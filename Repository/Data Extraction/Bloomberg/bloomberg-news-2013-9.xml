&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) leaked an unknown
quantity of natural gas from a pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico
near Pascagoula, Mississippi, according to a report filed Aug.
30 with the U.S. National Response Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigation was under way by a dive team according to
the report, filed at 5:24 p.m. local time on Aug. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News couldn&#8217;t immediately verify the information
in the filing was accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurt Glaubitz, a Chevron spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail inquiry today, outside of normal business
hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
most-read Bloomberg News reports from the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. JPMorgan Bribery Probe Said to Expand as Spreadsheet Found &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 29 (Bloomberg) -- A probe of JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s
hiring practices in China has uncovered red flags across Asia,
including an internal spreadsheet that linked appointments to
specific deals pursued by the bank, people with knowledge of the
matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Currency Spikes at 4 P.M. in London Provide Rate-Rigging
Clues &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 28 (Bloomberg) -- In the space of 20 minutes on the
last Friday in June, the value of the U.S. dollar jumped 0.57
percent against its Canadian counterpart, the biggest move in a
month. Within an hour, two-thirds of that gain had melted away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Brothels in Nevada Suffering as Internet Disrupts Oldest
Trade &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 28 (Bloomberg) -- In a dim parlor furnished with red
velvet couches and a stripper pole, Brooke Taylor is having a
sale on herself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Ex-JPMorgan Trader Released, Saying He Opposes U.S.
Extradition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Former JPMorgan Chase  Co. trader
Javier Martin-Artajo was released from police custody after
telling a Madrid court he opposed attempts by U.S. prosecutors
to extradite him on charges he hid trading losses that cost the
bank $6.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Ackermann Resigns From Zurich Board After CFO&#8217;s Suicide &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN) Chairman
Josef Ackermann resigned after the company&#8217;s finance chief died
in a suspected suicide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Stocks Fall as Oil Reaches 18-Month High on Syria, Gold
Rallies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Stocks slid the most since June and
oil surged to an 18-month high amid concern the U.S. will take
military action against Syria. Treasuries, the yen and gold rose
while Turkey&#8217;s lira and India&#8217;s rupee reached record lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Ackermann Quit Zurich After Being Named in CFO Suicide Note &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Josef Ackermann&#8217;s abrupt resignation
as chairman of Zurich Insurance Group AG came after Chief
Financial Officer Pierre Wauthier mentioned him in his suicide
note, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Fed Officials Rebuff Coordination Calls as QE Taper Looms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials rebuffed
international calls to take the threat of fallout in emerging
markets into account when tapering U.S. monetary stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. N.J. Jail Is Home for Husband as Lifetime of Alimony Fought &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Ari Schochet has grown so accustomed
to being sent to jail for missing alimony payments that he goes
into a routine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. U.S. Sees Multiday Strikes on Syria as U.K. Submits UN Draft &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 28 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. officials planning potential
military strikes on Syria aren&#8217;t limited to a one-day operation,
an administration official said, as&#160;the UN Security Council&#8217;s
permanent members considered a resolution condemning last week&#8217;s
suspected chemical attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Five Reasons Housing Isn&#8217;t Ready to Drop Dead: Caroline Baum &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Hissss! That&#8217;s the sound of the air
coming out of the housing market. At least that&#8217;s what some
folks thought they heard when the U.S. Census Bureau reported a
13.4 percent dive in new home sales in July, the biggest decline
in more than three years and one that coincided with a sharp
increase in mortgage rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Asia&#8217;s Real Problem Is Boosterism, Not Fed Policy: William
Pesek &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 27 (Bloomberg) -- It&#8217;s time to set our clocks back in
Asia. Not to 1997, as many are recommending, but to 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Will Obama Make the Fed Even Worse With Summers?: Ramesh
Ponnuru &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 27 (Bloomberg) -- President Barack Obama is making the
most important economic-policy decision of his second term:
picking a new chairman for the Federal Reserve. We shouldn&#8217;t be
optimistic, because nothing the president has said or done
suggests that he is at all displeased with a Fed performance
that has been just short of disastrous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Summers Pick Fits Obama&#8217;s Preference for Beaten Path: Ezra
Klein &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 29 (Bloomberg) -- At this point, Larry Summers isn&#8217;t
just the favorite for Federal Reserve chairman. He&#8217;s the
overwhelming  favorite. Unless something truly unexpected shows
up in the vetting process (a paid toast at Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s
birthday party, for example) or the administration comes to
believe Senate Democrats will revolt against a Summers
nomination, he&#8217;s going to get the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. JPMorgan Investigations Are America&#8217;s New Pastime: Jonathan
Weil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Hardly a week goes by without a new
report about a government investigation of JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and how much money the bank might have to pay because of some
alleged violation of the law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs International, the
European division of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), said first-half
pretax profit fell 60 percent, hurt by a charge linked to
employee compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretax profit dropped to $335.4 million in the first six
months of the year from $847.5 million in the year-earlier
period, the company said in a filing. Revenue fell 5 percent to
$3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administrative expenses rose to $2.5 billion from $2.1
billion, due to a $516 million charge as the company marked the
value of stock-based compensation to market prices. Shares of
the New York-based parent have climbed more than 19 percent so
far this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from institutional client services, the fixed
income, currencies and commodities division, fell 11 percent to
$2.2 billion, while investment banking revenue climbed 41
percent to $591.4 million, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is the top-ranked mergers
adviser in Western Europe, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The firm is advising Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) on its 7.7
billion euro ($10.2 billion) takeover offer for German cable
company Kabel Deutschland Holding AG. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s agreement to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset business, codenamed Project Gold Medal, was more of a sprint than a marathon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talks between the two companies began in February after both sides agreed a two-year-old collaboration on smartphone development wasn&#8217;t working, according to people familiar with the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By July, Microsoft and Nokia, based near Helsinki, settled on the price and structure of a 5.44 billion euro ($7.2 billion) deal to buy the handset business and license its patents, the people said. In contrast, Vodafone Group Plc&#8217;s announced sale on Sept. 2 of its 45 percent stake in U.S. mobile company Verizon Wireless for $130 billion followed years of talks with Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s codename in the talks was Nurmi, named after Paavo Johannes Nurmi, the nine-time gold medal runner known as the &#8220;the Flying Finn.&#8221; Microsoft was dubbed Edwin Moses, for the American track-and-field athlete who won two gold medals in the hurdles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s board met more than 50 times to deliberate on a sale, a process described as a soul-searching exercise by the people, who asked not to be identified. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Timed to follow last month&#8217;s announcement that Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer would retire, the Nokia deal is intended to set up the U.S. company for a renewed assault on the smartphone and tablet markets, the people said. Once the world&#8217;s most dominant technology firm, Microsoft under Ballmer has lagged behind Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. in fast-growing mobile devices, amid contraction in the personal-computer market it helped invent. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass, Ville Heiskanen and David Fickling" date="Sep 03, 2013  4:51 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-03/microsoft-to-buy-nokia-s-devices-business-for-5-44-billion-euros.html"><headline>Microsoft to Buy Nokia&#8217;s Devices Unit for $7.2 Billion</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is spending 5.44 billion euros ($7.2 billion) to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset unit so it can gain ground on Apple Inc. and Google (GOOG) Inc. in a smartphone market it let get away -- gaining a possible new chief executive officer in the process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s devices and services unit, which accounted for half of the company&#8217;s 2012 revenue, along with 32,000 employees, will transfer to Microsoft, the companies said. Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, 49, will return to Microsoft after a three-year stint running the Finnish manufacturer. The move stoked speculation he may be a successor to CEO Steve Ballmer, who said last month he&#8217;d retire within 12 months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is deepening a push into hardware as dwindling computer sales sap demand for the programs that made it the world&#8217;s largest software maker. Nokia shares jumped as much as 48 percent in Helsinki as the sale removes a money-losing handset business and lets it focus on higher-margin networking gear. Even combined, the companies have less than 4 percent of the smartphone market, leaving them far behind Apple and Google. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question is whether combining two weak companies will get you a strong new competitor -- it&#8217;s doubtful,&#8221; said Paul Budde, a telecommunications consultant in Sydney. &#8220;Both Nokia and Microsoft really missed the boat in terms of smartphones, and it is extremely difficult to claw your way back from that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Market-Share Decline &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland, racked up losses of more than 5 billion euros over nine quarters as Elop&#8217;s comeback efforts failed to eat into the dominance of Apple (AAPL) and Google&#8217;s Android platform in the smartphone market. The stock has lost more than 80 percent in the five years through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares rose 34 percent to 3.97 euros in Helsinki, valuing Nokia at 14.9 billion euros. The shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 4.6 percent to $31.88 at the close in New York, wiping out more than $12.6 billion in market value. The company&#8217;s market capitalization is now about $265.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement, Microsoft will pay 3.79 billion euros for Nokia&#8217;s devices division and 1.65 billion euros for patents, according to a statement from the companies. The all-cash transaction, subject to Nokia investors&#8217; approval, is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2014. JPMorgan Chase  Co. advised Nokia on the transaction, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. worked with Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Big Transformation&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia said it will book a gain of 3.2 billion euros, with the sale &#8220;significantly&#8221; accretive to earnings. It also said it aims to return its debt, which is ranked junk by all three major rating companies, to an investment grade. Chairman Risto Siilasmaa, who will become Nokia&#8217;s interim CEO, said the company may return excess capital to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a big transformation, but that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve got to do in the tech business to move forward,&#8221; Ballmer told Tom Keene on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;The Pulse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it is confident of getting the deal approved by early next year. The transaction will shave 12 cents a share off earnings in the current fiscal year, or 8 cents excluding some items, the company said. In 2015, the cost will be 6 cents based on generally accepted accounting principles. Excluding some costs, the deal will add to profit that year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft also expects to get more profit for every device sold -- more than $40 a unit for smartphones, compared with the less than $10 in gross profit it currently gets for Windows Phone sold by Nokia. That doesn&#8217;t include the costs of marketing and development, though. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cost Savings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on generally accepted accounting principles, the transaction will add to earnings in fiscal 2016, Microsoft said. The company expects to have annual cost savings of $600 million 18 months after the deal closes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Microsoft purchase was the second major deal to be announced during the U.S. Labor Day holiday yesterday. Verizon Communications Inc. agreed to pay $130 billion for Vodafone Group Plc&#8217;s stake in their U.S. wireless venture in the biggest transaction in more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-Nokia deal is the largest for a wireless device maker after Google&#8217;s purchase of Motorola&#8217;s handset unit in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For Microsoft, the deal including the payment to license Nokia&#8217;s patents is its second-biggest behind the $8.5 billion purchase of Internet telephone company Skype in 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Motorola Comparison &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft agreed to pay about 0.35 times annual revenue, compared with the median of about 1.4 times for 60 wireless equipment-maker deals tracked by Bloomberg. That also compares with the 0.77 times revenue Google paid for Motorola Mobility, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google paid about 1.3 times annual operating income for the handset maker, while Nokia&#8217;s device and services business reported an operating loss last year, according to the data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the latest sale, the original pioneers in the mobile-phone industry -- Motorola, Nokia and Ericsson AB -- have all ceased to be independent handset manufacturers or given up on the business. BlackBerry Ltd. said last month it&#8217;s considering putting itself up for sale. Its shares advanced less than 1 percent to $10.21 in today&#8217;s trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, meanwhile, becomes the last major developer of smartphone operating systems to get into manufacturing. Apple makes its own handsets, which use its iOS operating system. Google&#8217;s acquisition of Motorola Mobility gave it its own lineup of phones. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Surface Tablet &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s other recent significant move into hardware -- the Surface tablet -- has trailed expectations and the company wrote down inventory last quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To break even on an operating basis, Microsoft will need Nokia to sell about 50 million smartphones a year, it said in a presentation. Nokia has a run-rate of about 30 million units. In the second quarter, Nokia sold 7.4 million smartphones under the Lumia line. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft acquired the Lumia brand to use with smartphones, while it will license the Nokia brand to use with low-end phones for 10 years, Elop said at a press briefing today. Microsoft will later decide what to call its future smartphones. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will face a balancing act owning Nokia and keeping its other hardware partners, including HTC Corp. (2498) and Samsung Electronics Co., committed to its Windows Phone. Aiming to reassure other phone makers that Microsoft will still support them, Ballmer said that the company was &#8220;100 percent&#8221; committed to helping its manufacturing partners. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer declined to say whether Elop would become CEO, or had been a candidate to succeed him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Tie-Up &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer called Nokia&#8217;s Siilasmaa shortly after the new year to initiate discussions on an acquisition and the two met in February at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, according to Microsoft. Talks heated up in recent months and a deal was lined up before Ballmer announced his retirement last month, the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Nokia have had a close relationship through Elop, who had run Microsoft&#8217;s Office unit. He left the software maker in September 2010 to take the top job at Nokia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the time, Elop likened Nokia&#8217;s position to a man standing on a burning oil platform on the verge of being engulfed in flames, facing the option of staying aboard or jumping to the ocean to have a chance to survive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In February 2011, Elop struck a deal with Ballmer to switch Nokia&#8217;s smartphones from its own Symbian operating system to Windows Phone. In exchange, Microsoft ponied up more than $1 billion to pay for Nokia marketing and developing products on Windows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Losing Share &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia had the largest share of the mobile phone handset market until it was overtaken by Samsung (005930) in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Nokia remains a top seller of traditional mobile phones -- models that are more popular in developing markets. In total shipments, the company ranks second to Samsung among device manufacturers. Samsung accounted for 26 percent of shipments last quarter, while Nokia had 14 percent. Apple came in third with 7.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the sale to Microsoft, Nokia&#8217;s biggest business will be network equipment, which it recently fully took over from Siemens AG (SIE) and renamed Nokia Solutions and Networks. The unit competes with Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent as well as China&#8217;s Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. (763) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ericsson jumped 5 percent to 82.50 kronor in Stockholm. Alcatel-Lucent, which under new CEO Michel Combes is streamlining its business, added 9.2 percent to 2.20 euros in Paris trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mapping Unit &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia said it will also keep its mapping and location services unit, called Here, and its technology development and licensing division. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nokia has a highly evolved device design and manufacturing process which will benefit Microsoft greatly,&#8221; said Al Hilwa, an analyst at research firm IDC. &#8220;This is simply the fastest path in front of Microsoft to achieve something like Apple&#8217;s vision on devices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: David Fickling in Sydney at dfickling@bloomberg.net; Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net; Ville Heiskanen in Helsinki at vheiskanen@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net; Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, following the worst month since May 2012 for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, as better-than-forecast economic data overshadowed concern over possible military action against Syria. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CBS Corp. (CBS) jumped 4.7 percent after the broadcaster&#8217;s programs returned to Time Warner Cable Inc. Microsoft Corp. slipped 4.6 percent after agreeing to buy Nokia Oyj&#8217;s mobile-phone business and license its patents for 5.44 billion euros ($7.2 billion). Verizon Communications Inc. dropped 2.9 percent after agreeing to buy Vodafone Group Plc&#8217;s 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless for $130 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 climbed 0.4 percent to 1,639.77 at 4 p.m. in New York, paring an earlier advance of as much as 1.1 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 23.65 points, or 0.2 percent, to 14,833.96. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands, the highest level since Aug. 1. U.S. exchanges were closed yesterday for the Labor Day holiday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The economy, things are coming in pretty good,&#8221; Karyn Cavanaugh, a vice president and market strategist at ING U.S. Investment Management in New York, said in a phone interview. Her firm oversees about $190 billion. &#8220;We know there are a lot tensions in the Middle East. If you wait for the dust to settle in order to get in the market, you&#8217;re going to be waiting forever. Look at the fundamentals and if the fundamentals are increasing, that&#8217;s your directional signal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Global stocks rose yesterday as data showed China&#8217;s manufacturing index increased to a 16-month high in August, while other gauges showed euro-area factory output expanded at a faster pace than initially estimated in August. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Economic Reports &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among today&#8217;s reports in the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management&#8217;s manufacturing index increased to 55.7 in August, the strongest since June 2011, from 55.4 a month earlier. Readings above 50 indicate growth. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists was 54. Another report showed construction spending in the U.S. increased in July to the highest level in four years, propelled by gains in residential real estate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Equities pared gains after President Barack Obama won endorsement from the two top Republicans in the U.S. House for taking action against Syria. Backing from Speaker of the House John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor will help the president as he makes his case to lawmakers who&#8217;ve questioned the evidence presented by the administration that the Syrian government was behind a sarin gas attack last month or whether the U.S. has a vital interest in the region. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama urged Congress to take a &#8220;prompt&#8221; vote authorizing military action. He announced on Aug. 31 that he&#8217;d seek support from Congress, after previously saying he had authority to order a military mission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fed, Syria &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The benchmark index fell 3.1 percent in August amid concern the Federal Reserve would reduce its monthly bond purchases and the U.S. would take military action against Syria. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors in August pulled money from exchange-traded funds at the fastest rate since January 2010, with withdrawals reaching $17.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from about 1,500 funds. The SPDR SP 500 ETF Trust, the largest ETF for American equities, experienced $14 billion in outflows, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better-than-estimated corporate earnings and monetary stimulus from the Fed helped the index rally as much as 153 percent from a 12-year low in 2009, with the gauge reaching a record 1,709.67 on Aug. 2. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fed holds a policy meeting on Sept. 17-18 to decide whether to slow the pace of its bond-buying program.

The index closed below the trend measure for a fifth session, the longest stretch since Nov. 21, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The average was at 1,640 recently. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Financial, consumer-discretionary and health-care shares climbed more than 0.6 percent for the biggest gains among 10 SP 500 industries. Utilities and phone companies had the biggest declines, dropping at least 1.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CBS rose 4.7 percent to $53.50. The broadcaster&#8217;s programs returned to Time Warner Cable in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas after the companies ended a one-month blackout, in time for the start of National Football League regular-season games. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cable Agreement &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable agreed to pay a significant increase for the right to transmit CBS signals, according to people with knowledge of the situation who asked not to be identified because the terms are private.

The third-biggest U.S. bank by assets has sold more than $6 billion in private-equity and hedge-fund assets in the past month, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the transactions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. added 0.9 percent to $14.25. The lender confirmed plans to sell its remaining stake in China Construction Bank Corp. for a gain of about $750 million before taxes. The second-biggest U.S. lender first invested in Construction Bank in 2005. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple (AAPL) Inc. rose 0.3 percent to $488.58, trimming an early rally of as much as 2.8 percent.

The company agreed to buy Yankee Candle for $1.75 billion, making its biggest acquisition to add the 43-year-old scented candle maker to its collection of more than 120 consumer brands. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More acquisitions are &#8220;indicative of increased confidence in the corporate space in that they view opportunities to take advantage of and feel comfortable using some of their capital to do so.&#8221; Ethan Anderson, senior portfolio manager at Rehmann Financial in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said in a phone interview. His firm oversees about $1.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft, Verizon &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft slid 4.6 percent to $31.88. The maker of the Windows operating system will pay 3.79 billion euros for Nokia&#8217;s devices and 1.65 billion euros for its patents, according to a statement from the companies. Microsoft is deepening a push into hardware as dwindling computer sales sap demand for the programs that made it the world&#8217;s largest software maker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s U.S.-traded shares surged 31 percent to $5.12. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Verizon lost 2.9 percent to $46.01. Verizon will get full control of the most profitable U.S. mobile-phone carrier in the biggest acquisition in more than a decade. The deal, sought by Verizon since at least 2004, implies a total value for Verizon Wireless of almost $290 billion -- larger than the market capitalization of Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), or VIX, fell 2.4 percent to 16.61 today, after a 26 percent rally in August. Options strategists from JPMorgan Chase  Co. to Weeden  Co. are predicting that U.S. equity volatility will extend its increase in September after posting its biggest monthly advance in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;September Volatility &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in an Aug. 29 note that volatility is likely to increase in September and October, and recommended buying puts on global stocks gauges including the SP 500. Weeden told investors to implement a bearish strategy using October contracts on a security tracking the Russell 2000 Index. The VIX has fallen every September in years when volatility was below its historical average at the start of the month, data since 1996 compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a number of catalysts that could drive volatility higher in September such as an escalation in the Syrian crisis, further deterioration in emerging markets, or larger-than-expected tapering by the Fed,&#8221; Mandy Xu, a New York-based equity-derivatives strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG, said in an Aug. 29 interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Lu Wang in New York at lwang8@bloomberg.net. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost 14 years ago, Microsoft announced a major joint venture with a global leader in mobile communications, a company headquartered in a small Nordic country. The goal, according to Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, was to get all 30 million users of Microsoft's e-mail platform to use the company's software on their mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partner company was called Ericsson, and it was a major producer of mobile handsets. My first mobile phone, bought in Russia in 1998, was an Ericsson. It had a 3-inch antenna, and it did not fit in my jeans pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ericsson Microsoft Mobile Venture AB fell apart in 2001. Microsoft never even paid for its 30 percent stake. Having tried working with Microsoft, Ericsson elected instead to team up with Sony to make mobile phones that looked more like consumer products than like telecommunications devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, that partnership, too, came to an end, with Sony buying Ericsson out for $1.5 billion. The partnership had garnered only a 5 percent share of the global smartphone market, in part because its phones ran Symbian and Windows Mobile, both dead-end systems that lost out to Apple's iOS and Google's Android. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before Ericsson sold its share in the business, Sony Ericsson moved to Android. In the 2013 financial year, Sony Mobile -- the renamed former joint venture -- was still losing money but hoping, after some serous cost-cutting, that its Xperia range would carry it into the black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ericsson, for its part, has never regretted moving away from handsets to concentrate on mobile network equipment. It boasts that 40 percent of the world's mobile traffic runs through networks that it supplied. In 2012, it made a profit of almost $900 million. The consumer business is forgotten like a bad dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By selling its mobile phone business to Microsoft, another Nordic company, Nokia, is following in Ericsson's footsteps. There is little doubt that the Finns can repeat their Swedish neighbors' success. Nokia recently bought Germany's Siemens out of their joint venture, Nokia Siemens Networks, another global leader in network equipment, focusing on mobile broadband. The business lost money last year, but only because of large restructuring charges. In the second quarter of 2013, it showed a profit of about $10 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of importance to Nokia, the infrastructure business, with 2012 sales of $18.2 billion, comes a close second to handsets, which generated $20.7 billion. The phone division, however, lost almost $1.5 billion last year. Along with the growing but risky smartphone business, Microsoft has bought the Finnish company's rapidly deteriorating line of "feature phones" -- cheap outdated devices with actual buttons. Last year, the unit sales of these Nokia phones decreased 20 percent compared to 2011, and the decline continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's role is similar to that of Sony's in the Ericsson deal, except it is paying almost five times as much for a smaller, 3.3 percent share of the smartphone market. Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, who once worked for Microsoft and will return to the Redmond company to run the new mobile phone division, has done a great job for the Finnish company's shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Sony, Microsoft is not a consumer-products company. It has been most successful selling its products to businesses, from computer manufacturers to corporate clients buying licenses for Microsoft Office software. Instead of betting on the most successful operating system, Android, it is intent on pushing its own Windows Phone, ignored by many application developers because of its tiny market share. Ballmer has locked his successor into a money-losing business with a headcount of more than 32,000 people, operating in a highly competitive market where Microsoft is the underdog. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Nokia, it can breathe a sigh of relief. Gone are the (recent) days when its sales equaled 20 percent of Finland's gross domestic product. Also gone are the losses, offloaded on Microsoft with its $70 billion in cash. Let he who can afford it play the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Leonid Bershidsky, an editor and novelist, is a Bloomberg View contributor. Follow him on Twitter.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry Ltd. (BBRY), the struggling
Canadian smartphone maker weighing a sale, jumped in early U.S.
trading after Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) agreed to acquire Nokia Oyj&#8217;s
handset business in a $7.2 billion deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares advanced 3.3 percent to $10.45 at 7:52 a.m. New
York time. They have fallen 6.1 percent since Aug. 12, when
BlackBerry announced it was weighing a sale, and are down 15
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A BlackBerry board committee began exploring a sale of the
Waterloo, Ontario-based company last month while also studying
partnerships to rescue it from a three-year sales slide that has
slashed its market value by about 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft agreed to buy BlackBerry rival Nokia&#8217;s handset
business and license its patents, casting together the lot of
two technology companies trying to stay relevant against more
fleet-footed rivals. Both Nokia and BlackBerry have lost market
share to Apple Inc. and devices running Google Inc.&#8217;s Android
software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring against losses
on Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) debt fell by a record after Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) agreed
to buy its handset business and license its patents for 5.44
billion euros ($7.2 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Nokia dropped 330 basis points to
199, according to data provider CMA at 10 a.m. in London. The
Espoo, Finland-based company&#8217;s 6.75 percent bonds due February
2019 jumped 7.5 cents on the euro to 113.3 cents, the highest
since June 2011, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia is exiting the mobile-phone business it once
dominated after struggling to compete with Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone
and Google Inc.&#8217;s Android platform. The deal -- the largest for
a wireless device maker after Google&#8217;s purchase of Motorola&#8217;s
handset unit completed in May 2012 -- will let the company focus
on its network equipment business, which is facing intensifying
competition from Sweden&#8217;s Ericsson AB and China&#8217;s Huawei
Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. (000063) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whilst the loss of the handset business marks the end of
an era for the company, it could no longer continue to develop
new phones as its market share plunged,&#8221; said Aengus McMahon, a
London-based analyst at ING Groep NV. &#8220;This move is positive
for Nokia spreads and we would expect to see some positive
momentum in its ratings as the transaction moves towards
completion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nokia Ratings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia is rated B1 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, four levels
below investment grade, and the New York-based ratings firm has
a negative outlook on the company&#8217;s debt. Nokia&#8217;s plan to regain
a high-grade ranking will be plausible after the Microsoft deal
is completed, according to report from Mizuho International Plc
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 62 percent decline in the cost of Nokia&#8217;s swaps is the
most since CMA began collecting data in 2007 and the contracts
are the lowest since June 2011. They&#8217;re down from a peak of more
than 1,200 basis points in July 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps on Microsoft were unchanged at 33 basis points, CMA
data show. The world&#8217;s largest software maker is moving into
hardware as it also tries to remain competitive. Its 550 million
euros of 2.625 percent bonds due May 2033 fell 0.26 cents on the
euro to 91.08 cents, the lowest since they were issued in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements and an
increase signals deterioration in perceptions of credit quality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BYD Electronic International Co. (285) and
Compal Communications Inc. (8078) led gains of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s Asian
suppliers after Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) offered to pay 5.44 billion
euros ($7.2 billion) for the Finnish company&#8217;s handset business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BYD, which supplies keypads and casings to Nokia, surged
7.5 percent in Hong Kong to HK$3.71 as of 1:55 p.m. local time,
headed for the biggest one-day gain since June 26. Compal
Communications, which provides Nokia with design and assembly
services, closed 6.9 percent higher in Taipei, its biggest gain
since July 11. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will pay 3.79 billion euros for Nokia&#8217;s devices
unit and 1.65 billion euros for patents, the companies said in a
statement today. Nokia is coping with cash-flow challenges as
its phones lose market share to handsets from Apple Inc. and
manufacturers using Google Inc.&#8217;s Android operating system. The
Espoo, Finland-based company has lost more than 5 billion euros
in nine quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia had the largest share of the handset market until it
was overtaken by Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) in 2012, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Samsung Electronics fell as much as
1.9 percent while LG Electronics (066570) dropped as much as 0.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Asian suppliers to Nokia that rose include FIH Mobile
Ltd., which climbed as much as 6.8 percent. Compeq Manufacturing
Co. (2313) gained as much as 4.4 percent and Catcher Technology Co. (2474)
increased as much as 4.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today marks a moment of reinvention,&#8221; Microsoft Chief
Executive Officer Steve Ballmer and Nokia Chief Executive
Officer Stephen Elop said in joint blog post. &#8220;With the
commitment and resources of Microsoft to take Nokia&#8217;s devices
and services forward, we can now realize the full potential of
the Windows ecosystem, providing the most compelling experiences
for people at home, at work and everywhere in between.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devices and services business generated about 50
percent of Nokia&#8217;s net sales during 2012, worth an estimated 15
billion euros, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the top
global merger adviser this year, named Stuart Bernstein as head
of a group that focuses on venture capital investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein, a partner who joined Goldman Sachs in 1986, will
remain global head of the clean technology and renewables group,
according to a memo from investment banking co-heads Richard J. Gnodde, 53, David Solomon, 51, and John S. Weinberg, 56. David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, confirmed the
contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The venture capital community has become a strategically
important constituent of the division&#8217;s client franchise and is
critical to our ability to serve the needs of our emerging
growth clients,&#8221; according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein, 49, previously ran the equity underwriting group
that serves financial institutions, according to the memo. He
became a managing director in 1999 and a partner the next year.
As head of clean technology, Bernstein has led Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
effort to finance $40 billion of renewable energy in a decade,
which began last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank L. Walters led the venture capital group before
taking the same role at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America Corp. earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the top adviser on announced global
mergers this year and the leading equity underwriter, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank is the third-ranked
adviser on global technology deals, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) plans to release the
Xbox One video-game console on Nov. 22, a week before Black
Friday, and said it increased the number of units available for
its holiday faceoff against Sony (6758) Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer demand spurred Microsoft to speed production after
retailers sold out of pre-order allotments, said Yusuf Mehdi,
chief marketing officer for the Redmond, Washington-based
software maker&#8217;s interactive entertainment division. Sales this
year will top the debut of the current Xbox 360, he said,
declining to discuss specifics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re building more consoles for day one and for the
holidays than we&#8217;ve ever done,&#8221; Mehdi said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;It is on track to be the biggest launch by a wide
margin, much bigger than what we did for Xbox 360.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Sony are betting that faster machines
allowing for features such as motion capture and immersive
graphics will entice consumers whose tastes are shifting toward
mobile games played on tablets and smartphones. Microsoft, which
is buying Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset unit, is stregthening a push into
hardware as demand weakens for programs such as Windows that
made it the world&#8217;s largest software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also has increased the speed of the Xbox One&#8217;s
central processing unit to 1.75 GHz, 10 percent more than
previously targeted, Mehdi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You are now able to have even better fidelity of the
games,&#8221; Mehdi said. &#8220;The system itself will work much
faster.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Console Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers began taking orders for the $499 Xbox One and
Sony&#8217;s coming PlayStation 4 in June. Last month, Grapevine,
Texas-based GameStop Corp. (GME) raised its profit forecast, citing
strength in console orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the top U.S. seller of consoles for more than
two years, will debut the Xbox One a week later than the $399
PS4, which hits American stores on Nov. 15. Nintendo Co. (7974) last
week cut the price of the Wii U by $50 to $299. The console,
introduced last year, has missed company sales targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is the
traditional start to the shopping season in the U.S., with
retailers offering discounts to draw customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release the Xbox One in 13 countries all on
the same day, giving it a week&#8217;s head start in Europe, where the
PS4 starts selling on Nov. 29. Sony will reach stores in 32
markets this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which initially targeted 21 countries for its
debut, last month cut the number to 13 to ensure larger markets
have sufficient supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NFL Highlights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities in Los
Angeles, expects Sony to sell 3 million consoles this year and
12 million in 2014, compared with 2.5 million and 10 million,
respectively, for Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 4.6 percent to $31.88 yesterday in New York,
after announcing that it&#8217;s spending 5.44 billion euros ($7.2
billion) to buy Nokia&#8217;s devices and services unit. The shares
have climbed 19 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xbox One is an attempt to merge television watching with
video game playing, Mehdi said. Microsoft has teamed with
partners including the National Football League to offer
features such as viewing highlights and game scores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has no plans to offer pay-TV channels in
competition with established providers, nor to spin off the
video-game unit, Mehdi said. Xbox One is part of a companywide
strategy to offer multiple devices to consumers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That strategy was underscored by the acquisition Nokia&#8217;s
handset business. The unit accounted for more than half of the
revenue for the Espoo, Finland-based company, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We know we live in a multi-device world,&#8221; Mehdi said.
&#8220;The people between 18 and 30 -- 80 percent of them are looking
at a phone or tablet while watching TV.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By selling its money-losing mobile-phone business to Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) for $7.2 billion, Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) is
now on the cusp of earning an investment-grade rating from the
bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s $1 billion of 5.375 percent debt due in May
2019 jumped to a three-year high of 102.9 cents after Nokia said
Microsoft agreed to pay 5.44 billion euros for its handset unit.
That caused the yield on the junk-rated bonds to fall to 4.79
percent, just 0.25 percentage point more than the average for
similar-maturity debt with the lowest investment grade of BBB-,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia, founded as a pulp and paper maker almost 150 years
ago, is now exiting the mobile-phone business it once dominated
after losing customers to Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and Google Inc.&#8217;s
Android system. With the disposal, the Espoo, Finland-based
company will now focus on turning around its network-equipment
business after gaining full control from Siemens AG last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They certainly have it within their control to go to
investment grade,&#8221; said Sam Morton, a credit analyst at Mizuho
International Plc in London. &#8220;People were worried that cash
burn in the handset unit would eventually erode Nokia&#8217;s net cash
position. Disposal of this cash-burning entity has alleviated
those concerns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wirecard AG (WDI), a provider of software
for online payments, rose to the highest price since its initial
public offering in 2000 after Goldman Sachs predicted the stock
will gain as the company builds business in Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirecard jumped as much as 5.2 percent and was up 3.1
percent at 25.08 euros at 1:36 p.m. in Frankfurt, for the
biggest gain among the 110 stocks on the HDAX Index. (HDAX) Trading
volume was almost double the three-month daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a 65 billion-euro mobile commerce related
opportunity for Wirecard spread across mobile carriers,
retailers and other verticals,&#8221; S.K. Prasad Borra, a London-based analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in a note today. &#8220;We
expect Wirecard to augment its strong presence in Germany and
across Europe with continued expansion in Asia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman raised its recommendation on Aschheim, Germany-based Wirecard to buy from neutral, and put the stock on its
&#8220;conviction buy list.&#8221; Prasad Borra predicted the shares will
rise to 38 euros in 12 months, a potential 56 percent gain from
the closing price yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bridgepoint Advisers Ltd. hired
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to oversee a potential sale of Dutch
textbook publisher Noordhoff Uitgevers, just as the government
tries to rein in the cost of school materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private-equity firm will separate Noordhoff from the
group of education assets it acquired from Wolters Kluwer NV (WKL),
said two people with knowledge of the talks, who asked not to be
identified because the London-based firm hasn&#8217;t made the process
public. The firm paid about 774 million euros ($1 billion) for
the businesses in 2007 and renamed the group Infinitas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs has been appointed to help explore
strategic options&#8221; for Noordhoff Uitgevers, Infinitas said in
an e-mailed statement today. Officials at Bridgepoint and
Goldman Sachs declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch undersecretary for education yesterday announced
plans to stop funding free textbooks for secondary school
pupils. From 2015, parents will be required to pay as much as
300 euros a year for books. Noordhoff sells textbooks for Dutch
children to use from primary school through university. The
company has 355 employees and has also developed study kits used
on the iPad, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms typically pool money from pension
plans and endowments with a mandate to buy companies within five
to six years, then sell them and return the money and a profit
after 10 years. The firms usually charge a management fee of as
much as 2 percent and keep 20 percent of the profits from
investments. Bridgepoint raised 4.8 billion euros for its fourth
pool of capital in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer isn&#8217;t letting his departure plans stand in the way of a complete overhaul of the software-centric strategy he spent decades putting in place. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even after saying last month he will retire from Microsoft within the next year, Ballmer is accelerating the company&#8217;s move into hardware with a $7.2 billion deal to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset unit yesterday. That&#8217;s an area the Redmond, Washington-based company waded into in the past 18 months, including last year&#8217;s introduction of the Surface tablet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the company, which built a dominant position in personal-computing operating systems by focusing on software and relying on multiple partners to offer hardware, is diving into its own smartphone line, a low-end handset business and manufacturing operations. With rivals like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) leading in mobile, Microsoft executives said the company had few options except to break from its software past. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were in software exclusively and that was a logical thing to do for a long period of time, but the reality today is that&#8217;s no longer possible,&#8221; Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer had no choice, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner Inc. Even combined with Nokia, Microsoft has less than a 4 percent share in smartphones and is running out of time to carve out a piece of a market ruled by Google&#8217;s Android and Apple&#8217;s iOS. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Urgent Change &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There must be a sense of urgency that Microsoft feels about how much longer it will take them to make it in mobile and they need to make it in mobile,&#8221; Milanesi said. &#8220;There is a sense that they have to move faster than they have been and the only way they can do that is by integrating the hardware and software.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Within Microsoft&#8217;s headquarters, Ballmer realized last year that the company needed to dump its traditional playbook and make its own phones, said a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the time, Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phones were still at a percentage in the low single digits. It became clear that the company couldn&#8217;t gain on competitors or turn phones into a significant moneymaker if Microsoft only made the operating system, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Six Weeks &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon Ballmer was on the phone with Nokia Chairman Risto Siilasmaa, resulting in a meeting in February at the Mobile World Congress show, said the person. Various forms of a deal were rejected by both boards and talks seemed dead in June before being revived about six weeks ago, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment on specifics of the talks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the deal, Microsoft becomes the last major developer of smartphone operating systems to get into phone hardware. Apple makes its own handsets that use its iOS operating system. Google acquired Motorola Mobility last year for about $12.4 billion, giving the company its own lineup of phones. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Phones are the most personal of the personal devices people use today and success in phones is important for success in tablets and PCs,&#8221; Brad Smith, Microsoft&#8217;s general counsel, said in an interview. &#8220;We need to move faster.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer helped Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates formulate much of the strategy that led the company to dominate PC operating systems in the 1990s. As Microsoft&#8217;s first business manager, Ballmer negotiated some of the company&#8217;s initial deals to put its software on partners&#8217; computers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Strategy Shift &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The formula: focus on software that supports a multitude of devices, give customers choice, hone in on the part of the market that has very high margins and leave the low-margin hardware to others. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has developed Xbox game consoles since 2001 and took that on because partners weren&#8217;t interested. Elsewhere it hewed to the strategy -- it avoided making its own music player, for example, until it was too late to catch Apple&#8217;s iPod. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has increasingly deviated from the formula in recent months. In October 2012, it started selling the Surface tablet. That same month, Ballmer wrote a shareholder letter announcing a new strategy focused on devices and services. In July, he instituted the biggest reorganization in more than a decade to align divisions around his vision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a big transformation, but that&#8217;s kind of what you need to do in the technology world to move forward,&#8221; Ballmer told Tom Keene on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;The Pulse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Trickier Partnerships &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft isn&#8217;t completely changing its stripes, and it will still license its Windows Phone software to other handset makers. Yet that will be trickier because Microsoft now has to reassure hardware partners that it isn&#8217;t putting Nokia devices ahead of their products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Terry Myerson, head of Microsoft&#8217;s operating systems, this week authored a blog post claiming the deal would benefit all Windows Phone partners. He ended with a lyric from the rock band The Killers: &#8220;I don&#8217;t shine if you don&#8217;t shine.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The move to devices and services means a change for Microsoft&#8217;s margins. Internet-based services and hardware are costlier to deliver than software, and margins will decline, Hood said. Microsoft will still be able to increase revenue and profit by selling more, even at a lower margin, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Shareholder Reaction &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For phones specifically, Microsoft&#8217;s traditional strategy of working with equipment manufacturers wasn&#8217;t very profitable, Hood said. The phone unit had to fork over more than $1 billion to Nokia as part of a 2011 deal that got the Finnish phone maker to use the software. Hood said the Windows Phone business will end up with higher operating income once Nokia is integrated than it had without the hardware business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neither the prospective margins nor Microsoft&#8217;s further entrenchment in consumer hardware thrilled shareholders, some of whom favor a focus on business software. The company&#8217;s shares fell 4.6 percent yesterday to close at $31.88. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is &#8220;not good for investors that were hoping the company would narrow their focus to the enterprise,&#8221; said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Portland, Oregon-based Becker Capital Management Inc., which oversees $2.6 billion including Microsoft shares. &#8220;Why not let the next CEO make this call?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal is also serving to jolt investors who read Ballmer&#8217;s retirement as a sign Microsoft would reverse course on its devices strategy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anyone who thought that would be put on hold while a new CEO was sought has to accept that now,&#8221; said Tony Ursillo, an analyst at Loomis Sayles  Co. in Boston. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Motorola Mobility
deal is anything to go by, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) investors will need
to brace for diminished profitability now that it has agreed to
purchase Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The profit margin at Google has shrunk by more than 7
percentage points since the search provider purchased the
struggling hardware unit in May of 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Motorola business posted an operating
loss equal to 34 percent of sales in the most recent quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s experience with Motorola may hold lessons for
Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, which announced
plans on Sept. 2 to buy Nokia&#8217;s handset unit, stepping up an
effort to challenge Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google in the smartphone
market. Nokia&#8217;s devices and services business swung to a loss of
more than $1.4 billion after earning almost that much in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hardware margins are always much lower than software,&#8221;
said Sameet Sinha, an analyst with B. Riley  Co in San
Francisco. &#8220;Microsoft will have to bear the brunt. You will see
margin compression. There&#8217;s no doubt about it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, spent $12.4
billion on Motorola Mobility last year to expand into the
mobile-hardware business after 14 years in which Web advertising
accounted for almost all of its revenue. The purchase also gave
Google a trove of about 17,000 patents to protect Android
devices in legal disputes with competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inversiones Alsacia SA&#8217;s dollar
bonds gained the most in two months as JPMorgan Chase  Co.
raised its recommendation on the debt to the equivalent of hold,
citing the bus company&#8217;s new contract terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the bonds due in 2018 fell 1.46 percentage
point to 21.54 percent at 1:44 p.m. in Santiago, the biggest
decline on a closing basis since June 17, according to Trace,
the bond pricing system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alsacia, which has asked bondholders for waivers of
violations of its debt agreements, said on Aug. 29 that the
government approved a 4 percent increase per passenger on its
bus routes in Santiago. The company controls two of seven
operators in the capital city&#8217;s Transantiago public transport
system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the increased passenger payments will not have a
significant impact on the company&#8217;s liquidity, they are
&#8220;positive for the story,&#8221; JPMorgan analyst Daniel Sensel wrote
in a research note. A meeting scheduled this week with debt
holders also &#8220;could be a reflection of the company&#8217;s
willingness to negotiate better terms with bondholders including
a shorter term for the waivers and more transparency in terms of
the outlook for the company,&#8221; Sensel wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alsacia said Aug. 5 that its ratio of cash flow to total
debt including interest fell below a level that would obligate
it to prepay the 2018 bonds. The yield on the debt surged to a
record high on Aug. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower demand for bus transportation and persistent fare
cheating led to the violation of the debt agreements, the
company said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world&#8217;s largest
asset manager, hired Pavan Wadhwa, former head of U.S. dollar
interest rate strategy at JPMorgan Chase  Co., to lead a team
focused on global interest rate analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wadhwa will join BlackRock&#8217;s Americas fixed-income group
later this month in New York and report to Bob Miller, head of
the multisector retail and rates team and a portfolio manager on
BlackRock&#8217;s Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BASIX), Jessica Greaney, a spokeswoman for New York-based BlackRock, said today
in an e-mail. Prior to joining BlackRock, Wadhwa worked at
JPMorgan for 15 years, including five as head of European and
global interest rate strategy in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock, which manages $3.86 trillion in assets, has
worked to improve the performance of its actively managed bond
funds as deposits trailed those of index-based investments last
year. The firm reorganized its bond division in 2012, giving
unit heads such as Rick Rieder and Kevin Holt greater autonomy
and accountability. Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink has
said BlackRock is seeing a rotation in fixed income to more
flexible, non-traditional bond products with shorter durations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wadhwa, who will be a managing director and the unit&#8217;s head
of rates strategy, started his career at BlackRock in 1995,
where he was an associate in the financial modeling group. He
has an MBA and a Ph.D. in finance from the University of Texas
at Austin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAO Rostelecom, Russia&#8217;s state-run
phone company, hired advisers to help it combine with wireless
carrier Tele2 Russia to form a fourth mobile operator, a person
briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone company hired JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) as advisers, said the person, who asked not to
be identified as the discussions are private. State-controlled
VTB Group (VTBR) acquired Swedish Tele2 AB&#8217;s (TEL2B) Russian unit in a $3.55
billion deal in April. While Rostelecom is majority owned by the
state, it also has private shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A combination would help the two companies challenge market
leaders OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT), OAO MegaFon (MFON) and VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)
as the mobile-phone market in Russia expands with increased use
of smartphones to browse the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rostelecom has almost 14 million mobile users, while Tele2
Russia has 23 million. Working in different regions, the
companies fit well together and would form a fourth countrywide
wireless operator if combined, according to Konstantin Malofeev,
a private shareholder in Rostelecom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks are proposing to combine the Moscow-based
companies&#8217; wireless assets into a joint venture where Rostelecom
would have control, Vedomosti reported today, citing
unidentified sources. Rostelecom said last month it plans to
finalize its strategy including wireless expansion in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrey Polyakov, a Moscow-based spokesman for Rostelecom,
declined by phone to comment, as did Irina Rybakova, a
spokeswoman for Tele2 Russia, and VTB&#8217;s press office. JPMorgan
and Credit Suisse press officials didn&#8217;t immediately return
calls requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeking Acquisition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rostelecom shares rose as much as 1.2 percent and traded up
0.6 percent by 6:01 p.m. in Moscow, giving it a market value of
$9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile TeleSystems and VimpelCom have said they&#8217;ve been
seeking to acquire Tele2 Russia. Within Russia, MTS had almost
72 million users at the end of the second quarter, while MegaFon
had 64 million and VimpelCom had 57 million, according to
researcher ACM Consulting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The potential integration of its mobile assets with Tele2
will be a strategically logical development for Rostelecom,&#8221;
Konstantin Chernyshev, a telecommunications analyst at VTB
Capital, said in a note today. &#8220;Any financial implications are
hard to estimate at this point when the terms remain unclear.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s $7.2 billion takeover of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset business cost shareholders more than twice that as it dashed hopes for a fresh start under Steve Ballmer&#8217;s successor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software company lost $18 billion in market value since the purchase of Nokia&#8217;s mobile-phone assets was disclosed, erasing all of the gains that followed the announcement last month that Ballmer is retiring, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The agreement cements the departing chief executive officer&#8217;s shift toward the more volatile consumer-device business and leaves little room for his successor to take a different tack, Atlantic Equities LLP said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is chasing growth in a market already dominated by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) with devices that generate lower returns than the company&#8217;s business-software division. Nokia CEO Stephen Elop is returning to Microsoft as part of the asset sale, making him Ballmer&#8217;s most likely successor and signaling that the company is in smartphones for the long haul, Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. said, even as some shareholders say that strategy is misplaced. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m too thrilled about the deal,&#8221; Tim Schwartz, a money manager at Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Schwartz Investment Counsel Inc., which oversees $1.3 billion and owns Microsoft, said in a phone interview. &#8220;The perception is that this is going to be a continuation of the old management and old-school Microsoft mentality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR), the
investment bank founded by former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Roger Altman, hired Matthew McAskin as a senior managing
director in its health-care group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McAskin was previously co-head of health-care services
investment banking at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was
named a managing director in 2007, Evercore said today in a
statement. He&#8217;ll be based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merger and acquisition bankers have pointed to the health-care industry to lead a pickup in global deals. Announced
transaction volume across all industries has risen in the second
and third quarters this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Health care represents one of the largest and most active
industries for investment-banking services,&#8221; Chief Executive
Officer Ralph Schlosstein said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McAskin received an undergraduate degree in economics from
the University of Michigan and MBA degrees from Columbia
Business School and London Business School, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are extraordinarily pleased to have a banker of
Matthew&#8217;s quality and experience join Evercore,&#8221; Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold its
largest structured notes outside the U.S. in six years, raising
115 million euros ($151.5 million) from securities tied to
swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 15-year notes will initially pay coupons based on the
rate for 10-year euro constant-maturity swaps, benchmarks that
measure the cost of exchanging floating rate and fixed interest
payments through the swaps market, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The sale was the New York-based bank&#8217;s largest
outside its home market since it raised 230 million euros in
August 2007, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
declined to comment on the notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in the securities will receive an additional
payment from the fourth year onwards based on the difference
between 10-and two-year swap rates, Bloomberg data show. The
1.61 percentage-point gap between the two rates is the widest
since January 2011, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A constant maturity swap is a variation of an interest rate
swap where the floating interest portion is reset periodically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman raised $552.8 million from selling 31 structured
notes outside the U.S. this year, up from $503.4 million in the
same period last year, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Motorola Mobility
didn&#8217;t act in good faith when it demanded patent royalties from
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) for use of video-compression and Wi-Fi
technology, a federal jury said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury in Seattle acted in its first day of
deliberations. Microsoft was awarded about $14.5 million in
damages, the Seattle Times newspaper reported in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a landmark win for all who want products that are
affordable and work well together,&#8221; David Howard, Microsoft
deputy general counsel, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The
jury&#8217;s verdict is the latest in a growing list of decisions by
regulators and courts telling Google to stop abusing patents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re disappointed in this outcome, but look forward to
an appeal of the new legal issues raised in this case,&#8221; William
Moss, a Motorola Mobility spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict could help the two companies resolve a dispute
over patent royalties for both fundamental technologies in
electronic devices and features that make them easier to use.
More broadly, the case is one front in a global debate on how to
handle patents that relate to technology included in industry
standards used by all manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft claimed that Motorola Mobility acted unreasonably
by demanding royalties of 2.25 percent of the price of an Xbox
video-gaming system or a computer that runs on the Windows
operating system, and then threatening to get a court order
halting sales of the products if the money wasn&#8217;t paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Common Tactic &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility said the October 2010 letters sent to
Microsoft were a common opening offer that it used in
negotiating patent licensing with other companies for years.
Rather than sitting down to negotiate a licensing agreement as
other companies do, Microsoft went to the courts, Motorola
Mobility said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which reported $73.7 billion in 2012 revenue,
has said the royalty demand would equal more than $4 billion a
year, a figure Motorola Mobility disputed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Robart, who presided over the
trial, determined in April that the appropriate royalty rate was
about a half-cent per unit for video-decoding technology and 3
1/2 cents for wireless technology. Microsoft said that would
equal about $1.8 million a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue for the jury was whether Motorola Mobility&#8217;s
actions were in keeping with the standards of good faith and
fair dealing. Robart, in pre-trial rulings, said Motorola
Mobility&#8217;s offers have to be made in good faith, though the
initial offer doesn&#8217;t have to be on fair terms as long as the
result is fair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Royalty Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft struck first in 2010, demanding royalties from
companies using Google&#8217;s Android operating system and filing a
complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission. Motorola
Mobility responded within weeks by sending a letter saying it
was owed royalties on the Xbox and Windows. The company then
filed its own infringement lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, won a ruling that
limits imports of Motorola Mobility phones that have a feature
to synchronize calendars with computers. It sued U.S. Customs
and Border Protection for letting the phones continue to enter
the U.S., and both companies are appealing aspects of the case
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington, D.C. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$293.9 Billion Market &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent fights are part of a global war for an increased
share of the $293.9 billion smartphone market. They&#8217;ve become a
testing ground to determine how to treat patents that cover
basic technology used by companies so that, for instance,
chargers can plug into any device or Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone can
send and receive images from Samsung Electronics Co.&#8217;s Galaxy S4
handset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that participate in groups to establish
industrywide standards pledge to license any relevant patents on
&#8220;fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory&#8221; terms. In return,
they have the advantage of ensuring their technology is widely
used, giving them a leg up on implementing the standard and
establishing a broad base of potential licensees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A patent gives its owner the power to block others from
using the invention. Microsoft and Apple have both pledged not
to exercise that power when it comes to patents on industry
standards, though they have used other patents in their legal
fights with competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility and Samsung, two companies with long
histories with mobile phones, have lodged patent-infringement
suits using their patents on fundamental phone technology, such
as how data is transmitted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obama Veto &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration said limits should
be placed on such patents, and on Aug. 3 vetoed an import ban on
some of Apple&#8217;s older phones that Samsung had won. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung, which is under investigation by European
regulators over its use of standard-essential patents, had
agreed not to seek a sales ban on that continent against Apple
for use of any such technology. Google, of Mountain View,
California, reached an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission that limits its activities regarding those patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robart last year precluded Motorola Mobility from halting
sales of any Microsoft products based on an infringement finding
in Germany. Part of Microsoft&#8217;s request for damages was based on
the cost of relocating a logistics center warehouse to the
Netherlands from Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sept. 11 Arguments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which
specializes in patent law, is scheduled to hear arguments Sept.
11 on whether there should be different rules for standard
essential patents, and when companies can obtain court orders to
block the use of patented technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Posner, who normally presides on
the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, threw out cases
Apple and Motorola Mobility had filed against each other. Posner
ruled in June 2012 that Motorola Mobility wasn&#8217;t entitled to any
ban on the use of standard-essential patents, while Apple wasn&#8217;t
entitled to halt sales of complicated electronics based on an
infringement claim over device features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola Mobility Inc.,
10cv1823, U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that CBS Corp. has prevailed in its monthlong dispute with Time Warner Cable Inc., it&#8217;s Bob Iger&#8217;s turn to see how much his Walt Disney Co. can squeeze from a pay-TV carrier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney, owner of the most-expensive pay-TV channel in ESPN, faces a Sept. 30 deadline to reach a new agreement with Dish Network Corp. (DISH), the second-largest U.S. satellite-TV provider. The negotiations cover how much Dish pays for content and whether it can put programs on mobile phones -- the same sticking points that led to the one-month blackout of CBS on Time Warner Cable systems that was resolved this week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The outcome of those talks bodes well for Iger, Disney&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, and other content owners. CBS CEO Leslie Moonves won significant price increases while holding on to digital rights. Disney especially is buoyed by ownership of sports network ESPN -- a must-have for pay-TV providers like Dish, which are struggling to keep expenses in check while online players such as Netflix Inc. siphon viewers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even grandmas watch a lot of sports, so it will be difficult for Dish,&#8221; Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities in Denver, said in an interview. &#8220;ESPN and Disney are in a great bargaining position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Schwartz, chairman of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Asia-Pacific operations, bought a rare free-standing mansion on Manhattan&#8217;s Upper West Side for $14 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal for the 12,000-square-foot (1,115-square-meter)
home on Riverside Drive closed Aug. 8, according to records made
public yesterday by New York City&#8217;s Department of Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four-story house at the corner of 107th Street is the
last fully detached single-family mansion in Manhattan,
according to the property listing by Tod Mercy of the Corcoran
Group brokerage. It was built in 1909 by William Tuthill, the
designer of Carnegie Hall, and was commissioned by Morris
Schinasi, a Turkish tobacco baron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, 59, agreed to pay 3.7 percent more than the last
asking price of $13.5 million, according to property-listings
website StreetEasy.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12-bedroom, 11-bathroom house, surrounded by private
gardens and overlooking the Hudson River, &#8220;is an exquisite
French Renaissance jewel box executed in pristine white marble,
boasting deep-green roof tiles and bronze grills on the
balconies and at the main entrance,&#8221; according to the Corcoran
listing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy, the broker, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment.
Schwartz, who is based in Beijing, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to
an e-mail after normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Return &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz left New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2001,
returning in June 2012. In the interim, he served as chief
executive officer of Soros Fund Management and later chairman of
MissionPoint Capital Partners, according to his biography on the
bank&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz first joined Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment-banking
unit in 1979 and became chairman of the Asia business and a
member of the company&#8217;s management committee in 1999, the same
year that Goldman Sachs went public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seller of the mansion was the estates of Hans and
Beverly Smit. Hans Smit was an emeritus professor at Columbia
Law School who died in January 2012 at the age of 84, according
to the university&#8217;s website. His wife, Beverly Smit, a teacher
at the Spence School, died five weeks later, according to a
notice published in the New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto
may propose applying new food and soft-drink levies, boosting
income tax rates, tightening corporate tax rules and scrapping
gasoline subsidies, JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2014 budget and tax proposal will attempt to increase
the government&#8217;s non-oil revenue while lightening the fiscal
burden on state-owned oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos,
JPMorgan&#8217;s Nur Cristiani, Gabriel Lozano and Steven Palacio said
in a report today. The plan is set to be unveiled Sept. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pena Nieto&#8217;s plan &#8220;will likely involve a heated discussion
as many of the matters under review are highly unpopular,&#8221; the
JPMorgan analysts said. &#8220;The government will need to carefully
balance tax collection with lower dependency on oil revenues and
current economic and consumption deceleration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s central bank changed the backdrop for Pena Nieto&#8217;s
announcement with the second cut this year in its benchmark
interest rate after inflation decelerated to within its target
range and the economy expanded at the slowest pace since the
2009 recession. Lower rates may stimulate growth, easing the
sting of possible tax increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks reversed an earlier decline on the surprise rate
cut, sending the IPC index up 0.6 percent at the close in Mexico
City. The gauge slid 5.3 percent in the month that ended
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation Effect &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pemex, which provides about a third of government revenue,
will be one focus of Pena Nieto&#8217;s plan, according to the
JPMorgan report, &#8220;Tighten Your Belts, Fiscal Reform Is
Coming.&#8221; The company has said it needs lower taxes and more
investment as it strives to reverse eight straight years of
production declines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in the tax mix may produce a &#8220;long-term&#8221; increase
in non-oil government revenue of as much as 2.8 percent of gross
domestic product, the New York-based bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan may include an increase in the income tax rate for
higher earners to as much as 38 percent from the current level
of 30 percent, and changes to corporate tax law that raise the
effective rate, according to the JPMorgan analysts. Also
possible is the imposition of a tax on gasoline and an end to
subsidies for the fuel, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food Tax &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pena Nieto may also propose applying a 4 percent value-added tax to food, which could gradually climb as high as 8
percent in subsequent years, JPMorgan said. Medicine and basic
foods would probably be exempt. A 20 percent excise tax on
beverages, excluding bottled water and milk, is also possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the plan, Mexico&#8217;s annual inflation rate may rise by
about 1.8 percentage points next year, plus a cumulative 0.5
percentage point over the following three years, according to
JPMorgan. Annual inflation rose to 3.54 percent in the 12 months
through mid-August, the government said on Aug. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to boost tax receipts goes hand in hand with Pena
Nieto&#8217;s August proposal to allow more private investment in the
energy industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fiscal bill will be equally important, as changes
aiming to liberalize the energy sector -- including a revision
of Pemex&#8217;s current fiscal regime -- would need to be accompanied
by changes aimed at boosting non-oil public revenues,&#8221; the
JPMorgan analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is in talks
to sell a majority stake in its European insurance business to
Singapore&#8217;s GIC Pte and Blackstone (BX) Group LP, according to a
person with knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both GIC, Singapore&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, and
Blackstone, the world&#8217;s biggest private-equity firm, may each
buy a stake of about 30 percent in Rothesay Life Ltd., a London-based insurer run by Goldman Sachs partner Addy Loudiadis, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the
negotiations are private. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance
Co. may also buy 6 percent, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said last month that it expects to sell a
majority stake in Rothesay, which has about $9.66 billion in
assets, in the next 12 months as banks face more stringent
capital rules. Goldman Sachs sold about 80 percent of Global
Atlantic Financial Group, a reinsurance business in Bermuda, to
institutions and high-net worth clients this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported earlier today that Goldman
Sachs was set to sell almost two-thirds of the pensions insurer
to GIC, Blackstone and Mass. Mutual. Spokesmen for Goldman
Sachs, Rothesay, GIC and Blackstone declined to comment. A
spokesman for Mass. Mutual, based in Springfield, Massachusetts,
couldn&#8217;t be reached outside of normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass. Mutual invested 100 million pounds ($156 million) in
subordinated debt in Rothesay this year. The transaction is some
way off from being completed, with an announcement unlikely
before the end of September, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothesay insures about 12 billion pounds of insurance
contracts for companies including IAG SA&#8217;s British Airways and
General Motors Co. (GM)&#8217;s U.K. division. Firms such as Rothesay
promise to pay pensions if retirees live beyond a certain age
and then use derivatives to try to hedge the risk. The insurer
typically receives a portion of the pension plan&#8217;s assets. &lt;/p&gt;

plan options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move affects about 110,000 Medicare-eligible retirees,
Doug Shelton, an IBM spokesman, said by telephone. The company
has chosen the Extend Health exchange by Towers Watson, the
country&#8217;s largest private Medicare exchange, to provide more
options for prescription drug, dental and vision care, the
Armonk, New York-based company said in a statement e-mailed
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s move is the latest in a string of large changes that
organizations have made to counter rising health costs. In
August, United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) decided to drop health
benefits for 15,000 of its workers&#8217; spouses, while Michigan
Governor Rick Snyder tried to reduce costs by moving municipal
retirees to exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This transition provides more choice and flexibility at
equal or better costs to our retirees,&#8221; IBM said in the
statement. &#8220;While some retirees may be skeptical today, studies
show that the majority of people who are presented the concept
of an exchange are skeptical at first, but once they understand
the options available to them through these exchanges, they have
a more positive outlook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug. 29 (Bloomberg) -- A probe of JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s
hiring practices in China has uncovered red flags across Asia,

considering when to reduce bond buying were &#8220;broadly

may be needed soon, minutes of their last meeting show. &lt;/p&gt;

June &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Two Brevan Howard Asset Management
LLP credit traders left in recent weeks, as the firm scales back

&lt;h2&gt;4. Repo Market Decline Raises Alarm as Regulation Strains Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Regulations aimed at reducing the
risk of another financial crisis are starting to upend a key
part of the bond market that expedites trading in everything

Extradition &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug. 28 (Bloomberg) -- In the space of 20 minutes on the
last Friday in June, the value of the U.S. dollar jumped 0.57

Rallies &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Fabrice Tourre, the former Goldman

primarily responsible for the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;

Trade &lt;/p&gt;

sale on herself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Warning to Americans: Be Afraid, Very Afraid: Jeffrey
Goldberg &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 5 (Bloomberg) -- It seems as if al-Qaeda, or its
Arabian Peninsula branch, has succeeded in terrorizing the
United States of America again, but this time without -- as of
this writing -&#8211; detonating an ounce of C4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If You Think Europe Is Fine, Take a Look at Italy: Simon
Johnson &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 7 (Bloomberg) -- It has become fashionable not to
worry about Europe and the euro area. This complacency has a
serious flaw: Italy. &lt;/p&gt;

Baum &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 15 (Bloomberg) -- It&#8217;s good that Milton Friedman is

&lt;p&gt;4. Love Your Job? Thank the Country Where You Live: Edmund
Phelps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 19 (Bloomberg) -- It is widely assumed that people in
economically &#8220;advanced&#8221; countries do not differ significantly
in how satisfied they are with their jobs. Because they are
about equally productive, the reasoning is, they must produce
things the same way, and so their work experience must be the
same, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. All Miami Dolphins Should Have Gone to See Obama: Stephen
Carter &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 22 (Bloomberg) -- In 1903, President Theodore
Roosevelt invited naturalist John Muir, founder of the Sierra
Club, to be his guide for his famous camping trip through
Yosemite National Park. Muir was about to decline when a friend
warned him that one must always accept the president&#8217;s
invitation. Muir was offended by this notion, because it seemed
to treat the president like a king. In the end, Muir decided to
make the journey after all: &#8220;I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t refuse just
because he happens to be president,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Oil Advances on Syria as Stocks Rise, Treasuries Drop on
Economy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Crude oil and gold advanced amid

&lt;p&gt;Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- David Brenneman, a Harvard-trained

Economy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Payrolls in the U.S. climbed less

Fluke &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Mary Callahan
Erdoes got her first assignment managing money when she was 6
years old. The eldest of four children, Erdoes showed an early

elementary-school teacher from the southern state of Oaxaca, his
union&#8217;s protests disrupting Mexico&#8217;s capital aren&#8217;t just about

&lt;h2&gt;7. Pimco Total Return Loses 14% of Assets Amid Four-Month Rout &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The world&#8217;s biggest mutual fund

Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 4 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks rose for a second day,
led by chipmakers and automobile companies, and Treasuries fell
as the Federal Reserve said the economy maintained a &#8220;modest to
moderate&#8221; pace of growth. Shares in the Middle East sank as the
U.S. moved closer to a military strike against Syria. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept. 3 (Bloomberg) -- President Barack Obama urged

&lt;p&gt;10. Treasuries, Gold Rise on Fed Bets as Oil Gains on Syria
Concerns &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Treasury yields slid, the dollar

&lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Why Not Make Everyone Rich With $50 Minimum Wage?: Caroline
Baum &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Last week, fast-food workers staged
a one-day strike in 60 U.S. cities to demand a minimum wage of

&lt;p&gt;2. Why Do We Even Care About Chemical Weapons in Syria?: Ezra
Klein &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- The United Nations estimates that
more than 100,000 Syrians have died since the country&#8217;s civil
war began in March 2011. More die every day. But the U.S. is not
considering military action to save them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Mega Is a Lumbering Giant: Rich Jaroslovsky &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- The most common reaction to

Weil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 6 (Bloomberg) -- If you want to know how much money a

&lt;p&gt;5. Popular Misconceptions About Quantitative Easing: Joseph
Gagnon &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 3 (Bloomberg) -- To combat the recession that began
in 2007, the Federal Reserve and some other central banks have
been buying large amounts of long-term bonds. The novelty of
this quantitative easing makes the policy especially prone to
popular misconceptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MULTIMEDIA &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Draghi Says Confidence Indicators Confirm Better Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank President

</body></entry><entry author="By Patricia Hurtado" date="Sep 09, 2013  8:13 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-09/chevron-waives-some-claims-in-ecuador-pollution-case.html"><headline>Chevron Won&#8217;t Seek Money From Ecuadorians in U.S. Lawsuit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) said it won&#8217;t seek
money damages against two Ecuadorians it sued in a New York
racketeering case claiming the pair committed fraud to win a $19
billion verdict in a pollution case in their country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil company also asked that the trial, set to begin
next month in federal court in Manhattan, be held in two parts,
one before a jury and a second before a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, was ordered
to pay as much as $19 billion in compensatory and punitive
damages for Texaco Inc.&#8217;s alleged dumping of toxic drilling
wastes in the Ecuadorean jungle from 1964 to about 1992. The
ruling came in an 18-year-old case decided by a judge in Lago
Agrio, a provincial capital near the Colombian border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company sued in federal court in New York in 2011
accusing Ecuadorians who were named plaintiffs in the case and
their lead legal adviser, Steven Donziger, of improperly
influencing a court expert in the case in Lago Agrio and
committing fraud to win the judgment. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York, who is presiding over the case, scheduled an
Oct. 15 trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based oil company said it won&#8217;t
seek money damages against the two Ecuadorians, and that a jury
should determine liability claims against Donziger and his law
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Extensive Evidence&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron has uncovered extensive evidence that the 2011
Ecuadorian judgment was fraudulently obtained by the Lago Agrio
plaintiffs,&#8221; Morgan Crinklaw, a company representative, said in
an e-mail. &#8220;However, their international campaign to
enforcement that judgment has not gained much traction to date.
The equitable relief Chevron continues to seek against the
Lago Agrio plaintiffs will enable us to protect our assets, and
those of our subsidiaries, from being seized by the Lago Agrio
plaintiffs or in their name.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaplan today rejected a request by Donziger and two of the
individual plaintiffs in the Ecuadorean suit to delay the trial
pending a decision by the Manhattan-based U.S. Court of Appeals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral arguments are to be heard Sept. 26 on Donziger and the
Ecuadorians&#8217; request that the court remove Kaplan from the case
and cancel several orders he issued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaplan said that Donziger had failed to request a delay
pending the appeals court&#8217;s decision soon enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The motion to delay the trial is without merit,
represents a radical change in defendants&#8217; nominal position
(though it is entirely consistent with a years-old strategy of
delay wherever possible), and comes far too late,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Notwithstanding their attempts to portray themselves as
Davids, each alone facing Goliath, the reality is quite
different.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron asked that a jury determine what, if any,
compensatory and punitive monetary damages should be paid by
Donziger and asked Kaplan to determine what other remedies
should be imposed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phase Two &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company asked the judge to decide in a second phase of
the trial whether the Ecuadorians and Donziger should be barred
from further harming Chevron and to issue an order that protects
its assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also requested that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs
be prohibited from making what it called prejudicial statements
about &#8220;alleged environmental issues in Ecuador.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron denies there was company wrongdoing in the Lago
Agrio lawsuit, saying Texaco cleaned up its share of the
pollution at its former oil fields, which were taken over by
PetroEcuador, Ecuador&#8217;s state-owned oil company. Chevron said it
was released from any future liability by an agreement between
Texaco and Ecuador. Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-00691,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
The case in Ecuador is Aquinda v. Chevron, 002-2003, Superior
Court of Nueva Loja, Lago Agrio, Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is shuffling the
management of its Windows division, a move that will leave
longtime executives Jon DeVaan and Antoine Leblond without
senior leadership roles, according to people with knowledge of
the changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terry Myerson, who runs Windows and Windows Phone, is
reassigning executives in the newly joined software unit as part
of Microsoft&#8217;s companywide restructuring, said the people, who
asked not to be named because the moves haven&#8217;t been announced.
Henry Sanders, a Windows Phone executive, will lead development,
while Joe Belfiore, also from Windows Phone, will run a phone,
tablet and PC group, said one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, is
overhauling its top ranks as Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer nears retirement. Ballmer, who said last month he will
leave within a year, in July rolled out the largest change to
the company&#8217;s executive staff in more than a decade. Those
picked as unit leaders by Ballmer are now setting up their own
leadership teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leblond had been in charge of lining up applications for
Windows 8, Microsoft&#8217;s new operating system, which was
criticized for lacking some popular apps when it went on sale in
October. More recently he worked on the Windows 8.1 update to
the software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeVaan, a 29-year Microsoft veteran, was a vice president
in Windows development. It&#8217;s not clear if the two will take on
positions elsewhere in the company, stay in Windows, or leave
altogeter, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Xbox Software &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myerson, whose team also develops software for the Xbox and
the Xbox Live online service, picked Xbox executive Marc Whitten
to run those businesses, and Chris Jones will keep his current
job overseeing Windows services, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows changes were reporter earlier by the All Things
D blog. Tony Imperati, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bolster its struggling mobile business, Microsoft agreed
last week to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset business or $7.2 billion,
adding about 32,000 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will introduce new versions of its Surface tablet
at an event in New York on Sept. 23, according to an invitation
sent out by the company. While there has been speculation the
company might introduce a smaller Surface, no such device will
be unveiled at the event, said a person familiar with the
matter. Last quarter Microsoft took a $900 million charge
writedown on unsold Surface tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new products will include both a version for Intel
Corp. chips running Windows 8 and a version running Windows RT

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is making its Xbox
Music service available on Android and iOS devices to compete
with Apple (AAPL) Inc.&#8217;s iTunes, Spotify Ltd. and Pandora Media Inc. (P) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $9.99-a-month Xbox Music Pass, which provides
unlimited, advertising-free streaming, can be used today for the
first time on Apple iPhones and devices running Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s
Android software, Scott Porter, principal program manager at
XBox Music, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expansion gives Microsoft access to the biggest
smartphone platforms as it guns for the leaders in digital music
-- Spotify in subscription streaming, Pandora in Web radio, and
Apple&#8217;s iTunes for purchases. Microsoft introduced the service
in October on the Xbox 360 console and Windows 8 devices, saying
then it planned to add Android and iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Music needs to be something that freely connects between
devices for users to be happy,&#8221; Porter said. Windows users
&#8220;spent time curating and discovering new music and we need to
give them access wherever they are.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listeners can access Xbox Music on a smartphone, tablet,
Xbox 360 or the coming Xbox One video game console, Porter said.
A free, ad-supported online version allows tracks to be shared
with people who use an Apple PC, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which is buying mobile-phone maker Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) for
$7.2 billion, trails iOS and Android. Windows accounted for 3.6
percent of worldwide smartphones at the end of June, according
to Bloomberg Industries data. That compares with 79 percent for
Android and 13 percent for Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Xbox Music features will be introduced when Microsoft
starts selling Windows 8.1 in October, Porter said. One such
addition will be a Web Playlist tool that grabs all the music on
a Web page to create a list of songs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose 1.6 percent
to $31.66 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 18
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) sold an estimated $30 million of its Infinity game system in the two weeks after the product&#8217;s Aug. 18 debut, ranking among the top sellers, according to Michael J. Olson, a Piper Jaffray  Co. analyst. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shoppers bought 400,000 units, Olson said in a research note published today. First-week spending matched the debut of Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI)&#8217;s Skylanders Giants game, Olson said in an earlier note. That title was the top 2012 holiday children&#8217;s game, according to Activision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sales have been excellent, beyond our expectations,&#8221; said Richard Barry, chief merchandising officer at Toys &#8220;R&#8221; Us Inc., based in Wayne, New Jersey. &#8220;Kids are really engaging in the brand. They are not only buying the software, but they are really engaging in the characters and the power discs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Infinity represents Disney&#8217;s biggest bet in video games, drawing on characters like Captain Jack Sparrow from its library of film hits. The company is counting on the product and follow-on sales to turn a profit at its interactive division, which lost $103 million through nine months of the current fiscal year. First-week purchases totaled 379,000, Olson said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like Skylanders, Infinity integrates collectible figures with on-screen video-game play. Kids use the figures to create and play with characters using game consoles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disney Infinity is having meaningful success at retail,&#8221; Olson wrote in the earlier note. Clerks said the game is &#8220;selling very well&#8221; in 17 of 20 stores checked, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, rose 0.3 percent to $61.59 at the close in New York. Shares of the Burbank, California-based company are up 24 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Infinity product, including a base unit and three collectible characters, retails for $75. Additional toys and discs, providing more characters and features, sell for $5 to $13. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Christopher Palmeri in Los Angeles at cpalmeri1@bloomberg.net; Cliff Edwards in San Francisco at cedwards28@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Anthony Palazzo at apalazzo@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MetLife Inc. (MET), the largest U.S. life
insurer, said Nela D&#8217;Agosta joined from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
as a managing director in the unit investing funds for
institutional clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D&#8217;Agosta will focus on marketing and relationships for
MetLife, the New York-based insurer said in a statement today.
She was a senior relationship manager at Goldman Sachs&#8217;s asset
management unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetLife created the unit for institutional investors last
year as Chief Executive Officer Steve Kandarian works to boost
fee income and scales back from capital-intensive businesses
like variable annuities. The insurer said last month that it won
a commitment of as much as $5 billion from SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI)
for commercial mortgage loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nela will bring strong global experience in sales,
relationship management and team leadership,&#8221; Lou Jug, head of
investor services for MetLife Investment Management, said in the
statement. &#8220;Her extensive relationship management
expertise and client service capabilities are valuable assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier at Goldman Sachs, D&#8217;Agosta was global head of
insurance client relationship management. Andrea Raphael, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D&#8217;Agosta also worked at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan
Stanley (MS) and graduated from Villanova University in 1990 with a
bachelor&#8217;s degree in business administration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and insurers
reached a $300 million settlement with property owners who
accused the companies of overcharging for hazard insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Assurant Inc. (AIZ) and other insurers will pay refunds
valued at 12.5 percent of annual premium costs to homeowners who
had the policies placed on their properties by the bank starting
in January 2008, according to documents filed Sept. 6 in federal
court in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeowners covered by the case stand &#8220;to recover hundreds,
if not thousands, of dollars as a result of the settlement,&#8221;
lawyers for the plaintiffs said in a memorandum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, was accused of placing
mortgage borrowers&#8217; required hazard and wind coverage with
Assurant and other insurers at inflated rates, covering costs of
kickbacks to a JPMorgan unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlement will have no expected impact on our
financials,&#8221; Amy Bonitatibus, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said in
an e-mailed statement. The insurance agreement at issue was
discontinued this year, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shawn Kahle, a spokeswoman for New York-based Assurant,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the
settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Saccoccio v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 13-cv-21107, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street&#8217;s biggest firms are
predicting intensifying bond losses in emerging markets, where
borrowing costs have already soared to the highest in more than
four years versus U.S. corporate debt, as the Federal Reserve
considers curtailing record stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not yet convinced that we&#8217;ve seen the worst in
terms of flows out of emerging markets,&#8221; Jeffrey Rosenberg, the
chief investment strategist in fixed-income at New York-based
BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, said in a
telephone interview, expressing his own views. &#8220;We see a lot of
valuation change but we see the potential for even more
valuation change.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have yanked $22.1 billion from emerging-market
bond funds since the end of April, almost five times the amount
pulled from U.S. corporate credit, according to EPFR Global.
That&#8217;s pushed the extra yield that buyers now demand to own
dollar-denominated emerging-market debt instead of U.S. company
notes to 1.4 percentage points, about the most since December
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowing costs are soaring from record lows reached in
January as speculation deepens that the Fed will curtail its so-called quantitative easing as soon as this month, signaling an
end to the flood of cheap money that's propped up asset prices
from India to China and Indonesia. The exodus from developing
nations began after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress
on May 22 that the central bank could scale back the pace of its
$85 billion of purchases of mortgage bonds and Treasuries if the
U.S. economy showed sustained improvement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the bank that
incurred a $6.2 billion trading loss last year, will elect Linda B. Bammann and Michael A. Neal to its board and named Lee R. Raymond as lead independent director, giving him more powers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raymond, formerly presiding director, will have authority
to call meetings at any time, approve agendas and add agenda
items, and will guide the board in considering the succession of
chief executive officers, New York-based JPMorgan said today in
a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in May rejected a proposal to split the chairman
and CEO roles, which advisory firms such as Institutional
Shareholder Services said would improve oversight. The bank said
today that the board will hold executive sessions without
company management at every regular board meeting, make members
available to meet with major shareholders and won&#8217;t rotate the
lead independent director position every year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bammann and Neal are &#8220;proven leaders and will bring
outstanding, risk, finance and management experience to our
board,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, last
year staved off a shareholder proposal to split the roles of
Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein by agreeing to appoint an
independent lead director. James J. Schiro, the former CEO of
Zurich Financial Services AG and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP who
joined Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board in 2009, was named to the role in
April 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America&#8217;s biggest employers, from GE to IBM, are increasingly moving retirees to insurance exchanges where they select their own health plans, an historic shift that could push more costs onto U.S. taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time Warner Inc. (TWX) yesterday said it would steer retired workers toward a privately run exchange, days after a similar announcement by International Business Machines Corp. General Electric Co. (GE) last year said it, too, would curb benefits in a move that may send some former employees to the public insurance exchanges created under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While retiree health benefits have been shrinking for years, the newest cutbacks may quickly become the norm. About 44 percent of companies plan to stop administering health plans for their former workers over the next two years, a survey last month by consultant Towers Watson  Co. (TW) found. Retirees are concerned their costs may rise, while analysts predict benefits will decline in some cases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Things are going to change dramatically,&#8221; said Ron Fontanetta, a partner at New York-based Towers Watson, which advises GE and other large companies. &#8220;Over the next two to three years, we see a much more aggressive rethinking of what employers are going to provide.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Visa (V) Inc.
and Nike Inc. (NKE) will be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU),
replacing Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Alcoa
Inc. (AA) in the biggest reshuffling since April 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes will boost the influence of banking and
computer companies in the 30-member gauge as the fifth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets and the largest payment network join seven
other financial and technology firms, such as JPMorgan Chase 
Co. and Cisco Systems Inc. Bank of America exits even after
rising 109 percent in 2012, the Dow&#8217;s largest gain. The changes
will take effect after the close on Sept. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moves announced today by a committee that includes editors
of the Wall Street Journal will give extra influence to the
average&#8217;s newest members, due to the way the gauge is designed.
Since Dow proportions are determined by stock price rather than
market value, shares of Visa and Goldman Sachs, which trade
above $160 apiece, will have about seven times the weighting as
the constituents they replace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Dow is going to look and act very differently,&#8221; Dan Greenhaus, a strategist at BTIG LLC, said in a note to clients.
&#8220;Visa would become the second-most important stock in the index
and Goldman Sachs the third-most important.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All 55,000 square feet of the Park
Avenue Armory&#8217;s Wade Thompson Drill Hall are focused on a table
not much bigger than the chess board atop it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s more than a world chess championship at stake in
&#8220;The Machine,&#8221; Matt Charman&#8217;s play based on the 1997 re-match
between grandmaster Garry Kasparov and &#8220;Deep Blue,&#8221; the
computer that IBM (IBM) built to beat him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasparov won the first duel a year earlier, and Deep Blue
returned with a chip on its shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hall is tricked-out like a Las Vegas boxing arena, with
giant scoreboard, digital video screens and color commentators
bloviating from the wings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which provides plenty of sizzle for very little
steak: As the match unfolds, Charman&#8217;s paint-by-numbers script
skips back in time to the parallel stories of Azerbaijan-born
Kasparov (the nuanced Hadley Fraser) and the computer&#8217;s chief
developer, Taiwan emigre Feng-Hsiung Hsu (Kenneth Lee, good in a
more one-note role). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasparov is a genius with mommy issues (the forceful
Francesca Annis). Hsu ignores his pretty cheerleader girlfriend
from Carnegie-Mellon (Antonia Bernath). Their passion lies
elsewhere, you see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charman toys with the idea that the man-versus-machine
showdown served a public relations purpose above all. But an
outsize set (Lucy Osborne) and snappy video (Andrzej Goulding)
don&#8217;t justify blowing such an intimate encounter so wildly out
of proportion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josie Rourke&#8217;s staging atomizes these gladiators, and the
echo-chamber sound doesn&#8217;t amplify the themes so much as render
them unintelligible. (Rating: **1/2) &lt;/p&gt;

been taken over by a conglomerate with the bottom line
paramount, it&#8217;s a timely meditation on the gloomy outlook for
books -- real ones, with pages and spines and ink -- in the
digital age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Lumbly is stirring as Alexander Ames, the aging, up-from-poverty patriarch. Even better is Ismael Cruz Cordova as
&#8220;J,&#8221; a window washer with dreams and, it seems, a direct link

&lt;p&gt;Best yet is Neil Patel and Shawn Sagady&#8217;s elegant design,
playing with projections of words, quotations and a Windy City

&lt;p&gt;Taylor, who also directs, is not in control of her
material, which goes seriously off the rails after Alexander and
J connect. The play spins out into digital entropy that&#8217;s more
nonsense than the sad, surrealistic endgame it means to suggest.

&lt;p&gt;UniCredit SpA (UCG), Italy&#8217;s biggest
bank, forecast savings of 725 million euros ($961 million) in 10
years from a joint venture with International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) to outsource information-technology systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;UniCredit&#8217;s partnership will allow the bank to have
significant savings at not material costs,&#8221; UniCredit Deputy
General Manager Paolo Fiorentino said at a press conference in
Milan today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value Transformation Services, the joint venture in which
IBM holds a 51 percent stake, will operate in Italy, Germany,
Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, he said.
Milan-based UniCredit will transfer 700 workers to the new
venture as part of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniCredit and IBM, based in Armonk, New York, agreed in
July to improve the bank&#8217;s infrastructure services as part of a
plan, dubbed Newton Program, to cut costs and increase revenue
through strategic partnerships. UniCredit Chief Executive
Officer Federico Ghizzoni said last month he plans to reduce
costs by 1 billion euros more than the 15.8 billion euros
previously targeted by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mortgage lenders including Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) that feasted on refinancings as interest rates reached all-time lows are now warning that the drop in demand may be steeper than expected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even Bank of America Corp., which fell to fourth in U.S. mortgages last year as it scaled back after buying Countrywide Financial Corp., is reducing capacity further as surging interest rates crimp demand. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm is eliminating 2,100 jobs and closing 16 offices by Oct. 31, said two people with direct knowledge of the plan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Home lenders are tempering forecasts after interest rates rose amid signs the Federal Reserve may scale back stimulus efforts. Wells Fargo, the top U.S. home lender, said yesterday that third-quarter originations may fall 29 percent to $80 billion. JPMorgan, ranked No. 2, said it expects to lose money on home lending in the second half as volumes drop as much 40 percent from the year&#8217;s first six months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was speculation, I&#8217;m sure by Wells but a lot of other people, that there would be second-quarter momentum that would carry through to the third quarter,&#8221; said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance in Bethesda, Maryland. Yesterday&#8217;s comments and Bank of America&#8217;s job cuts show &#8220;that some of that stuff appeared very quickly in terms of people dropping out of the market. That clearly doesn&#8217;t bode well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Business Machines Corp. (IBM) to develop technology that puts the
Internet in the driver&#8217;s seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continental, based in Hanover, Germany, and Armonk, New
York-based IBM, agreed to create a multimedia platform that
controls functions such as mobility and navigation, the
companies said at the International Auto Show in Frankfurt
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership comes five weeks after Continental
announced a cooperation with Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), the biggest
maker of networking equipment, to develop technology to connect
vehicles to the Internet. Web connectivity has become critical
for carmakers as customers demand vehicles with more technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM&#8217;s experience in cloud-enabled platforms and embedded
systems development capabilities, combined with our systems
expertise in automotive electronics, create the foundation for a
new generation of intelligent networked vehicles,&#8221; Continental
Chief Executive Officer Elmar Degenhart said at a press
conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology will be designed to help cars communicate
with each other, steer their way better through traffic and
&#8220;literally look around the corner,&#8221; the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler AG (DAI) provides live traffic
information and a Wi-Fi hotspot in its new-generation Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan. Backed by an array of 12 ultrasonic
detectors, five cameras and six radar sensors, the 79,800-euro
($104,630) S-Class can match the speed of the car in front of
it, even coming to a complete stop and steering to stay in the
lane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) has been testing self-driving cars for several
years, putting its own technology into existing car models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The boom is just starting,&#8221; Ralf Lenninger, a manager of
Continental&#8217;s interior divison, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the bank that
incurred a $6.2 billion trading loss last year, will elect Linda
B. Bammann and Michael A. Neal to its board and named Lee R.
Raymond as lead independent director, giving him more powers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raymond, formerly presiding director, will have authority
to call meetings at any time, approve agendas and add agenda
items, and will guide the board in considering the succession of
chief executive officers, New York-based JPMorgan said yesterday
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in May rejected a proposal to split the chairman
and CEO roles, which advisory firms such as Institutional
Shareholder Services said would improve oversight. The bank said
yesterday that the board will hold executive sessions without
company management at every regular board meeting, make members
available to meet with major shareholders and won&#8217;t rotate the
lead independent director position every year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, expects to elect
Bammann to the board on Sept. 16 and Neal will join in January
after he retires from his current position, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is contending with criminal investigations of its
energy-trading and mortgage-backed securities operations. The
firm also faces U.S. probes of its anti-money-laundering
safeguards, foreclosures, credit-card collections and the London
Whale debacle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has made bolstering regulatory compliance and
internal controls its priority this year, Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, has said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mexico&#8217;s Pena Nieto Seeks Capital Gains, High Earners Taxes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s President Enrique Pena Nieto is proposing taxes on
capital gains, sugary drinks and the nation&#8217;s highest earners in
a bid to wean Latin America&#8217;s second-largest economy off its
dependence on oil revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill sent to congress Sept. 8 along with the
president&#8217;s 2014 budget proposal would place a 10 percent tax on
individuals&#8217; profits from stock sales and dividends, raise the
maximum personal income tax rate to 32 percent from 30 percent
and avoid taxing food and medicine. The measures would help
offset a proposed lower tax burden for state-owned oil producer
Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, and help pay for universal social
security and unemployment insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratings companies will probably be disappointed by the
decision not to tax food and medicine, while some government
bond investors may be hurt as additional debt issuance boosts
supply of the securities, said Alonso Cervera, the chief Mexico
economist at Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax bill would increase government revenue, according
to the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pena Nieto has pledged to boost tax collection as part of a
series of economic overhauls to speed up growth that&#8217;s 40
percent slower than the regional average over the past five
years. Income from Pemex crude sales funds about a third of the
federal budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reform would end a tax benefit, known as fiscal
consolidation, which allows holding companies to postpone paying
taxes when their subsidiaries post losses. Companies with the
largest deferred tax assets, and thus may be the most affected,
are America Movil (AMXL) SAB, Cemex SAB, Arca Continental SAB (AC*), Empresas
ICA SAB (ICA*) and Grupo Bimbo SAB (BIMBOA), JPMorgan Chase  Co. said in a
Sept. 6 research note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tin Smelters in Indonesia Pushing for JFX Trade Permits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smelters and Jakarta Futures Exchange are expected to meet
with the Trade Ministry this week to push for permits to trade
physical tin contracts, said M.B. Gunawan, director and general
manager at PT Stanindo Inti Perkasa, a metals manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smelters stopped operations and won&#8217;t resume until the
Futures Exchange gets trading permits or the government delays
the rule, Gunawan said by phone from Jakarta yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miners halted work because they can&#8217;t sell ore, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smelters met last week. Most are not interested in joining
the Indonesia Commodity and Derivatives Exchange, Gunawan said.
They prefer the Futures Exchange because they can show their
brand and interact directly with buyers, he said. The Futures
Exchange will display smelters&#8217; brands on the trading system,
according to Gunawan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FDIC to Sell $2.42 Billion of Citigroup Debt to End Rescue Stake &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is selling $2.42
billion of bonds issued by Citigroup Inc. (C) in a transaction that
will eliminate U.S. government holdings in the bank linked to
the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup exchanged the subordinated notes due 2025 and
2043 to the FDIC for other securities used to pay the government
for $301 billion of asset guarantees, the New York-based bank
said yesterday in a regulatory filing. Citigroup won&#8217;t receive
any proceeds from the resale to the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering is the latest step to end taxpayer support for
Citigroup, which took more bailout assistance than any other
U.S. lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the transaction concludes, no U.S. government entity
will continue to hold any securities in Citi issued as a result
of the financial crisis,&#8221; Mark Costiglio, a spokesman for the
lender, said by e-mail. The government&#8217;s investment realized a
return of &#8220;more than $13 billion,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup issued a combined $7.06 billion in preferred
shares to the FDIC and the Treasury as consideration for the
loss-sharing protection, provided to help shore up investor
confidence in the bank during the worst financial crisis since
the Great Depression. The Treasury said in February that it
expected to receive $894 million in proceeds from a similar
offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Barr, a spokesman at the FDIC, declined to comment on
the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hewlett-Packard Says Polish Regulators Join Bribery Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) said the Polish Anti-Corruption Bureau
joined an investigation by U.S. regulators into potential
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by the computer
maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe, along with the U.S. Department of Justice and
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, centers on an employee
of Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s Polska unit and &#8220;public sector
transactions in Poland,&#8221; according to a regulatory filing
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agencies are also investigating &#8220;public-sector
transactions&#8221; in Russia, Mexico and other countries that
weren&#8217;t named, according to the filing. The Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, or FCPA, makes it illegal for U.S. business
people to bribe foreign officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reserve Primary Fund Settles Shareholder Suit for $54.9 Million &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce R. Bent II, president of the $62.5 billion Reserve
Primary money-market fund that failed during the financial
crisis, agreed to settle a shareholder lawsuit in an accord
worth about $54.9 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bent and his father, Bruce R. Bent, are among defendants
that agreed to pay $10 million in cash, drop their claim for
$42.4 million from a court-established expense fund, and to
allow $2.5 million from the expense fund to go to shareholders.
None of the defendants admitted wrongdoing as part of the
proposed settlement to end a class-action lawsuit led by Third
Avenue Institutional International Value Fund LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed in September 2008, two days after Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. went bankrupt in the midst of the worst
U.S. economic crisis since the Great Depression. The Reserve
Primary money-market fund held $785 million in Lehman debt. A
run on the fund triggered its failure when it &#8220;broke the buck&#8221;
by failing to maintain a $1-a-share net asset value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal jury found Bruce Bent II negligent on one claim
of violating a securities law. His father was absolved of all
claims in a suit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund&#8217;s closing sparked an investor run on similar money
funds, contributing to a freeze among global credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement is subject to court approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Reserve Primary Fund Securities  Derivative
Class Action Litigation, 08-cv-08060. The SEC case is SEC v.
Reserve Management Co., 09-cv-04346, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interviews &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Secret Swiss Accounts No Longer Safe Tax Dodge, Prosecutor Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxpayers who still believe they can hide secret Swiss bank
accounts from the Internal Revenue Service are &#8220;beyond
foolish,&#8221; the top U.S. tax prosecutor said as a five-year
crackdown expands to new offshore havens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enforcement drive has forced a &#8220;remarkable&#8221; change in
the ability of the U.S. to find secret accounts in Switzerland,
the world&#8217;s largest offshore financial center with about $2.2
trillion of assets, said Kathryn Keneally, assistant attorney
general in the Justice Department&#8217;s tax division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If someone had an account in Switzerland, it is beyond
foolish to think that that account is going to remain secret,&#8221;
said Keneally, 55. &#8220;In the last five years, we&#8217;ve seen a
remarkable change in our ability to get information concerning
Swiss bank accounts. It&#8217;s extraordinary. Switzerland is no
longer a good place to hide assets for tax reasons.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keneally, in her first interview since taking the job in
April 2012, said a new U.S. amnesty program for Swiss banks to
disclose how they aided tax evasion puts taxpayers and offshore
enablers at risk of prosecution. Since 2009, the U.S. has
prosecuted 68 U.S. taxpayers, three Swiss banks, and 30 bankers,
lawyers, and advisers. Another 38,000 Americans moved $5.5
billion to the U.S. and avoided prosecution by saying who helped
them offshore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen firms are under criminal investigation. On Aug.
29, the U.S. announced a program for other Swiss banks to avoid
charges. They must pay penalties and disclose their cross-border
activities, among other measures. Banks that don&#8217;t come forward
by the Dec. 31 deadline could face criminal charges, Keneally
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have investigations and activities that will be coming
in other parts of the world that I can&#8217;t comment on right now,&#8221;
she said. &lt;/p&gt;

former chairman of UBS AG&#8217;s Americas unit, talked about U.S.
banking regulation and the market outlook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, agreed to
sell its customer-care outsourcing business to Synnex Corp. (SNX) for
$505 million to focus on more profitable investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synnex will pay $430 million in cash and $75 million in
stock, giving IBM a stake in Synnex, the companies said in
statements yesterday. The unit had $1.3 billion in 2012 sales,
accounting for more than 1 percent of IBM&#8217;s revenue. Synnex
shares jumped to a record intraday price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is getting rid of businesses with lower profit margins
to reach a goal of $20 a share in earnings by 2015, up from
$15.25 last year. The company last year sold its retail-store
systems unit to Toshiba Tec Corp. (6588) for $850 million. IBM has had
talks with Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) about selling its division that
makes standard X86 servers, which have become a commodity item
amid increasing competition, people familiar with the matter
said earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As you look at our strategy, we continue to move our
business and transform our business to the higher-value
spaces,&#8221; said Lori Steele, general manager of IBM Global
Process Services, in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to focus on
software and analytics.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in Armonk, New York, said earlier this
year that it would sell assets to make up for a $1 billion
charge to cut jobs. IBM excluded the charge from its 2013
earnings forecast, saying future divestitures would make up for
the expense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lower Margins &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customer service unit had a gross profit margin of
about 20 percent, IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
said in a presentation to investors earlier this year. That
compares with margins of about 60 percent for newer businesses
like analytics and cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synnex, based in Fremont, California, said the transaction
will add 55 cents in earnings per share in the first 12 months
after it closes the deal. Its shares jumped more than 20 percent
to $57.59 at the close in New York, an all-time high. IBM rose
2.2 percent to $190.70. &lt;/p&gt;

So Why Didn't Ballmer Build Any of It?</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;(Corrects spelling of Microsoft spokesman's name in 6th paragraph.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 22, 2000, a few months after Steve Ballmer took over as CEO of Microsoft, the company summoned several hundred reporters and analysts to a conference center at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Ballmer, under pressure from a U.S. antitrust case and super-hot dot-com rivals, was set to unveil his company's vision for the future of computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat in a packed room as Microsoft held a daylong series of sessions during which the company announced what it called the .NET strategy. To regain its place within the vanguard of personal computing, Ballmer's Microsoft promised to deliver an interconnected set of Web services that could serve up relevant information to users across multiple devices and let them share with family, friends and co-workers. In a statement then, Ballmer said Microsoft would create a "unified platform through which devices and services cooperate with each other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft filmed a bunch of concept videos to illustrate its product ideas. You can watch an edited version of the videos at the top of this post. Cheesiness aside, it's pretty spot-on, no? There's personalized content for each family member synchronized across PCs, televisions, tablets, mobile phones and cars; location-aware devices that tell you when friends are nearby; photo-sharing; voice controls -- all years before Facebook, Foursquare, or Apple's iCloud and Siri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired Neil Moge from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to lead a London-based team
overseeing investments for insurers amid an expansion of asset
management in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moge was named executive director and head of insurance
portfolio management for Europe, the Middle East and Africa,
according to a memo last month from Mike Siegel, global head of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s insurance asset management unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, and
No. 1 JPMorgan are among firms vying to manage money for
insurance companies facing pressure from low bond yields and new
regulation. New York-based Goldman Sachs manages $133 billion
for insurance clients, according to June 30 figures on the
company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Neil will play an integral role as we continue to expand
our insurance business in Europe and the United Kingdom,&#8221;
Siegel said in the memo. &#8220;Neil has an extensive background in
investment management for insurance companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moge had been an executive director at New York-based
JPMorgan&#8217;s global insurance solutions team, where he managed
client relationships. Prior to joining JPMorgan, he was an
investment director at RSA Insurance Group Plc and also held
money-management roles at Axa SA and Prudential Plc&#8217;s MG
business, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will report to John Melvin, chief investment officer of
the insurance asset management unit, and Iain Lindsay, co-head
of global fixed income portfolio management. Moge has a
bachelor&#8217;s degree in history and a master&#8217;s in medieval studies
from the University of Bristol in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s asset management unit in June announced the
hiring in London of Prashant Sharma from Goldman Sachs as head
of international fixed-income investments for insurance clients.
Kristen Chambers, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment on the departure. She said the company has about $90
billion in assets under management at the global insurance
solutions business. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Mike Cohen and Paul Burkhardt" date="Sep 11, 2013 11:19 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-11/exxon-says-s-african-oil-law-changes-to-deter-investment.html"><headline>Exxon Says S. African Oil-Law Changes to Deter Investment</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) and other energy companies operating in South Africa
said planned changes to mineral and energy laws lack clarity and
will deter investment in the continent&#8217;s largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to the 2002 Mineral and Petroleum Resources
Development Act, being processed by parliament, would give the
state an unspecified free stake in all new oil and gas ventures
and the right to name two directors to their boards. The state
would be able to force mine operators to process some output
locally and declare some minerals strategic to secure supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes &#8220;may significantly impact on the ability of
investors to continue exploration in South Africa,&#8221; Russ
Berkoben, president of Exxon&#8217;s local unit, told lawmakers in
Cape Town today. The government &#8220;is sending a message to
investors that their high-risk investment will have a much lower
reward. A lot of work has to be done.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa, closed to foreign investment until apartheid
ended in 1994, is seeking to develop its oil resources to boost
and diversify an economy with a 25.6 percent unemployment rate.
While Irving, Texas-based Exxon and Shell have stakes in
offshore blocks, extraction is yet to take off. The country
imports 70 percent of its oil needs, processing the remainder of
its fuels from coal and gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Excessive Discretion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliament&#8217;s mineral resources committee began four days of
public hearings on the draft bill today. On July 30, officials
from the Department of Mineral Resources told lawmakers they
were winning over business to the new laws and they didn&#8217;t
expect the regulations to hurt investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell said the proposed bill gives the mineral resources
minister excessive regulatory discretion and doesn&#8217;t clarify the
size of stake the state intends to take in new energy ventures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For a country to attract investment in the exploration of
oil and gas, the financial risks need to be balanced with stable
and transparent legislation that provides benefits to investors
and meets the country&#8217;s aspirations,&#8221; The Hague-based Shell
said in its submission. The bill&#8217;s deficiencies &#8220;could lead to
significant delays in planned investment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marek Ranoszek, managing director of Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. (APC)&#8217;s South African unit, told lawmakers the draft law failed
to protect the rights and expectations of mineral permit holders
and may lead investors to reconsider plans for oil and gas
exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wider Deficit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The potential costs to the country in terms of job
creation, energy security, energy diversification and revenue to
the fiscus will be in the order of billions of rands,&#8221; Ranoszek
said. Johannesburg-based Sasol Ltd. (SOL), the world&#8217;s largest
producer of motor fuel from coal, several other energy companies
and business lobby groups also rejected the bill on the grounds
that it&#8217;s unclear and would hamper investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa relies on foreign capital to fund its current-account deficit, which widened to 6.5 percent of gross domestic
product last quarter as a weaker rand failed to damp imports and
boost exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft law has also drawn objections from mining
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo American Plc, the largest investor in South African
mining, and Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP), the world&#8217;s second-largest platinum producer, said in written submissions that the
bill introduced legislative uncertainty and would fail to
achieve its aims of encouraging local processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legal Obligations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measures may also flout South Africa&#8217;s international
legal obligations, said London-based Anglo American, which is
due to address the committee on Sept. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fund-management companies Allan Gray Ltd. and Sanlam
Investment Management, both based in Cape Town, said many of the
law&#8217;s provisions would discourage investment in mining and
energy at a time when resources companies are struggling
worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stagnating economies have eroded demand for commodities
from metals to fuels, sending the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Spot
Index (SPGSCI) of 24 raw materials down 4.8 percent in the past 12
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provisions in the bill aimed at encouraging local mineral
processing may lead to the construction of unviable plants,
while restraints on exports would undermine businesses&#8217; ability
to reap maximum revenue, Allan Gray said in its submission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., the state power company, said coal
should be declared a strategic mineral and exports of some
grades should only be permitted after being offered to domestic
energy producers at a cost that provided for &#8220;fair returns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eskom also urged lawmakers to ensure it and other domestic
utilities were consulted prior to the awarding, granting and
renewal of coal exploration and mining licenses, and they had
first right of refusal on forfeited exploration rights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), whose $186.60 share price and 2.6 percent loss in 2013
combined to restrain the Dow Jones Industrial Average more than
any other stock, is about to have its influence diluted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest seller of computer services will see
its proportion in the gauge cut to 7.9 percent from 9.4 percent
when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Visa Inc. (V) and Nike Inc. (NKE) are added
this month. Goldman and Visa, at $165.14 and $184.59, become the
second- and third-most influential members of the Dow, which is
weighted according to stock price rather than market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing IBM&#8217;s influence was part of the rationale for
picking Goldman, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, and
Visa, the largest payment network, according to David Blitzer,
chairman of the SP Dow Jones index committee, which announced
the actions yesterday. Had they been in the gauge all year, the
Dow would be up 17.3 percent instead of 15.9 percent, data based
on yesterday&#8217;s prices compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s sway over the Dow has been &#8220;reason enough not to
consider it a good reflection of the stock market,&#8221; according
to Mark Luschini, the Philadelphia-based chief investment
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which oversees $58
billion. &#8220;On certain days I&#8217;ll walk out, and I&#8217;ll know to the
right of the decimal where the SP 500 index closed. But I won&#8217;t
know if the Dow Jones industrial average is above 15,000.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the nation&#8217;s largest bank by assets, is easing mortgage lending standards in housing markets hard hit by the crash where prices are surging. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank lowered some down payment requirements in Florida, Nevada, Arizona and Michigan because they will &#8220;no longer be considered distressed states,&#8221; it informed smaller lenders it buys loans from in July. The second-largest U.S. mortgage lender also loosened underwriting requirements for a refinancing program for Federal Housing Administration borrowers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the economy rebounds and home values climb at about the fastest pace since 2006, lenders including the largest, Wells Fargo (WFC)  Co., JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp. (BAC), and mortgage insurers are easing the tightest credit conditions in two decades, lifting restrictions put in place after the worst real estate bust since the Great Depression. Banks are being forced to compete harder for customers after a spike in borrowing costs from near-record lows slowed refinancing by more than 70 percent and curbed what had been record profits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Historically, you make underwriting as tough as possible when people are lined up at the door and when the lines go away, you start loosening underwriting to get people back,&#8221; said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fed Survey &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 10 percent of banks reported they loosened standards on &#8220;prime&#8221; or low-risk residential loans in recent months, according to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s July survey of senior loan officers. The average FICO score for closed loans fell to 737 in July, the lowest level since at least August 2011, according to data compiled by Pleasanton, California-based Ellie Mae. Borrowers loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios also increased from May, signaling lenders are willing to accept more risk to maintain volume. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, which originated about 1 in 4 U.S. home loans in the first half of the year, has relaxed certain credit standards and is requiring borrowers to put up less equity to buy high-priced homes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based bank began, on July 13, to offer nonconforming loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 85 percent, up from 80 percent, according to Tom Goyda, a bank spokesman. That means borrowers have to come up with less equity to get financing. The terms on the loans, which are too large for purchase by Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac, apply for new home purchases and refinancing, and don&#8217;t require mortgage insurance, Goyda said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Total Picture&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Getting approved for a home loan hinges on a borrower&#8217;s total financial picture,&#8221; Goyda said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We are always evaluating our credit standards in light of market conditions and trends.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goyda declined to provide further details on where Wells Fargo has eased underwriting restrictions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan removed a minimum 640 credit score requirement for the FHA&#8217;s streamlined refinancing program in May, enabling more borrowers to get new home loans at lower interest rates, according to spokeswoman Amy Bonitatibus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banks are trying to lure more borrowers as mortgage applications plunged last week to a five-year low. Refinancing dropped more than 20 percent, the lowest since June 2009. The industry benefitted from record profit margins last year, when refinancing accounted for 76 percent of last year&#8217;s $1.75 trillion in loan originations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told investors in July that rising interest rates could trigger a &#8220;dramatic reduction&#8221; in the bank&#8217;s mortgage profits after mortgage fees and related revenue at the bank dropped 20 percent to $1.82 billion in the second quarter, compared with $2.27 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Eliminating Jobs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;An increase in lending for home purchases won&#8217;t be enough to replace a drop in refinancings, JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said in a presentation at an investor conference this week. The bank&#8217;s pretax-profit margins and income on mortgage lending will be &#8220;slightly negative&#8221; in the third and fourth quarters as the firm takes time to adjust its fixed costs. The firm is eliminating as many as 19,000 jobs in its mortgage and community-banking divisions through 2014 as Dimon trims expenses, JPMorgan said in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continuously review our lending standards to help families buy homes they can afford over the long term,&#8221; Bonitatibus said. &#8220;We have responded to improvements in the housing market by removing some additional requirements we put in place in hard-hit markets during the crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America has been easing underwriting standards in markets it designated as &#8220;soft&#8221; in certain parts of the country as the housing market improves, said Kris Yamamoto, a company spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Loosened Credit &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated the central bank may slow its purchases of government and mortgage bonds, the average rate on 30-year home loans has risen more than 1.2 percentage points after hitting a low of 3.35 percent in May, according to Freddie Mac data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Loosened mortgage credit would offset some of the impact of rising rates, which make homeownership more expensive,&#8221; said Jed Kolko, chief economist at San Francisco-based property-listings service Trulia Inc. &#8220;Because rates are rising, demand for refinancing has plummeted and some banks have suggested that would open up capacity for home-purchase lending.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. homeownership rate fell to 65 percent this year, its lowest level since 1995, according to Census Bureau data, as fewer people were able to qualify for a mortgage. Banks are starting to ease credit with home prices across the country rising 12.1 percent in June from a year earlier, according to the SP/Case-Shiller index of 20 cities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cash Buyers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prices in some of the hardest-hit markets have rebounded faster. Las Vegas gained 24.9 percent, Phoenix showed a 19.8 percent increase, Detroit rose 16.4 percent Miami-area values were up 14.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms such as Blackstone Group LP building rental businesses and other cash buyers have helped lift house prices in cities showing some of the biggest gains. Their mass purchases have made it more difficult for borrowers seeking mortgage financing, as they compete for a shrinking supply of properties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Florida, lenders including JPMorgan and mortgage insurers this year removed many of the additional requirements that had helped to push the share of cash buyers above 45 percent in the second quarter, said Rob Nunziata, co-Chief Executive Officer of FBC Mortgage LLC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Florida Downpayments &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan decreased the minimum downpayment on mortgages made in Florida for primary residences to 5 percent from 10 percent and down to 10 percent from 20 percent for second homes, according to Bonitatibus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those restrictions have handcuffed Florida buyers,&#8221; Nunziata said, also referring to mortgage insurers and banks. &#8220;When you had restrictions telling buyers they had to put down an extra 5 to 15 percent in some cases, that eliminated a lot of potential buyers from qualifying.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mortgage insurers that restricted coverage during the housing crisis, including MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) and Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW), have eased underwriting guidelines this year as the market improves. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the crash, borrowers in California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona needed a credit score of at least 700 and could have a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 90 percent to qualify for mortgage insurance with MGIC, said Sal Miosi, vice president of marketing at the Milwaukee-based firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Added Complexity &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, the third-largest U.S. mortgage insurer limited rules so borrowers whose loans qualify for purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac with credit scores of at least 620 and a loan-to-value ratio up to 97 percent can get insurance coverage, according to Miosi. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additional restrictions &#8220;weren&#8217;t contributing to the credit quality, they were just adding to complexity,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Genworth Financial Inc., the fourth-largest mortgage insurer in the country, broadened credit guidelines in the first quarter of 2013 and reduced pricing, Rohit Gupta, chief executive officer of the company&#8217;s U.S. mortgage insurance business, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banks are still taking a cautious credit posture, according to David H. Stevens, CEO of the Mortgage Bankers Association. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re starting from a very narrow market, so any expansion wouldn&#8217;t go near the reckless lending practices of the early 2000s,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re in the most conservative overall credit environment for housing finance that we&#8217;ve seen in almost three decades.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Risky Lending &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A decrease in access for interest-only loans and those with terms longer than 30 years led to a slide in a Mortgage Bankers Association measure of loan availability last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those types of loans are less attractive to banks as planned rules created by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to curb abusive or risky lending kick in next year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Credit has been loosening faster for the wealthiest Americans, since bigger loans are mostly put on bank balance sheets instead of packaged into securities that get sold to investors. Applications for jumbo mortgages of at least $729,000 increased 59 percent in the first four months from a year earlier. Loans of less than $150,000, fell by 2.1 percent, according to the MBA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration has been pushing to expand homeownership opportunities as families rebuilding from the recession face some of the tightest underwriting standards. The president last month introduced new housing reforms targeted at middle-class communities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Borrowers with foreclosures or bankruptcies resulting from a job or income loss can now finance a home purchase with an FHA mortgage as long as they demonstrate 12 months of timely payments, complete housing counseling and otherwise qualify. The FHA, a government mortgage insurer, previously required a three-year wait. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 7 million houses have been sold for a loss or lost to foreclosure since 2007, according to RealtyTrac. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The reaction post-bust was a bit extreme but we&#8217;re returning to more prudent underwriting standards,&#8221; said Erin Lantz, director of mortgages at Seattle-based Zillow Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Heather Perlberg in New York at perlberg@bloomberg.net Prashant Gopal in Boston at pgopal2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Rob Urban at robprag@bloomberg.net; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold will extend a drop into 2014
as the U.S. Federal Reserve tapers stimulus, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said, forecasting that a decision by the central bank to
start reducing bond-buying next week may spur renewed selling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reduction of asset purchases may be the catalyst that
pushes gold prices lower, analysts including Jeffrey Currie and
Damien Courvalin wrote in a report today. Goldman&#8217;s economists
expect that policy makers will curb quantitative easing at the
Sept. 17-18 meeting as the economy improves, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold slumped 19 percent in 2013 after rallying for 12 years
as investors sold the metal at record pace from exchange-traded
products on prospects for a global recovery. The Fed will pare
the $85 billion monthly bond-buying at the meeting, according to
a Bloomberg survey on Sept. 6, backing away from the stimulus
program used by the central bank to revive the largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gold prices will decline into 2014 on the back of an
acceleration in U.S. activity and a less accommodative monetary-policy stance,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;The September FOMC
meeting, where our economists expect a tapering of QE3, could
prove the catalyst to push gold prices lower.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold futures on the Comex, which touched a record $1,923.70
an ounce two years ago, traded at $1,362.10 by 9:27 a.m. in New
York. Goldman kept its three- and six-month targets at $1,300 an
ounce, while saying that the approach of the U.S. debt ceiling
may limit declines until the borrowing threshold is raised by
October. The bank&#8217;s 12-month target is $1,175. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lower Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale SA, Citigroup Inc., ABN Amro Group NV and
Macquarie Group Ltd. are among banks predicting lower prices in
2014 as the global economy recovers and inflation fails to
accelerate. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp. say
bullion may be bottoming as the rout boosts demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors sold 683.3 metric tons of gold from ETPs this
year, reducing holdings by more than $56 billion to 1,948.6
tons, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The assets have
dropped every month this year after peaking at 2,632.5 tons in
December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold should drop to $1,200 by about the end of the year on
sales from ETPs and a reduced likelihood of a U.S. military
action against Syria, Societe Generale said in a report e-mailed
yesterday. President Barack Obama said yesterday that he has
asked Congress to delay a vote authorizing a strike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Open Market Committee will reduce Treasury
purchases to $35 billion a month from $45 billion, while
maintaining mortgage-bond buying at $40 billion, according to
the median of 34 responses in the Bloomberg survey. That pace
was unchanged from an Aug. 9-13 poll, as was a projection that
the program will end in June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest energy company, was charged with illegally dumping more
than 50,000 gallons (189,000 liters) of wastewater at a shale-gas drilling site in Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon unit XTO Energy Inc. discharged the water from waste
tanks at the Marquandt well site in Lycoming County in 2010,
according to a statement on the website of Pennsylvania&#8217;s
attorney general. The pollution was found during an unannounced
visit by the state&#8217;s Department of Environmental Protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspectors discovered a plug removed from a tank,
allowing the wastewater to run onto the ground, polluting a
nearby stream. XTO was ordered to remove 3,000 tons of soil to
clean up the area. Wastewater discharged from natural-gas wells
can contain chlorides, barium, strontium and aluminum, the
attorney general&#8217;s statement showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Criminal charges are unwarranted and legally baseless,&#8221;
the XTO unit said yesterday in a statement posted on its
website. &#8220;There was no intentional, reckless or negligent
misconduct by XTO.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania has become one of the biggest gas-producing
states in the past five years as explorers drill the Marcellus
shale, a rock formation stretching across the northeast U.S.
that holds 24 percent of the nation&#8217;s shale gas reserves,
according to the Energy Information Administration. Exxon agreed
to buy XTO in 2009 for $34.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XTO was charged with five counts of unlawful conduct under
the Clean Streams Law and three counts under the Solid Waste
Management Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legal Risks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Charging XTO under these circumstances could discourage
good environmental practices,&#8221; the company said in its
statement. &#8220;This action tells oil and gas operators that
setting up infrastructure to recycle produced water exposes them
to the risk of significant legal and financial penalties should
a small release occur.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it &#8220;acted quickly&#8221; to clean up the spill
and there was &#8220;no lasting environmental impact,&#8221; according to
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XTO said it agreed to pay &#8220;reasonable civil penalties&#8221; in
a July 18, 2013 settlement with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the Department of Justice. It also agreed
to recycle at least half its drilling wastewater, according to
the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libyan crude output losses and the
possible escalation of unrest in Syria provide an option to buy
front-month futures, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protests at oil fields and ports in Libya have reduced
supply from the country to the lowest since October 2011,
prompting Goldman to halve its forecast for production this
month to 500,000 barrels a day, the bank said in a report today.
With Iraq&#8217;s output forecast also revised down by 100,000 barrels
a day, this will cause a shortage in spare capacity from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries this month,
according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium of front-month Brent to the second, or
backwardation, widened to $1.90 a barrel on Sept. 3, the most
since November 2012. This structure, allied to the lack of
supply, gives investors with an opportunity to double their
returns by buying prompt futures and holding on to them, said
Jeffrey Currie, a New York-based analyst at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With currently high levels of backwardation in oil,
investors can earn returns even when prices are expected to be
flat, or even fall slightly, by buying deferred oil contracts
and waiting as they approach expiry,&#8221; Currie said. &#8220;Rolling
the front-end over the course of one year would generate nearly
twice the return of buying one year out and holding to
maturity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk to oil output remains greater in Libya than in
Syria, with the loss to OPEC&#8217;s spare capacity occurring at the
same time as petroleum inventories in members of the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development are set
to fall to their lowest levels since 2004, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shortage is driving Goldman&#8217;s forecast for Brent to
trade at $115 a barrel in the near-term. The October contract
was at $112.31 as of 10:07 a.m. London time on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Longer-term the tightness in supply will
probably ease with the bank predicting crude to drop to $105 a
barrel, barring any spillover of hostilities in Syria to
neighboring countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
12-month forecast for commodity returns, predicting a decline in
precious metals, agriculture and energy. The bank kept its
neutral recommendation on raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index will
drop 2 percent, compared with an increase of 0.1 percent
expected in July, analysts led by New York-based Jeffrey Currie
said in a report today. Energy, with a 73.5 percent weighting,
will probably fall 1 percent, while precious metals slide 15
percent and agriculture declines 7 percent, they said.
Industrial metals may increase 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gauge advanced 2.9 percent this year through Sept. 9 on
speculation the U.S. may launch a military strike on Syria in
retaliation for what it said was use of chemical weapons.
President Barack Obama has since asked Congress to postpone a
vote on military action while he pursues a diplomatic solution.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. said Sept. 6 it turned overweight on
commodities because of an improvement in manufacturing, better
demand and more optimism over China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors will probably make more profits buying and
rolling front-end futures, rather than purchasing one year out
and holding to maturity, the analysts said. &#8220;We expect this
strong positive carry to offset these declines, leaving returns
mostly flat over the next year. Accordingly, we are maintaining
our neutral recommendation on commodities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate crude climbed 17 percent this year
to $107.10 a barrel while gold for immediate delivery dropped 18
percent to $1,366.88 an ounce. &lt;/p&gt;

depositors in overseas branches of U.S. banks could be
disadvantaged in the event of a lender&#8217;s collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC board members meeting in Washington yesterday
unanimously voted to adopt a measure responding to U.K.
regulators&#8217; concern that U.S. banks favored domestic depositors
over foreign-based account holders. The agency in February
proposed that overseas branches of the U.S. companies make an
FDIC-estimated $1 trillion in deposits payable in either
country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the FDIC&#8217;s chief concerns was writing a rule that
walls off the insurance fund from non-U.S. deposits, so the
final proposal maintained a clear barrier. The adopted version
was virtually unchanged from the February proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule is a revision of the agency&#8217;s definition of
&#8220;insured deposit&#8221; to make overseas accounts of corporate
customers also payable in the U.S. It puts foreign depositors
who aren&#8217;t covered by FDIC insurance in line ahead of general
creditors in a liquidation. About 40 percent of such deposits
are in the U.K., according to the FDIC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a joint letter to the agency in April, officials from
Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS) and State
Street Corp. (STT) said that instead of forcing banks to make the
deposits dually payable, the FDIC could just give the same
treatment to all global deposits of a bank without extending
insurance protection -- an effort they acknowledged would have
required more rulemaking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman Martin Gruenberg said in February that the rule
would bring U.S. banks into compliance in the U.K. without
requiring the institutions to turn their branches into
subsidiaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Clearing House Association LLC, a New York-based trade
group that represents large U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp., described the restructuring of
foreign-branch deposit agreements as &#8220;administratively
challenging&#8221; and costly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks are likely to make their foreign branch deposits
dually payable only when forced to do so by a foreign regulator
because of &#8220;negative consequences,&#8221; the Clearing House
Association said in a letter to the FDIC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hedge Funds No Systemic Risk to Australia Financial System &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds pose no systemic risk to Australia&#8217;s financial
system, the Australian Securities  Investments Commission said
in a report released on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the report, ASIC identified hedge funds that &#8220;manage
only a small share of Australia&#8217;s A$2.1 trillion managed funds
industry with more than half of these holding less than A$50
million each.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Australian hedge funds do not currently appear to pose a
systemic risk to the Australian financial system,&#8221; the survey
indicates. Listed equities represent surveyed hedge fund
managers&#8217; greatest asset exposure, with 32 percent being in
Australian-listed shares, according to the website report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU Lawyers Clash Over Legality of 11-Nation Transaction-Tax Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union lawyers are clashing over whether a proposed
11-nation financial-transaction tax is legal under the 28-nation
bloc&#8217;s governing treaties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the Council of the European Union, which
represents the executives of EU member states and makes laws in
tandem with the EU Parliament, say the tax plan goes too far and
would discriminate against countries that don&#8217;t participate,
according to an EU document. The legal service of the European
Commission, which proposed the levy, stands by the plan and will
offer a rebuttal, said Emer Traynor, a spokeswoman for EU Tax
Commissioner Algirdas Semeta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU has proposed a broad-based tax on stocks, bonds,
derivatives and other trades that could be collected worldwide
by France, Germany and nine other EU nations that have so far
signed up. The plan would charge a 0.1 percent rate for stock
and bond trades and 0.01 percent for derivatives transactions,
with some exemptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feud centers on proposals for worldwide tax collection
on trades involving a bank or financial security based in one of
the participating nations. The council&#8217;s Sept. 6 legal opinion
said the EU can&#8217;t justify such an aggressive approach just to
keep traders from moving outside the participating-nations zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission&#8217;s plan exceeds the jurisdiction of
participating nations, the council opinion said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council legal opinion was reported earlier by Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Boosts Bank&#8217;s Legal Reserves for Potential Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets,
increased its litigation reserve by more than $1.5 billion in
the third quarter to help cover potential legal claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said Sept. 9 at the
Barclays Global Financial Services Conference in New York that
the &#8220;reserves covers a number of different matters,&#8221; and
there&#8217;s &#8220;been a crescendo of activity in past weeks,&#8221; to which
the bank is reacting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan added 3,000 employees to bolster internal controls
and compliance as it grapples with multiple investigations and
regulatory orders, Lake said. The U.S. is conducting criminal
investigations linked to the bank&#8217;s energy-trading and mortgage-backed securities businesses as well as separate probes of its
anti-money-laundering safeguards, foreclosures, credit-card
collections and a record trading loss in London last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank named two new members to its board and announced
expanded powers for lead director Lee R. Raymond to help bolster
risk oversight, according to a company statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Probes Gold Fields on South African Black-Ownership Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) said the U.S. Securities Exchange
Commission is investigating an ownership deal that helped the
South African producer of the metal secure a mining license. The
shares fell to the lowest in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is probing the transaction associated with the
grant of the mining permit for the South Deep operation near
Westonaria, 55 kilometers (34 miles) southwest of Johannesburg,
Gold Fields said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Gold Fields agreed to issue 600,000 shares to a
black-owned group and allowed it to buy 10 percent of South
Deep. South African law requires mining companies to sell at
least 26 percent of their local operations to black citizens,
with transactions that benefit workers, communities near sites
and trusts for the poor being favored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the company denied a news report by
Johannesburg-based Carte Blanche that the deal benefited
influential people who helped it win the license needed to
continue operating the mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the early stage of this investigation, it is not
possible to estimate reliably what effect the outcome this
investigation, any regulatory findings, and any related
developments may have on the company,&#8221; Gold Fields said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S investors trade Gold Fields stock through American
depositary receipts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deutsche Bank Faces Hearing Over Fired Euribor Traders&#8217; Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) faces a hearing in a lawsuit by four
traders fired over the lender&#8217;s role in the alleged rigging of
interest benchmarks after mandated mediation failed to produce a
settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt labor court will hear arguments today over
whether the four men were wrongfully dismissed by the bank in
February. Another banker, who was the most junior of the group,
reached a settlement with the bank, two people familiar with the
matter said in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators from Canada to Switzerland are investigating
whether more than a dozen lenders, including Deutsche Bank,
colluded to rig benchmark interest rates. Deutsche Bank has
fired at least seven employees over suspected misconduct in
connection with rates. The bank, continental Europe&#8217;s largest by
assets, said in February that while it would fire or suspend
workers that acted inappropriately, it wouldn&#8217;t identify
individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank justified the dismissal of the employees by
saying they had inappropriate communication with a trader the
bank fired at the end of 2011 for trying to rig rates, one of
the people familiar with the matter said in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Roelz, a lawyer for the four traders, declined to
comment on the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traders fired in February were based in Frankfurt and
included two managing directors, two directors and a vice
president, two people with knowledge of the matter said at the
time. Submitting euro interbank offered rates was part of their
responsibilities, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mediation hearing in April didn&#8217;t yield any results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interviews/Hearings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CFTC&#8217;s Gensler Says He Never Received E-Mail Training &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, testified about U.S. transparency laws and his use
of his private e-mail account for communications as part of his
work at the CFTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Ferriero, the archivist of the U.S., former
Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa Jackson, former
Energy Department loan program director Jonathan Silver, and
former U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer Andrew McLaughlin
also testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform
committee in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former securities analyst
extradited to the U.S. from Hong Kong in March pleaded guilty to
his role in an insider trading scheme involving International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s $1.2 billion acquisition of SPSS Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trent Martin, 34, an Australian citizen, entered his plea
to a single count of conspiracy in a hearing today before U.S.
District Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr. in Manhattan. Martin told
Carter that he made about $7,600 from trading on the tip, which
he received from an unidentified attorney working on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I knew my actions were wrong and in violation of the law
and I apologize to the court for my conduct,&#8221; Martin said
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin, who faces as much as five years in prison when he&#8217;s
sentenced on March 14, is cooperating with the government in
hopes of leniency. Carter agreed to a request by lawyers for
both sides that he be allowed to return to Sydney until he&#8217;s
sentenced. Martin will probably face deportation to Australia as
a result of the guilty plea, Carter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin said he received the tip from the lawyer, a close
friend, in June 2009. He shared the information with his
Manhattan roommate, Thomas Conradt, who was a stockbroker.
Conradt passed the information to his co-worker and friend David
Weishaus, who in turn tipped two other brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Securities Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conradt pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy
and two counts of securities fraud. Weishaus has pleaded not
guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin worked at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in the
U.S. and an RBS joint venture in Australia before joining Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604) in September 2011, according to two people
familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified
because they aren&#8217;t authorized to speak about the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority lists a Trent
Martin who left ABN Amro Bank NV in 2009 to work at the Stamford
office of RBS, which participated in ABN Amro&#8217;s takeover in
2007. Martin&#8217;s broker registration at RBS ended in November
2010, Finra documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Martin, 12-cr-00887, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madison Square Garden Co. (MSG), the
sports and entertainment company that owns the namesake arena in
Manhattan, hired JPMorgan Chase  Co. to explore a sale of its
music-TV channel Fuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been approached by certain parties expressing
interest in Fuse and have retained JPMorgan to explore all
strategic alternatives,&#8221; the New York-based company said today
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling Fuse would let the company&#8217;s TV business focus on
its more lucrative sports networks, which broadcast New York
Knicks and Rangers games. Fuse could be worth $300 million to
$400 million in a sale, said Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie
Group, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on MSG shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music channel, which reaches about 64 million
households, competes with networks such as Viacom Inc. (VIAB)&#8217;s MTV and
VH1 and Mark Cuban&#8217;s AXS TV. Fuse charges pay-TV providers about
6 cents per month per customer, according to research firm SNL
Kagan. That&#8217;s far less than what popular sports networks fetch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Madison Square Garden, which also owns real
estate and sports teams, rose 1.6 percent to $55.99 at the close
in New York. The stock has gained 26 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Post reported earlier on the potential sale of
Fuse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sasol Ltd. (SOL), the largest producer of
motor fuel from coal, urged South Africa to say what size stakes
it plans to take in new energy ventures under proposed changes
to the law as a way to reduce industry opposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliament&#8217;s mineral resources committee is holding public
hearings into amendments that would give the state a holding in
new oil and gas projects, a plan that has drawn opposition from
companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t know what the percentage is,&#8221; Johan Thyse,
Sasol&#8217;s head of public policy and regulatory affairs, told
lawmakers today in Cape Town. Concerns may be &#8220;easily
remedied&#8221; by spelling out the maximum stake, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country imports 70 percent of its oil needs, with the
rest produced by processing coal and gas. Shell will soon decide
on whether to invest 4 billion rand ($400 million) to 5 billion
rand in South Africa and is concerned about the proposed changes
to the regulatory regime, Jan Willem Eggink, general manager for
upstream operations in South Africa, told lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell&#8217;s plans include drilling an offshore exploratory well
in the Orange Basin off the country&#8217;s west coast, and onshore
drilling for shale gas in the southern Karoo region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need certainty today on what the rules of the game
are,&#8221; Eggink said. &#8220;We need a fair return on investment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chance of commercial success for exploration projects
is about 10 percent to 30 percent and risks and rewards should
be shared among all participants, Thyse said. Companies spend
typically $10 million to $30 million on offshore seismic data
and $50 million to $100 million on exploration drilling, and
should be able to recoup some of that from the state, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s proposed amendments are to South Africa&#8217;s
2002 Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commodity demand in China, the
world&#8217;s largest user of iron ore, copper and tin, will rebound
through the end of the year as infrastructure projects gather
pace and users restock, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key demand driver is infrastructure and fixed-asset
investment, analyst Julian Zhu told reporters at a briefing in
Singapore today. Steel prices in the world&#8217;s largest producer
were seen higher through the end of December, Zhu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s assessment adds to signs that a slowdown in the
second-largest economy may be ending, lifting the outlook for
commodities from iron ore to base metals. While Premier Li
Keqiang said yesterday that the foundations of a recovery aren&#8217;t
solid, policy makers have signaled that they will defend a 7.5
percent expansion goal for 2013. Bank of America Merrill Lynch
today raised its growth forecast for China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From now till the end of this year, we anticipate China
demand for commodities to continue to recover,&#8221; Zhu said. &#8220;The
current commodities inventory in China is still quite low and
with the further demand rebound, we should see the ongoing
restocking to continue as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities as tracked by the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Index
of 24 raw materials are little changed this year, after
advancing in July and August. Iron ore with 62 percent content
delivered to the Chinese port of Tianjin rose 0.1 percent to
$135.20 a ton today, up from this year&#8217;s low of $110.40 in May,
according to figures from The Steel Index Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Higher Forecast &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data this month showed industrial production beat estimates
and manufacturing resumed growth, signaling that the economy is
strengthening after a two-quarter slowdown. Bank of America
Merrill Lynch said China will grow 7.7 percent in 2013, up from
7.6 percent previously forecast, according to a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are getting more positive, but they&#8217;re not super
bullish, not yet,&#8221; said Zhu &#8220;You&#8217;re going to see further
upside. If you look at the early indicators in September, it
seems like the overall economic activity is picking up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s GDP growth slowed to 7.5 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, extending the longest streak of
sub-8 percent expansion in at least two decades. Li signaled in
July he won&#8217;t tolerate a slowdown beyond 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government used measures from extra spending on
railways to tax cuts to respond to the slowdown. The State
Council is targeting 690 billion yuan ($113 billion) of fixed-asset investment in the railway industry this year, the Beijing
News reported in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steel reinforcement-bar futures ended at 3,713 yuan a
metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange today, after
advancing in August for a third month, the best run of gains
since January 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks will continue to rally as
the bull market in equities moves into a new phase driven by
earnings growth rather than expanding valuations, according to
strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities will produce more moderate returns with lower
volatility in the second phase of the bull market, according to
Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman&#8217;s chief global equity strategist, who
reiterated his bullish stance on stocks. Oppenheimer said in a
March 2012 report that the prospects for returns from equities
versus bonds &#8220;are as good as they have been in a generation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accommodative monetary policies from central banks have
helped extend the bull market in U.S. stocks into a fifth year.
The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index has rallied 150 percent since
March 2009, driven by three rounds of bond purchases by the
Federal Reserve and better-than-forecast earnings by companies.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index has surged 96 percent in the same
period, while the MSCI World Index has climbed 123 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Eighteen months on, we continue to believe the case for
equities remains strong, albeit with returns likely to be more
muted in the months ahead,&#8221; London-based Oppenheimer wrote in a
report dated yesterday. &#8220;The driver from here is likely to be
earnings growth rather than valuation expansion from current
levels, consistent with the growth phase of the equity cycle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s credit risk is lower than
markets are pricing in because the world&#8217;s biggest energy
exporter has strong earnings from oil sales and a low debt
burden in its favor, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contracts, which insure against a default, are 25 basis
points more expensive than the average of 10 developing-nation
peers and should trade at least on par, Clemens Grafe, an
economist at Goldman Sachs in Moscow, said yesterday. Russia&#8217;s
credit-default swaps climbed 44 basis points since May 22 to
180, compared with a 46-basis point increase to 176 for Brazil
and an advance of 51 to 218 for South Africa, all ranked BBB at
Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Fitch Ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors probably haven&#8217;t taken into account Russia&#8217;s
current account surplus, driven by energy exports, while other
nations run deficits, Grafe said. Emerging-market credit default
swaps climbed, indicating rising investor perceptions of risk,
and bonds sold off after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled in May that quantitative easing could be pared
amid signs of an improving U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Russia is obviously the one that has the least problems
on the external front,&#8221; Grafe said by phone yesterday. &#8220;The
market has aligned Russia with the wrong part of the peer group.
Russia certainly should outperform its peers in this
environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oil Boost &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia ran a current account surplus equivalent to 3
percent of gross domestic product at the end of the first
quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Brazil had a 3 percent
deficit in the period, while South Africa ran a 5.8 percent
shortfall. Russia has $510.8 billion of gold and foreign-currency reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude jumped to $116.61 per barrel in London on Aug. 28,
the highest since 2008, on concern a U.S. strike on Syria would
lead to supply disruptions in the Middle East. The oil and
natural gas industries contribute about 50 percent of Russia&#8217;s
government revenue. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to
meet counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Geneva today to discuss a
Russian initiative to place Syria&#8217;s chemical weapons arsenal
under international control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Historically Russia&#8217;s credit risk traded in line with the
peer group average,&#8221; Grafe said. &#8220;It has the lowest external
financial requirements out of all emerging markets with the
exception probably of China.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Auction Sell-out &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia is &#8220;robust and protected&#8221; given only 4 percent of
its foreign debt is due in the &#8220;short-term&#8221; and the total is
equivalent to 31 percent of GDP, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote
in a report dated June 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry sold out two auctions of ruble bonds
yesterday as the possibility of U.S. military action subsided,
boosting investor appetite for riskier assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 9, Russia sold the most foreign debt this year
among emerging-market nations with a $7 billion placement in
dollars and euros. Investor demand was more than double the
amount offered, Andrey Solovyev, the head of debt capital
markets at VTB Capital, which arranged the sale with five other
banks, said Sept. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s CDS need to rise a further 15 basis points to be a
tempting investment because of the country&#8217;s exposure to oil-price movements, Konstantin Artemov, who manages $500 million of
fixed-income funds at Raiffeisen Capital in Moscow, said by
phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on Russia&#8217;s 2042 dollar notes dropped 11 basis
points today to 5.737 percent by 11:37 a.m. in Moscow. The extra
yield investors demand to hold Russia&#8217;s dollar debt rather than
Treasuries fell one basis point to 237, compared with a gain of
one basis point to 237 for Brazil, according to JPMorgan
indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key Categories &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s analysts compared Russia against countries rated
BBB on 11 macroeconomic, fiscal and structural criteria, which
Fitch uses in its sovereign credit rating model. Russia ranked
in the middle of the peer group based on all variables, and
above average for key categories the market is focusing on,
including external and fiscal balances, Grafe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This mispricing will disappear in the next few months,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visitors to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, leave appreciative notes on a glass wall near the entrance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thanks Alice!&#8221; reads one. &#8220;Merci Alice Walton, pour la vision!&#8221; reads another. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) heiress Alice Walton founded Crystal Bridges in 2011 in a wooded ravine next to her childhood home, supplying dozens of paintings from her personal collection. Bankrolled by more than $1 billion in donations from her family, the museum attests to the Waltons&#8217; generosity and vast wealth. It&#8217;s also a monument to their skill at preserving that fortune across generations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;America&#8217;s richest family, worth more than $100 billion, has exploited a variety of legal loopholes to avoid the estate tax, according to court records and Internal Revenue Service filings obtained through public-records requests. The Waltons&#8217; example highlights how billionaires deftly bypass a tax intended to make sure that the nation&#8217;s wealthiest contribute their share to government rather than perpetuate dynastic wealth, a notion of fairness voiced by supporters of the estate tax like Warren Buffett and William Gates Sr. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Estate and gift taxes raised only about $14 billion last year. That&#8217;s about 1 percent of the $1.2 trillion passed down in America each year, mostly by the very rich, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers estimated in a December blog post on Reuters.com. The contrast suggests &#8220;our estate tax system is broken,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Unbelievable&#8217; Savings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alice Walton&#8217;s mother and brother poured more than $9 billion into trusts since 2003 that fund charitable projects like Crystal Bridges and are also designed to protect gifts to heirs from taxation. Another Walton pioneered a tax-avoidance maneuver that is now widely used by U.S. billionaires. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I hate to say it, but the very rich pay very little in gift and estate tax,&#8221; said Jerome Hesch, a lawyer at Berger Singerman LLP in Miami who reviewed some of the Walton family&#8217;s trust filings for Bloomberg. &#8220;At the Waltons&#8217; numbers, the savings are unbelievable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A family spokesman, Lance Morgan, said in a statement that &#8220;any charitable or estate planning practices employed by the Walton family are broadly available and commonly used.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan represents the branch of the family that includes Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton&#8217;s three surviving children and eight grandchildren. Their Wal-Mart stake is worth enough to fill a large backyard swimming pool with solid gold. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Amassing Billions &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spurred by historically low interest rates that magnify the tax savings, the richest Americans have amassed at least $20 billion in trusts like those used by the Waltons. They include Elaine Marshall, the Koch Industries Inc. director, and Fidelity mutual funds&#8217; Johnson family. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 40 percent tax is levied at death on estates of more than $5.25 million for an individual or $10.5 million for a couple. Total lifetime giving to heirs that exceeds those thresholds is also taxed at 40 percent, preventing people from avoiding the estate tax through early handouts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Closing just two estate tax loopholes -- ones that the Waltons appear to have used -- would raise more than $2 billion annually over the next decade, according to Treasury Department estimates. That doesn&#8217;t count taxes lost to the type of charitable trusts the Waltons used to fund projects like the museum; the department hasn&#8217;t estimated that cost. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;More Unfair&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a sign of just how much money is at stake, the IRS is trying to collect as much as $2.8 billion from the estate of the Michigan industrialist William M. Davidson, according to a petition filed by Davidson&#8217;s family in U.S. Tax Court in June. The IRS is challenging the validity of some of Davidson&#8217;s maneuvers, which were different from the ones the Waltons use. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The whole tax structure since I came to Congress actually has gotten more and more unfair,&#8221; said James McDermott, a Washington Democrat who&#8217;s been in the House since 1989 and has sponsored unsuccessful bills to close estate-tax loopholes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Artful Dodgers: From Hedge Fund Managers to Retail Magnates to Superstar Athletes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guarding the Waltons&#8217; wealth as it passes from one generation to the next is the task of a handful of staffers laboring in an unmarked suite in Bentonville, above a bike shop called Phat Tire. Walton Enterprises LLC manages the world&#8217;s biggest fortune in a nondescript office that even employees of the coffee shop next door have never heard of. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The family&#8217;s estate-planning efforts are well shielded from public view. The wills of Alice&#8217;s parents, Sam and Helen, on file in an Arkansas probate court, reveal little about their financial arrangements. That of her brother John, who died in 2005, was sealed by a Wyoming judge. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Waltons&#8217; Model &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, professional planners have sometimes held up the Waltons as a model. Patriarch Sam Walton, who founded Wal-Mart in Bentonville, cultivated an image as a regular guy from Oklahoma who enjoyed quail hunting and drove a beat-up Ford pick-up truck. He also showed unusual foresight about estate planning. &lt;/p&gt;

Ortakligi. The new office will allow the firm to advise clients
on cross-border private equity and corporate-backed MA
transactions throughout the Central and Eastern Europe, Middle

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Istanbul has become a hub for sophisticated MA and
private equity activity in the region as multinational companies
and private equity firms are attracted to the increasingly
active leadership role that Turkey plays economically in the
region,&#8221; Ted Cominos, a partner and chairman of Edwards
Wildman&#8217;s international private equity practice group said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards Wildman will work in collaboration with Ismen

&lt;h2&gt;Legal Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lehman Recovery Seen as Justifying $2 Billion Bankruptcy Bill &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvey Miller, the lawyer guiding Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. through the biggest-ever U.S. bankruptcy, reflected on how
his client&#8217;s collapse five years ago went from unthinkable to
inevitable in an interview near the offices of his law firm, New
York-based Weil, Gotshal  Manges LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s demise &#8220;ignited a worldwide conflagration that
almost brought down the global financial system,&#8221; said Miller,
who filed the Chapter 11 petition at 2 a.m. on Sept. 15, 2008,
in New York after the bank failed to win U.S. government aid or
attract a buyer. &#8220;The consequences were unknown,&#8221; Bloomberg
News&#8217; Erik Larson reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years later, Miller takes credit for helping fend off
some creditors&#8217; liquidation demands and instead turning the
remains of one of the biggest failures of the financial crisis
into a going concern. In the process, the Lehman estate has paid
more than $2 billion in fees and expenses to professionals like
him for that work, dwarfing the previous record of $757 million
in Enron Corp.&#8217;s bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exchange for that eye-popping payday, approved by the
judge in charge of the case, Lehman creditors are poised to get
18 cents on the dollar by 2016, from an estate valued at $65
billion, according to a liquidation plan approved in December
2011. Miller, 80, estimated that recovery may rise to as much as
22 cents as the value of Lehman&#8217;s assets increases over the next
three years to about $80 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His estimate is a &#8220;somewhat educated guess,&#8221; Miller said.
&#8220;I am sure debt traders have their own projected recovery
valuations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which listed $613 billion in debt when it filed, is
scheduled to pay out $14 billion to creditors on Oct. 3,
bringing total distributions to $43 billion since the Chapter 11
plan was approved, according to court records and Miller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller&#8217;s firm, which also worked on the Enron case, has
made almost $500 million since the Lehman bankruptcy started,
and more than $600 million has gone to the restructuring company
Alvarez  Marsal Inc., whose employees ran Lehman after the
collapse and are still unwinding complex derivatives contracts
to generate cash for creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-bk-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Law Firm Management &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Managing Partners Pessimistic About Profit, Not Hiring &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law firm managing partner confidence levels dipped in the
third quarter of 2013, according to a survey by the Citi Private
Bank, which cast the firm leaders as forecasting flat profit
growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey of firm leaders, which included responses from
48 of the wealthiest 200 American law firms, indicated that the
firm leaders had diminished expectations for the legal industry
and the wider economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It validated the revised forecast we made after we
reviewed the first half-year numbers,&#8221; Dan DiPietro, chairman
of Citi Private Bank&#8217;s Law Firm Group, said in a telephone
interview, &#8220;from low single-digit profits to flat.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand expectations for legal work also declined, though
the managing partners reported an increase in outlook for equity
partner and associate hiring, according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DiPietro said the apparent contradiction could be explained
by managers looking to hire qualified mid-level associates and
equity partners who would bring a book of business with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey also showed managing partners as confident about
managing expenses but concerned about discounted fee requests
from clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Government Lawyer Joins Goodwin&#8217;s Securities Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter LLP announced that Derek A. Cohen has
joined the firm&#8217;s New York office as a partner in the securities
litigation and white-collar defense group. Cohen was most
recently a deputy chief of the fraud section for the Justice
Department&#8217;s criminal division and deputy director of the
Deepwater Horizon Task Force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Goodwin, Cohen will focus on white-collar criminal
investigations and prosecutions, regulatory inquiries and
lawsuits, internal corporate investigations and complex
commercial litigation, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Derek&#8217;s extensive experience and accomplishments are a
welcome addition to our already deep talent pool of white collar
attorneys,&#8221; Richard M. Strassberg, chairman of Goodwin&#8217;s white-collar crime and government investigations group, said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his role on the Deepwater Horizon Task Force, Cohen
supervised the criminal investigation and prosecutions in
connection with the April 2010 Gulf Coast oil spill disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to his work at the Justice Department, Cohen was an
assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter has 860 lawyers at nine offices in the
U.S., Hong Kong and London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Former Federal Prosecutor Hamilton Joins Ulmer  Berne &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ulmer  Berne LLP has added former federal prosecutor
Richard T. Hamilton Jr. to the litigation practice in Cleveland,
where he will head the firm&#8217;s white-collar practice group.
Hamilton spent most of his 20-plus-year legal career as a trial
attorney with the Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division and,
most recently, with the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Northern
District of Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his former role, Hamilton led international, national
and local white-collar criminal investigations and prosecutions
against individuals and corporations for violations of the
Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal crimes, including the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, money laundering and
multidefendant conspiracy cases, the firm said in a statement.
Among his notable cases, he led the Ohio and Florida-based cases
of 16 corporate and individual participants in the scrap metal
industry on criminal price-fixing, bid rigging and other
charges, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ulmer  Berne is a full-service law firm with more than 185
attorneys at offices in Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland and
Columbus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jones Walker Adds Partner in Commercial Litigation Group &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectual property litigator and former Exxon Mobil
Corp. technology manager&#160;Jeffrey J. Phillips has joined the
Houston office of Jones Walker LLP as a partner in the business

&lt;p&gt;Phillips&#8217; practice focuses on intellectual property matters
in the oil and gas, chemical processes and catalysts, foods and
beverages, advanced biofuels, internal combustion engines,
complex mechanical systems, and computer and software related
technologies industries, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His litigation experience includes both patent enforcement
and patent defense. Phillips counsels clients on intellectual
property issues, such patent portfolio management, preparing
opinions relating to a company&#8217;s ability to sell its products
and/or practice its valuable technology, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones Walker has more than 375 attorneys at its U.S.
offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bankruptcy Lawyer Penelope Parmes Joins Troutman Sanders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troutman Sanders LLP added Penelope Parmes as a partner in
the Orange County, California, office as a partner in the
bankruptcy practice.&#160;Parmes was previously a partner at Rutan 
Tucker LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parmes practices business insolvency law, with a particular
focus on representing&#160;non-debtors in workouts and bankruptcy
matters. Her clients include secured creditors, landlords,
buyers and sellers, trade creditors, and other parties affected
by financial insolvency, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A substantial amount of Parmes&#8217;s practice includes the
representation of lenders regarding adequate protection and cash
collateral litigation, valuation issues, avoiding actions and
plan confirmation litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troutman Sanders has more than 600 lawyers at offices in
the U.S. and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;KL Gates Hires Health-Care Partner in Seattle Office &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seattle office of KL Gates LLP&#160;added Carla M. DewBerry
as a partner in the&#160;health-care&#160;practice. DewBerry joins the

&lt;p&gt;DewBerry represents clients on Medicare and Medicaid

as momentous as the passage and implementation of Dodd-Frank in
the U.S.,&#8221; Bruce Bennett, co-head of Covington&#8217;s securities and
capital markets practice said in a statement. &#8220;Our clients have
an increased need for advice on the interplay of new regulations

&lt;p&gt;Covington  Burling has lawyers at 10 offices in the U.S.,

&lt;h2&gt;News &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stringer Repels Spitzer&#8217;s Comeback in NYC Comptroller Race &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer fought off Eliot Spitzer in the Democratic primary for New York City comptroller,
halting the former governor&#8217;s attempted comeback from a
prostitution scandal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stringer, who had the support of the party establishment
and the city&#8217;s three major newspapers, captured 52 percent of
yesterday&#8217;s vote with 97 percent of precincts reporting,
compared with 48 percent for Spitzer, according to the
Associated Press. With Democrats outnumbering Republicans by
more than 6 to 1, the victory virtually ensures Stringer, 53,
will become comptroller after the general election in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comptroller is the city&#8217;s chief financial officer,
auditing agencies and overseeing $140 billion in pension assets.
Stringer&#8217;s temperate public statements before his opponent
entered the race contrasted with the media-driven drama of the
fiery Spitzer&#8217;s return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spitzer, 54, resigned as governor in 2008 after his trysts
were disclosed. He entered the race in July, upending a contest
in which Stringer, a career politician, was expected to coast to
victory. The former &#8220;Sheriff of Wall Street&#8221; vowed to use the
power of the pension funds to keep corporations well managed and
socially responsible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He portrayed himself as a ready to do battle with Wall
Street again, just as he had done as state attorney general. In
that post, he rose to prominence by exposing conflicts of
interest between Wall Street firms&#8217; analysts and investment
bankers. Stringer, he said, accomplished little in a 20-year
career in politics, including 12 in the state Assembly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As attorney general from 1999 through 2006, Spitzer
disclosed subpoenaed e-mails and other evidence to persuade
Merrill Lynch  Co., Citigroup Inc. and other securities firms
to pay $1.4 billion in pretrial settlements, rather than go to
court on charges they misled consumers with biased research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was then elected governor, with 69 percent of the vote
in 2006, serving for less than 15 months before getting caught
patronizing high-priced prostitutes. &lt;/p&gt;

ask a judge to put to rest antitrust allegations that have
plagued the companies for years over fees that are paid by U.S.
merchants to support the credit card networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York,
will hear arguments today over whether to grant final approval
to a multibillion-dollar class-action settlement on behalf of
merchants nationwide. Opposed by scores of big-box retailers and
other consumer businesses, the accord is aimed at ending future
court battles with U.S. merchants over the practice of setting
credit card interchange payments, known as swipe fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re seeing this settlement as finally buying them
some peace,&#8221; said Steven Semeraro, a former U.S. Justice
Department lawyer who isn&#8217;t involved in the case. &#8220;And that&#8217;s
worth it to them, however many billions of dollars it&#8217;s going to
cost.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed by banks half a century ago, Visa and MasterCard
have been subject to government scrutiny over their business
practices for decades, Georgetown University law professor Adam Levitin wrote in a 2008 report on credit card merchant
restraints. The card firms faced an antitrust suit filed by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and other retailers in 1996 and actions by the
Justice Department, leading to changes in some of their rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank-owned groups spun off the card companies through
initial public offerings in 2006 and 2008 in a move that
merchants alleged was intended to dodge antitrust liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Previous Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after Foster City, California-based Visa and
Purchase, New York-based MasterCard received final approval for
their previous settlement of more than $4 billion in January
2004, the current case was brought against them in October 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms thought they would be protected from future
antitrust lawsuits over interchange fees by releases written
into the settlement of the earlier Wal-Mart-led case, said
Semeraro, a professor at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in
San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the card companies &#8220;think they really have the
language in there&#8221; and included an &#8220;unbelievably broad&#8221;
release, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It prohibits virtually anyone except an antitrust
enforcement authority from ever suing them again for anything
that relates to antitrust claims,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimated to be the largest ever in a U.S. antitrust case,
the settlement is currently valued at about $5.7 billion. In an
August report, a court-appointed expert said that plaintiffs
might have difficulty establishing that the companies violated
antitrust laws at trial and are probably better off with the
accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interchange Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchants are expected to receive about one-third of a
year&#8217;s worth of interchange payments if final approval is
granted and the order isn&#8217;t delayed by an appeal. That estimate
is based on assumptions about the number of merchants that will
file claims and other factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard forged ahead with the settlement
despite objections from hundreds of retailers, including Wal-Mart and Target Corp. (TGT), which contended that the releases would
cover too many of the firms&#8217; policies and allow them to raise
rates in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a conference call with investors this July, MasterCard
President and Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga disclosed that
the companies decided not to back out of the accord even though
a termination provision had been triggered by the volume of
merchants that dropped out. Some of those merchants have chosen
to file their own lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Gigantic Nightmare&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement will help the card companies rid themselves
of a &#8220;gigantic nightmare&#8221; in terms of legal fees and other
costs, said Sarah Jane Hughes, a professor at Indiana University
Bloomington&#8217;s Maurer School of Law, who isn&#8217;t involved in the
litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard said it&#8217;s confident the court will grant final
approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The scope of the release is reasonable and logical,&#8221;
Noah Hanft, the company&#8217;s general counsel, said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Cohen, a Visa spokesman, declined to comment about
today&#8217;s hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a joint court filing in April, lawyers for the card
companies and major U.S. banks said the release &#8220;covers only
claims based on continued rules and practices that are the same
as, or substantially similar to, those currently in place or
modified by the settlement, which courts have held a class may
properly release.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interchange fees are collected by Visa and MasterCard and
turned over to banks, which use the funds to help cover the
costs of issuing cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. began regulating debit-card interchange fees under
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
2010. In July, a federal judge found those fees had been set too
high and ordered the Federal Reserve to revisit the rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), on pace to be the top adviser on U.S. initial public offerings for the first time since 2009, scored a coup by landing the lead role on Twitter Inc.&#8217;s sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twitter, which announced yesterday that it filed for an IPO, gave Goldman Sachs the job of running the sale, a person with knowledge of the matter said. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley (MS) will also be bankers for the IPO, said another person, who asked not to be identified because the process is private. Deutsche Bank AG also has a part, another person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lost out to rival Morgan Stanley on similar roles in the highest-profile technology IPOs in recent years, including Facebook Inc. (FB)&#8217;s $16 billion sale last year and offerings by Groupon Inc. and Zynga Inc. the year before. San Francisco-based Twitter may have opted for Goldman Sachs after the other offerings drew criticism and complaints from shareholders, according to Michael Holland of Holland  Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Facebook experience was one that was so egregious that Twitter did a fairly predictable thing,&#8221; said Holland, who oversees more than $4 billion as chairman of the New York-based money manager. &#8220;When the biggest and best have needed IPO services, Goldman is always a finalist.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ViroPharma Inc. (VPHM), a producer of
drugs that treat rare diseases, has attracted interest from
suitors including European drugmakers Sanofi (SAN) and Shire Plc (SHP), said
people with knowledge of the process. ViroPharma&#8217;s shares
surged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ViroPharma began working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on a
possible auction after fielding an unsolicited approach, said
the people, who asked not to be named because talks are private.
Goldman Sachs has actively sought other suitors for the Exton,
Pennsylvania-based drugmaker since then, said one person.
ViroPharma&#8217;s market value was about $2 billion before
Bloomberg&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s top pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
have pursued acquisitions this year as they seek new drugs to
replace products whose patents are expiring. After Amgen Inc.&#8217;s
agreement to buy Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX) for $10.4 billion in
August, the value of deals in the two sectors has risen 14
percent from a year earlier to more than $70 billion, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ViroPharma shares gained 28 percent to $39.13 at the close
in New York, the biggest single-day increase since August 2005.
Representatives at Sanofi, ViroPharma, Shire and Goldman Sachs

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s main opposition party named
Narendra Modi as its prime ministerial candidate ahead of next
year&#8217;s general election in a bid to showcase his reformist
credentials and broaden its base beyond core Hindu nationalists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi, chief minister of western Gujarat state since 2001,
will be prime minister if the Bharatiya Janata Party and its
coalition partners form a government after the polls, party
President Rajnath Singh said in New Delhi after a meeting of the
BJP&#8217;s highest decision-making body. The U.S. refused a visa to
the 62-year-old over his alleged role in the 2002 riots that
killed about 1,000 Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposition will push Modi&#8217;s record of delivering
higher-than-average growth rates in Gujarat in a bid to unseat
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after India&#8217;s $1.8 trillion
economy expanded at the slowest pace in a decade and the rupee
slumped to a record. The ruling Congress party is likely to
attack Modi over his handling of the deadly riots in the home
state of peace icon Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even if Modi has strong appeal among the corporate sector
and middle class, he doesn&#8217;t enjoy that charm among large
sections of the population,&#8221; said Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, an
independent analyst who has covered politics for more than three
decades. &#8220;His economic reforms in one state are not going to
influence the bulk of the electorate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fractured Mandate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls suggest a hung parliament once votes are
counted. Singh&#8217;s Congress party appointed Rahul Gandhi, scion of
the country&#8217;s foremost political dynasty, to lead its poll
charge as it seeks to recover from three years of policy drift,
coalition infighting and corruption allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh&#8217;s ruling coalition may win 136 seats of the total 545
in the lower house of parliament, with Congress getting 119, a
drop of 87 seats from the previous poll in 2009, a July survey
by the Times Now television channel and C-Voter polling agency
found. The opposition alliance could get 156 seats, with the BJP
securing 131 or 15 seats more than the last ballot, the survey
showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi has raised his national profile since winning a third
term in Gujarat in December. The BJP appointed him to lead its
election campaign, and he routinely addresses gatherings of
business leaders and students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting Goal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Modi has the ability to galvanize the BJP cadre and
attract different sections of voters,&#8221; said Jai Mrug, a Mumbai-based political analyst, adding his candidacy will help the BJP
win more seats. &#8220;He is a very meticulous planner; sets a goal
and works for that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi arouses strong emotions in the nation of 1.2 billion
people. To followers, he&#8217;s a cult figure who dragged Gujarat
from the ashes of the 2002 rioting, wooing businesses and
cutting red tape and corruption. To opponents, he&#8217;s an autocrat
who failed to control the attacks on Muslims by Hindu mobs or
show enough remorse over the killings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2002 carnage, which has also left Modi barred from
entering some European nations, followed the killing of Hindu
activists in a train fire, a blaze for which Muslims were later
found guilty. Human rights groups accuse Modi of not doing
enough to control the subsequent riots and exploiting religious
divisions for political gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi denies any wrongdoing and a Supreme Court-appointed
panel investigating one documented incident found no evidence
that he took decisions to prevent assistance from reaching those
being attacked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aide Jailed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maya Kodnani, a former Modi aide, was jailed last year for
her role in the murder of 97 people in a suburb of Ahmedabad,
Gujarat&#8217;s biggest city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fallout of the riots continues to hinder Modi and the
BJP outside of the state and the party&#8217;s support base. His
elevation in the BJP prompted its biggest ally at the time --
which governs a state with a large Muslim minority -- to quit
the opposition alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have been given a huge responsibility by the party,&#8221;
Modi said in a press conference in New Delhi yesterday after the
announcement. &#8220;I assure the party workers that I will ensure
BJP&#8217;s victory in 2014.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi has been credited with increasing Gujarat&#8217;s economic
growth by an annual average rate of about 10 percent over the
last decade, compared with about 8 percent for the nation. While
he raised power generation capacity more than fivefold and won
investment with a rapid project-approval process, his success in
improving health and education indicators has lagged behind
other states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a young boy, Modi helped his father sell tea to
passengers at a Gujarat railway station before school, Kingshuk
Nag wrote in &#8220;The NaMo Story -- A Political Life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the age of eight, Modi joined the student wing of the
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or National Volunteers Corps. The
RSS advocates that Hinduism is central to Indian culture and
life, and acts as a guide to the BJP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi completed a master&#8217;s degree in political science
before entering politics in 1987 by joining the BJP, according
to his personal website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julien Grout, a former JPMorgan (JPM)
Chase  Co. trader charged with trying to hide the bank&#8217;s record
trading loss last year, is arguing to prosecutors that he was
following orders from his then-boss, Bruno Iksil, people with
knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grout&#8217;s lawyers provided records including e-mails to U.S.
prosecutors in Manhattan in the past two weeks in an effort to
cast doubt on the government&#8217;s assertion that Iksil resisted
pressure to inflate the value of the trades, said the people,
who asked not to be named because the talks were private. While
Grout and another supervisor, Javier Martin-Artajo, were charged
with conspiracy and wire fraud, Iksil -- nicknamed the London
Whale -- avoided prosecution after agreeing to cooperate with
authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange shows that Grout, who is fighting accusations
he improperly marked assets to hide losses, is trying to damage
his former boss&#8217;s credibility. In announcing charges against
Grout and Martin-Artajo last month, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara
in Manhattan said Iksil had sounded the alarm &#8220;more than once&#8221;
to co-workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It may be part of an attempt to tell the government that
this case is weaker than you think, and you&#8217;ll be embarrassed,&#8221;
John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University
Law School, said of Grout&#8217;s effort. E-mails are often a matter
of debate, with defense attorneys trying &#8220;to tell the
prosecution that they can&#8217;t go forward because their
interpretation is wrong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold is poised to extend declines
as the U.S. Federal Reserve withdraws stimulus and economic data
improve, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which says that
there&#8217;s a risk that bullion may drop below $1,000 an ounce.
Futures retreated in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While debt-ceiling discussions in the U.S. and the Syrian
crisis may support bullion in the near term, gold will resume
its decline into next year, Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities
research, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television today.
The bank&#8217;s target for 2014 is $1,050, and the commodity may
overshoot to the downside, Currie said in Singapore. Gold
futures haven&#8217;t traded below $1,000 since October 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullion has dropped 22 percent this year as some investors
lost faith in the metal as a store of value, the U.S. economy
improved and stocks and the dollar rallied. The Fed will pare
its $85 billion a month bond-buying program next week, according
to a Bloomberg survey. Earlier this year, Currie issued a sell
recommendation on bullion on April 10, before gold plunged 13
percent in a two-session slump that ended April 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we agree with the mid-cycle price somewhere around
$1,200, we believe that at least near term it can overshoot to
the downside, which is why we have $1,050&#8221; as a target, Currie
said. &#8220;It clearly could trade below $1,000.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Price &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold for December delivery fell as much as 2 percent to
$1,304.60 on the Comex, the lowest since Aug. 9, and traded at
$1,314.40 at 11:52 a.m. in New York. Most-active futures reached
a record $1,923.70 in September 2011. Goldman&#8217;s three- and six-month targets are $1,300, according to a report on Sept. 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global stocks tracked by the MSCI All-Country World Index
rallied 12 percent this year and the Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index
climbed 3.9 percent. The Fed began buying $40 billion of
mortgage-backed securities per month in September of last year
and then supplemented that with $45 billion of Treasury
securities in December to bolster the recovery. Fed Chairman Ben
S. Bernanke suggested on June 19 that the program might be wound
up by the middle of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For next year, a move to $1,000 is on the cards,&#8221; said
Dominic Schnider, head of commodities research at UBS AG&#8217;s
wealth-management unit in Singapore. &#8220;Once a timetable of
tapering is known, then you probably will see a fresh selling
wave of the exchange-traded fund side.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the Fed&#8217;s expected decision next week to start
tapering has been priced in, and Goldman expects an initial
reduction of $10 billion a month in asset purchases, said
Currie. A stronger dollar would diminish gold demand, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ETP Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have sold bullion at a record pace from exchange-traded products this year. Holdings in ETPs have contracted
684.1 metric tons to 1,947.8 tons after shrinking every month in
2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG raised the possibility of gold
trading below $1,000 in May as Ric Deverell, head of commodities
research at the bank, said then that bullion was going to get
crushed as inflation risks remained muted. That forecast was for
bullion in five years&#8217; time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The real key in gold is to see the evidence of the
improving economic data in the U.S.,&#8221; said Currie, who is based
in New York. Weakening emerging-market currencies, especially
the South African rand, will also help to reduce the cost of
production in dollars, he said &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Institute for Supply Management&#8217;s factory index showed
U.S. manufacturing expanded in August at the fastest pace since
June 2011. The group&#8217;s gauge of service industries, which cover
almost 90 percent of the economy, posted the highest reading
since December 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaster Insurance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold has fallen this year because investors see less need
for disaster insurance, Bernanke said in July. One reason that
prices are lower is that people are less concerned about extreme
outcomes, particularly negative, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. federal government needs to increase its debt
limit later this year, and Goldman expects that the ceiling will
be raised by the end of next month, according to the Sept. 11
report. On Syria, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov this week to seek to get
Syria to give up its chemical weapons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
outlook for U.S. soybean prices in the next three and six months
after a government report yesterday showed U.S. production will
be reduced due to dry weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soybeans may be $12.50 a bushel in three months and $11.50
in six months, below current price levels while above the bank&#8217;s
previous outlook of $10.50 a bushel, Goldman analysts including
Damien Courvalin wrote in an e-mailed report today. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture lowered its forecast for the U.S.
harvest to 3.149 billion bushels yesterday, its second cut in as
many months and 3.3 percent less than expected in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Uncertainty over the size of the U.S. corn and especially
soybean crops remain unusually high for this time of year given
the volatility and extremes in planting and growing weather
across the Midwest,&#8221; Courvalin wrote. The USDA may lower its
outlook for U.S. yields again in its October report, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soybeans for November delivery rallied 2.8 percent
yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade, before falling as much
as 0.7 percent today to $13.8675 a bushel. The most-active
contract has jumped 20 percent since reaching a 19-month low in
August as heat and dry weather intensified in U.S. growing
areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Areas of the Midwest, including top growers Iowa and
Illinois, had as little as 5 percent of the normal amount of
rain in the last 30 days, according to the National Weather
Service. Crop development was already delayed by wet, cool
weather earlier this year, leaving yields vulnerable to heat and
dry weather in August, a time when plants are developing pods
and maturing before the harvest, USDA data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Production &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soybean prices may still be pressured by ample world
supplies, Courvalin said. Global production may be 281.66
million metric tons, less than expected in August while still
the biggest crop on record, the USDA estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we see upside risk to current prices given downside
risks to U.S. production, we ultimately believe that lower U.S.
exports and another large increase in South American soybean
acreage and production will leave U.S. inventories above last
year&#8217;s level and prices below the current forward curve,&#8221;
Courvalin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn prices may be $4.25 a bushel in the next three, six
and 12 months, Courvalin said. The bank left its wheat forecast
unchanged at $6.50 a bushel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korean stocks are beating
bonds by the most in six quarters as foreign investors buy
shares at the fastest pace on record and accelerating global
economic growth increases the chances of monetary tightening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kospi (KOSPI) index has added 7 percent since the end of June,
compared with a gain of less than 0.1 percent in Bank of America
Corp.&#8217;s index tracking the nation&#8217;s sovereign debt, the biggest
gap since the first quarter of 2012. While overseas money
managers withdrew $1.9 billion from debt in August, equities
lured inflows in the past five weeks, including a record $3.6
billion last week. The Kospi is valued at 1.1 times net assets,
a 47 percent discount versus the MSCI All-Country World Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. say
shares will keep outperforming bonds as the fastest export
growth in seven months boosts profit at Kospi companies, which
get about 40 percent of their sales overseas. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg predict the Federal Reserve will announce
a reduction in its bond-purchase program on Sept. 18, while
Goldman Sachs says the Bank of Korea will increase interest
rates in the second half of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We bought more Korean stocks in August,&#8221; Grace Tam, a
Hong Kong-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset,
which manages about $1.5 trillion, said in a telephone interview
on Sept. 11. &#8220;Rotation from bonds to equities will go on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International investors have poured a net $7.2 billion into
South Korean shares in the past five weeks as data showed the
economy expanded 1.1 percent in the three months through June
from the previous quarter, while exports jumped at a quicker-than-estimated 7.7 percent rate in August. Foreigners bought a
net $165.4 million worth of Kospi shares as of 10:37 a.m. in
Seoul today, extending net purchases to 17 consecutive days. The
benchmark Kospi index added 0.9 percent to 2011.96. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Samsung Inflows &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world&#8217;s biggest smartphone
maker, attracted $2.05 billion of inflows during the period and
SK Hynix Inc. (000660), the second-largest computer-memory chipmaker,
lured $573 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kospi advanced 2 percent last week to 1,994.32,
extending its rally from an 11-month low on June 25 to 12
percent. The Bank of America bond index returned 0.8 percent
last week and its yield slipped to 3.19 percent, within 0.01
percentage point of the lowest level since July 24. The won
strengthened 0.6 percent to 1,086.88 per dollar, paring this
year&#8217;s drop to 2.1 percent. The cost of protecting the nation&#8217;s
debt against nonpayment using credit default swaps rose to 75
basis points from 73.5, according to CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Profit Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark equity index will probably climb to as high
as 2,200 by the middle of next year, a 10 percent gain from its
closing level on Sept. 13, according to Kwon Goohoon, a Seoul-based economist for Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization at Kospi index companies will probably climb 15
percent in the next 12 months, versus 10 percent for the MSCI
All-Country index, according analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Corporate earnings will see better growth, most likely
from the fourth quarter, as global economies including Korea are
turning around,&#8221; Kwon said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced stimulus by the Fed will weigh on most emerging-market assets, including South Korean equities, Vivek Misra, a
Bangalore-based Asia equity strategist at Societe Generale SA,
said in a telephone interview on Sept. 13. The Kospi may end the
year at 1,900, about 5 percent below the closing level last
week, before rallying in 2014, Misra said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Taper &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. central bank will cut monthly Treasury purchases
to $35 billion from $45 billion while maintaining mortgage-bond
buying at $40 billion, according to the median of 34 responses
in a Bloomberg News survey of economists on Sept. 6. That pace
was unchanged from an Aug. 9-13 poll, as was a projection that
the program will end in June. The Kospi has rallied 106 percent
since the Fed&#8217;s first round of bond-buying in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gains in South Korean stocks this quarter have reduced
dividend yields on the Kospi to the lowest levels since April
2012 compared with the yield on debt, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The equity gauge has a payout of 1.17 percent,
versus the 3.57 percent yield on the nation&#8217;s 10-year government
bonds. The gap of 2.4 percent compares with the 16-month low of
2.5 percent on Aug. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors will continue favoring equities over bonds as
interest rates rise, said Kim Jiun, a Seoul-based analyst at
Shinhan Investment Corp. The foreign withdrawals from debt in
August were the first in seven months, according to the
Financial Supervisory Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BlackRock Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Bank of Korea held its key interest rate at 2.5
percent for a fourth straight month last week, Goldman Sachs
estimates the central bank will increase the rate to 3 percent
by the end of 2014. The economy will expand 2.8 percent in 2013
and 4 percent next year, which would be the fastest pace since
2010, according to central bank forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been holding a conservative view on the bond
market and have moved to bonds with shorter maturity,&#8221; Kim Ki
Hyun, head of the fixed-income investment division at Woori
Asset Management Co., said by phone from Seoul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quicker global growth is boosting the sales outlook for
South Korean companies, according to BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s
largest money manager. Service industries in the U.S. expanded
in August at the fastest pace in almost eight years as a pickup
in demand encouraged companies to increase hiring, the Institute
for Supply Management said on Sept. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Korean exporters are benefiting from global growth,&#8221;
Marc Desmidt, the head of alpha strategies for Asia Pacific at
BlackRock, which oversees about $3.8 trillion, said in a Sept.
11 interview on Bloomberg Television. &#8220;If that continues that
will be very good for them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) unit put its
Century Park property, a Los Angeles office complex where
Creative Artists Agency has its headquarters, up for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Asset Management is marketing the 3.2 million-square-foot (297,000-square-meter) Century Park on behalf of
institutional investors, said Darin Oduyoye, a New York-based
spokesman for the company. The property, located in the Century
City business district, may fetch more than $2 billion, said a
person with knowledge of the plans who asked not to be
identified because the expected price isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex has two 44-story towers housing high-end
offices along with stores and restaurants, as well as a 4-acre
(1.6-hectare) park and the Annenberg Space for Photography. A
sale may come by the end of the year, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastdil Secured LLC is the broker marketing the complex,
Oduyoye said. Martha Wallau, a spokeswoman for Eastdil, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX) in April planned to market a 21-story
building at 1888 Century Park East valued at more than $300
million, two people with knowledge of the effort said at the
time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Asset Management&#8217;s plans to market Century Park
were reported earlier today by the Hollywood Reporter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, said internal stress tests show the company would
come through an economic crisis with more than enough capital to
stay in business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Tier 1 common ratio would be at least 8.5
percent in a scenario designed to measure how the firm would
perform during a severe crunch, the New York-based bank said
today in a presentation on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank would show a net loss before taxes of $0.3 billion
from the second quarter of 2013 through the middle of 2015, with
$32.1 billion in loan losses and $17.5 billion in trading and
counterparty losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. banks must run their own tests on how they
would fare during a crisis to supplement those conducted by the
Federal Reserve six months earlier. The central bank reports
results each March based on different economic assumptions. The
most recent round showed 17 of the 18 largest firms surviving a
deep recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it would have been more conservative in its
assumptions if it had been able to incorporate feedback from the
Federal Reserve before running the results in late March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Wells
Fargo  Co. and Citigroup Inc. also concluded their firms would
ride out a shock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it could handle a crisis that sends
stocks down 40 percent and produces $20 billion in trading
losses for the firm. Bank of America, ranked second by assets
among U.S. lenders, foresaw a $26.1 billion cumulative deficit.
Citigroup, ranked third by assets, found it would exceed capital
minimums even after sustaining about $43 billion in loan losses
and $10 billion in trading and counterparty losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are based in New York. Bank of
America has its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s stock advanced 1.1 percent today to $53.14,
bringing the gain for this year to 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essent Group Ltd., the mortgage
insurer backed by investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and George Soros, filed to raise $287.5 million in an initial
public offering as investors pour capital into companies that
guaranty home loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Barclays Plc are
managing the offering, Bermuda-based Essent said today in a
regulatory filing. The offering size is a placeholder amount used
to calculate registration fees and may change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgages insurers MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) and Radian Group
Inc., which are recovering from years of losses, have sold stock
and notes to investors including hedge fund manager John Paulson
who has been betting on the recovery of the U.S. housing market.
The guarantors cover losses when homeowners default and
foreclosures fail to recoup costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the offering may be used for &#8220;capital
contributions to support the growth of our insurance
subsidiaries,&#8221; Essent said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
agreed to sell about half its Aerogold Visa credit-card
portfolio to Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), which is planning to start
its own Aeroplan rewards card program in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial will receive about C$3 billion ($2.9
billion) cash for the outstanding card balances, as well as an
upfront payment of C$200 million from Toronto-Dominion and
Aeroplan owner Aimia (AIM) Inc., Toronto-based CIBC said today in a
statement. Toronto-Dominion also agreed to pay CIBC C$37.5
million annually for three years, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies had been in talks since last month, when
Toronto-Dominion was chosen as the primary card partner of
Montreal-based loyalty-program operator Aimia. Toronto-Dominion
will offer co-branded Aeroplan Visa cards that offer miles for
flights and other rewards starting in January under a 10-year
contract with Aimia, while CIBC keeps the right to offer
Aeroplan cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto-Dominion said in a separate statement that it will
acquire 550,000 cardholder accounts, primarily those who don&#8217;t
have a banking relationship with Canadian Imperial. The
agreement, expected to be completed in December, will add about
10 cents a share to its adjusted earnings next year, and 15
cents in 2015, Toronto-Dominion said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aimia Contract &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the negative in the agreement is that TD will
no longer be the sole Canadian bank issuing Aeroplan cards,&#8221;
John Aiken, an analyst with Barclays Plc in Toronto, said in a
note to clients. &#8220;We do not believe this was the original
vision when TD initially pursued the contract with Aimia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto-Dominion plans to introduce five Aeroplan Visa
cards in Canada and the U.S., the lender said in a conference
call. The three-way deal gives Toronto-Dominion Aeroplan
cardholders from the outset of its new offering, allowing the
lender to avoid starting from scratch and having to win over
each cardholder individually, Chief Executive Officer Ed Clark
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s just dramatically lower risk, and so I&#8217;ll always say
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,&#8221; Clark said in a
telephone interview from Toronto. &#8220;So we get an earnings base
and we can spend vigorously on marketing to grow this file.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Renewal Option &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial will retain its Aerogold Visa cardholders
that have &#8220;deeper&#8221; banking relationships with the lender,
David Williamson, group head of retail and business banking,
said today in a conference call. The bank can continue to offer
Aeroplan cards for 10 years, and may have the option to renew
after that, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial rose 0.8 percent to close at C$81.74 in
Toronto and Toronto-Dominion advanced 1.2 percent to C$91.02.
Aimia surged 7.3 percent to C$17.85, the most since June 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While CIBC does not receive much of a premium on the
cardholder balances, the accounts sold were the ones that were
the highest risk of flight and receiving any value should be
viewed as an incremental positive,&#8221; Aiken said. &#8220;With the
ability to continue to issue Aeroplan cards, CIBC should be able
to more adequately defend the customers that it retained.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial will release about C$65 million of loan-loss provisions tied to the sold portfolio and have about C$55
million in costs, the bank said. Net income of upfront payments,
the loan-loss release and closing costs is expected to be about
C$180 million. Annual earnings will be reduced by about 45 cents
a share, Canadian Imperial said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Air Canada &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial&#8217;s two-decade partnership with Aimia made
the CIBC Aerogold Visa its most popular card. The bank buys
Aeroplan miles from Aimia to give to cardholders on purchases,
including flights with Air Canada (AC/B), the country&#8217;s biggest
carrier. Aimia, which owns and manages rewards programs
including Nectar in the U.K. and Italy, counts CIBC as its
biggest partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aimia said in a separate statement that Toronto-Dominion
becomes Aeroplan&#8217;s primary financial-services partner and
credit-card issuer, though CIBC will also continue to be an
issuer of Aeroplan cards through 10-year agreements. CIBC will
keep 630,000 Aeroplan accounts held by existing banking
customers under the agreement, Aimia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;CIBC has been an issuer of Aeroplan loyalty credit cards
for more than 20 years, and this deal ensures that our clients
will continue to have access to the program for the next 10
years,&#8221; Canadian Imperial CEO Gerald McCaughey said on the
conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aeroplan began in 1984 as a promotional tool for business
travelers on Air Canada. CIBC Aerogold Visa was started in 1991,
according to Aimia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) has agreed to pay at least $750 million to resolve U.S. and U.K. regulatory probes of its record trading loss last year, people with knowledge of the negotiations said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank is seeking to settle as many inquiries as possible before the third quarter ends Sept. 30, the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told investors last week that the quarter&#8217;s addition to legal reserves would &#8220;more than offset&#8221; about $1.5 billion of consumer reserve releases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s bad bets on derivatives, placed by U.K. trader Bruno Iksil, prompted authorities on two continents to open investigations into the firm&#8217;s controls and disclosures last year as losses surpassed $6.2 billion. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve and the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority are among watchdogs planning to sanction the New York-based lender, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some settlements may be announced as early as this week, and total penalties may yet change, one of the people said. Iksil, who became known as the London Whale because his trading book was so large, agreed in June to testify against his colleagues after U.S. prosecutors promised not to charge him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
could survive a global market shock that would send stocks down
almost 40 percent and produce $20 billion in trading losses for
the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs would maintain a Tier 1 common ratio of at
least 8.9 percent during the shock, above the 5 percent minimum,
the New York-based firm said in a disclosure of its company-run
stress test. The test included the assumption of a
&#8220;reputational event&#8221; specific to Goldman Sachs that would
reduce its revenue over the nine-quarter length of the exam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. banks must conduct so-called mid-cycle
stress tests using their own scenarios and disclose a summary of
the results. Goldman Sach&#8217;s performance in its own test topped
that in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s version in March, in which it had
a minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 5.8 percent. The Fed&#8217;s test had
different assumptions and covered a different time period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs projected it would have a $6.2 billion net
loss over the nine quarters from April 2013 to June 2015 in a
&#8220;severely adverse scenario.&#8221; The bank would have $15.5 billion
of pre-provision net revenue in the period, overwhelmed by $20
billion in trading and counterparty losses, $1.1 billion in
other losses and a $600 million provision for loan losses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithuania strengthened
environmental restrictions for using shale-gas and shale-oil
technologies as a state body recommended the Baltic country
issue a first license for such work to Chevron Corp. (CVX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New regulations, among other things, require an
environmental impact study and public consultations before
exploration can start, the Environment Ministry in Vilnius said
on its website. It said a tender commission today suggested the
government grant rights to the U.S. energy company&#8217;s local unit
because &#8220;legally no other decision is possible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron submitted the only bid in a January tender for
shale-hydrocarbon exploration and production rights in the
western Lithuanian region of Silute-Taurage. The country wants
to develop shale resources as an alternative to energy imports
from Russia. Some local communities oppose the technology as
environmentally unsafe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron hopes that its work helping Lithuania find and
utilize hydrocarbon resources will facilitate the country&#8217;s goal
of energy security,&#8221; Chevron Exploration  Production Lietuva
UAB said of the tender commission&#8217;s decision in a statement on
ELTA news service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the government names Chevron the winner of the tender,
the company will have 30 days to pay the price it offered for
the license and confirm it&#8217;s still interested, Environment
Minister Valentinas Mazuronis said in an interview on Sept. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithuania plans to revise a law that currently taxes
proceeds from shale-gas production at a rate of 25 percent, news
portal Vz.lt cited Mazuronis as saying today. The minister said
a 40 percent tariff proposed to parliament was too high and the
government would seek a compromise somewhere between that and
the current rate, Vz.lt reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron last year bought half of the Lithuanian oil and gas
recovery company LL Investicijos, which holds a license to
explore in Rietavas, an area contiguous to the Silute-Taurage
block, according to the company&#8217;s Lithuanian website. &lt;/p&gt;

Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told employees to prepare for more
legal woes while the bank undertakes an &#8220;unprecedented effort&#8221;
to comply with regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are all well aware of the news around the legal and
regulatory issues facing our company, and in the coming weeks
and months we need to be braced for more to come,&#8221; Dimon said
today in an e-mail to JPMorgan&#8217;s more than 250,000 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender, increased spending on
internal controls by about $1 billion this year and dedicated
more than $750 million &#8220;to address several of our consent
orders,&#8221; Dimon said. At least 5,000 people at the New York-based company have been assigned to compliance, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank will pay at least $750 million to close some
regulatory probes into its record London Whale trading loss last
year, people familiar with the matter said. That includes about
$200 million to resolve Securities and Exchange Commission
claims, a person with knowledge of the matter said today,
requesting anonymity because the agreement isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has been
investigating whether the bank manipulated trading in credit
derivatives, is unlikely to announce a settlement at the same
time as the other regulators, according to people familiar with
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, announced a new $40 billion stock
buyback plan and increased its dividend 22 percent, seeking to
reward shareholders as the company undergoes a change in
strategy and leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repurchase program, which has no expiration date,
replaces another $40 billion buyback plan that was due to lapse
at the end of this month, Microsoft said today in a statement.
The company&#8217;s quarterly dividend will rise to 28 cents a share,
payable on Dec. 12 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is a step in the right direction for investors,
though the open-ended schedule for the new buyback plan raises
questions, said Matthew Hedberg, an analyst with RBC Capital
Markets in Minneapolis. The company has come under pressure from
activist investor ValueAct Holdings LP, which pushed Microsoft
to return more money to shareholders, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What would be more interesting is if they put more
parameters on the timing of the buyback -- sooner is better than
later,&#8221; said Hedberg, who has a neutral rating on Microsoft.
&#8220;The dividend is more material because it&#8217;s incremental to
their existing dividend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. (AIG),
the company that repaid a $182.3 billion U.S. bailout last year,
hired David May from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to help revive the
insurer&#8217;s brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May, 54, was named to the newly created post of chief
marketing officer and reports to Christina Pretto, senior vice
president of corporate communications, according to a note she
sent to colleagues. May&#8217;s team at AIG includes Mark Clowes, who
oversees corporate advertising, and Danny Glantz, who handles
sponsorships, Pretto wrote in the memo, which was obtained by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG restored the use of its name in U.S. television ads in
2011 and struck a deal last year to sponsor six New Zealand
rugby teams including the All Blacks. The branding revival was a
reversal for the New York-based insurer, which focused on the
identities of subsidiaries after then-Chief Executive Officer
Edward Liddy dismissed the AIG name in 2009 as &#8220;wounded and
disgraced&#8221; by the bailout a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the financial crisis well behind us, our businesses
seek to employ best practices and the power of our global scale
as they leverage the AIG brand,&#8221; Pretto wrote. The effort will
involve &#8220;marketing activities aimed at growing sales, expanding
distribution channels, and deepening the trust our clients hold
in us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Benmosche, who took over as CEO in 2009, finished
repaying the rescue in 2012 after selling units to help raise
funds. This year AIG restored a dividend, the company&#8217;s first
since 2008 when the insurer was hobbled by losses on bets tied
to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gupta, Siewert &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May worked for 17 years at New York-based Goldman Sachs in
posts including director of global brand marketing, according to
the memo. He has an MBA from Harvard University and a bachelor&#8217;s
degree from Princeton University, according to AIG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers including Allstate Corp., the largest publicly
traded provider of U.S. auto coverage, have been recruiting
marketing executives from outside the industry. Northbrook,
Illinois-based Allstate last year filled the chief marketing
officer post with Sanjay Gupta, who had led rebranding at Ally
Financial Inc.&#8217;s bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has also worked to burnish its brand after
fending off accusations that the bank&#8217;s actions contributed to
the financial crisis. The company last year hired former U.S.
Treasury Department aide and presidential spokesman Jake Siewert
as global head of corporate communications. David Wells, a
spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn&#8217;t immediately return a message
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG climbed 0.6 percent to $50.01 at 1:20 p.m. in New York.
The insurer has rallied 42 percent this year, beating the 31
percent advance at Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julien Grout, a former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) trader indicted yesterday in connection with a $6.2 billion trading loss last year, will be proven innocent, his attorney said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grout, who reported to Bruno Iksil, was &#8220;totally dependent on Iksil&#8217;s instructions and relied in good faith on his expertise,&#8221; Edward Little, a partner at Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP, said today in an e-mailed statement. Iksil, known as the London Whale because of the size of his trading portfolio, is cooperating with prosecutors and hasn&#8217;t been charged. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grout, 35, who moved to his native France from London earlier this year, faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted. The indictment against him and Iksil&#8217;s boss, Javier Martin-Artajo, listed five charges against each of them, including securities fraud for allegedly manipulating marks on trades to conceal mounting losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is astonishing that the prosecutors are relying on Iksil&#8217;s testimony when he is the one who taught Mr. Grout how the bank was marking the portfolio, gave specific instructions on where he should mark positions, and personally approved the marks on a daily basis,&#8221; Little said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s strategy &#8220;can only be explained by the political pressure&#8221; the U.S. Justice Department faces over the trading debacle, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Grout&#8217;s Bail &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to pay more than $750 million to end U.S. and U.K. regulatory probes of the trading loss, people familiar with the matter said yesterday. The Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve and the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority are preparing settlements with the New York-based bank, the people said. Accords may be announced as early as this week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grout&#8217;s lawyers and prosecutors haven&#8217;t reached an agreement on whether he should be released on bail, and under what conditions, if he decides to return to the U.S. to face charges, said a person with direct knowledge of the situation, who requested anonymity because the discussions are private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jim Margolin, a spokesman for U.S. attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grout, Iksil and Martin-Artajo worked in London at JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office, where the wrong-way derivatives bets were made. The loss led to the departure of senior executives, including Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, and spurred the company&#8217;s board to cut Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s pay by 50 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Traders&#8217; Judgment&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grout is accused of mismarking prices on the derivatives portfolio. The bank&#8217;s traders &#8220;had to estimate their fair market value, based not just on unreliable dealer quotes, but also on the prices of related securities, market conditions and the traders&#8217; judgment,&#8221; Little said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo was on vacation when prosecutors unsealed charges Aug. 14, according to a statement that week from his attorneys at Norton Rose Fulbright LLP. He turned himself in to Spanish police Aug. 27, a police official there said at the time. Martin-Artajo was released on bail in Madrid and said he was unwilling to be extradited, a spokeswoman for the National Court said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cr-00707, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cv-05677, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Keri Geiger in New York at kgeiger4@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: David Scheer at dscheer@bloomberg.net; Christine Harper at charper@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;
</body></entry><entry author="By Carla Main" date="Sep 17, 2013  7:37 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-17/goldman-market-shock-test-ecb-change-lloyds-compliance.html"><headline>Goldman Market-Shock Test, ECB Change, Lloyds: Compliance</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
could survive a global market shock that would send stocks down
almost 40 percent and produce $20 billion in trading losses for
the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs would maintain a Tier 1 common ratio of at
least 8.9 percent during the shock, above the 5 percent minimum,
the New York-based firm said in a disclosure of its company-run
stress test. The test included the assumption of a
&#8220;reputational event&#8221; specific to Goldman Sachs that would
reduce its revenue over the nine-quarter length of the exam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and
Bank of America Corp., must conduct so-called mid-cycle stress
tests using their own scenarios and disclose a summary of the
results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sach&#8217;s performance in its own test topped that in
the Federal Reserve&#8217;s version in March, in which it had a
minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 5.8 percent. The Fed&#8217;s test had
different assumptions and covered a different time period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm projected it would have a $6.2 billion net loss
over the nine quarters from April 2013 to June 2015 in a
&#8220;severely adverse scenario.&#8221; It would have $15.5 billion of
pre-provision net revenue in the period, overwhelmed by $20
billion in trading and counterparty losses, $1.1 billion in
other losses and a $600 million provision for loan losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-largest U.S. bank by
assets, could incur $21.2 billion of losses over nine quarters
through mid-2015 and stay above minimum regulatory capital
levels in a severe financial downturn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s Tier 1 common capital ratio would fall to as low
as 9.1 percent under a severely adverse scenario, above the 5
percent minimum set by U.S. regulators, the New York-based
company said yesterday in a presentation on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s figures assume $43.1 billion in pre-provision
net revenue and an equal amount of loan losses in the nine
quarters from the end of March 2013 through June 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Bank of America saw Tier 1 capital ratio under
its stress test at June 30, 2015, at 10.6 percent, according to
a statement posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bundesbank Says ECB Bank Oversight May Need Primary-Law Change &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union lawmakers will probably have to amend the
rules governing the European Central Bank as it embarks on the
complex task of regulating banks, according to the Bundesbank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabine Lautenschlaeger, vice president of the German
central bank, said in Frankfurt yesterday that a &#8220;primary law
change&#8221; may be needed to simplify the governance structure and
&#8220;separate monetary policy more clearly from banking
supervision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECB is set to oversee banks, starting next year, as
part of an effort to create a banking union that would break the
link between lenders and states, which spawned the sovereign
debt crisis. Critics say the move may create a conflict of
interest at the central bank as policy makers are charged with
guaranteeing the stability of Europe&#8217;s financial sector while
fighting inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bundesbank vice president said her concerns don&#8217;t mean
she favors delaying plans for more concerted controls of
European lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kenyan Bourse Authority Completes Draft Rules for Futures Trade &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draft regulations, aimed at creating a fair and efficient
futures exchange, are open for public comment until Oct. 17, the
Capital Markets Authority, the regulator for Kenya&#8217;s Bourse,
said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The development of the two draft regulations bring to
completion the requisite regulatory framework for the
establishment of a futures market in Kenya,&#8221; the authority said
in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans to set-up a futures market in Kenya have been delayed
since at least 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.K. to Sell $5.3 Billion Lloyds Stake, Five Years After Bailout &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government plans to sell a 3.3 billion-pound ($5.3
billion) stake in Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), its first disposal
since bailing out the lender in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Financial Investments Ltd., which oversees the
government&#8217;s holding in the bank, is selling 4.28 billion shares
to money managers, the London-based body said in a statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, constrained by
the biggest austerity program since World War II, could use the
proceeds to fund tax cuts or more spending before the next
general election, due in 2015. He has said Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, which received a 45.5 billion-pound bailout,
is still burdened by too many poor assets to be sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction will reduce the Treasury&#8217;s stake in Lloyds
to 32.7 percent from 38.7 percent. JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of
America Corp. and UBS AG are managing the offering, according to
a statement from UKFI. The government still owns 81 percent of
Edinburgh-based RBS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lloyds sale is the government&#8217;s biggest since the
financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;HSBC Joins Morgan Stanley in Plan to Screen for Money Laundering &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are working with
outside firms to develop a shared client-screening service amid
a crackdown by regulators on money laundering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genpact Ltd. (G) and Markit Group Ltd. are creating the
service, which will help banks satisfy so-called know-your-client requirements, Hamilton, Bermuda-based Genpact said
yesterday in a statement. The service will allow banks to start
new trading relationships faster and cut costs by sharing
expenses, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. fined London-based HSBC $1.9 billion last year
over claims the lender gave terrorists and drug cartels access
to the U.S. financial system. Europe&#8217;s biggest bank was accused
of failing to monitor more than $670 billion in wire transfers
and more than $9.4 billion in purchases of U.S. currency from
HSBC Mexico, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC accepted responsibility at the time and said it&#8217;s &#8220;a
fundamentally different organization from the one that made
those mistakes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Morgan Stanley, owner of the world&#8217;s largest
brokerage, hasn&#8217;t faced fines over money laundering since the
financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators have ordered U.S. banks including Citigroup Inc.
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. to tighten their controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-JPMorgan Employees Indicted Over $6.2 Billion Derivative Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two former JPMorgan Chase  Co. traders were indicted for
engaging in a securities fraud to hide trading losses that
eventually surpassed $6.2 billion on wrong-way derivatives bets
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javier Martin-Artajo, who oversaw trading strategy for the
synthetic portfolio at the bank&#8217;s chief investment office in
London, and Julien Grout, a trader who worked for him, were
named in a federal indictment, which was unsealed yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. The U.S. announced preliminary
charges against the men in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both were charged in yesterday&#8217;s indictment with five
criminal counts, including securities fraud, conspiracy, filing
false books and records, wire fraud and making false filings
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The pair,
along with unnamed co-conspirators, are accused of engaging in a
scheme to manipulate and inflate the value of position markings
in the synthetic credit portfolio, or SCP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo and Grout were named in criminal complaints
filed by prosecutors in the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara on Aug. 14 that accused them of four separate
counts of conspiracy, falsifying books and records, wire fraud,
and false filings with the SEC. Yesterday&#8217;s indictment, which
formalized those counts, added the securities fraud charge,
which carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has agreed to pay at least $750 million to resolve
U.S. and U.K. regulatory probes of its record trading loss,
people with knowledge of the negotiations said. The bank is
seeking to settle as many inquiries as possible before the third
quarter ends Sept. 30, the people said, asking not to be
identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Little, a lawyer for Grout, and Meeta Vadher, a
spokeswoman for Martin-Artajo&#8217;s lawyers, didn&#8217;t immediately
return e-mails yesterday after regular business hours seeking
comment on the indictment. Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New
York-based JPMorgan, declined to comment on the charges against
the two men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cr-00707, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Martin-Artajo,
13-cv-05677, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Falcone&#8217;s SEC Securities Ban Settlement Gets Judge&#8217;s Approval &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire hedge-fund manager Philip Falcone&#8217;s $18 million
settlement with U.S. regulators that includes a five-year ban
from the securities industry and an admission of wrongdoing was
accepted by a federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC accused Falcone, who became a billionaire by
betting against the U.S. housing market in 2006, of improperly
borrowing money from his fund to pay his personal taxes and said
he gave preferential treatment to some of his investors in
returning their money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bar from the securities industry will allow Falcone to
liquidate his hedge funds under SEC supervision. He and his firm
will pay an $18 million fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Goldstein, a lawyer representing Harbinger Capital,
didn&#8217;t immediately return phone or e-mail messages yesterday
after regular business hours seeking comment on the settlement&#8217;s
approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Philip A. Falcone, 12-cv-05027, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repsol, Cepsa Lose Bid for Reduction in EU Bitumen-Cartel Fines &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol SA and Cia. Espanola de Petroleos SA lost European
Union court appeals against fines levied for fixing prices of
bitumen in Spain, while Nynas AB and Galp Energia SGPS SA had
their penalties cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU General Court yesterday rejected appeals by Repsol
and Cepsa of the six-year-old fines. The Luxembourg-based EU
court trimmed the fines for Galp and a Spanish unit to 8.3
million euros ($11.1 million) from 8.6 million euros and reduced
a penalty for Nynas to 10.4 million euros from 10.6 million
euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol, which previously was called Repsol YPF SA, was
fined 80.5 million euros. Madrid-based Cepsa was fined 83.8
million euros. BP Plc, Europe&#8217;s second-largest oil company, got
immunity from any fines for being the first to come forward with
information about the cartel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitumen is used primarily for surfacing roads and
waterproofing. More than 10,000 European companies make or lay
asphalt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Galp is certain that a complete annulment of the decision
is justified,&#8221; the Lisbon, Portugal-based company said in a
statement on the securities regulator&#8217;s website. The company
said it will study the ruling before deciding whether to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristian Rix, a spokesman for Repsol, said the company
didn&#8217;t immediately have any comment, when contacted by phone. No
one in the press departments of Nynas or Cepsa was immediately
available for comment when contacted by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the commission, said it
welcomed the court ruling &#8220;as it confirms all the substantial
findings&#8221; of the authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are: T-462/07, T-482/07, T-495/07, T-496/07,
T-497/07. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RBS Said to Settle Highland Suits Over $100 Million CDO Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc settled lawsuits with
Highland Capital Management LP over a failed debt deal that led
to accusations of fraud and dishonesty, and losses of as much as
$100 million, a person familiar with the cases said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement ends a four-year legal battle with lawsuits
in London and Texas between RBS and Dallas-based Highland. The
terms are confidential, according to the person, who asked not
to be identified because they weren&#8217;t authorized to discuss it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highland said it lost as much as $100 million when RBS
terminated a planned 500 million-euro ($668 million)
collateralized-debt obligation at the height of the 2008
financial crisis and then seized the underlying loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Edinburgh-based lender is being sued by as many as
16,000 investors over a 2008 share offering before its collapse
in the 2008 financial crisis, as well as other claims from
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan Prelog, a spokesman for Highland in New York,
declined to comment on the settlement. A spokeswoman for RBS in
London declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. case is The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v. Highland

Division) A3/2012/1474. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wabco Wins $272 Million Cut in EU Cartel Fine for Ideal Standard &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wabco Holdings Inc. (WBC) won a 203.4 million euro ($272 million)
windfall after a European Union court cut the antitrust penalty
it paid for Ideal Standard&#8217;s involvement in a bathroom fittings
cartel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU General Court in Luxembourg also trimmed Sanitec
Corp.&#8217;s fine to 50.6 million euros from 57.7 million euros.
Wabco was liable for the original fine as part of an accord
linked to its spinoff from American Standard Cos. that predated
the EU penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said yesterday that EU regulators had wrongly
held Ideal Standard guilty of colluding on the Italian market
for ceramics for longer than was the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wabco paid all of the 326.1 million-euros fine levied in
September 2010 &#8220;and will keep the full amount of the
reimbursement&#8221; awarded by the EU court yesterday, the company
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanitec, owned by EQT Partners AB, said in a statement it
had made a provisional payment of 57.69 million euros in
September 2010. It now expects to be reimbursed the difference
plus interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the commission in
Brussels, said the ruling &#8220;confirms the substantial findings&#8221;
of the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are: T-412/10, T-411/10, T-408/10, T-396/10,
T-386/10, T-380/10, T-379/10, T-381/10, T-378/10, T-376/10,
T-375/10, T-373/10, T-374/10, T-382/10, T-402/10, T-368/10,
T-364/10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BT Loses Court Fight Over EU Order to Repay U.K. Pension Aid &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BT Group Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s largest fixed-line phone company,
and its pension fund lost a court fight against a European Union
order forcing repayment of as much as 16.6 million pounds ($26.5
million) of exemptions from pension rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU General Court in Luxembourg yesterday rejected the
appeals by BT and BT Pension Scheme Trustees against the
findings of a European probe that the company benefited from
unlawful government aid which had to be recovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the 28-nation EU&#8217;s antitrust
regulator, concluded in 2009 that an exemption for the BT
Pension Scheme to contribute to the country&#8217;s Pension Protection
Fund was unlawful state aid. The EU probe was started after one
of BT&#8217;s competitors complained to the Brussels-based regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Pension Protection Fund was created in 2004 to
guarantee pensions when sponsor companies go bankrupt and was
financed by their contributions. BT&#8217;s exemption was created
under a so-called crown guarantee at the time of its
privatization in 1984 to protect the staff&#8217;s pensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed with the decision, which is not in
the best interests of BT Pension Scheme members,&#8221; Dan Thomas, a
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We
shall analyze the judgment in detail and decide upon next
steps.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commission&#8217;s adverse decision had already been
implemented&#160;through changes to U.K.&#160;pension&#160;legislation&#160;prior to
the General Court&#8217;s decision as required by EU law,&#8221; Thomas
said. &#8220;The court&#8217;s decision maintains this status quo.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The amount to be recovered should be such as to eliminate
the economic advantage given to BT which,&#8221; the EU decision
said, &#8220;is the beneficiary of the measure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are: T-226/09, British Telecommunications v.
Commission, T-230/09, BT Pension Scheme Trustees v. Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

products to ensure they aren&#8217;t susceptible to manipulation, CFTC
Chairman Gary Gensler said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors expect German Chancellor
Angela Merkel to retain power in an election and they will
probably move money to Europe as the economy recovers, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Joh. Berenberg Gossler  Co. KG said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a clear expectation that Merkel will be involved
in the government in one form or another,&#8221; Philip Holzer,
deputy head of Goldman Sachs in Germany, told reporters in
Frankfurt today. &#8220;Merkel&#8217;s performance in the crisis was
received very positively internationally. The Americans are
increasingly constructive on Europe and the periphery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merkel&#8217;s Christian Democrats, who lead Germany&#8217;s largest
opposition party in polls ahead of the election this weekend,
have made fiscal austerity a condition of rescues of indebted
states amid efforts to preserve the euro. The European Central
Bank has also shored up confidence in the euro area by pledging
to buy sovereign bonds if states sign up to conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was a certain standstill before the election,&#8221;
Hendrik Riehmer, managing partner of Hamburg-based Berenberg,
Germany&#8217;s oldest private bank, said at the joint briefing. &#8220;The
expectation is that the European process will improve,
especially with regard to the relationship between France and
Germany.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect of economic growth in Europe next year will
draw capital from North America, Riehmer said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global investors and strategists
say India needs to remove all limits on investing in its bond
market, after a move to cut red tape helped bolster the rupee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lombard Odier Investment Management and Aletti Gestielle
Sgr SpA say such opening would allow India to join major bond
indexes, boosting inflows. Inclusion in JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s
GBI-Global Diversified Index of emerging-market government debt
could lure as much as $40 billion over 12 months, according to
Standard Chartered Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee rose 1 percent yesterday as Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh allowed foreigners to buy sovereign debt without
quotas until holdings reach 90 percent of the overall $30
billion limit. The currency slumped 14 percent as investors
pulled $8.9 billion from local notes in three months through
Aug. 31. Standard Chartered says inclusion in major indexes
would limit outflows during such panic selling as investors
can&#8217;t stray too far from their benchmark&#8217;s performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Removing the cap on debt investment is a progressive step
which policy makers should consider,&#8221; said Nagaraj Kulkarni, a
strategist at Standard Chartered in Singapore. &#8220;The latest
measure is a welcome simplification of an existing process. This
alone will be insufficient to reverse the recent outflows.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule change announced by Securities and Exchange Board
of India after trading hours on Sept. 13 follows an earlier
decision to remove the need for foreign institutional investors
to buy quotas for acquiring corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investment Limit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular overseas investors can buy as much as $25 billion
of government bonds and an extra investment of a maximum $5
billion is permitted for long-term investors such as sovereign
wealth funds. Both categories of foreigners held a combined 659
billion rupees ($10.4 billion) of debt as of Sept. 16, official
data show. Overseas funds held $138.5 billion of equities as of
Sept. 13, according to exchange data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign investors own about 2 percent of India&#8217;s $550
billion of rupee-denominated sovereign debt compared with 41
percent in Malaysia and 31 percent each in Indonesia and Brazil,
Standard Chartered estimated in a Sept. 12 research note.
Romania&#8217;s inclusion in JPMorgan GBI-EM index in March was
estimated to boost inflows by $2 billion, while the addition of
Nigerian debt in October last year was seen to lure $1.5 billion
to the country, according analysts at the U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darrell Wright, head of communications and media relations
at JPMorgan in Singapore, said the lender couldn&#8217;t immediately
comment on India&#8217;s case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Portfolio Inflows &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would expect portfolio inflows to pick up as India
joins global indices,&#8221; said Holger Friedrich, who manages $490
million of bonds in London at Lombard Odier Investment
Manangement. &#8220;It would be helpful in the long run, if combined
with reasonable macro long-term measures addressing structural
weaknesses, not just short-term steps to fix the currency
weakness.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit of Lombard Odier  Cie., a Geneva-based private
bank that managed $183 billion globally as of June, has a quota
to buy Indian government debt, Friedrich said in a Sept. 13
telephone interview. The notes have a 7 percent weight in its
in-house index for local-currency debt, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on India&#8217;s 7.16 percent rupee-denominated bond
due May 2023 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 8.395 percent as of 2:08 p.m. in Mumbai, according to central
bank prices. It reached a five-year high of 9.24 percent on Aug.
19. The rupee fell 0.4 percent to 63.11 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring bonds of State Bank of India (SBIN),
considered a proxy for the government by some investors, against
non-payment for five years fell 5 basis points yesterday to 326,
a sixth day of decline, according to data provider CMA. The
credit-default swaps surged 106 basis points in August, the most
since October 2008, and reached a 14-month high of 372 on Aug.
20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Twin Deficits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s currency and bonds have declined this year as
Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy expanded 4.4 percent last quarter
from a year earlier, the least since the three months ended
March 2009, and amid the nation&#8217;s twin current-account and
budget deficits. Foreign investors pulled $3.7 billion from
stocks in the three months through Aug. 31 as capital fled
emerging markets amid prospects of the Federal Reserve reducing
its record stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortfall in the current account, the broadest measure
of trade, widened to a record 4.8 percent of GDP in the year
ended March 31, official data show. The Reserve Bank of India
considers the gap the biggest risk to India&#8217;s economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2012, then RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said
that though limits for foreign investment in corporate and
government debt have been expanded marginally, the changes were
only meant to gauge market appetite and were not a sign that
caps will be increased further. The central bank prefers non-debt flows over debt flows, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yield Swings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perception that higher bond inflows would stoke market
volatility isn&#8217;t entirely true, Standard Chartered&#8217;s Kulkarni
said. Data compiled by the U.K. lender show yield swings in the
past three years have been larger in India than in markets like
South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand that have embraced larger
inflows, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be eligible for inclusion in global bond indexes India
shouldn&#8217;t have explicit capital controls, must allow its
currency to be freely traded and encourage foreign
participation, Standard Chartered said in its report, citing
criteria for benchmarks compiled by banks including JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;India will see committed long-term flows if some of the
caps are eased, and that will benefit its economy and investor
community,&#8221; Walter Rossini, who oversees $200 million of Indian
assets at Aletti Gestielle in Milan, said in a Sept. 12
telephone interview. &#8220;It will lift confidence by more than just
a notch.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) isn&#8217;t the only Web
property with a new look. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Bing search engine
is unveiling today a revamped website with a redesigned logo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brand features a simpler typeface &#8220;created to be
simple, real and direct&#8221; that better matches the font used on
other Microsoft products, Scott Erickson, senior director, brand
and creative at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post. The company
also changed how it displays search results, moving from three
columns to two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been rolling out changes to Bing about twice
a year and last unveiled a new design in May 2012, seeking to
attract more search users and narrow the gap with Google Inc. (GOOG)
The No. 1 software maker is undergoing a management transition
and struggling to break into mobile devices as users shift away
from personal computers, while keeping up investment in Web
services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had 17.9 percent of the search market in August,
up one percentage point from March, according to ComScore Inc. (SCOR)
Google leads with a 66.9 percent share, while Yahoo trails both
at 11.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said in July that
its online-services business, largely advertising revenue from
Bing and other online properties, posted an operating loss of
$1.28 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) unit put its
Century Park property, a Los Angeles office complex where
Creative Artists Agency has its headquarters, up for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Asset Management is marketing the 3.2 million-square-foot (297,000-square-meter) Century Park on behalf of
institutional investors, said Darin Oduyoye, a New York-based
spokesman for the company. The property, located in the Century
City business district, may fetch more than $2 billion, said a
person with knowledge of the plans who asked not to be
identified because the expected price isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex has two 44-story towers housing high-end
offices along with stores and restaurants, as well as a 4-acre
(1.6-hectare) park and the Annenberg Space for Photography. A
sale may come by the end of the year, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastdil Secured LLC is the broker marketing the complex,
Oduyoye said. Martha Wallau, a spokeswoman for Eastdil, didn&#8217;t
return a telephone call seeking comment late yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX) in April planned to market a 21-story

&lt;p&gt;Essent Group Ltd., the mortgage
insurer backed by investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and George Soros, filed for an initial public offering as
investors pour capital into companies that guaranty home loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Barclays Plc are
managing the share sale, Bermuda-based Essent said yesterday in
a regulatory filing. The proposed $287.5 million offering size
is a placeholder amount used to calculate registration fees and
may change. The prospectus didn&#8217;t include information about the
insurer&#8217;s implied valuation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage insurers have rallied this year as the U.S.
residential real estate market rebounds and the government
weighs scaling back its role in housing finance. MGIC Investment
Corp. (MTG) and Radian Group Inc. sold stock and notes this year to
rebuild capital. Losses had mounted at the companies as
homeowners defaulted during the housing slump, triggering
payouts on policies sold prior to the crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essent was created &#8220;to serve the U.S. housing finance
industry at a time when the demands of the financial crisis and
a rapidly changing business environment created the need for a
new, privately funded mortgage insurance company,&#8221; the firm
said in the filing. Its mortgage guarantee unit was formed in
late 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following year, Essent agreed to pay as much as $30
million for software and other assets from Triad Guaranty Inc.,
a mortgage insurer hobbled by losses from soured home loans.
Competitor PMI Group Inc. ceased writing new coverage and filed
for bankruptcy in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Essent&#8217;s Expansion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As those companies stopped writing new business, Essent
expanded. The firm accounted for 9.2 percent of coverage sales
in the first six months of this year, up from 5.2 percent a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Inside Mortgage Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer posted net income of $30.8 million in the six
months ended June 30, compared with a net loss of $12.5 million
a year earlier, according to the filing. Premium revenue more
than tripled from the same period in 2012, as losses and
expenses were almost unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the offering may be used for &#8220;capital
contributions to support the growth of our insurance
subsidiaries,&#8221; according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essent&#8217;s investors include New York-based Goldman Sachs and
Valorina LLC, which is majority owned by an entity that&#8217;s
managed by Soros Fund Management LLC, according to the filing.
The company is planning to list its shares on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker ESNT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage insurers may benefit as the U.S. retools the
housing-finance system. President Barack Obama said in a speech
last month the government should play a smaller role covering
soured home loans and that private capital should take more risk
as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are wound down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is poised to
pay about $900 million to settle U.S. and U.K. claims that lax
internal controls led the bank to provide inaccurate information
about last year&#8217;s record trading loss to the board, investors
and regulators, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is set to announce deals today with four
regulators over its handling of the trades by an employee known
as the London Whale because his bets were so large, the people
said, requesting anonymity because talks were private.
Separately, the firm may also pay less than $80 million to
settle two watchdogs&#8217; probes tied to consumer lending practices,
two people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, whose pay was cut in
half last year after the board said he was partially responsible
for faulty oversight of the trades, told employees in a Sept. 17
memo the bank is making an &#8220;unprecedented effort&#8221; to simplify
its business, overhaul controls and improve relations with
regulators. The firm has been beset by inquiries this year,
including the emergence last month of an investigation into its
hiring practices in Asia as well as criminal probes tied to
mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package of penalties to be announced today is a message
to banks &#8220;that regulators are going to really ratchet up the
fines if the organization is deemed too big to manage in order
to get the organization to simplify their structure,&#8221; said
Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said Paul Posoli is rejoining the commodities unit to help manage the sale of the company&#8217;s physical commodities operations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Posoli, 44, who&#8217;s returning from a sabbatical, will report directly to Blythe Masters, JPMorgan&#8217;s commodities head, and might be part of the the new company&#8217;s management team after the sale is completed, Masters, 44, said today in a memo to employees and obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;While it is impossible at this stage to predict what the outcome of that process will be, we anticipate that if those businesses are sold as a new, going concern, Paul would be part of the new company&#8217;s management team,&#8221; Masters wrote. &#8220;It need not be said that we are extremely fortunate to have someone of Paul&#8217;s caliber, expertise and knowledge of the industry be integrally involved in charting the future of our business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Dawn Kopecki in New York at dkopecki@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: David Scheer at dscheer@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. warned
that &#8220;negative feedback loops&#8221; triggered by waning investor
confidence are threatening India&#8217;s finances, after state-owned
lenders&#8217; bond risk surged the most in Asia this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank said in a Sept. 16 report the rupee may
drop to 72 per dollar in six months from 63.385 now as weaker
capital inflows force the central bank to raise interest rates,
hurting lenders and the economy. Rising bad loans then require
more capital injections, further worsening perceptions of
India&#8217;s finances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There might be a need to recapitalize banks above the
budgeted amounts, but there is not much fiscal room available
this year,&#8221; Tushar Poddar, Mumbai-based economist at Goldman
Sachs, said in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking Secretary Rajiv Takru said last month authorities
may delay cash infusions into government-controlled banks, as
the International Monetary Fund forecasts the government&#8217;s
deficit will reach 8.3 percent of the economy this year, the
highest since 1987. Credit-default swap prices on State Bank of
India, a sovereign proxy, surged 32 basis points to 307 this
quarter, the worst in the Markit iTraxx Asia ex-Japan
investment-grade index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next-worst performers were also state-owned lenders.
Contracts on IDBI Bank Ltd. jumped 27 basis points to 342, while
those on Bank of India leapt 25 basis points to 325. China
Development Bank was the best performer, declining 43 basis
points to 104. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Increasingly Tough&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs the world&#8217;s
biggest bond fund, warned this week that India faces risks of
ratings reductions. The chance of a downgrade by major credit
agencies is &#8220;large&#8221; even as &#8220;outright default&#8221; is unlikely,
Roland Mieth, Pimco Asia&#8217;s EM senior vice president, said in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Compared to previous years, it&#8217;s increasingly tough now
for the government to sustain the cost of capital infusion,&#8221;
said M. Narendra, chairman of Indian Overseas Bank (IOB), in a
telephone interview from Chennai yesterday. &#8220;A sustained period
of difficulties is inevitable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India may delay injecting capital into state-run banks
including IDBI and Indian Overseas Bank because it doesn&#8217;t want
to lose money on price declines when buying lenders&#8217; shares,
Takru said in an Aug. 19 interview. The government, which
usually infuses cash by buying lenders&#8217; shares, doesn&#8217;t want to
lose money on stock price declines, Takru said. While the SP
BSE Bankex index, a gauge for 13 banking stocks, has rebounded
from a 20-month low marked on Sept. 3, it remains down 17
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slowing Economy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government needs to provide 910 billion rupees ($14.3
billion) of equity capital to state-run lenders by March 2018 in
order to maintain its current stakes, Duvvuri Subbarao, who was
governor of the Reserve Bank of India at the time, said in
October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s economic advisory council
said last week that containing the fiscal deficit within the
budget estimate of 4.8 percent &#8220;could be a challenge.&#8221; The
ratio was 4.9 percent in the year through March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital adequacy ratios at the state-run banks under the
so-called Basel II rules averaged 12.4 percent as of March 31,
data compiled by the central bank show. That exceeds India&#8217;s
minimum regulatory requirement of 9 percent. A higher figure
shows lender&#8217;s ability to absorb bad loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s currency and bonds have dropped this year as Asia&#8217;s
third-largest economy expanded 4.4 percent last quarter from a
year earlier, the least since the three months ended March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Positive Possibility &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on India&#8217;s 7.16 percent rupee-denominated bond
due May 2023 fell 7 basis points to 8.37 percent yesterday,
according to central bank prices. It reached a five-year high of
9.23 percent on Aug. 19. The rupee was little changed yesterday
after slumping as much as 13 percent this year, making it the
worst performer in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think the commitment to banks on infusing capital will
be met as it will strengthen the fundamentals of the economy,&#8221;
D. R. Dogra, managing director of CARE Ratings Ltd., said in a
Sept. 17 telephone interview from Mumbai. &#8220;The central bank as
a regulator will respond to the developing situation pro-actively.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central bank governor Raghuram Rajan faces pressure to
signal a reversal this week in his predecessor&#8217;s tightening
measures. Rajan will hold the repurchase rate at 7.25 percent
tomorrow, his first meeting in charge of the central bank,
according to all 34 economists in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Higher Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, whose report was meant &#8220;to illustrate the
risk of feedback loops, not to predict them,&#8221; wrote that there
is also the possibility of a positive circle in which any
improvement in the current account could lead to stability in
the rupee. That in turn could encourage capital inflows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takru&#8217;s retreat from earlier comments that India will
inject as much as 140 billion rupees by September comes after
the proportion of bad loans and restructured assets as a
percentage of total lending rose to a 10-year high of 10.02
percent at the end of June, central bank data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soured loans in the banking system rose to 3.92 percent of
total lending as of June 30, the highest in at least five years,
from 3.4 percent at the end of March, according to central bank
data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Expectations that the bad loan situation will worsen are
not out of place,&#8221; Pratip Chaudhuri, chairman of State Bank of
India (SBIN), said in a telephone interview yesterday. &#8220;It looks
imminent the government will have to bear a higher cost for
supporting the banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve projections for
where the federal funds rate will be in 2016 are a central piece
of information being released in conjunction with the policy-maker meeting ending today, said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief
economist Jan Hatzius. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That is the first time that FOMC participants are going
to be telling us where they see monetary policy that far out in
the future,&#8221; Hatzius said of the Federal Open Market
Committee&#8217;s two-day session on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s Market
Makers with Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker. &#8220;Our
expectation is that most of the participants will project
something in the low two&#8217;s, but I think there will be a
significant impact from whatever they do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed policy makers will also probably decide today whether
to taper $85 billion in monthly bond buying at their meeting in
Washington, dialing down monthly Treasury purchases by $5
billion to $40 billion while maintaining mortgage-backed
securities purchases at $40 billion, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No tapering would definitely be a surprise,&#8221; Hatzius
said. &#8220;Investors are very much on board with the idea that you
get some tapering.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed will also release its economic forecasts today, and
Hatzius said &#8220;it is pretty clear that 2013 growth numbers are
going to have to come down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The health insurance marketplaces

JPMorgan Chase  Co. analyst who suggested there may be a delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan analyst, Justin Lake, said in a note to

delay the start of open enrollment on the health exchanges and

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s physical
commodities unit is a &#8220;core&#8221; business that provides a crucial
service to clients, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The role we play in that business is very, very important
to users in the market,&#8221; Blankfein, 58, said in an interview
with CNBC. &#8220;Without us in that market, a good credit, a
regulated company, the outcomes won&#8217;t be very good for the users
of the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers have questioned whether banks should be
allowed to own physical commodities businesses and the Federal
Reserve said it&#8217;s reviewing a decision it made a decade ago that
allowed commercial banks to enter the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs hasn&#8217;t been pressured by regulators to exit
its physical commodities units, Blankfein said. The New York-based firm is in a different position than some commercial banks
because Goldman Sachs was already in the commodities business
when it became a bank holding company and didn&#8217;t need approval
from regulators later on, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein worked in the firm&#8217;s J. Aron commodities unit,
which also produced Chief Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz
and President Gary D. Cohn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That is a core, strategic business for us,&#8221; Blankfein
said. &#8220;Commodity hedging is no different to people who have
risks in the commodities markets -- which are real, iconic
American companies -- as their credit risk or interest-rate
risk. And we provide that service.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arcapita Bank BSC, the Bahrain-based investment house that filed for Chapter 11 in the U.S.
last year, exited bankruptcy after receiving a $350 million loan
from Goldman Sachs International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the restructuring deal, a new entity
named RA Holding Corp., owned by the creditors, will realize the
value of Arcapita&#8217;s investment portfolio, the bank said in a
statement on its website. The Goldman Sachs-led loan will fund
cash flow requirements of the new entity and pay obligations
connected to the restructuring, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies including Kuwait&#8217;s Global Investment House KSCC,
Dubai World Corp. and Dubai-based Nakheel PJSC were forced to
restructure billions of dollars of debt after lending evaporated
and asset values plummeted during the global credit crisis.
Arcapita filed for bankruptcy in March 2012 after negotiations
with creditors over a $1.1 billion syndicated loan failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chapter 11 was a challenging experience, but one which
has enabled us to deliver a solution in the best interests of
our investors, creditors, and other stakeholders,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Atif Abdulmalik said in the statement. &#8220;We
will be able both to assist RA and investors to maximize the
value of the existing investment portfolio and to undertake new
investment opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing management team at Arcapita will continue to
lead the bank&#8217;s investment portfolio with the aim of maximizing
sale values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reorganization is effective from Sept. 17. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer, who will be retiring within a year, said
the company is still working to make sure that the personal
computer remains relevant as &#8220;the device of choice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made his comment as Windows, which dominated computing
for more than two decades, now makes up 25 percent of revenue.
The operating system slipped to become Microsoft&#8217;s third-largest
business after Office, which generated 32 percent of sales, and
Server and Tools, which garnered 26 percent for the latest
fiscal year through June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer&#8217;s remarks were being closely watched as he shakes
up the world&#8217;s largest software maker amid a shift by consumers
toward smartphones and tablets and away from PCs running
Windows. The CEO overhauled Microsoft&#8217;s management and strategy
to accelerate development of hardware and services, agreeing
this month to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset unit for $7.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We must do the work to ensure that the PC stays the
device of choice when they&#8217;re trying to be productive in life,&#8221;
Ballmer said at a meeting for analysts and institutional
shareholders, the first in two years. Ballmer said the company
will have to work hard to keep the industry &#8220;north of 300
million&#8221; units. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. became the
second-largest shareholder in Eike Batista&#8217;s OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) as
the shipbuilding unit of the former Brazilian billionaire faces
a possible restructuring of $500 million in bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acquired OSX shares on Sept. 3 to reach a
5.22 percent stake, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in a
regulatory filing today. OSX is the worst-performing stock in
Batista&#8217;s commodities group this year with a 92 percent slump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batista, Brazil&#8217;s richest person until November, is selling
assets and restructuring his group of publicly traded
commodities and logistics startups after a series of missed
operational and financial targets eroded investor confidence.
Creditors representing about 60 percent of OSX bondholders hired
law firm Bingham McCutchen LLP in preparation for the possible
restructuring of the company&#8217;s 2015 bonds, two people briefed on
the arrangements told Bloomberg News on Sept. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
declined to comment on the share purchase in an e-mail sent by
an external public relations representative in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a minority investment that does not involve a
change in the composition of corporate control or a change in
the management structure of the company,&#8221; the firm said in a
letter accompanying the OSX filing. &#8220;Currently, the shareholder
does not target any quantity of the company&#8217;s shares.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSX fetches 0.06 times book value, making it the cheapest
stock among 264 companies trading in Brazil with a market value
of at least $100 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The entrepreneur created OSX to supply vessels to
sister company OGX Petroleo  Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3), which is in
talks with creditors in a bid to avoid bankruptcy protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSX rose 1.3 percent to 80 centavos in Sao Paulo today, the
highest since Sept. 9. This year&#8217;s slump is the steepest in the
Ibovespa small cap index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was
prevented from participating in the Sept. 9 auction of three-month U.S. Treasuries because of a malfunction with the
government&#8217;s online order system, according to a person with
direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One bidder couldn&#8217;t participate in the sale of three-month
bills due to a &#8220;technical error&#8221; with the government&#8217;s TAAPS
system, the Treasury&#8217;s Bureau of Public Debt said Sept. 10 on
its website. Goldman Sachs was the firm that was locked out,
according to a person briefed on the event, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disruption in the Treasury auction comes as U.S.
regulators press for improvements in the infrastructure of
American equity and derivatives markets. Following Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc.&#8217;s three-hour trading halt on Aug. 22, Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White told U.S. stock
markets on Sept. 12 to collaborate on bolstering technology
systems. On Sept. 9, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
requested industry input on safeguarding markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Public Debt &#8220;continues to test its systems
to maintain the smooth functioning of Treasury auctions,&#8221; it
said on Sept. 10. The government said attempts to address the
Sept. 9 malfunction &#8220;ultimately resulted&#8221; in the bidder buying
more than 35 percent of the six-month bills that were sold,
which normally isn&#8217;t allowed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $1.5
trillion asset management unit is buying emerging-market and
convertible bonds as it seeks higher-yielding securities with
the Federal Reserve maintaining its stimulus effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All asset prices are going to be underwritten by central
banks for the foreseeable future,&#8221; Robert Michele, JPMorgan
Asset Management&#8217;s chief investment officer of fixed income and
currencies, said today on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market
Makers&#8221; with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle. &#8220;There are
many parts of the bond market that look attractive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michele said the firm is buying &#8220;equity-like&#8221; fixed-income securities, including local emerging-market debt, bank
capital contingent notes and convertible bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are bolstered by the Fed&#8217;s decision yesterday to
maintain its $85 billion of monthly Treasury and mortgage-debt
purchases, surprising economists who expected the central bank
to start slowing the stimulus program. The greatest proportion
of fixed-income buyers are more &#8220;overweight&#8221; investment-grade
corporate bonds since February 2011, according to a September
survey by JPMorgan strategists led by Eric Beinstein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark 10-year government note plunged
16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 2.69 percent
yesterday, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, the
biggest drop since Oct. 31, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Defensive&#8217; Investors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds in the U.S. are returning 0.4 percent this
month, paring a 4.3 percent loss in the previous four months as
concern mounted that the Fed would start slowing its
unprecedented stimulus effort. U.S. policy makers said yesterday
they want more evidence of an economic recovery before reducing
its quantitative-easing program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors had become very defensive over the summer and
raised a lot of cash,&#8221; Michele said. &#8220;You start to sense that
the market is oversold.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds from developing nations are returning 1.3
percent this month, the biggest gain since October, according to
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Emerging Markets Corporate
Plus Index, as confidence increases that easy monetary policies
will keep supporting riskier debt markets. A Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index of convertible notes is returning 4.5

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, is paying $389 million in penalties and
restitution to settle regulators&#8217; claims that it unfairly
charged customers for credit-monitoring products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank will pay $60 million to the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency and $20 million to the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in penalties for improperly
billing customers for the &#8220;add-on products,&#8221; the agencies said
in a statement today. JPMorgan has already paid $309 million in
refunds to more than 2.1 million customers, CFPB Director
Richard Cordray said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Put simply, Chase was charging consumers for services
they did not receive,&#8221; Cordray said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigation started by the OCC revealed that JPMorgan
enrolled customers in credit-monitoring programs that were sold
as add-ons to credit cards from October 2005 through June 2012,
the consumer bureau said. The bank began charging customers for
the programs before obtaining the necessary written
authorization, the regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer bureau, created by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010,
is conducting an industrywide inquiry into various aspects of
the add-on market, including whether credit-card customers were
unknowingly enrolled in products such as credit-monitoring
services and whether banks properly oversaw contractors that
helped sell them. The probe has yielded settlements with
companies including Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), which agreed to
pay $210 million in July 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Wallace, the bank&#8217;s head of operations for consumer
and community banking, said in an e-mailed statement that the
company&#8217;s Chase Bank unit had stopped new enrollments in the
products in mid-2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;High Standards&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any mistakes like these are regrettable and we are
committed to ensuring our partners and vendors hold themselves
to the same high standards that our customers expect of us,&#8221;
Wallace said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank still faces a CFPB investigation, disclosed last
month in a regulatory filing, over credit card debt sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, the OCC was involved in two other
settlements with JPMorgan. It was among several regulators in
the $920 million agreement to settle allegations stemming from
the bank&#8217;s London Whale losses. The OCC also ordered the bank
repay harmed customers and fix problems with its consumer debt-collections practices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three of the world&#8217;s top 20 oil
companies by market value didn&#8217;t submit bids for Brazil&#8217;s
largest oil field amid lower-than-expected interest in the
deposit, the head of the country&#8217;s oil regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), BP Plc (BP/) and BG Group (BG/) didn&#8217;t register for
the Libra field before yesterday&#8217;s deadline, Magda Chambriard,
the head of Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator, told reporters in Rio de
Janeiro today. The number of participants was less than half of
the more than 40 companies expected by the regulator, Chambriard
said. At least a dozen companies registered, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Exxon, BP and BG didn&#8217;t bid because of &#8220;company-specific reasons,&#8221; the trio are still interested in a presence
in Brazil, Chambriard said, without elaborating. The companies
called to inform her of their decisions, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is auctioning Libra, estimated to hold as much as 12
billion barrels of recoverable crude, under a new model for the
so-called pre-salt region where state-controlled Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR3) is guaranteed operating control of new projects.
Libra will be auctioned under a profit-sharing model where
Petrobras and its partners will give the government at least
41.65 percent of production after deducting enough output to
cover costs. The government will choose the group that offers
the most so-called profit oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Potential Opportunities&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After reviewing this opportunity, we decided not to
participate in the Libra bid round,&#8221; Patrick McGinn, an Exxon
Mobil spokesman, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. &#8220;We
continually look for new exploration and development
opportunities around the world where we can leverage our
experience and technology, and we look forward to evaluating
potential opportunities in Brazil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP and BG didn&#8217;t immediately reply to e-mails seeking
comment. Exxon, BP and BG all won acreage in Brazil&#8217;s most
recent auction in May when it sold onshore and offshore licenses
on the coast of northeastern Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG expected &#8220;low interest&#8221; in the auction, analysts
led by Lilyanna Yang said in a Sept. 4 note to clients. It will
take until 2021 to start selling crude from Libra, about two
years longer than ANP estimates, and higher-than-expected levels
of natural gas at the field will increase extraction costs, the
UBS analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Elop, the former Nokia (NOK1V) Oyj
chief executive officer who is rejoining Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), is set
to get more than $25 million if the Finnish company completes
the sale of its handset business to the software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will pay 70 percent of the projected total amount
of about 18.8 million euros ($25.5 million), and Nokia the
remainder, according to a proxy filing by Espoo, Finland-based
Nokia today. The value of Elop&#8217;s reward is estimated using
Nokia&#8217;s Sept. 6 closing share price and may still change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 49-year-old Canadian, who was CEO at Nokia for three
years, will move back to Microsoft as part of the 5.44 billion-euro takeover announced this month. He is a candidate to succeed
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who is preparing to step down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia shares have dropped by more than a third since Elop
was hired on Sept. 10, 2010, even with the stock&#8217;s gain since
the sale to Microsoft was announced. Nokia shareholders are set
to vote Nov. 19 on the transaction, which will see a business
that accounted for half of the company&#8217;s 2012 revenue, along
with 32,000 employees, transfer to Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares fell 1.1 percent to 4.89 euros at 6:06 p.m. in
Helsinki. Nokia has a market value of 18.3 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to
repay harmed consumers and fix problems with its handling of
credit-card debt collections under an agreement with the U.S.
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank violated rules regarding
collections practices, debt documents and sales of consumer
credit-card debt, the OCC said in a consent order. JPMorgan, the
biggest U.S. bank by assets, must provide remediation to
affected customers, improve its documentation procedures with
non-home loans and review lending accounts since 2005 for
deficiencies that need to be repaired, the OCC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to the sanctions without admitting or
denying wrongdoing, according to today&#8217;s order. The settlement
was announced at the same time as a separate $920 million
agreement with multiple regulators over the bank&#8217;s London Whale
trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The unsafe or unsound practices identified by the OCC
were most prevalent in the Bank&#8217;s consumer and community banking
lines of business, including credit-card services, auto lending,
and student lending,&#8221; according to the order. The bank&#8217;s
employees -- or those of hired third-party firms -- signed
affidavits that they personally reviewed debt documents that
&#8220;were not based on such personal knowledge or review of the
relevant books and records.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank will review files and submit a plan to the
regulator on how it intends to repay those harmed. Because the
plan isn&#8217;t yet approved, the amount of remediation isn&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Steps Taken &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have taken extensive steps over the past two years to
remediate the issues that affected customers and redesign our
practices,&#8221; said Bill Wallace, the bank&#8217;s head of operations
for consumer and community banking, in a statement. &#8220;Although
these issues affected less than 1 percent of Chase customers,
any mistake is regrettable and does not reflect the high
standards we set for ourselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems were discovered by the bank in its own
internal reviews in 2010, it said in a statement. JPMorgan said
it stopped filing credit-card collection lawsuits against
customers in early 2011 and hasn&#8217;t restarted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, has also made the debt collection industry a
top priority this year. His agency, which has been focusing on
the accuracy of information used to collect debts, is
investigating JPMorgan&#8217;s practices, the bank said in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing last month. The
consumer agency may write a regulation to create nationwide
industry standards, Cordray said on July 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in its SEC filing that it had responded to
formal and informal inquiries from both federal and state
regulators on credit-card collections. In May, the bank was sued
by the California attorney general for violating state laws on
the use of sworn documents in debt collection and taking illegal
shortcuts to pursue borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, generated the most revenue from commodities
out of the 10 biggest investment banks in the first six months
this year, according to Coalition, an analytics company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ranked second and Morgan Stanley (MS)
was third, Coalition, based in London, said in a report today.
For all of last year, Goldman had the most revenue from
commodities, followed by JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. Figures
for individual banks weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity prices dropped 5.5 percent in the first half as
Chinese growth slowed and supply surpluses emerged. JPMorgan
said in July that it plans to get out of the business of owning
and trading physical commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from raw materials fell 20 percent in the first
half to $2.7 billion and dropped 24 percent for all of last
year, to $6 billion, Coalition said. Last year&#8217;s total was less
than half the level in 2008, when oil climbed to a record.
Spokesmen for JPMorgan, Goldman and Morgan Stanley declined to
comment about their commodity rankings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said
this year that he&#8217;s open to different structures in his bank&#8217;s
commodities unit. The firm held talks last year with Qatar&#8217;s
sovereign-wealth fund about selling a stake in the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s physical commodities unit is a &#8220;core&#8221;
business that provides a crucial service to clients, Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the largest investment bank by revenue in the
first six months this year and also ranked first for fixed
income, currencies and commodities as a group, Coalition said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Investment Partners,
set up to allow clients to invest with some of the bank&#8217;s top
proprietary traders, is raising capital for a new Asian fund,
said two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund, named Oryza Capital, started early this month,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
information is private. It is overseen by a team led by Hideki Kinuhata in Tokyo and Hong Kong-based Ryan Thall, said the
people, who didn&#8217;t disclose how much money the fund is seeking
to gather. Kinuhata and Thall didn&#8217;t reply to e-mails seeking
comment on the new fund. Connie Ling, a Hong Kong-based
spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia&#8217;s economic growth that has outperformed the U.S. and
Europe, and renewed interest in Japan, where Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe has committed to ending deflation, are attracting
global investors. Inflows into Asia-focused funds took regional
hedge-fund assets to $98.4 billion as of the end of June, the
highest since 2007, according to Chicago-based data provider
Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Asia is still one of the fastest-growing regions in the
world, albeit at a slower pace, so it&#8217;s no surprise that there
is continued interest in notable Asian launches,&#8221; Will Tan, a
managing director who focuses on the hedge-fund industry at
Singapore-based recruiting firm Principle Partners Pte, said.
&#8220;The past year especially has seen renewed global interest in
Japan resulting in a surge in hiring for Japan-focused
investment professionals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) will end its
partnership with &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8221; producer Jerry Bruckheimer as the company looks to rein in film costs and focus
on movies from Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first-look deal with Bruckheimer, one of the best-known
action producers in Hollywood, won&#8217;t be renewed when it expires
in 2014, Burbank, California-based Disney said yesterday in a
statement. They will continue to work together on projects
including the fifth &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision underscores the pressure on studio Chairman
Alan Horn to limit risk while placing huge bets on a handful of
big movies with blockbuster potential. While the first four
&#8220;Pirates&#8221; films generated $3.73 billion at the global box
office, Disney pulled the next one from its release schedule,
and Bruckheimer stumbled in July with &#8220;The Lone Ranger,&#8221; which
may lose $190 million for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have had an incredibly successful collaboration over
the past two decades and he is a friend to many of us here,&#8221;
Horn said in the statement. &#8220;We will continue to work together
in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruckheimer, 67, spent 25 years with Disney, making 27

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, who will be retiring within a year, said the company is still working to make sure that the personal computer remains relevant as &#8220;the device of choice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He made his comment as Windows, which dominated computing for more than two decades, now makes up 25 percent of revenue. The operating system slipped to become Microsoft&#8217;s third-largest business after Office, which generated 32 percent of sales, and Server and Tools, which garnered 26 percent for the latest fiscal year through June. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer&#8217;s remarks were being closely watched as he shakes up the world&#8217;s largest software maker amid a shift by consumers toward smartphones and tablets and away from PCs running Windows. The CEO overhauled Microsoft&#8217;s management and strategy to accelerate development of hardware and services, agreeing this month to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset unit for $7.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We must do the work to ensure that the PC stays the device of choice when they&#8217;re trying to be productive in life,&#8221; Ballmer said at a meeting for analysts and institutional shareholders yesterday, the first in two years. The company will have to work hard to keep the industry &#8220;north of 300 million&#8221; units, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined 2.5 percent to $32.79 at the close in New York, leaving the stock up 23 percent this year. The shares rose 7.3 percent the day Ballmer announced his retirement, then fell 4.6 percent when Microsoft said it would buy Nokia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Challenging Environment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;PC shipments will decline 9.7 percent this year to 315.4 million and won&#8217;t ever return to the peak levels it reached in 2011, according to researcher IDC. The market will shrink until 2015, it said. The slumping popularity of the devices is coming as consumers increasingly turn to smartphones and tablets, two markets where Microsoft and the PC industry have lagged. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Windows accounted for 3.7 percent of smartphone operating-system shipments in the second quarter, according to IDC. In the tablet market, that figure was 4.5 percent, IDC said. Microsoft&#8217;s first-ever computer hardware, the Surface tablet, sold so poorly the company had to write down $900 million of unsold inventory. Introduced in October, the handheld device was aimed at taking on Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad, as well as touchscreen computers running Google Inc.&#8217;s Android software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The challenges are fairly obvious and the questions are about how to execute,&#8221; said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen in Seattle. &#8220;They&#8217;ve laid out a strategy of being more of a devices- and services-focused company, and started to execute on that. Nokia is part of that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hardware Evolution &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer is reorganizing Microsoft into fewer units around devices and services, while separating corporate tasks like marketing and finance. As part of the restructuring, the company will report results from five new segments beginning from the current fiscal first quarter, which ends this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said she&#8217;ll give more detailed information on the company&#8217;s new financial-reporting structure on a Sept. 26 conference call with analysts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer told analysts that the company will perform better in the future by having its business, consumer, software and device units work together. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hardware and software will kind of need to evolve together,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Long Microsoft &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some shareholders have been seeking more of a say in Microsoft&#8217;s strategy and finances. The company said earlier this week it will raise quarterly dividends by 22 percent to 28 cents a share, exceeding the average analyst estimate of 26 cents. Microsoft sought to head off shareholder dissent last month by reaching a cooperation agreement with ValueAct Holdings LP, which would let the activist investor claim a board seat starting next year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it&#8217;s still seeking a new CEO, and didn&#8217;t offer any updates on the process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board continues on the process that we laid out in late August,&#8221; Hood said at the conference, which was delayed by a power failure at the venue in Bellevue, Washington. &#8220;We&#8217;ll update you when appropriate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are only a few companies making the investments in data centers and technology needed to provide future devices and services that consumers and companies will demand, Ballmer said. Microsoft won&#8217;t be &#8220;religious&#8221; about having its services work only with Microsoft hardware, and will keep offering them on Apple and Google&#8217;s products, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also continue to challenge Google, which has secured a pole position in Internet search and is one of the few companies with the breadth to take on Microsoft, Ballmer said. Regulators should look at what he called Google&#8217;s &#8220;monopoly&#8221; in search, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m long Microsoft,&#8221; said Ballmer, who owns about 4 percent of the company. &#8220;I treasure it as an investor, too.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) managing
director Jason Lee pleaded not guilty to charges he raped a
woman at his rental home in East Hampton, New York, the wealthy
beach community on the east end of Long Island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Lee, 37, wearing a dark suit and accompanied by his
wife, was arraigned today before Suffolk County Judge Barbara
Kahn in Riverhead, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee, of Manhattan, was arrested and charged with first-degree rape in August after police went to his Clover Leaf Lane
home and learned that a woman had been sexually assaulted inside
the residence, where several people had gathered, according to a
police statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grand jury indicted Lee last month on one count of first-degree rape, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in
prison, and misdemeanor counts of assault and sexual misconduct,
according to court records. He was freed at the time on $20,000
cash bail. Bail was set today at $100,000 cash, with the $20,000
applied to that amount. Lee left the courthouse after posting
the additional bail. He was ordered to turn in his passport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On Leave &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), seeking to
end probes of a $6.2 billion trading debacle, admitted to
violating federal securities laws and agreed to pay about $920
million for failing to implement adequate controls and providing
incomplete information to regulators and its board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior management knew in April 2012 that the bank&#8217;s chief
investment office in London, which was responsible for the loss,
was using aggressive valuations that hid $750 million in losses,
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday in a
statement. Some executives &#8220;expressed reservations&#8221; at signing
off on JPMorgan&#8217;s first-quarter earnings filings last year as
required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement resolves claims by the SEC, the U.S. Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve and the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was fined 137.6 million pounds ($221.2 million)
by U.K. regulators as part of a probe into last year&#8217;s record
trading loss, the Financial Conduct Authority said on its
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department and Commodity Futures Trading
Commission are among agencies still investigating the trading
loss at the CIO, a unit of the New York-based bank that was
supposed to help reduce risk and manage excess deposits.
JPMorgan said yesterday that it was notified by the CFTC that
its staff intends to recommend enforcement action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more than $6.2 billion in losses led to the indictment
of two former traders this week, the departure of at least four
senior managers and a blow to the reputation of Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, whose pay was cut in half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan restated results and its market value fell by
almost $51 billion after disclosing errant bets made by Bruno
Iksil, a trader who became known as the London Whale because his
positions were so large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cr-00707,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Martin-Artajo, 13-cv-05677, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Insurers Agree to Audit Workplace Pension Plans in OFT Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. insurers agreed to audit some pension plans as part of
a settlement with regulators reviewing the 275 billion-pound
($442 billion) market for defined contribution workplace
pensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees for the pension plans are too high and not always
transparent to consumers, the Office of Fair Trading said in a
report yesterday. The Association of British Insurers agreed to
conduct an immediate audit of older and high-charging contract
and bundled-trust schemes, containing about 30 billion pounds of
savings, to ensure participants understand the plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator began an investigation into defined
contribution workplace pension plans in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We agree with the OFT that it is important to review
charges to ensure they represent good value for money for
today&#8217;s employers and savers,&#8221; Otto Thoresen, the ABI&#8217;s
director general, said in a statement. &#8220;Pension providers have
agreed to an audit of all legacy and higher charging schemes to
ensure any problems can be sorted out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Association of Pension Funds, which represents
U.K. workplace pension plans and their members, said the report
didn&#8217;t go far enough to give companies more choices of pension
plans to offer their employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BMC Software Loses Repatriation Case in U.S. Tax Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMC Software Inc. faces a $12.9 million tax bill after the
U.S. Tax Court upheld a finding by the Internal Revenue Service
that some earnings repatriated in the mid-2000s were ineligible
for a temporarily lower tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMC, based in Houston, contended that accounts receivable
on its books shouldn&#8217;t be counted as debt that would reduce the
amount of money it could bring to the U.S. from foreign
affiliates at the reduced tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Diane Kroupa disagreed, ruling that the IRS&#8217;s
&#8220;treatment of the accounts receivable are consistent with the
dictionary definition&#8221; and &#8220;may constitute indebtedness&#8221; for
purposes of calculating how much in earnings could be taxed at
the lower rate in effect at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann Duhon, a spokeswoman for BMC, said she hadn&#8217;t seen the
ruling and had no immediate comment. Christine Vaughn, of Vinson
 Elkins LLP, an attorney on the case for BMC, didn&#8217;t
immediately reply to a phone message requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2004 repatriation program permitted U.S. corporations
to bring home income held outside the U.S. at an effective rate
of 5.25 percent instead of the top 35 percent corporate income
tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMC claimed $709 million in earnings qualified for the tax
holiday. The IRS ruled that $43 million was ineligible for
taxation at the lower rate because it represented a foreign
unit&#8217;s debt to BMC created by accounts receivable, according to
court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is BMC Software Inc. v. IRS, 15675-11, U.S. Tax
Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-SAC Analyst Dennis Called Uncharged Co-Conspirator by U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron Dennis, a former SAC Capital Advisors LP analyst, is an
uncharged co-conspirator in an insider-trading scheme involving
SAC portfolio manager Michael Steinberg, U.S. prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steinberg, the long-serving portfolio manager at the
Stamford, Connecticut-based fund charged in the government&#8217;s
probe of insider trading, was indicted by a grand jury in
Manhattan, according to documents unsealed on March 29. He&#8217;s
scheduled to go on trial Nov. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. alleges Steinberg engaged in insider trading in
Dell Inc. (DELL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) based on illicit tips provided to him
by his analyst, Jon Horvath. The former analyst, who has pleaded
guilty and is cooperating with the U.S., is scheduled to be a
witness at Steinberg&#8217;s trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a memo to Steinberg&#8217;s lawyers providing details on the
alleged conspiracy, prosecutors in the office of Manhattan U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara said Horvath and Dennis were part of a
group of six analysts who obtained and passed nonpublic
information about stocks in at least 10 other technology
companies including Volterra Semiconductor Corp. (VLTR) and PMCS Sierra
Inc. Some of the tips were passed to former Diamondback Capital
Management LLC analyst Jesse Tortora, according to prosecutors.
Tortora has pleaded guilty to insider trading and is cooperating
with the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steinberg faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC at Sard Verbinnen
 Co., declined to comment on the government&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Steinberg, 12-cr-00121, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cisco Officials Accused of Role in Falun Gong Monitoring &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese and U.S. citizens accusing Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) of
conspiring with China&#8217;s government to monitor and torture
members of Falun Gong, a religious practice, have now said
officials at the company&#8217;s headquarters in San Jose, California,
were directly involved with human rights abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco&#8217;s main office helped design the surveillance and
internal security network known as &#8220;Golden Shield,&#8221; according
to an amended lawsuit filed Sept. 18 in federal court in San
Jose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revised complaint &#8220;more directly ties&#8221; Cisco and its
San Jose headquarters to human rights abuses against Falun Gong,
the plaintiffs said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their suit against Cisco, the world&#8217;s biggest networking
equipment maker, unidentified Chinese and U.S. citizens alleged
that the company has collaborated with the Chinese Communist
Party to intercept communications of Falun Gong believers, who
were arrested, detained and tortured because of their religious
beliefs. The claim was originally filed in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cisco continues to believe the entire case is without
merit and will file a motion to dismiss the amended complaint,&#8221;
spokeswoman Kristin Carvell said Sept. 18 in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs have recycled previous allegations to try to
overcome a Supreme Court decision that the claims can&#8217;t be
brought in U.S. courts, Carvell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Doe I v. Cisco Systems Inc., 11-cv-02449, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interviews &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Underfunded CFTC Hasn&#8217;t Grown Much in 20 Years, Gensler Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is
underfunded and needs more money to be an effective regulator,
Chairman Gary Gensler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency is &#8220;only slightly larger&#8221; than it was 20 years
ago, he said. Gensler made the remarks at a conference yesterday
in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t oversee swaps 20 years ago, we didn&#8217;t have
electronic trading,&#8221; Gensler said. &#8220;It&#8217;s critical for the
public&#8217;s confidence in a market that a regulator is well-funded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comings and Goings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ASX Board Members Resign After SEC Action Against Hedge Fund &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shane Finemore and Russell Aboud resigned from the board of
ASX Ltd. (ASX) after their hedge fund, Manikay Partners LLC, agreed to
settle claims of improperly buying shares of companies they had
bet against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aboud said by phone yesterday that he told ASX Chairman
Rick Holliday Smith he would resign. New York-based Manikay
agreed to pay $2.6 million to settle the action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund was sanctioned by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission as part of an enforcement against 23 firms,
the agency said in a statement Sept. 17. Aboud, a member of the
ASX board, is chairman of the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said while he doesn&#8217;t believe there are governance
issues at ASX, &#8220;even a perception of an issue has the ability
to damage&#8221; the company. Therefore, resigning was the right
thing to do, he said. Aboud said the action stemmed from a
Citigroup Inc. (C) share sale in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASX board member Finemore is the managing partner of
Manikay. Finemore didn&#8217;t respond to e-mailed requests for
comment. The company made no admission of guilt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASX confirmed the two resignations in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms cited in the cases allegedly bought shares from
an underwriter, broker or dealer participating in a share sale
after having sold short the same security during the restricted
period, according to the SEC statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi holding group Senaat,
which owns companies including National Petroleum Construction
Co., hired HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) for a
share sale, two people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company appointed the banks as joint book runners for
an initial public offering this year, the people said, declining
to be identified because the matter isn&#8217;t public. Senaat Chief
Financial Officer Jassem Saleh Busaibe declined to comment, as
did a spokesman for HSBC. Calls to JPMorgan&#8217;s media office in
London outside of office hours weren&#8217;t immediately answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senaat is among United Arab Emirates&#8217; companies planning
share sales after stock values surged. Abu Dhabi&#8217;s benchmark ADX
General Index gained 45 percent this year, while the government
forecasts average economic growth of 4.6 percent between 2012
and 2015, more than twice as fast as the previous four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senaat, which also owns Emirates Steel Industries PJSC,
posted a 7 percent rise in revenue to 12.3 billion dirhams ($3.3
billion) in 2012, while assets rose 8 percent to 25.4 billion
dirhams, according to a statement on the company&#8217;s website.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
rose 8 percent to 2.3 billion dirhams in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just Falafel, the U.A.E. fast-food chain, is weighing the
sale of a 25 percent stake in an initial public offering, two
people with knowledge of the matter said last week. Gulf
Capital, the Abu Dhabi-based private equity firm, hired
Rothschild to advise on a share sale of its Gulf Marine unit,
while private equity firm Abraaj Group is planning an IPO of its
Stanford Marine Group unit in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French police seized 1.3 metric
tons (2,866 pounds) of pure cocaine carried on an Air France
passenger plane from Caracas as well as 400 kilograms (881
pounds) transported by truck, Journal Du Dimanche reported,
citing comments by prosecutors in Nanterre yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors held a press conference in the Paris suburb, at
which France&#8217;s Interior Minister Manuel Valls was present, to
discuss the haul, an Interior Ministry spokesman said by phone
today. He declined to confirm details reported by the newspaper,
referring calls to prosecutors, who couldn&#8217;t immediately be
reached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Air France is cooperating closely with the Interior
Ministry, which has requested maximum confidentiality in this
investigation,&#8221; airline spokesman Herve Erschler said by
telephone today. An internal investigation is also under way, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contraband, confiscated on Sept. 11, was stored in 31
suitcases checked in by passengers who didn&#8217;t board the plane,
Journal Du Dimanche reported. The second seizure was from a
truck destined for Luxembourg from the eastern part of France,
the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugs were seized after an investigation by French
judicial police collaborating with their Spanish, British and
Dutch counterparts that was under way for several weeks,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sotheby&#8217;s (BID), the New York auctioneer
under pressure to improve returns, said Patrick McClymont, a
partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is replacing its chief
financial officer of 17 years, William Sheridan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1991 graduate of Cornell University, McClymont has been a
managing director in investment banking at Goldman since 1998,
Sotheby&#8217;s said in a release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gully, a Sotheby&#8217;s spokesman, said the move is
unrelated to corporate activism by investor Daniel Loeb, whose
Third Point LLC has taken a 5.7 percent stake in the auction
house, according to an Aug. 26 filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge-fund company &#8220;intends to engage in a dialogue
with members of the board or management&#8221; that may relate &#8220;to
potential changes of strategy and leadership,&#8221; the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bill and Sotheby&#8217;s came to a mutual agreement that he
would no longer serve as CFO after being at Sotheby&#8217;s for 17
years,&#8221; Gully said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McClymont takes over Oct. 7. Sheridan will remain at the
company until the end of the year, according to the release. The
company said on Sept. 11 that it&#8217;s &#8220;conducting a thorough
review of its capital allocation and financial policies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced two new versions of its Surface tablet, the software maker&#8217;s latest bid to challenge Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in the hardware market after its first devices fell flat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new Surface Pro, powered by an Intel Corp. chip, is 20 percent faster and features an all-day battery with 75 percent more life, Panos Panay, the company&#8217;s Surface vice president, said at an event in New York today. The Surface 2 has a high-definition screen and 25 percent better battery life, and runs on an Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) chip based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft jumped into the touch-screen tablet market, dominated by Apple&#8217;s iPad and models running Google Inc.&#8217;s Android software, in June 2012 with the announcement of its first Surface. Designed to keep its Windows software relevant as consumers shift to tablets from personal computers and laptops, the Surface instead generated such little demand that Microsoft took a $900 million inventory writedown last quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft &#8220;bet the farm on touch and tablet,&#8221; said Wes Miller, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, a Kirkland, Washington-based research firm. They&#8217;ve &#8220;got to move some serious tablets,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Thinner Covers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the devices will go on sale on Oct. 22. The Pro, which runs on Intel&#8217;s Haswell chip, starts at $899, and the Surface 2, the successor to the Surface RT, starts at $449. The company also introduced new, thinner versions of the device&#8217;s covers that come with built-in keyboards -- and one model boosts the tablets&#8217; battery life even further. There&#8217;s also a docking station that lets the Surface Pro connect to a computer monitor and speakers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the most powerful tablet in the world,&#8221; Panay said of the new Surface Pro. &#8220;This thing&#8217;s a beast.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Surface 2 is priced at $50 less than its predecessor when it was introduced. The new Pro starts at the same price as the earlier model when it debuted. That may still be too high to attract more buyers, though Microsoft has packed more powerful chips and hardware into the Pro to try to make it a better value, Miller said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be interesting to see how the market receives it -- they&#8217;re both still premium-priced devices,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They were inspired by Apple&#8217;s model, which is you create premium devices and premium accessories and you hope that people are willing to pay premium prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surface 2 comes with a copy of Microsoft&#8217;s Office applications, and both devices include free Skype Internet-based calls to landlines internationally, Skype Wi-Fi and free storage on Microsoft&#8217;s cloud service. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Little Traction &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company has thus far failed to get traction in the market. Surface accounted for 0.7 percent of the 44.3 million tablets sold in the second quarter, according to researcher IDC. The device was too expensive, riddled with software bugs and featured too few applications, Miller said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Android controlled 62.6 percent of the tablet market and Apple had 32.5 percent, according to IDC. Android software is used in tablets manufactured by companies including Samsung and Sony Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tablet shipments will top those of PCs for the first time in the fourth quarter, IDC said earlier this month. Some 84.1 million tablets will be shipped, compared with 83.1 million PCs, the researcher said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft entered the tablet hardware market in part because traditional manufacturers of Windows computers weren&#8217;t stepping up with compelling devices. Still, among Windows tablets with Intel chips, Surface is being outsold by vendors like Acer Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), IDC said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hardware Competition &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While giving a boost to the Windows business, the competition hurts the prospects of Microsoft&#8217;s hardware unit, fueling opposition from investors, who have balked at the Surface writedown and Microsoft&#8217;s agreement to spend $7.2 billion on Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;For Windows, Surface is less important as long as other people&#8217;s tablets do OK,&#8221; Miller said. The hardware challenge &#8220;poses an interesting conundrum given that Microsoft just bought a phone company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it sold $853 million worth of Surface tablets in the fiscal year that ended June 30. To sell more devices, the company has cut prices, and earlier this month it started offering at least $200 in coupons to its retail stores if customers traded in a used iPad. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.net; Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;
</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Mulholland" date="Sep 23, 2013 12:28 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-23/banks-facing-onslaught-of-property-loan-seekers-jpmorgan-says.html"><headline>Banks Facing Onslaught of Property Loan Seekers, JPMorgan Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks face an influx of
borrowers seeking commercial property loans in the wake of the
Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision to maintain the pace of its stimulus
measures, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With interest rates falling since the central bank
announcement, after a surge that started in May when Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated policy makers could taper $85
billion in monthly bond purchases as soon as September, issuance
of commercial-mortgage bonds is poised to increase, according to
JPMorgan analysts led by Ed Reardon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both refinance volume and transaction volume will pick up
as borrowers seek to lock in lower rates ahead of the eventual
tapering decision,&#8221; the New York-based analysts said in a Sept.
20 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extended period of low rates, a boon for property
values, could strain investor appetite for securities linked to
everything from skyscrapers to strip malls, according to
JPMorgan. The bank is forecasting $77 billion in sales this
year, with about $56.7 billion offered to date, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for new commercial-mortgage backed securities
reopened in 2010 after slamming shut when credit markets froze
in 2008. The amount of debt paying down during the past five
years outstripped the pace of new issuance, boosting demand,
according to JPMorgan. That pattern is set to reverse as
issuance rises. Sales are poised to double from last year&#8217;s $42
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Net supply is now less of a tailwind for the market
relative to the period when the CMBS market first reopened,&#8221;
the JPMorgan analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian stocks fell for a second
day as JPMorgan Chase  Co. reduced the nation&#8217;s equities to the
equivalent of sell on declining crude prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micex (INDEXCF) slid 0.6 percent to 1,467.62 by the close in
Moscow. OAO Rosneft, Russia&#8217;s biggest oil producer, dropped 1.3
percent to 259.62 rubles. Steelmaker OAO Severstal sank 2.2
percent to 293.20 rubles, while OAO Mechel (MTLR), Russia&#8217;s biggest
coking coal producer, retreated 3.4 percent to 107.50 rubles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan cut its weighting of Russian equities to
underweight, citing a drop in the crude price as the risk of
U.S. military action in Syria fades. Oil has averaged $105.90 a
barrel in New York this quarter amid concern an attack may
distrupt supplies, helping the benchmark index of the world&#8217;s
biggest energy exporter gain 11 percent since June. Crude lost 1
percent to $103.61 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen the Micex gain a lot this quarter, we were
expecting a slight correction, but valuations remain
attractive,&#8221; Dmitri Kryukov, the chief investment officer at
Verno Capital, said by phone from Moscow. &#8220;Oil has been
declining for the past few days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO Uralkali fell the most on the Micex, losing 4.7 percent
to 170.15 rubles. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarus
counterpart Aleksandr Lukashenko &#8220;briefly&#8221; discussed the
potash producer today, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in
Sochi, without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Uralkali Retreats &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uralkali&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Vladislav Baumgertner
was arrested in Minsk on Aug. 26, a month after he pulled out of
a Belaruskali trading venture with Belarus. Baumgertner will
probably be handed over to Russia soon, Kremlin foreign-policy
aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters on Sept. 20. Uralkali sank 2.7
percent to $27.25 in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO Moscow Exchange fell 1 percent to 62.41 rubles. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. removed the bourse from its central and eastern
Europe, Middle East and Africa focus list, according to a note
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moscow Exchange shareholders will vote at a Nov. 14
extraordinary meeting in Moscow on whether to approve the
buyback of a 4.2 percent stake, the bourse said in a statement
on Sept. 19 after the market close. The exchange plans to buy
the shares at 55 rubles apiece, allowing stockowners as of Sept.
25 to participate in the plan, it said. The company will buy the
shares from its unit, OOO Micex Finance, after which it will
cancel them, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymetal International Plc (POLY), a Russian gold and silver
miner, retreated 4.6 percent to 332 rubles, a second day of
declines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alrosa Surges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO Alrosa, the world&#8217;s biggest diamond miner by output,
added 1.7 percent to 35.107 rubles, the biggest advancer. The
company may sell a 14 percent stake in October, two people with
direct knowledge of matter said on Sept. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average trading volume on the Micex was about 11 percent
below the 30-day average today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Ten-day price swings climbed to 16.184. The dollar-denominated
RTS Index dropped 0.8 percent to 1,451.43. The gauge closed 19.9
percent above this year&#8217;s low on June 24, 0.9 index point short
of a bull market, after the U.S. Federal Reserve unexpectedly
decided against reducing monetary stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after last week&#8217;s 2.5 percent rally, Russian equities
have the cheapest valuations among 21 emerging economies tracked
by Bloomberg. The Micex Index&#8217;s 12-month estimated price-to-earnings ratio was at 4.3 today, compared with a multiple of
10.7 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Russian stocks in New York fell 0.5 percent today, while the
Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the largest dedicated Russian
exchange-traded fund, dropped 0.6 percent. The ruble
strengthened 0.1 percent to 36.8721 against the dollar-euro
basket today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has added
trading sessions and increased the money it makes available to
buy securities on its electronic bond-trading platform as the
industry grapples with changes in market structure, according to
a person briefed on the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will hold two daily sessions on its platform,
up from twice weekly when it started last year, and will offer
$300 million in guaranteed liquidity, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because the change hadn&#8217;t been publicly
announced. The platform, known as GSessions, was halted last
month amid a lack of demand, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate bond dealers and investors have started
electronic-trading platforms as they seek to reduce costs and
improve their ability to convert investments into cash amid new
capital rules. The world&#8217;s biggest dealers have cut inventories
of corporate debt by three-quarters since the 2007 peak, leading
to concerns that waning liquidity provides greater potential for
market disruptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While clients have been wary of trading on so-called
single-dealer platforms run by one bank, the sell-side hasn&#8217;t
agreed on parameters that would allow one multidealer platform
to emerge, according to two people involved in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs began trading on GSessions in June 2012,
after a year of development. The expansion will allow clients to
trade 35 bonds -- including investment-grade and high-yield
securities -- each day, the person said. GSessions is housed
within the New York-based bank&#8217;s credit-trading unit and remains
a small part of that group&#8217;s revenue, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technology Shifts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment. The Financial Times reported the changes to Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s system yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corporate bond market is unsuitable for full electronic
trading, according to a study last month by McKinsey  Co. and
Greenwich Associates. The bond market has more securities
compared with listed stocks and its issues trade at a lower
frequency, making a full transition to computer-based buying and
selling unlikely, the consultants said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world&#8217;s biggest asset manager, set up
an internal electronic bond-trading system that would match
orders from buy-side investors, allowing them to bypass Wall
Street dealers. The system failed in April because it couldn&#8217;t
attract a critical mass of customers, even as small dealers
stood ready to aid trading. The New York-based firm said in
April it would instead route trades through MarketAxess Holding
Inc.&#8217;s electronic system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) revamped its electronic brokering system,
called Bond Pool, last year, offering sessions based on client
interest. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. announced
plans to start electronic bond-trading platforms this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While technology and shifts in market structure have added
to the appearance of fixed-income market liquidity, they have
added little depth, according to a July report by the Treasury
Borrowing Advisory Committee. Trading volumes of investment-grade debt dropped in August to the lowest since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s private-equity fund and General Atlantic LLC are in talks to buy a 12.75
percent stake in STP -- Servicos  Tecnologia de Pagamentos SA,
the Brazilian electronic-toll-collection company, two people
with direct knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll-road operator EcoRodovias Infraestrutura  Logistica
SA hired Banco Itau BBA SA to sell its stake in Osasco-based STP
for about 250 million reais ($114 million), the people said,
asking not to be identified because the negotiations are
private. The talks, which include additional potential buyers,
are preliminary and may not lead to a deal, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of vehicles traveling Brazil&#8217;s toll roads rose
4.2 percent in the past 12 months, according to Brazil&#8217;s
Association of Highway Concessionaires. STP sells Sem Parar and
Via Facil tags, which car owners use to pay tolls and parking
fees. CCR SA (CCRO3), the biggest toll operator by revenue, and CCBR
Catel Construcoes do Brasil Ltda are STP&#8217;s biggest shareholders,
with a combined 73.25 percent, according to data on STP&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STP said last month it agreed to sell a 10 percent stake to
Raizen Energia SA, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc
and Cosan SA Industria  Comercio, for 250 million reais, in a
capital increase that will dilute holdings of most existing
shareholders when completed. Highway-concession company Arteris
SA will retain its 4.68 percent stake after the deal, which must
still to be approved by Brazil&#8217;s antitrust regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FleetCor Acquisition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FleetCor Technologies Inc., a Norcross, Georgia-based
provider of fuel cards and workforce payment products to
businesses, said on Sept. 10 it agreed to acquire DB Trans SA, a
provider of payment solutions for independent truckers in Brazil
and also an electronic-toll-collection company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STP, EcoRodovias and Itau declined to comment, according to
officials who asked not to be named in keeping with company
policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to
comment in a e-mailed statement. Pat Hedley, a spokeswoman for
General Atlantic, said the company&#8217;s policy is not to comment on
investments it may be considering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects second paragraph to show Canada, Germany and
Children&#8217;s Investment Fund Foundation are among those
contributing the $94 million.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and the Bill 
Melinda Gates Foundation formed an investment fund that will
back late-stage development of technologies to fight killer
diseases in low-income countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of investors including the Canadian and German
governments and the Children&#8217;s Investment Fund Foundation
committed $94 million to the fund. The International Finance
Corp., GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), Merck  Co. (MRK), Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s
foundation, Storebrand ASA (STB) and JPMorgan Chase also invested. The
Global Health Investment Fund will tackle diseases including
malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, as well as maternal and infant
mortality, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private financing seeks to address the fact that global
health funding barely grew last year. The U.S. and other
governments cut their aid to programs in developing nations by
4.4 percent, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Global Health Investment Fund demonstrates the
potential for innovative collaborations and thoughtful financial
structures to mobilize new sources of capital for social
challenges,&#8221; said Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive
officer of JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;This product brings a diverse group
of investors together around the shared objective of developing
life-saving technologies in a financially sustainable way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the risks of investing in the clinical development of
new technologies, the Gates Foundation and the Swedish
International Development Cooperation Agency will partially
offset potential losses in the fund, which will seek a financial
return for investors by targeting technologies with public
health applications in both developed and emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lion&#8217;s Head Global Partners LLP, a London-based asset
manager specializing in sustainable development, will be
responsible for originating, managing and exiting the fund&#8217;s
portfolio investments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. upgraded
equities in Turkey, Peru and South Africa, saying the Federal
Reserve&#8217;s decision to keep monetary stimulus intact would spur
emerging-market stocks for the rest of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should add domestic cyclical stocks listed in
Istanbul, Johannesburg and Mumbai, which underperformed their
benchmarks since June, JPMorgan analysts including Adrian Mowat
said in the e-mailed report dated Sept. 21. The New York-based
investment bank downgraded Russian stocks on falling oil prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index jumped 2.2 percent the most
in more than two months, on Sept. 19, the day after the Fed
refrained from trimming its $85 billion monthly quantitative-easing program. Turkey, South Africa and India, which are facing
among the biggest current-account deficits in developing
countries, &#8220;are the main beneficiaries&#8221; of the move, JPMorgan
said. Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) and ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) are among its
top-10 emerging stock picks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Fed is allowing investors to &#8216;temporarily&#8217; relive the
happy days of QE-driven EM bonds and equities,&#8221; JPMorgan said
in the report. &#8220;The switch to bullish EM equities was built on
bearish positioning and improving cyclical data in EM.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank raised Turkey and Peru to overweight,
joining Mexico, Thailand, the Philippines and Taiwan. South
Africa was raised to neutral and Malaysia was cut to neutral.
The MSCI gauge was little changed at 1:13 p.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russia Downgrade &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower oil prices are a downside risk for Russia, JPMorgan
said, lowering the country and Colombia to underweight, on par
with Brazil. The Micex Index (INDEXCF) fell for a second day in Moscow,
losing 0.6 percent to 1,468.08. Crude oil in New York has fallen
3.1 percent this month, trimming the quarterly gain to 8.1
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oil price is on thin ice given the receding threat of a
military action by the U.S. and supply appears to be improving,
particularly in Iraq and Libya,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S., France and the U.K. want a United Nations
resolution this week that provides enforcement of the terms of
the Sept. 14 Geneva accord between the U.S. and Russia to rid
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s regime of chemical weapons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities in Thailand and the Philippines should advance,
along with Indonesia, where the &#8220;key risk&#8221; stems from an
&#8220;overvalued&#8221; rupiah and declining foreign-exchange reserves,
according to JPMorgan. The investment bank lowered Taiwanese and
Korean financial-services stocks to neutral from overweight
after higher interest rates helped them outperform. The Kopsi
Finance Index has gained 5 percent this year in Seoul, compared
with a 0.6 percent increase for the broader measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also advised investors to &#8220;stay away from policy-risk sectors that are value traps,&#8221; including Chinese financial
companies, Brazilian banks, Indian materials and energy
companies and utilities in various countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. banks&#8217; fixed-income trading revenue will probably fall 20 percent in the
third quarter from a year ago on lower volumes, according to
Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staite cut his estimate for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s per-share earnings 18 percent to $2.47 and Morgan Stanley&#8217;s 25
percent to 38 cents, according to a research note today. Staite
also cut his estimate at Citigroup Inc. (C) by 14 percent to $1.05. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, and Barclays
Plc have told investors that third-quarter trading revenue will
probably drop from a year earlier. Jefferies Group LLC said last
week that revenue from fixed-income trading plunged 88 percent
in its fiscal third quarter that ended Aug. 31 compared with the
same period in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;July and August were very slow months as investors sat on
the sidelines waiting for more clarity on Fed tapering, Syria
and the emerging-market slowdown, and we believe the weakness
has extended into September,&#8221; Staite wrote in a note, referring
to uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve would slow its $85
billion-a-month bond-buying program. &#8220;In contrast September
2012 was very active in rates and foreign exchange due to
improvements in the Eurozone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage production revenue at the biggest banks will
probably be down 55 percent, Staite added. That&#8217;s because the
third quarter in 2012 was &#8220;a strong period for both volumes and
margins,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1,800 Jobs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, said
last week that it&#8217;s cutting about 1,800 jobs in its home-loan
production business as rising interest rates curb demand for
refinancing. Chief Financial Officer Timothy Sloan said Sept. 9
that the San Francisco-based bank may originate about $80
billion in home loans during the third quarter, a 29 percent
decline from the three months that ended June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staite previously cut his estimates for JPMorgan by 14
percent and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) by 10 percent following their
comments at a conference, he wrote. Wells Fargo&#8217;s estimates were
held flat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think Bank of America will show better underlying cost
and revenue trends than its major peers,&#8221; Staite said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlantic Equities has an &#8220;underweight&#8221; recommendation on
Morgan Stanley (MS), U.S. Bancorp, and Wells Fargo, a &#8220;neutral&#8221;
rating on Goldman Sachs, and an &#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on
Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan and PNC Financial Services
Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, is paying $389 million in penalties and
restitution to settle regulators&#8217; claims that it unfairly
charged customers for credit-monitoring products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank will pay $60 million to the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency and $20 million to the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in penalties for improperly
billing customers for the &#8220;add-on products,&#8221; the agencies said
in a statement Sept. 20. JPMorgan has already paid $309 million
in refunds to more than 2.1 million customers, CFPB Director
Richard Cordray said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigation started by the OCC revealed that JPMorgan
enrolled customers in credit-monitoring programs that were sold
as add-ons to credit cards from October 2005 through June 2012,
the consumer bureau said. The bank began charging customers for
the programs before obtaining the necessary written
authorization, the regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer bureau, created by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010,
is conducting an industrywide inquiry into various aspects of
the add-on market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Wallace, the bank&#8217;s head of operations for consumer
and community banking, said in an e-mailed statement that the
company&#8217;s Chase Bank unit had stopped new enrollments in the
products in mid-2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any mistakes like these are regrettable and we are
committed to ensuring our partners and vendors hold themselves
to the same high standards that our customers expect of us,&#8221;
Wallace said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank still faces a CFPB investigation, disclosed last
month in a regulatory filing, over credit card debt sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Barclays Cybercrime Suspects Arrested Over $2.1 Million Theft &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London police arrested eight men in connection to a 1.3
million pound ($2.1 million) computer-aided robbery from a
Barclays Plc (BARC) branch in the capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money was taken from the Swiss Cottage branch via the
bank&#8217;s computer system in April, the Metropolitan Police said in
a statement Sept. 20. Barclays has recovered a &#8220;significant
amount&#8221; of the stolen funds, police said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men, who are between 24 and 47, were arrested Sept. 19
and 20 and are in custody in a London police station. Searches
were carried out at addresses across London where cash, jewelry,
drugs and credit cards have been found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sept. 20 arrests marked the second time in a week that
London police announced arrests over suspected bank hacking. The
Met said on Sept. 13 it detained twelve men over an attempt to
hack into Banco Santander SA (SAN) computers, preventing a theft
potentially worth millions of pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks face cyber-security threats from increasingly
sophisticated hackers trying to steal customer identities or
access funds. In the Barclays case, police said a man posing as
an information technology engineer had installed a device in the
local branch that allowed the group to remotely transfer money
to accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Barclays has no higher priority than the protection and
security of our customers against the actions of would-be
fraudsters,&#8221; Alex Grant, a managing director for fraud
prevention at the bank, said in a statement. &#8220;We can confirm
that no customers suffered financial loss as a result of this
action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Co-Op Deal With Regulator Cited as Bailout Obstacle by Creditors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parent of Co-operative Bank Plc, which is seeking
capital after losses, may avoid being forced to rescue the
lender thanks to an accord it struck with regulators last year,
according to bondholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-Op Group Chief Executive Officer Euan Sutherland said in
a letter to an unidentified bondholder, which was seen by
Bloomberg News, that the Financial Services Authority agreed not
to classify the firm as a &#8220;mixed financial holding company.&#8221;
That would mean Co-Op can&#8217;t be forced to inject capital into the
lender, Mark Taber, the organizer of a group of bondholders,
said in a separate letter dated Sept. 19 to the Prudential
Regulation Authority, or PRA, which along with the Bank of
England replaced the FSA as the banking industry&#8217;s regulators
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-Op Bank must raise 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) to
plug a capital hole after losses incurred following its
acquisition of Britannia Building Society in 2009. The FSA
granted the waiver to the parent before the completion of a
planned purchase to acquire 632 branches owned by Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY) last year, Sutherland wrote in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liam Parker, a spokesman for the PRA, declined to
immediately comment on the contents of the page-long letter
dated Sept. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FSA granted a three-year waiver from CGL being
considered a mixed financial holding company and put the matter
beyond doubt,&#8221; Sutherland wrote in the letter. &#8220;That waiver
remains in force.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Telfer to Pay $194,000 Costs in Settlement With Canada&#8217;s OSC &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldcorp Inc. (G) Chairman Ian Telfer agreed to pay C$200,000
($194,000) in costs and will be banned from arranging for people
to buy shares in companies he promotes for one year in a
settlement over allegations that he violated Canadian securities
laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telfer admitted his conduct fell below standards expected
from his position in capital markets, Cullen Price, a lawyer
representing Ontario Securities Commission staff, said at a
hearing Sept. 20 in Toronto. Telfer was reprimanded by the OSC
as part of the settlement and will make the payment to cover the
cost of the investigation, Price said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement is reasonable and appropriate, said Telfer&#8217;s
lawyer Kevin Richard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sanctions don&#8217;t include a prohibition on acting as a
director and officer of a public company, which was among the
potential penalties Telfer faced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unitech Can Claim Deutsche Bank Libor Dishonesty, Judge Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unitech Ltd. (UT), an Indian property firm, won permission from
a London judge to argue that Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) dishonestly fixed
interest rates in a U.K. trial over a derivative contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Unitech can&#8217;t use rigging allegations to annul the
disputed interest-rate swap, it can file a counter-claim for
damages caused by the German lender&#8217;s alleged attempts to
influence the London interbank offered rate, Judge Nigel Teare
said Sept. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the swap dispute and any claim linked to Libor must be
decided at a trial, he said in a written ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. judges have taken differing approaches on lawsuits
related to Libor-fixing allegations, which led to criminal and
regulatory probes across the globe and fines totaling about $2.5
billion for investment banks that tried to manipulate the
interest-rate benchmark for profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unitech lost its first attempt in February to add Libor
allegations to its U.K. lawsuit. Another judge allowed a suit to
proceed against Barclays Plc for fraud related to the benchmark
and swaps. Both decisions were appealed and will be decided in a
joint appeal-court hearing scheduled for October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a long-standing case of a loan that was made and
never paid back,&#8221; said Kathryn Hanes, a London spokeswoman for
Deutsche Bank. Unitech&#8217;s &#8220;unfounded allegations about Libor are
an attempt to delay payment and divert attention from its
remaining unpaid debt on a swap agreement tied to the loan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unitech&#8217;s lawyer, Richard Gwynne, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Swipe-Fee Rules to Remain in Place During Appeal, Judge Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s rules for debit-card transaction
fees and processing will remain in place while the central bank
appeals a decision throwing out the regulations, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Fed and retailers had asked the federal judge in
Washington to keep the current rules in place pending the
appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is seeking to reverse Leon&#8217;s ruling that it wrongly
set the cap on debit-card transaction fees, known as swipe fees,
at about 21 cents for each transaction, and neglected to bolster
competition among payment networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by U.S. District Judge Richard Leon&#8217;s, unless
overturned on appeal, will force regulators to revisit rules
that bankers said would cost them 45 percent of their swipe-fee
revenue. Lenders collected about $16 billion annually from those
fees before the Fed&#8217;s regulation and responded by cutting back
on perks such as rewards programs and free checking to soften
the blow to their profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is NACS v. Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, 11-cv-02075, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interviews &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buffett Calls Federal Reserve History&#8217;s Greatest Hedge Fund &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire investor Warren Buffett compared the U.S.
Federal Reserve to a hedge fund because of the central bank&#8217;s
ability to profit from bond purchases while accumulating a
balance sheet of more than $3 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Fed is the greatest hedge fund in history,&#8221; Buffett
told students Sept. 19 at Georgetown University in Washington.
It&#8217;s generating &#8220;$80 billion or $90 billion a year probably&#8221;
in revenue for the U.S. government, he said. &#8220;And that wasn&#8217;t
the case a few years back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank has been buying $85 billion of bonds a
month to help the U.S. recover as it emerges from the deepest
slump since the Great Depression. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and
other Fed policy makers unexpectedly opted last week to sustain
that pace of asset purchases instead of tapering it, saying they
need to see more signs of lasting improvement in the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed &#8220;is under no pressure, none whatsoever to have to
deleverage,&#8221; Buffett said. &#8220;So it can pick its time, and if
you have somebody wise there -- and I think Bernanke is wise,
and I certainly expect his successor to be -- it can be handled.
But it is something that&#8217;s never quite been done on this scale.
It will be interesting to watch.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linda Bammann, a former JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) executive who joined the company&#8217;s board last week,
has almost $5 million of the bank&#8217;s shares, according to a
regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bammann, 57, owns 98,486 JPMorgan shares, according to a
securities filing today. The stake is worth $4.96 million at
today&#8217;s closing price of $50.32 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, elected Bammann
to the board effective Sept. 16. She was chief risk management
officer at Bank One Corp. from 2001 until the lender, then run
by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, was sold to JPMorgan in
2004. Bammann became deputy head of risk management at New York-based JPMorgan, where Dimon is now chairman and CEO, until her
retirement in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bammann also has call options on 32,500 shares with strike
prices between $47 and $50 per share, according to the filing.
Options on an additional 15,000 shares with a strike price of
$55 expired unexercised on Sept. 21, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and billionaire George Soros are poised for gains
from a housing bet placed in the depths of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essent Group Ltd. (ESNT), the Bermuda-based mortgage insurer that
raised $500 million from a group including those backers in
2009, filed last week to sell shares in the first initial public
offering of a home-loan guarantor in almost two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry is rebounding from record homeowner defaults
that triggered payouts, forced almost half the companies out of
the business and pushed some of the biggest survivors to the
brink of default. With property prices now rising at the fastest
pace since 2006 and the government reducing its role backing
home loans, firms that sold policies before housing collapsed --
Radian Group Inc. and MGIC (MTG) Investment Corp. -- are attracting
new investors to replace capital lost in the slump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We still think it&#8217;s the best way to play the housing
recovery,&#8221; Jack Micenko, an analyst at Susquehanna
International Group LLP in New York, said of mortgage insurers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radian and MGIC, which were unprofitable for most of the
past six years, have more than doubled in 2013 in New York
trading. Homebuilders in comparison are down 0.6 percent this
year after slumping 20 percent since a May peak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is forming a video-game venture with a Chinese company to capitalize on proposed
free-trade rules that would end a 13-year ban on foreign
companies selling consoles in the world&#8217;s largest nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and BesTV New Media Co. (600637), a subsidiary of Shanghai
Media Group, formed a $79 million gaming venture, the Chinese
company announced in a statement to Shanghai&#8217;s stock exchange on
Sept. 23. BesTV will invest $40.29 million for a 51 percent
stake, while Microsoft will invest $38.71 million for the rest,
according to the filing. BesTV surged by the 10 percent limit to
51.11 yuan in Shanghai trading yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consoles such as Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox 360, Nintendo Co.&#8217;s Wii U

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s asset-management business hired Gareth Haslip to lead U.K. strategy
for a group that advises insurance clients on investments and
oversees more than $90 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haslip previously was a director at Aon Benfield Securities
and Aon Hewitt&#8217;s Insurance Asset Solutions, units of broker Aon
Plc (AON), according to a statement today from New York-based
JPMorgan. Prior to that, he worked in Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s
asset-management business, focusing on insurance clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gareth&#8217;s extensive experience of advising insurance
companies on their investments will further strengthen our
capabilities and deep working relationships with insurance
companies in the U.K.,&#8221; Douglas Niemann, head of strategy and
analytics for JPMorgan Asset Management&#8217;s global insurance
solutions team, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is adding staff as it vies with Goldman Sachs,
BlackRock Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG for fee income from managing
institutional client money. Insurance companies have outsourced
oversight of some investment duties as they shift strategies
amid new regulation and low interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, JPMorgan said it hired Prashant Sharma from
Goldman Sachs to head international fixed-income investments for
insurance clients. Niemann joined the team in 2012 from insurer
American International Group Inc. (AIG) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs announced the hiring of
Neil Moge from JPMorgan to lead a London-based team overseeing
insurer client money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haslip holds a Ph.D. in actuarial science with a focus on
derivative pricing from Cass Business School in London,
according to the statement. David Prosperi, a spokesman for
London-based Aon, declined to comment on the departure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is altering its
compensation plan so that the company can use special equity
incentives to retain executives during a transition to a new
chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software maker&#8217;s board approved the potential stock
awards, which will vest over a term of at least 30 months,
seeking to ensure &#8220;continuity of key leaders during the
transition,&#8221; Microsoft said in a filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Ballmer, Microsoft&#8217;s CEO since 2000, said last month
that he will retire within a year and directors are currently
looking for his replacement among internal and external
candidates. The change in leadership is happening amid the
company&#8217;s biggest reorganization in more than a decade, as it
grapples with a decline in personal-computer sales as consumers
shift to smartphones and tablets. Adding to the upheaval,
Microsoft said earlier this month that it plans to acquire Nokia
Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the incentive is also aimed at making sure &#8220;key
executives have sufficient unvested equity to provide alignment
with shareholders,&#8221; the stock awards won&#8217;t exceed share limits
previously in place, the Redmond, Washington-based company said
in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Microsoft executives sought to reassure spooked
managers by e-mailing their staff last month to say they remain
committed to the CEO&#8217;s reorganization plan, even after Ballmer
said he would retire, people with knowledge of the matter had
said. Some executives saw an increase in outside job offers
since the restructuring plan was unveiled in July, and others
may be tempted to leave since stock grants and bonuses are
awarded in late August, said the people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J.C. Penney Co. (JCP), the retailer
trying to reverse $1.6 billion of losses in the past year, sank
the most in almost seven months after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said its liquidity will be strained this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares fell 15 percent to $10.12 at the close in New
York for the biggest one-day since Feb. 28, the day the
department-store chain reported the lowest annual sales since at
least 1987. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Weak fundamentals, inventory rebuilding, and an
underperforming home department will likely challenge J.C.
Penney&#8217;s liquidity levels in the third quarter,&#8221; Kristen McDuffy, at New York-based analyst for Goldman, wrote yesterday
in a note to clients. &#8220;In order to safeguard against a
potentially poor fourth-quarter holiday season, it is likely
that management will look to build a bigger liquidity buffer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDuffy initiated J.C. Penney&#8217;s debt at an underperform
rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since taking over in a second stint as chief executive
officer in April, Mike Ullman has borrowed money to shore up the
finances, and re-introduced discounts and brought back
merchandise to help recover from his predecessor&#8217;s failed
attempt to transform the company. The retailer has taken out a
$2.25 billion loan, arranged by Goldman, and drawn down $850
million from its credit revolver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
told government negotiators working on a possible settlement

fell far short of an acceptable payment amount, according to a

&lt;p&gt;At the early stages of the negotiations this week, the
company was proposing a settlement of between $3 billion and $4
billion, a separate person with knowledge of the negotiations
said. Those numbers were rejected by the government, said the
person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent proposals have reached higher dollar amounts,
according to the person, who said that the numbers, as well as
how the settlement money may be disbursed, are still subject to

&lt;p&gt;Rambus Inc. (RMBS), a designer of high-speed memory chips, won an appeals court ruling yesterday that
forces the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to reconsider the
validity of one of its patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington said the agency erred in its analysis of whether the
patent was an obvious variation of earlier know-how and remanded
the case for further review. The court did uphold part of the
patent office decision. The opinion was posted on the court&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent at issue -- 6,260,097 -- was issued in July 2001
and was at issue in a patent dispute between Rambus and Nvidia
Corp. (NVDA) of Santa Clara, California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pfizer Complaint Triggers Raid on Fake Viagra in Philippines &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), maker of the erectile-dysfunction drug Viagra,
filed a trademark complaint that resulted in the seizure of 1
million Philippine pesos ($23,028) worth of fake Viagra pills,
the Philippines&#8217; Freeman newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making a test buy, the country&#8217;s National Bureau of
Investigation arrested a Chinese citizen in connection with the
sale of the fakes, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the fake Viagra, law enforcement officials
found boxes of a fake version of another manufacturer&#8217;s drug
used to treat erectile problems, according to the Freeman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer consultant Maximo Ocampo told the newspaper that the
product was being sold by street vendors who were getting their

&lt;h2&gt;University of Alabama Calls Foul on Houndstooth Mafia &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Alabama filed a trademark infringement
lawsuit against an Alabama company that creates goods for fans
of the school&#8217;s football team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint filed Sept. 19 in federal court in
Alabama, the school accused Houndstooth Mafia Enterprises LLC of
infringing the university&#8217;s trademarks associated with its
former football coach, the late Paul &#8220;Bear&#8221; Bryant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryant, who coached the team from 1958 to 1982, was known
for wearing a fedora in a houndstooth-patterned fabric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houndstooth Mafia, of Smiths Station, Alabama, sells
clothing that is similar to products sold by the university and
is likely to confuse potential buyers into thinking it has the
school&#8217;s endorsement, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school also objects to a website operated by the
company and to Houndstooth Mafia&#8217;s application to register the
term as a trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school was unsuccessful in opposing the application. On
July 23 an appeals board at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
found that the school failed to show that the mark &#8220;closely
approximates the identity or persona of either Coach Bryant or
the university.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board said the mark doesn&#8217;t falsely suggest a
connection with the school and isn&#8217;t disparaging. The board
dismissed the opposition with prejudice, which means that the
school isn&#8217;t free to re-file it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the suit, the school asked the court to order the patent
office not to register the mark, and to vacate the board&#8217;s
opinion. Additionally, the school wants the court to to bar the
company&#8217;s use of the term &#8220;Houndstooth Mafia,&#8221; and to order a
recall of all allegedly infringing merchandise. The school asked
for damages, the company&#8217;s profits attributable to the alleged
infringement, and attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school is known for aggressive protection of its
intellectual property rights. Last September, it backed down
from its pursuit of a local bakery for selling cakes and cookies
featuring a red letter A. The school also engaged in lengthy
litigation with the artist who designed the U.S. postage stamp
honoring Bryant, objecting to the artist&#8217;s refusal to take a
license to make commercial prints of images he made of the team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new case is Board of Trustees of the University of
Alabama v. Houndstooth Mafia Enterprises, 7:13-cv-01736, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney Sues Pennsylvania Theater Company Over Live Performances &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s Disney Enterprises unit sued a theater
company in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed yesterday in federal court in Allentown,
Pennsylvania, accused Entertainment Theatre Group of presenting
a stage production -- &#8220;Broadway: Now  Forever&#8221; -- that
infringes the company&#8217;s copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court papers, Entertainment Theatre Group,
which does business as American Music theater, is using content
from &#8220;Mary Poppins,&#8221; &#8220;The Lion King&#8221; and &#8220;Spider-Man&#8221;
without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney said in the complaint that American Music Theatre
advertises its &#8220;Broadway: Now  Forever&#8221; show as a re-creation
of &#8220;the greatest moments ever on stage.&#8221; Disney says the show
uses its trademarks, artwork, songs and other properties
deliberately and without permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burbank, California-based film company asked the court
to bar further infringement of its copyrights and to award at
least $1.65 million in damages, plus attorney fees and
litigation costs. Disney also seeks additional damages for what
it says is trademark infringement and asked that the amount be
tripled to punish the theater company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entertainment Theatre Group didn&#8217;t respond immediately to
an e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Disney Enterprises Inc. v. Entertainment
Theatre Group, 13-cv-05570, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Pennsylvania (Allentown). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Couristan Takes Issue With Rug-Pattern Camouflage Costumes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couristan Inc., a rug manufacturer based in Fort Lee, New
Jersey, sent a cease-and-desist letter to two participants at a
conference where attendees wear science-fiction, superhero and
fantasy costumes, the Daily Dot reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rug company objected to costumes worn by two attendees
that matched the carpeting at the Atlanta Marriott Hotel where
the DragonCon event was held, according to the Daily Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carpet-pattern camouflage costume was so popular with
conference attendees that the designer -- Atlanta-based Volpin
Props -- began offering similar costumes for sale and promoting
them on its Facebook Inc. (FB) social media page, the Daily Dot
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volpin Props commented on Couristan&#8217;s position that the
costumes infringed in a statement on the Facebook page, saying
that &#8220;the absurdity is palpable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Burmese Artists Say Unauthorized Work Hangs in Innwa Bank Lobby &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight Burmese artists are seeking compensation from a bank
in that nation&#8217;s city of Yangon over what they say is
unauthorized use of a painting they jointly created, Myanmar&#8217;s
Eleven Media Group reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artists said they were hired to create a landscape
painting to be placed in the departure lounge of the Yangon
airport, according to Eleven Media Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artists claim their painting was reproduced on vinyl
with a quarter of it cut out, and then hung in the lobby of the
Innwa Bank, Eleven Media Group reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administrative manager of the bank told Eleven Media
Group that the bank is willing to negotiate with the artists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Indian Director Wins Dismissal of &#8216;Fashion&#8217; Copyright Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bollywood director Madhur Bhandarkar persuaded a Mumbai
court to dismiss a copyright lawsuit brought over his film
&#8220;Fashion,&#8221; the Indian Express reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was accused of infringing the copyright to a book
written by Seema Seth, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Bhandarkar, Seth sued the film&#8217;s writer and
UTV Motion Pictures Plc, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although given almost a year after the filing of the
initial complaint to present evidence of the infringement, Seth
failed to appear in court, according to the Express. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Denmark to Devote More Resources to Criminal Copyright Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark has begun a two-pronged attack on copyright
violators, the Copenhagen Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a plan developed by the public prosecutor&#8217;s office,
the Statsadvokaten for Saerlig Okonomisk of International
Kriminalitet, Denmark&#8217;s so-called &#8220;fraud squad&#8221; would be
delegated to handle a &#8220;substantial number&#8221; of the criminal
copyright cases, according to the Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the local level, each police district will have one
officer designated as the contact point for copyright-related
crimes, and the fraud squad will be available to local police
departments when needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marie Fredenslund, head of Rettighedsalliancen, an
association of copyright owners, hailed the changes and told the
newspaper that that a year ago, when content owners contacted
law enforcement about copyright crimes, &#8220;they wouldn&#8217;t have any
idea what we were talking about.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesco Plc (TSCO), the U.K.&#8217;s largest
retailer, fell the most in more than three months as JPMorgan
Cazenove cut the stock to underweight a week after being dropped
as the supermarket company&#8217;s co-brokerage adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares fell as much as 3 percent to 362.65 pence, the
steepest intraday drop since June 20, as JPMorgan analysts said
the emergence of German discounters Aldi and Lidl may cause
Tesco to go &#8220;through a painful rebasing of pricing and the
gross margin, synonymous to a profit warning.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesco is struggling to maintain its dominant 30 percent
market share as consumers defect to discounters, upscale chains
such as Waitrose and the Internet. The grocer&#8217;s market share
fell to 30.2 percent in the 12 weeks ended Sept. 16 from 30.9
percent a year earlier, Kantar Worldpanel said yesterday. Tesco
is scheduled to report first-half earnings Oct. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aldi and Lidl are disrupting a price and range architecture
that the U.K.&#8217;s four biggest supermarkets used for two decades,
JPMorgan (JPM) analysts said in a report. That is &#8220;of most concern to
Tesco because its prices and ranges are margin driven.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesco dropped JPMorgan Cazenove and Nomura as brokerage
advisers last week and said it appointed Barclays to work
alongside Deutsche Bank in the role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura&#8217;s new food retail analyst David Payne started his
coverage of Tesco with a neutral recommendation last week. His
predecessor Nick Coulter recommended buying the stock before
leaving this year to join Tesco&#8217;s investor relations team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesco traded at 363.3 pence as of 9:10 a.m. in London, down
2.9 percent from yesterday&#8217;s close. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) resumed
settlement talks with the U.S. as the government was preparing
to sue the bank in California alleging it misrepresented the
quality of mortgage-backed securities sold from 2005 to 2007,
according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government informed JPMorgan it was ready to file a
complaint yesterday in Sacramento, the person said. Shortly
after, talks between the bank and Justice Department officials
over a possible settlement restarted, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because the matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan wanted to negotiate an accord resolving mortgage-bond investigations being conducted by federal and state
authorities, including probes by the U.S. attorneys in
Sacramento, Philadelphia and Washington, according to another
person briefed on the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also tried to settle a $6 billion claim by the
Federal Housing Finance Agency and an investigation by New York
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who sued the company in
October over mortgage bonds packaged by Bear Stearns Cos., which
JPMorgan acquired in 2008, according to the person, who asked
not to be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FHFA sued the bank and 17 other lenders two years ago
over faulty mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on settlement negotiations. Adora Andy
Jenkins, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department, and
Peter Garuccio, a spokesman for FHFA, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BofA Told to Pay $2.2 Million in Race Bias Case Spanning Decades &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. was ordered to pay $2.2 million to
black job applicants who were unfairly rejected for teller and
clerical positions in a case spanning almost two decades,
according to the U.S. Department of Labor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An administrative judge told the bank to pay $964,000 to
more than 1,000 applicants from 1993 and $1.22 million to 113
people who were rejected from 2002 to 2005, the regulator said
yesterday in a statement. The lender also was ordered to make
job offers to 10 people. The firm settled separate claims of
racial and gender bias at its Merrill Lynch unit in the past
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Labor Department complaint stems from a routine review
of hiring practices at an office in the firm&#8217;s hometown of
Charlotte, North Carolina, according to the statement. After
talks broke down, the government filed an administrative
complaint in 1997, asserting the federally insured bank was
subject to laws covering U.S. contractors, the agency said. The
firm challenged that authority, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by assets,
said it&#8217;s examining the recommended decision and order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Diversity and inclusion are part of our culture and core
company values,&#8221; said Christopher Feeney, a company spokesman.
&#8220;We actively promote an environment where all employees have
the opportunity to succeed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Chase Said to Be Sued Over Libor With 12 Other Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., Barclays Plc (BARC), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)
and 10 other international lenders were sued by a U.S. credit
union regulator alleging they illegally manipulated benchmark
Libor interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Credit Union Administration, an Alexandria,
Virginia-based regulator, said it sued the banks Sept. 23 at a
U.S. court in Kansas. The filing couldn&#8217;t immediately be
confirmed in court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their alleged manipulation &#8220;resulted in a loss of income
from investments and other assets held by five failed corporate
credit unions: U.S. Central, WesCorp, Members United, Southwest
and Constitution,&#8221; according to an NCUA statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks are accused of giving false information in
response to a daily survey by the British Bankers&#8217; Association,
which asks lenders how much it would cost to borrow money from
each other for various intervals in 10 different currencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libor, the London interbank offered rate, is a key metric
to set interest rates for trillions of dollars in financial
instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The misinformation allowed them to &#8220;benefit their
investments that were tied to Libor, to reduce their borrowing
costs, to deceive the marketplace as to the true state of their
creditworthiness, and to deprive investors of the interest rate
payments to which they were entitled,&#8221; according to the NCUA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerrie Ann Cohen, a New York-based spokeswoman for
Barclays, declined to comment on the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
and Drew Benson, a spokesman for Credit Suisse, also declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is National Credit Union Administration Board v.
Credit Suisse Group AG, U.S. District Court, District of Kansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-SAC Manager Martoma Has Assets Frozen in Insider Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge in Manhattan yesterday froze the Florida home and
other assets of former SAC Capital Advisors LP manager Mathew
Martoma, who is charged in a $276 million insider trading case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. claims the assets, including Martoma&#8217;s $1.9
million Boca Raton home and more than $4 million in accounts
held by Martoma and his wife, were derived from the alleged
crime. The government is seeking forfeiture if Martoma is
convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors and lawyers representing Martoma agreed to the
order, which bars him from transferring the property while the
case against him goes forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. claims Martoma used inside information from two
doctors who were involved in the clinical trial of the
Alzheimer&#8217;s disease drug bapineuzumab, or &#8220;bapi,&#8221; to trade in
shares of Elan Corp. (ELN) and Wyeth on behalf of SAC, the hedge fund
company founded by Steven A. Cohen. The government has called it
the biggest criminal insider-trading case against an individual
in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martoma was paid a $9.3 million bonus tied to the illegal
trades, prosecutors claim. SAC, based in Stamford, Connecticut,
was indicted in July, partly because of Martoma&#8217;s alleged
illegal trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martoma has pleaded not guilty. His trial is scheduled to
begin Nov. 4. It may be delayed at his lawyer&#8217;s request and to
accommodate court schedules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Martoma, 12-cr-00973, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Wins Case Over Interest Deductions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. is entitled to deduct
interest on a loan linked to a transaction with a British bank
that generated disallowed tax credits, a U.S. Tax Court judge
ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loan &#8220;served a purpose beyond the creation of the tax
benefits,&#8221; Judge Diane Kroupa wrote in an opinion released
Sept. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kroupa&#8217;s decision grew out of her ruling earlier this year
that BNY Mellon couldn&#8217;t claim $199 million of tax credits and
related expense deductions for 2001 and 2002 from a series of
transactions with London-based Barclays Plc (BCS) because they had no
economic substance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon didn&#8217;t challenge Kroupa&#8217;s ruling on the tax
credits and instead argued that since she ruled that the loan
proceeds could be used by the bank for business purposes,
interest on them is deductible. Kroupa agreed with that
analysis. The ruling didn&#8217;t indicate the amount of interest at
stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Heine, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, declined to
comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of New York Mellon Corp. v. IRS, 09-26683,
U.S. Tax Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SEC&#8217;s White Says Jury &#8216;Still Out&#8217; on High-Speed Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo
White talked about market regulations, banking rules and high-frequency trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a wide-ranging discussion, White talked about
acknowledgments of wrongdoing in SEC settlements, as well as
rule-making topics such as crowd-funding, which she described as
a &#8220;very high priority,&#8221; adding that she hopes to get those
rules done this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White also vowed the agency would eventually adopt a June 5
proposal to add new restrictions to money-market mutual funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She spoke with Peter Cook at the Bloomberg Link Markets 50
Summit in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Bank Agency Invites Foreign Regulators to Review Its Work &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator of U.S. national banks is inviting overseas
counterparts to find flaws in its practices that may have caused
the agency to miss early signs of the coming financial crisis
more than five years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry said he has asked
regulators from Australia, Singapore and Canada to review his
agency&#8217;s bank supervision methods even as the OCC conducts its
own performance evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curry made the comments in remarks prepared for delivery at
an American Banker regulatory conference this week in Arlington,
Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCC was among regulators criticized by lawmakers for
missing early evidence that the financial system was under
threat before the crisis, as well as for overlooking initial
signs of money-laundering violations at HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and
trades at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll be looking at everything from agency culture to our
approach to risk identification,&#8221; Curry said in his remarks,
&#8220;and we&#8217;ll be looking for gaps in the system that might have
led us to miss problems in the past.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia, Singapore and Canada were selected as countries
that weathered the 2008 global credit crisis well, Curry said.
They will conduct &#8220;an independent peer review of the process we
use for the supervision of large banks and thrifts&#8221; -- an
evaluation he said could be &#8220;frankly painful&#8221; for those at the
OCC, Curry said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mattel Inc. (MAT), the world&#8217;s largest
toymaker, placed the most items on an annual industry list that 
tries to predict the hottest gifts for the holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in El Segundo, California, has three 
items on the Toy Insider&#8217;s Hot 20 list, including &#8220;Sofia the 
First Talking Sofia and Animal Friends&#8221; that retails for about 
$40. Sofia is the main character in &#8220;Sofia the First,&#8221; the 
animated series on Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s Disney Junior network that 
draws on the entertainment&#8217;s company&#8217;s Disney Princess brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two products from Hasbro Inc. (HAS), the Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based toymaker, made the cut, according to the trade website&#8217;s
eighth-annual guide for picking toys and gifts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies could use some hit items for the year-end
holiday-shopping season after toy revenue in the U.S. market has
been sluggish the past three years. Hasbro&#8217;s sales have declined
2.6 percent to $4.06 billion in the past 12 months through June
while Mattel&#8217;s have increased 4.2 percent to $6.5 billion in the
same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, several retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT) and Toys &#8220;R&#8221; Us Inc., released their own top toy lists to
boost interest in the items they are betting on for the
holidays. Wal-Mart&#8217;s top-20 list, which it said was made based
on feedback from 1,000 kids, has 13 items from either Mattel or
Hasbro, compared with the Toy Insider list which has five
products combined from the two manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasbro&#8217;s items on the Toy Insider list include &#8220;Big Hugs
Elmo,&#8221; from its Playskool brand which costs about $60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tablets and mobile devices specifically designed for young
children, a growing market for companies including Samsung
Electronics Co., were represented by LeapFrog Enterprises Inc. (LF)&#8217;s
LeapPad Ultra for $150 and the Kurio Touch 4S from Techno Source
that sells for about $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toy Insider&#8217;s Hot 20: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of Ecuadorians lost a bid
to remove a U.S. judge set to oversee a trial over Chevron
Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s claims that a $19 billion pollution verdict against it
in the South American country was obtained fraudulently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, today won a
decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan rejecting
the Ecuadorians&#8217; attempt to have a new judge take up the case
and to reverse several orders by the current judge. The three-judge appeals panel issued its ruling just hours after hearing
arguments over the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theodore Olson, a lawyer for the San Ramon, California-based company, argued today that U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan has been &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; and &#8220;thorough,&#8221; and that a
switch would be a waste of resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That remedy they seek is utterly unwarranted,&#8221; he said
of the Ecuadorians&#8217; request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents from the country&#8217;s Lago Agrio area near the
Colombian border have sought damages for about 20 years for
pollution in the Amazon rainforest that they allege was caused
by Texaco. Chevron, which bought Texaco in 2001, claims the
Ecuadorians and their legal adviser, Steven Donziger, improperly
influenced a court in that country to issue a $19 billion
verdict in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trial over the fraud allegations is scheduled for Oct. 15
in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how many motions or proceedings there
have been&#8221; in the case before Kaplan, Olson told the appeals
panel, referencing years of litigation and more than 1,400
docket entries. &#8220;Our opponents have won a lot of those.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inappropriate Findings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Tyrrell, a lawyer for two of the Ecuadorian
claimants, argued that Kaplan issued inappropriate findings in
previous orders that conflicted with an earlier decision by the
appeals court. Tyrrell also contended that the judge is
accommodating the oil company&#8217;s effort to encourage courts
around the world not to enforce the Ecuador verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron denies there was company wrongdoing in Ecuador and
claims that Texaco cleaned up its share of the pollution at its
former oil fields, which were taken over by state-owned
PetroEcuador. The U.S. company also said that it was released
from future liability by an agreement between Texaco and
Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, Chevron said it won&#8217;t seek money damages
against the two Ecuadorians in the fraud case. The oil company
asked that a jury determine liability claims against Donziger
and his law firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-cv-00691,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
The appeals court case is In Re Naranjo, 13-00772, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the lender
that lost almost $2 billion during Chrysler Group LLC&#8217;s 2009
bankruptcy, is now its chief adviser as the automaker&#8217;s two
owners haggle over its value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will advise Chrysler in the event of its sale to
majority shareholder, Fiat SpA, said people with knowledge of
the matter who asked not to be identified because the
information is private. The bank was also listed this week as
the lead underwriter of an initial public offering of Chrysler
shares owned by the company&#8217;s other shareholder, a United Auto
Workers retiree trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dual role highlights the complicated path Chrysler has
been forced to take to resolve a dispute between its two
backers. Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive officer of both
Chrysler and Fiat who has spent four years seeking to merge the
companies, is at loggerheads with the UAW&#8217;s trust over the value
of its 41.5 percent stake in Chrysler. Letting public investors
put a price on the stake, through the IPO process, is one way to
resolve the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From a banker&#8217;s viewpoint, more transactions are
preferred to less,&#8221; said Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at
the University of Florida. &#8220;In either an IPO or a merger, the
acquisition of the remaining stake offers opportunities to
collect fees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) hired Mark Alberici, who left Bank of America Corp. last month, as head of
equity derivatives structuring in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alberici, who works on structured notes that the bank
creates for sale to retail investors, started at JPMorgan this
month, said Justin Perras, a company spokesman. He reports to
Jason Sippel, managing director of equity derivatives in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alberici declined to comment when reached at his office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He worked at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner  Smith Inc.
since July 2000, according to online records of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. Bank of America bought Merrill
Lynch in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move was originally reported by
Structuredretailproducts.com, an industry newsletter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets while earning fees and
raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived
from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, or events such
as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valve Corp., operator of the
largest online store for downloading video games to PCs, is
developing consoles that would use its more than 50 million
customers to challenge Sony Corp. (6758) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closely held company, maker of the &#8220;Half-Life&#8221;
titles, captures 75 percent of the global market for digital PC
games through its Steam store, researcher IHS Screen Digest
estimates. Valve has developed a prototype console and is
working with hardware partners to start selling models in 2014,
according to a statement yesterday on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The specific machine we&#8217;re testing is designed for users
who want the most control possible over their hardware,&#8221; the
company said. &#8220;Other boxes will optimize for size, price,
quietness, or other factors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve is going on the offensive as its own turf is
attacked, banking on a growing base of personal-computer gamers
to carve a chunk of the $15 billion market for home consoles.
Microsoft and Sony, which are introducing new machines for the
holidays, have started their own online portals to duplicate
Steam&#8217;s success selling games through the Internet -- as have
Wii U maker Nintendo Co. and publisher Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 1.2 percent, to $32.88 at 1:25 p.m. New York
time. Electronic Arts fell 0.5 percent to $26.47, while Sony&#8217;s
American depositary receipts added 0.7 percent to $21.26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Harvard Dropout &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Valve doesn&#8217;t disclose sales, digital distribution of
pc games this year will comprise $5.5 billion of the $21.4
billion computer games market, according to researcher DFC
Intelligence. IHS estimates Valve generated $1.1 billion in 2012
from full-game downloads. Steam also offers downloadable game
add-ons and multiplayer titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This substantial user base makes Valve and its community
of PC gamers a potentially significant threat to other
established games platforms,&#8221; said Piers Harding-Rolls, an IHS
analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug Lombardi, a Valve spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve, based in Bellevue, Washington, was co-founded by
Gabe Newell, a Harvard dropout who spent 13 years working on the
Windows operating system at Microsoft, according to a September
2007 interview with the site ComputerAndVideoGames. He rarely
speaks with the press. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is a pioneer of downloading games from the
Internet and creating communities of players. It started Steam
&#8220;as a little sleeper project&#8221; in 2002, according to its
website, to let gamers download updates to its &#8220;Counter-Strike&#8221; action title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Consoles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam originally distributed games solely on Windows PCs,
taking a cut of each sale, before expanding to Mac titles and
Linux-based games. The new SteamOS that will power the consoles
will be based on the Linux operating system and require
developers to create games using that software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It allows for media sharing across connected devices, live
streaming, family sharing of content and parental controls,
Valve said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Ouya Inc., another challenger to incumbent console
makers, Valve may struggle to get developers to make games for
its operating system, said Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities
analyst in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They only way they sell it is to give us a reason why we
need it,&#8221; Pachter said. &#8220;If they make every game work better
with this OS, that&#8217;s great, but I don&#8217;t see how it becomes a big
threat to the console guys.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PC Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While digital downloads of PC games have more than doubled
since 2007, fewer people are buying personal computers. That&#8217;s
forcing Steam to look elsewhere for future growth. PC sales
peaked in 2011, according to research firm IDC, and are expected
to decline 9.7 percent this year as more users migrate to
tablets and other mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam also faces pressure from Sony&#8217;s coming PlayStation 4
and Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox One, both reaching U.S. stores in November.
They use a PC-like architecture, making it easier for smaller
developers that now flock to Steam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the number of consoles in consumers&#8217; homes,
including the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii U, stood at 238
million, according to IHS Screen Digest. Spending on console
software was $12.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai, former head of
the Japanese company&#8217;s PlayStation business, said in January any
new competitors will have a tough time against incumbents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s really difficult to try and build a platform
business,&#8221; Hirai said in an interview. &#8220;I&#8217;ve managed it
personally, so I know it&#8217;s a gradual process, not an overnight
thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and at
least 12 other companies urged the European Union to change
draft rules that will guide the way the bloc&#8217;s first patent
court operates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We appreciate that Europe has long worked towards a
unified patent system, and we hope the proposed new system will
be a significant step forward,&#8221; the companies, including Apple
Inc. (AAPL) said in a letter that was sent to EU institutions today.
&#8220;We are concerned&#8221; that aspects of the draft rules &#8220;may
undermine these benefits by creating significant opportunities
for abuse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU ministers in February approved plans to set up the first
patent court, paving the way for a common patent system after a
decades-long deadlock on the plans. Costs for getting patent
protection in Europe could be cut by more than 30,000 euros
($40,443) under a new common patent system, the European
Commission, the EU&#8217;s executive agency has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the companies&#8217; concerns is that the rules aren&#8217;t
clear enough on when or how it will be decided whether a
particular patent is valid and that this &#8220;could undermine,
rather than promote, innovation in Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investor expectations for U.S.
inflation have declined to the lowest in more than three years
even as data point to economic recovery, JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
said, citing surveys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While policy makers in major economies are providing
unprecedented stimulus, investors see little price pressure in
the U.S., the euro region or the U.K. over the next five years,
according to the bank&#8217;s quarterly overview published yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors expect U.S. inflation to average 1.68 percent in
the next 12 months, compared with 1.85 percent in the previous
survey in March. Over the next two-to-five years, the rate is
seen at 2.4 percent, the lowest since the July 2010 survey,
JPMorgan said. The report was based on responses from 320
investors including asset-management companies, pension funds,
banks and hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium-term inflation expectations for the euro region
dropped to the least since the surveys began in March 2010, with
investors predicting consumer prices will increase at a 1.3
percent rate in the next 12 months and 2 percent in the two-to-five-year horizon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) won a
tentative court ruling they don&#8217;t infringe a patent owned by
SmartMetric Inc., a technology development company that seeks
$13.4 billion in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald issued his
tentative ruling yesterday at a hearing in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t see there&#8217;s anything to determine here for a
jury,&#8221; the judge said at the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric sued Visa and MasterCard two years ago,
claiming they infringed its patent for a system for automatic
connection to a network. The company claimed it was entitled to
a royalty of 25 percent of the anticipated savings Visa and
MasterCard would receive from a drop in credit and debit-card
fraud by the introduction of so-called EMV cards in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EMV cards, which are already used in Europe, include a
microchip instead of a magnetic strip to access a payment
system. The SmartMetric patent pertains to the process by which
the payment system selects a network for a card transaction,
Patrick Bright, the company&#8217;s lawyer, said at yesterday&#8217;s
hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bright said he should be allowed to take his evidence
before a jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You substituted the court as the trier of fact,&#8221; Bright
told the judge. &#8220;That is reversible error.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Melnik, a lawyer for Visa, said at the hearing that
the Visa and MasterCard systems do fundamentally different
things than what&#8217;s claimed by the patent. An earlier lawsuit
brought by SmartMetric against the two companies resulted in a
court ruling that there was no infringement, according to a Visa
court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitzgerald didn&#8217;t issue a final ruling at the hearing and
took the motion under submission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dispute is patent 6,792,464, which was issued in
September 2004. The patent suit was filed in August 2011.  The
case is SmartMetric Inc. (SMME) v. MasterCard International Inc., 11-cv-07126, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Starbucks&#8217; Trademark Quest Points to Soda-Producing Machines &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starbucks Corp. (SBUX), the Seattle-based coffee chain, filed an
application to register a trademark that could be used for a
home soda machine like those made by Israel&#8217;s SodaStream
International Ltd. (SODA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee company filed an application Sept. 18 to
register the term &#8220;Fizzio,&#8221; according to the database of the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application is for the term&#8217;s use with a wide range of
food and beverages, one of which is &#8220;machines for the
production of beverages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application also lists &#8220;flavored and unflavored water;
mineral water; sparkling water; soft drinks; fruit drinks; fruit
juices; sparkling fruit and juice based beverages; soda
beverages; frozen fruit beverages; frozen fruit-based
beverages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)&#8217;s Keurig unit
filed an application to register a mark it said would be used
with &#8220;machines for the production of cold water, soda, still,
carbonated and sparkling beverages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term Green Mountain is seeking to register is
&#8220;Karbon.&#8221; At that same time, Waterbury, Vermont-based Green
Mountain filed a second application to register &#8220;Bolt&#8221; for use
with carafes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the selling points for SodaStream&#8217;s product is that
it cuts down on waste because customers will be using a
refillable container to make sparking beverages, instead of
buying soda in plastic bottles that need to be recycled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SeaWorld Seeks Trademark on Name of Japanese Island, Horse Breed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS), the subject of a critical
documentary over the use of killer whales in its theme parks,
may be going in a new direction in efforts to combat an
attendance slump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Orlando, Florida-based company filed an application
Sept. 19 to register the term &#8220;Yonaguni&#8221; as a trademark,
according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term is to be used for the &#8220;entertainment services in
the nature of an animated television series for children,&#8221; the
company said in its application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application also covers the use of the term for the
production of live-action and animated entertainment shows and
interactive programs for distribution via audio and visual
media, and electronic means, and for live performances by
costumed characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yonaguni is the name both of a breed of horse found on
Japan&#8217;s western islands, and the westernmost inhabited island in
that chain. There is also a stone formation beneath the sea near
that island that is known as the Yonaguni Monument, and is
believed by some to be a sunken man-made structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SeaWorld received negative publicity from &#8220;Blackfish,&#8221;
released in U.S. theaters on July 19, which began attracting
attention after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in
January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Blackfish&#8221; argues that killer whales shouldn&#8217;t be held
in captivity, and that the company ignored warning signs of the
danger to handlers. SeaWorld has countered with a detailed
critique of the film, calling it &#8220;a dishonest movie&#8221; in a
statement distributed to critics and refuting many of its
conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no higher priority for SeaWorld than the safety
of guests and staff and the welfare of our animals,&#8221; the
company said in a statement following the release of the film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pho Holdings Backs Down in Trademark Claim Against Mo Pho &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Vietnamese restaurant in South London received a cease-and-desist letter from a restaurant chain accusing it of
infringing a &#8220;pho&#8221; trademark, the U.K.&#8217;s Guardian newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pho is Vietnam&#8217;s national dish and a staple at Vietnamese
restaurants, according to the Guardian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pho Holdings Ltd., which sent the notice to the Mo Pho
restaurant, said it had registered the mark six years earlier
and no one else was entitled to use the word in a restaurant
name, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has since changed course, saying it had made a
mistake, wouldn&#8217;t file a trademark infringement suit and hadn&#8217;t
meant to suggest that the trademark conveyed ownership of pho,
according to the Guardian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diamond Resorts Claims Diamond Resort Marketing Infringes Marks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamond Resorts International Inc., the Las Vegas-based
time-share vacation-property operator, sued a Virginia company
that offers time-share marking services for trademark
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamond Resort Marketing Services Inc. of Alexandria,
Virginia, is accused of confusing the public by using marks that
are similar to those belonging to the Las Vegas company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Sept. 24 in federal court
in Newark, New Jersey, Diamond Resort Marketing also used an
Internet domain name -- www.diamondresortms.com -- that is also
causes the public to assume falsely that the two entities are
affiliated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamond Resort Marketing allegedly uses similar names to
trade on the goodwill established by the Las Vegas company,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamond Resorts International asked the court for an order
barring further use of the confusingly similar names, and asked
that it be transferred the objectionable domain name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the company seeks money damages of at least
$2 million per infringed trademark, and asked that they be
tripled to punish the Virginia company for its actions, and for
awards of litigation costs and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit also names Diamond Resort Marketing&#8217;s Web-hosting
service and a privacy protection service that replaces visible
contact information for a domain name with alternative
information, concealing the identity of the true owner of the
domain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamond Resort Marketing didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mailed
request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Diamond Resorts Holdings LLC v. Host Department
LLC, 2:13-cv-05689-SDW-MCA, U.S. District Court, District of New
Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bollywood-Style Weddings Need Copyright Protection, Planners Say &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the &#8220;Copyright of Wedding&#8221; conference, held in

off and credited to others often within less than a week,
according to Asian Age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Menezes of the Showtime Group wedding organizers
told the conference that protecting his work is difficult
because intellectual property rights presently don&#8217;t exist in
the field, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conference attorney Umesh Sharma said when someone
is accused of infringement in this category, offenders often
manage to walk out of court with no more than a warning,
according to Asian Age. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Largan Seeks Seizure of Ability&#8217;s Assets in Trade Secret Fight &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Largan Precision Co. (3008), a Taiwanese maker of lenses for
handset cameras, has asked a court in Taiwan to seize a
competitor&#8217;s working capital, liquid assets and production
equipment under claims the competitor stole its trade secrets,
the China Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ability Opto-Electronics Technology Co. (3362) is accused of
applying for two patents based on technology brought to the
company by four defecting Largan engineers without
authorization, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tauchung Hsien, Taiwan-based Ability has denied all
allegations and said it will file a countersuit, China Post
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Largan and Ability are already engaged in a patent-infringement case that began in June, according to China Post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) will extend
benefits to same-sex spouses of U.S. employees after federal
government agencies altered the definition of marriage, marking
the conversion of one of the last major corporate holdouts on
the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s decision follows a June ruling by the U.S. Supreme
Court that struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act,
spurring changes by the Internal Revenue Service and other
agencies on what constitutes legal marriages, Alan Jeffers, a
spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said in a phone
interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender
community, known as LGBT, heralded the move as a victory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s announcement &#8220;shows the tide is continuing to turn
in corporate America,&#8221; said New York State Comptroller Thomas
DiNapoli, who for the past four years has failed to win approval
of shareholder resolutions it sponsored urging Exxon to take
this step. &#8220;This is a very positive step for the LGBT community
and a vindication of years of efforts by shareholders and
activists across the country.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has long based its employee benefits programs on the
government&#8217;s definition of marriage in nations where it
operates. Accordingly, Exxon adapted its rules to the recent
changes in the U.S., Jeffers said. The company already provided
benefits to same-sex spouses in 30 other countries where local
laws allow for the marriages, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfa SAB (ALFAA), the Mexican maker of car
parts and petrochemicals, hired Citigroup Inc. (C) and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. for an initial public offering of its Sigma Alimentos
SA food division, according to two people with direct knowledge
of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB also
are among the banks working on the transaction, said the people,
who asked not to be identified because details of the planned
sale, including the timing and size, haven&#8217;t been set. Alfa fell
0.5 percent to 36.67 pesos at the close in Mexico City, after
earlier advancing as much as 3.7 percent. The benchmark IPC
index of 35 companies fell 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigma&#8217;s IPO would be the second in two years from San Pedro
Garza Garcia-based Alfa, which sold shares of petrochemical
division Alpek SAB in April 2012. Sigma has been expanding
through acquisitions, with purchases in the second quarter of a
Costa Rican cheesemaker and a Mexican processor of beef, poultry
and pork. In 2010 Sigma bought Phoenix-based Bar-S Foods Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enrique Flores, a spokesman for San Pedro Garza Garcia,
Mexico-based Alfa, didn&#8217;t respond to e-mails and phone calls
seeking comment on the company&#8217;s plans for Sigma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angeles Meraz, a press official with Citigroup&#8217;s Banamex
unit, declined to comment, as did Michael DuVally, a Goldman
Sachs spokesman, and Kerrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for Bank of
America. Ayax Carranza, a press official with Banorte, didn&#8217;t
respond to phone calls and an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfa shares have soared 35 percent this year, the fourth-best performance on the nation&#8217;s benchmark IPC index, giving the
company a market value of 189.4 billion pesos ($14.5 billion) at
yesterday&#8217;s close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigma accounted for about a quarter of Alfa&#8217;s 2012 earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure
of profit known as Ebitda. It contributed about 23 percent of
sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global Atlantic Financial Group,
the insurer divested by Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. this year,
agreed to buy closely held Forethought Financial Group Inc. to
expand sales of life and retirement products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase will increase assets at Global Atlantic to
more than $31 billion, the Bermuda-based insurer said today in a
statement that didn&#8217;t include terms. Forethought had $6.3
billion in assets as of Dec. 31, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Atlantic, led by Chief Executive Officer Allan Levine, is expanding distribution after Goldman Sachs sold a
majority stake in the firm to private investors. The insurer
announced in May that it would buy Aviva Plc&#8217;s U.S. life
business, with $10 billion of assets, in a reinsurance deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Forethought&#8217;s leading annuity distribution and pre-need
business will further diversify our product mix and position us
to provide a full range of innovative life and annuity
solutions,&#8221; Levine said in today&#8217;s statement. Pre-need policies
provide funds that can pay funeral costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Atlantic was founded in 2004 at Goldman Sachs and
acquired Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Co. in 2005.
The firm also offers reinsurance under the Ariel Re brand.
Global Atlantic had $1.75 billion in equity, the company said in
a May 1 statement announcing the separation from New York-based
Goldman Sachs, which maintained a stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forethought&#8217;s surplus, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, was about $470 million as of Dec. 31. The Houston-based company agreed in 2012 to acquire an individual annuities
distribution unit from Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.,
and entered the variable annuity market this year, according to
Forethought&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caskets, Funerals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillenbrand Industries Inc., a maker of caskets, agreed to
sell Forethought to Devlin Group LLC in 2004 for about $280
million, according to a statement at the time. Hillenbrand
started Forethought to sell coverage that paid for funerals when
policyholders died. Mark Kollar, a spokesman for Global Atlantic
at Prosek Partners and David Entrekin at Forethought declined to
comment on terms of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Atlantic&#8217;s transaction is expected to be completed
in early 2014, according to the statement. Debevoise  Plimpton
LLP provided legal advice to Forethought, the law firm said in
an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said capital requirements by international
banking regulators pushed the retreat from insurance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time since the 2008
financial crisis, derivatives traders regard General Electric
Capital Corp. (GE) as less risky than JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) as GE
shrinks the unit and the bank faces billions of dollars in
fines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps protecting debt of GE Capital cost 2.5
basis points less than debt of JPMorgan, according to data
provider CMA. Contracts on the biggest U.S. bank by assets
traded 26.5 basis points lower at the start of 2013 and as much
as 497 basis points lower in April 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price reversal marks a milestone in GE&#8217;s recovery from
damage suffered when the finance unit imperiled the Fairfield,
Connecticut-based company as its access to capital dwindled in
2008-09. While JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
negotiates a potential $11 billion settlement to end a U.S.
regulatory probe, GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt is seeking to curb risk
by plotting exits from some real estate and lending operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;GE Capital is performing relatively well versus JPMorgan,
and the other banks as well, as they&#8217;ve shed their higher-risk
assets,&#8221; Brian Monteleone, a Barclays Plc credit analyst in New
York, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;JPMorgan has been
underperforming for the last couple months and that&#8217;s been
largely drive by the various negative regulatory and litigation-related headlines.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup
Inc. (C) were among the banks that lost a bid to throw out a Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. lawsuit over $388 million in securities
sold to a failed lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in Manhattan today denied
a motion to dismiss the suit, which also targets UBS AG (UBSN),
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) Stanton rejected defense
arguments that FDIC filed the suit too late and that the agency
failed to make a sufficient claim that could allow it to
recover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the suit, filed last year, FDIC alleged that the banks
misrepresented the quality of the loans underlying 11
residential mortgage-backed securities that Colonial Bank
purchased in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colonial Bank, of Montgomery, Alabama, was closed by the
Alabama State Banking Department on Aug. 14, 2009, and the FDIC
was named as a receiver for the institution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The misrepresentations included inaccurate loan-to-value
ratios based on inflated property values, according to the
complaint. Many of the properties at issue also had second
mortgages that weren&#8217;t disclosed, the FDIC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In many cases, the amount of the undisclosed additional
liens was much greater than the owners&#8217; ostensible equity,
putting the owner &#8217;under water&#8217; on the day on which this
securitization closed,&#8221; the FDIC said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as receiver for
Colonial Bank v. Chase Mortgage Finance Corp, 12-cv-6166, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is part of
a group that&#8217;s close to buying a stake in Dong Energy A/S,
Denmark&#8217;s largest utility, a person involved in the transaction
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group, which includes a unit of New York-based Goldman
and Danish pension funds ATP and PFA, will pay more than 8
billion kroner ($1.5 billion) for a stake that&#8217;s greater than 20
percent, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the talks are private. Danish newspaper Borsen reported earlier
today that Goldman and the two funds are seeking a stake,
without saying how it obtained the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark&#8217;s government said in February it will sell a stake
in the Skaerbaek, Denmark-based utility which is restructuring
after losing money on failed natural gas bets. Goldman would be
the lead buyer taking a greater stake than the pension funds,
the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman wouldn&#8217;t say if the bank is seeking to buy a stake
in Dong, according to an e-mail from Joanna Carss, a London-based spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties are still negotiating terms for how they would
exit the investment, the person said. The buyers want a clause
allowing them to sell their stake to the government or a
timetable for an initial public offering of Dong shares, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley (MS) had their earnings estimates lowered by Brad Hintz, a
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst, amid a decline in trading he
called &#8220;a full-scale rout.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hintz cut Goldman Sachs&#8217;s third-quarter per-share earnings
estimate by 15 percent to $2.62 and the full-year estimate by
8.6 percent to $15.59 per share, according to a note today about
the two New York-based banks. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s per-share third-quarter estimate was decreased 20 percent to 41 cents, and the
2013 figure dropped 4.8 percent to $1.98. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the third quarter is typically seasonally soft, Q3
2013 appears to be turning into a full-scale rout in trading as
weak activity and limited risk-taking constrained performance,&#8221;
Hintz wrote. Fixed-income trading volume could decline 20
percent to 25 percent on average in the three months ended Sept.
30, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts have been reducing their third-quarter earnings
estimates for the biggest U.S. banks. JPMorgan Chase  Co., the
nation&#8217;s largest lender, said trading revenue will probably fall
this period and Jefferies Group LLC said revenue from fixed-income trading plunged 88 percent in its fiscal third quarter,
which ended Aug. 31, compared with a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marty Mosby, an analyst for Guggenheim Securities LLC,
downgraded shares of Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Corp.,
the second-biggest U.S. bank, to neutral from buy as revenue
from capital-markets and mortgage banking declines, according to
a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income trading revenue at the biggest U.S. banks will
probably fall 20 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier amid lower volume, Richard Staite, an analyst at
Atlantic Equities LLP, said in a note this week. That led him to
cut his estimate for Goldman Sachs&#8217;s per-share third-quarter
earnings by 18 percent and Morgan Stanley&#8217;s by 25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s (JPM) negotiations
with federal and state authorities to resolve a series of
investigations tied to mortgage bonds are focusing on a
potential $11 billion figure, including $4 billion for consumer
relief, a person familiar with the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount isn&#8217;t final, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the negotiations aren&#8217;t public. Those
involved in the talks include the U.S. Justice Department, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development and New York
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is co-chairman of a
federal and state working group on residential mortgage-backed
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon arrived at the
Justice Department in Washington yesterday to personally discuss
the settlement with Attorney General Eric Holder, according to a
person familiar with the meeting. Federal officials rejected a
proposal&#160;from the bank earlier this week to pay between $3
billion and $4 billion to settle the probes, a separate person
with knowledge of the negotiations said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks are still fluid and the size of the settlement
keeps changing, according to another person familiar with the
matter. The people said they weren&#8217;t sure which claims may be
resolved. The bank is trying to resolve as many probes as
possible before the end of the third quarter on Sept. 30,
according to people familiar with the bank&#8217;s thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking to negotiate a resolution to mortgage-bond investigations being conducted by federal and state
authorities, including probes by U.S. attorneys in Philadelphia,
Washington and Sacramento, California, according to another
person briefed on the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has also tried to settle a $6 billion claim by the
Federal Housing Finance Agency, according to the person, who
also asked not to be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-based bank,
declined to comment on the negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Talks are ongoing,&#8221; Lauren Horwood, a spokeswoman for
Sacramento U.S. Attorney Ben Wagner, one of the federal
officials involved in the talks, said Sept. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, JPMorgan agreed to pay $920 million in penalties
over $6.2 billion in losses stemming from derivatives trading by
the bank&#8217;s chief investment office in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Germany Rejects Plan for $68 Billion Fund to Aid Non-Euro Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany rejected a European Commission proposal to turn a
50 billion-euro ($68 billion) rescue fund into a bank backstop
for member states outside the single-currency bloc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union&#8217;s balance-of-payments fund currently has
about 40 billion euros available, after being used to help
Latvia, Hungary and Romania. The commission, the EU&#8217;s executive
arm, now wants to overhaul the fund and add a tool for bank aid
that could be tapped by non-euro countries whose lenders fail
next year&#8217;s continent-wide stress tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German government and those of five other EU member
states, including non-euro countries, reject the plan, which
isn&#8217;t needed to maintain financial stability, a German Finance
Ministry official said by telephone yesterday on customary
condition of anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brussels-based commission wants a resource that can
operate alongside the euro area&#8217;s 500 billion-euro firewall, the
European Stability Mechanism, so that the entire 28-nation EU is
braced for the results of next year&#8217;s stress tests. The goal is
to reach a deal by the end of this year so that the tool can be
ready by mid-2014, when the commission also hopes to have
finished negotiations on when the firewall can provide direct
aid to euro-zone banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank will be conducting balance-sheet
reviews of major banks across the euro area as it prepares to
take on new oversight duties in the second half of 2014. If all
the proposed backstops are in place, the EU would have as much
as 400 billion euros available to handle any banking problems
that emerge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China May Allow Non-Financials to Set Up Consumer Finance Units &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The China Banking Regulatory Commission plans to allow non-financial companies to set up consumer finance companies, the
regulator said in a statement on its website yesterday, citing
revised draft rules and seeking public opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-financial companies will require experienced strategic
investors to meet regulatory requirements, according to the
statement. The minimum stake requirement for major shareholders
will be lowered to 30 percent from the current 50 percent, the
commission said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer finance companies will be allowed to accept
deposits from their shareholders in China, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Danish Regulator Cracks Down on Mortgage Banks as Risks Grow &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark&#8217;s financial regulator is preparing a set of
guidelines due to be unveiled next year to stop mortgage banks
falling deeper into a funding mismatch spawned by reliance on
short-term borrowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Supervisory Authority, criticized in a
government-commissioned report last week for failing to curb
risk-taking in the years leading into the financial crisis,
plans to set limits on issuance of bonds backing interest-only
and adjustable-rate mortgages in the $500 billion market,
Director General Ulrik Noedgaard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government-appointed committee investigating the causes
behind Denmark&#8217;s housing and banking crises said last week
regulators should have done more to prevent an explosion in
lending. More than one-third of the country&#8217;s commercial banks
have closed since a property bubble burst in 2008, according to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA&#8217;s standards will be based on recommendations from
the crisis committee, Noedgaard said. The clampdown on lending
follows warnings from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Standard 
Poor&#8217;s and the central bank that a shift away from 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgages during the past decade is threatening
Denmark&#8217;s financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mizuho Penalized for Transactions With &#8216;Anti-Social&#8217; Groups &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)&#8217;s lending unit was penalized by
Japan&#8217;s banking regulator for failing to take steps to end more
than two years of transactions with &#8220;anti-social&#8221; groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mizuho Bank Ltd. was ordered to strengthen legal compliance
and administrative controls, the Financial Services Agency said
in a statement in Tokyo today. The unit of Japan&#8217;s third-biggest
bank by market value made loans to the anti-social groups, the
FSA said, without identifying them. The phrase is often used in
Japan to describe criminal organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese authorities have stepped up efforts to combat
yakuza gangs, whose activities range from extortion to fraud and
money laundering, according to the National Police Agency. In
the first penalty of its kind against a Japanese bank since
2007, the FSA told Mizuho to make a &#8220;clean break&#8221; from the
groups after conducting 230 transactions, mostly car loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mizuho made transactions valued at about 200 million yen
($2 million), an FSA official said at a news briefing in Tokyo,
asking not to be named in accordance with the agency&#8217;s policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has to formulate measures to prevent a recurrence
and submit a business improvement plan by Oct. 28, the regulator
said. It will report on its progress at the end of November and
December and then every three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mizuho &#8220;takes this order very seriously and deeply regrets
these occurrences,&#8221; the bank said in a statement. The Tokyo-based company hasn&#8217;t decided any internal penalties yet,
spokeswoman Masako Shiono said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s action is the latest blow to Mizuho after the FSA
punished the bank for a computer glitch that delayed
transactions following the nation&#8217;s March 2011 earthquake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rabobank Said to Be Close to Libor Probe Settlement Next Month &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabobank Groep may reach a settlement with regulators as
soon as next month over claims the Dutch bank tried to
manipulate benchmark interest rates, a person with knowledge of
the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabobank, the Netherlands&#8217; biggest mortgage lender, is
likely to pay a fine higher than the 290 million pounds ($466
million) levied on Barclays Plc (BARC) in June 2012 and lower than the
$612 million paid by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, though it
may be negotiated even below the Barclays fine, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabobank, the only Dutch contributor to the London
interbank offered rate, has had talks since at least 2011 with
regulators including the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the Justice Department and the U.K. Financial
Services Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s biggest agricultural lender is next in line to
settle probes into Libor. The settlement&#8217;s timing was reported
earlier by the Financial Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hendrik Jan Eijpe, a spokesman for the Utrecht-based
lender, said the company is cooperating with the investigations
and declined to comment on the status of the probes. Rabobank in
August said it took a provision to settle probes into Libor,
without elaborating the size of the charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender previously said it received Libor-and Euribor-related subpoenas and information requests in nations including
the Netherlands, U.K., U.S. and Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Capital Rules Compliant With Basel III, Basel Group Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China&#8217;s implementation of the Basel capital framework was
found to be closely aligned with the Basel III global
standards,&#8221; the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some differences with the Basel framework were found,&#8221;
the Basel group said in statement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;None of the findings were judged to be material at this
point,&#8221; the group said. China&#8217;s &#8220;response to the report
expresses the strong commitment of the Chinese authorities to
implement the global regulatory reforms,&#8221; the Basel group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts/Tribunals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GM Suppliers in Japan Plead Guilty in $5 Billion Cartel Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503), Hitachi Automotive Systems Ltd. (6501)
and seven other Japanese companies agreed to plead guilty and
pay a total of $740 million in fines for a price-fixing
conspiracy targeting automakers that included General Motors Co. (GM)
and Ford Motor Co. (F) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrysler Group LLC and Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) were also among
car companies operating in the U.S. that faced inflated costs on
more than $5 billion of parts, affecting prices on at least 25
million vehicles, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a
news conference yesterday in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement brings criminal fines in the Justice
Department&#8217;s continuing probe of price fixing in the auto-parts
industry to more than $1.6 billion and the number of companies
and individuals charged to 20 and 21 respectively, the Justice
Department said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventeen of the 21 executives have been sentenced to jail
in the U.S. or have entered into plea agreements calling for
&#8220;significant&#8221; prison sentences, Holder said. Two of them were
charged yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Hammond, a deputy assistant attorney general who
worked on the investigation said there are &#8220;more than a dozen
separate conspiracies operating independently,&#8221; that all target
U.S. automotive manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plea agreements must be accepted by a federal judge to
become final. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mitsubishi Heavy case is U.S. v. Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7011), 2:13-cr-20711, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ex-RBS Trader Fired Over Libor-Rigging Sues for Unfair Dismissal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc trader sued the
lender over his firing for alleged misconduct related to
manipulation of benchmark interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Green, who traded derivatives tied to short-term
moves in interest rates in dollars and euros, filed an unfair
dismissal suit, according to documents from a London employment
tribunal. He was let go in March, weeks after the Edinburgh-based bank paid $612 million to settle with regulators probing
its attempts to rig the London interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims that traders tried to influence Libor, the benchmark
for $300 trillion of contracts worldwide, led to criminal probes
and regulatory fines for Barclays Plc, UBS AG (UBSN), RBS and broker
ICAP Plc. (IAP) RBS has fired seven employees for misconduct related
to Libor, a person familiar with the matter said in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Small, an RBS spokeswoman, declined to comment. The
bank has said it will claw back bonuses from those involved to
help pay any fines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green&#8217;s lawyer, Layla Bunni, said she couldn&#8217;t immediately
comment when reached by phone at her office in London. Copies of
the employment complaint aren&#8217;t publicly available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green may argue he was singled out unfairly, or that the
bank knew about his actions and did nothing until regulators
intervened, according to employment lawyer Jo Keddie, who isn&#8217;t
involved in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-ChinaCast Chairman Sued by SEC Over Claims He Stole Millions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused the
former chairman and chief executive officer of ChinaCast
Education Corp. (CAST) of stealing tens of millions of dollars from
investors in a U.S. public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chan Tze Ngon, 57, transferred $41 million out of the $43.8
million raised from investors to a purported subsidiary in which
he secretly held a controlling 50 percent stake, the SEC said in
a statement. Chan also secretly pledged $30.4 million of
ChinaCast&#8217;s cash deposits to secure the debts of entities
unrelated to the company, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC also sued Jiang Xiangyuan, ChinaCast&#8217;s former
president for operations in China, over claims he avoided more
than $200,000 in losses by illegally selling shares in the
company on confidential information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChinaCast entered U.S. capital markets in 2006 through a
reverse merger, in which a closely held firm buys a shell
company already on an exchange in order to list shares without a
public offering, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong-based company had a market capitalization of
more than $200 million before the alleged frauds came to light,
the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chan and Jiang, who live in China, have no known defense
counsel, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interviews/Conferences &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dimon Going to Justice a &#8216;Brilliant Move,&#8217; Farley Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Farley, a partner at law firm Paul Hastings LLP,
talked about JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s negotiations with federal
and state authorities to resolve a series of investigations tied
to mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon arrived at the
Justice Department in Washington yesterday morning reportedly to
discuss a settlement with Attorney General Eric Holder. Farley
spoke with Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market Makers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bankers Weigh In On EU Challenges At Frankfurt Conference &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers gathered in Frankfurt at the European Supervisor
Education Initiative&#8217;s conference yesterday. Speakers included
European Central Bank Governing Council member Yves Mersch,
European Banking Authority Chairman Andrea Enria, ECB Vice
President Vitor Constancio and U.S. Federal Reserve Governor
Jeremy Stein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the topics covered were setting up the single
supervisory mechanism and the European economic outlook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SEC&#8217;s White Says Investigators Will Focus Cases on Individuals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo
White said her agency will focus on bringing more cases against
individuals who violate securities laws rather than the
companies where they work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I want to be sure we are looking first at the individual
conduct and working out to the entity, rather than starting with
the entity as a whole and working in,&#8221; White said in remarks
prepared for delivery at a Council of Institutional Investors
conference in Chicago yesterday. &#8220;It is a subtle shift, but one
that could bring more individuals into enforcement cases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC investigators will also seek more mandatory compliance
measures in settlements to prevent future misconduct and not
just punish past wrongdoing, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Redress for wrongdoing must never be seen as a cost of
doing business made good by cutting a corporate check,&#8221; White
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Premier Farnell Plc (PFL) climbed as much
as 3.9 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
recommendation to buy, saying the U.K. supplier of electronic
and industrial products stands to increase market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares climbed 2.2 percent to 215.60 pence at 12:48
p.m., for the biggest gain on the FTSE 350 Index today. That
took the advance to 11 percent this year, giving the company a
market value of 800 million pounds ($1.29 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman upgraded its recommendation from neutral because
Premier Farnell &#8220;is well positioned to take advantage of
improving market conditions,&#8221; analysts led by Charles Wilson
said in a note today. It &#8220;stands to gain market share from
small &#8216;mom and pop&#8217; competitors and improve sales due to its
extensive product offering in conjunction with its improved
online platform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premier Farnell will focus on segments including
nanotechnology, medical, lighting and energy rather than
industries such as defense, which are affected by spending cuts,
Chief Executive Officer Laurence Bain said in an interview on
Sept. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic confidence in the euro area rose in September,
adding to signs the single-currency bloc&#8217;s recovery is gaining
momentum. An index of executive and consumer sentiment rose for
a fifth month to 96.9 from a revised 95.3 in August, the
European Commission in Brussels said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. consumer confidence advanced to the highest in almost
six years in September, and labor productivity rose for the
first time in two years in the second quarter, led by the
manufacturing industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 17 analysts who follow Premier Farnell and share their
findings with Bloomberg, nine recommend buying the stock, four
suggest holding and four advise selling. The average 12-month
price target for the stock is 245.55 pence, based on 11
estimates, implying a potential gain of 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Alastair Marsh" date="Sep 27, 2013  5:52 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-27/jpmorgan-joins-nomura-selling-notes-linked-to-peripheral-banks.html"><headline>JPMorgan Joins Nomura Selling Notes Linked to Peripheral Banks</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Sales of structured notes tied to
the creditworthiness of banks in the euro region&#8217;s periphery are
the highest in six months as investors gain confidence lenders
will benefit from the region&#8217;s improving economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) led issuance
of $42.3 million of the securities in September, the most since
$167.2 million in March, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The notes are tied to the debt of lenders including
Spain&#8217;s Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP), Banco BPI SA of Portugal and
UniCredit SpA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro area&#8217;s economy emerged from its longest-ever
recession in the second quarter and European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi said this week he&#8217;s ready to use another
longer-term refinancing operation if needed to curb market
rates. Bank credit risk is improving, with investors demanding
102 basis points of extra yield to hold their debt instead of
government bonds, down from 179 a year earlier, according to
Bloomberg bond index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Peripheral banks have been beaten up over the past few
years, but there is growing investor comfort with them and more
willingness to take on that exposure, especially in Spain where
the restructuring of balance sheets has been extensive and
visible,&#8221; said Steve Hussey, head of financial institutions
credit research at AllianceBernstein Ltd. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spanish Lenders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish banks took more than 200 billion euros ($270.6
billion) of impairments between June 2008 and December 2012 amid
the collapse of a decade-long property boom that sent home
prices plunging and burdened banks with more bad loans,
according to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. The country&#8217;s
lenders, which have received 129 billion euros of capital
injections since the end of 2007, are in a strong position to
pass an ECB asset quality review next year, BBVA&#8217;s chief
financial officer Manuel Gonzalez Cid, said Sept. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan issued the first credit-linked notes tied to
Portugal&#8217;s Banco BPI since at least 1999, Bloomberg data show.
The largest U.S. bank by assets raised $19.8 million from two
offerings that pay 4.7 percentage points and 4.8 percentage
points more than the three-month euro interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura sold $5.5 million of 15-year callable notes tied to
UniCredit, Italy&#8217;s largest bank, with coupons of 9.1 percent
this month, as well as 2.28 million euros of 5.26 percent
securities linked to Banco Popolare SC. Italian banks&#8217; gross
non-performing loans as a proportion of total lending rose to
7.2 percent in July from 5.7 percent a year earlier, according
to the Italian Banking Association ABI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig MacDonald, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London,
declined to comment on the notes, while Nomura spokesman Rob
Davies was unable to comment immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Interest in peripheral banks is emblematic of the risk-on
environment, with investors looking to take advantage of wider
credit spreads on offer in countries like Spain and Italy&#8221; said
Michael Symonds, a credit analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets in
London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) is poised to be the
next U.S. bank to attract legal and regulatory scrutiny as
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) looks to settle a host of probes, according
to an analyst at Portales Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s $5 billion estimate of potential legal costs
that weren&#8217;t covered by reserves at midyear is second only to
JPMorgan, Charles Peabody of Portales said yesterday in a
Bloomberg Radio interview. That shows Citigroup may be bracing
for more legal challenges, Peabody said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very conceivable that Citigroup will be next in the
firing line,&#8221; Peabody said. &#8220;Their litigation costs have been
accelerating faster than anyone else&#8217;s.&#8221; Citigroup is the
third-largest U.S. bank by assets and JPMorgan is ranked first.
Both are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said earlier this month
that announcements about banks other than JPMorgan would be made
in the coming weeks and months. Citigroup Chief Executive
Officer Michael Corbat has seen litigation costs climb to $1.44
billion in the first half of 2013, putting this year on track to
be the most expensive for such costs since the financial crisis,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Costiglio, a company spokesman, declined to comment.
The lender is facing &#8220;legacy issues&#8221; tied to mortgage
products, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said in July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
most-read Bloomberg News reports from the past week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. At 77 He Flips Burgers Earning Former Hourly Wage in Week &lt;/h2&gt;

Retail &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Cinnabon&#8217;s signature product is an
880-calorie cinnamon roll that the Dallas Observer has called a
&#8220;gut bomb.&#8221; It&#8217;s a swirly pillow of dough dripping with
cinnamon, brown sugar, margarine, and cream-cheese frosting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Death Dinners at Baby Boomers&#8217; Tables Take on Taboo Over
Dying &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 24 (Bloomberg) -- At a Manhattan dinner party, former

&lt;p&gt;Sept. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. sold a record 9 million

Mortgages &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan

&lt;p&gt;Sept. 23 (Bloomberg) -- BlackBerry Ltd. reached a tentative

biggest shareholder, forging a path to go private after years of
losing ground to Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and Google Inc.&#8217;s Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Stocks at Risk With Government Shutdown Looming Before a
Default &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Even as the U.S. stock market roars
to new highs, helped last week by the Federal Reserve, a risk is
rising from another corner of Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. Deutsche Bank Said to Propose Creating Bond Platform With
Rivals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Deutsche Bank AG is trying to drum
up interest with some of its largest competitors to create a
multi-dealer U.S. bond trading platform at the same time that
asset managers discuss ways to make buying and selling debt
easier, according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Cotton-Candy IOS 7 Masks Potent Apple Upgrade: Rich
Jaroslovsky &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Shiny new iPhones always get the
most attention. But it&#8217;s iOS 7, the updated version of Apple&#8217;s
mobile-device operating system, that will have the biggest
impact on users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Does &#8217;Grand Theft Auto V&#8217; Mean the End of Hollywood?: Charles
Yu &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 23 (Bloomberg) -- There&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ve heard:
&#8220;Grand Theft Auto V,&#8221; the latest installment of the storied
video game franchise, took in over $1 billion in its first week.
That&#8217;s more than any movie released this year, with the
exception of&#160;&#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221;&#160;(which happens to be the fifth
highest-grossing movie of all time).&#160;At this rate, &#8220;GTA V&#8221;
could be a nontrivial contributor to the U.S. gross domestic
product. It&#8217;s a cultural event. Even Apple Inc. should be
impressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Why France Shrugs at NSA Eavesdropping Revelations: Peter
Gumbel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- At the United Nations General
Assembly yesterday, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff condemned
the surveillance of electronic communications around the globe
by the U.S. National Security Agency as a breach of individual
rights and national sovereignty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Maybe New Zealand Has the Answer to Asset Bubbles: William
Pesek &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 24 (Bloomberg) -- As the world&#8217;s biggest economies
search for ways to let the air out of giant asset bubbles, they
might find some answers in tiny New Zealand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Republicans Cower as Cruz Makes His Last Stand: Margaret
Carlson &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Move over Rand Paul. Ted Cruz may
be cruising to the biggest loss in his short career as a U.S.
senator and surpass you as the pre-eminent conservative in
Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MULTIMEDIA &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Boomers Find They Need to Work to Support Retirement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 23 (Bloomberg) -- At the height of his corporate
career Tom Palome was a vice president at Oral-B Laboratories,
earning a salary in the low six-figures. Today the 77-year-old
works two part-time jobs, at about $10 an hour, to support his

&lt;p&gt;U.K. tax officials may have to pay
out 1 billion pounds ($1.62 billion) to about 100 investment
funds -- including some run by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc -- suing for the return of overpaid
taxes dating back two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue  Customs won&#8217;t disclose what it may
owe the funds in lawsuits stemming from a 2007 European Court
ruling that investment trusts were improperly charged value-added tax on management fees. Marc Welby, a partner at
accounting firm BDO LLP estimated the agency might have to
refund about 1 billion pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The litigation &#8220;is about investment trusts who feel short-changed over the way in which HMRC handled claims,&#8221; said Welby,
a London tax specialist who isn&#8217;t involved in the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. lawmakers have publicly censured companies including
Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) for using legal loopholes to
minimize taxes. At the same time, the agency in charge of
collecting them is fighting in the courts to avoid refunds that
could cost the government billions of pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 120 investment trusts, including others operated by
BlackRock Inc. (BLK), Schroders Plc (SDR) and Investec Plc, have sued HMRC
since May 2012, according to court filings that didn&#8217;t show the
reason for the suits. Two people familiar with the actions said
at least 100 of them are related to overpaid VAT. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator John McCain pressured
the Justice Department to hold JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) executives
individually accountable while they work to settle claims that
the bank packaged and sold bad mortgage bonds to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Will you seek to hold any top officer, director or key
employees within JPMorgan personally accountable for the
wrongdoing?&#8221; McCain, of Arizona, wrote in a letter today to
Attorney General Eric Holder. McCain, the ranking Republican on
a Senate subcommittee that probed JPMorgan&#8217;s record trading loss
last year, criticized Holder&#8217;s Sept. 26 meeting with Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, calling it &#8220;highly unusual.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender is in talks to pay about $11 billion to end
investigations by state and federal authorities into its
mortgage-bond sales practices, according to people familiar with
the talks, who requested anonymity because the negotiations are
private. The discussions are fluid and the size of the
settlement keeps changing, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCain asked Holder whether the settlement being discussed
will preclude civil or criminal actions against JPMorgan
executives and whether the structure of the deal will allow the
New York-based bank to receive tax breaks on fines or penalties
it may pay, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) will get more than $2 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
stock through warrants acquired during the depths of the 2008
financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire will receive about 13.1 million shares in Goldman
Sachs, according to an agreement that uses the average closing
price on the 10 trading days through today to calculate
Buffett&#8217;s stake. The bank fell 1 percent to $158.21 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York, valuing the holding at $2.07 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs turned to Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire in
2008 to bolster capital and shore up market confidence when
shares plunged following the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. Buffett, Berkshire&#8217;s chairman and chief executive
officer, invested $5 billion for a preferred holding and got
warrants to buy $5 billion of stock for $115 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Buffett used his position as a white knight and his
reputation to prop up an institution at a time of crisis,&#8221; said
Richard Cook, co-founder of Cook  Bynum Capital Management LLC.
&#8220;Goldman Sachs is almost certainly better off for it, even
though it was very expensive. And certainly Berkshire
shareholders are better off.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, redeemed the
preferred stake in 2011 at a 10 percent premium. Buffett agreed
in March to exercise the warrants through a cashless
transaction, in which he passed on a chance to spend $5 billion
for stock at below-market prices. He instead gets an amount of
stock equivalent to his paper profit, based on closing prices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Premarin for
menopause may be tied to a higher risk of blood clots than
another common estrogen treatment called estradiol, a study
found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women taking Premarin, also known as conjugated equine
estrogens, had double the risk of a blood clot in the veins than
women taking estradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen, according
to research today in JAMA Internal Medicine. No difference
between the treatments was seen in the risk of stroke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s findings don&#8217;t mean women should stop taking
Premarin, an estrogen gathered from the urine of pregnant
horses, to ease their menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes,
night sweats, mood swings and vaginal dryness, said Nicholas
Smith, the lead study author. More research is needed to
replicate the results so doctors can say for sure that different
types of estrogen drugs carry varied levels of heart risks, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The assumption has held that all oral estrogens have
similar safety profiles. This may not be the case,&#8221; Smith, a
professor of epidemiology at the University of Washington School
of Public Health in Seattle, said in an e-mail. &#8220;More
comparative safety studies of commonly used treatments are
needed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the study included 384 post-menopausal women
ages 30 to 79 who were taking hormone treatments and were part
of the heart and vascular health study with Group Health
Cooperative, a health-care system in Washington state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Study Findings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From January 2003 to December 2009, 68 women developed
blood clots, including 39 who used Premarin, 67 had a heart
attack, including 38 who used Premarin, and 48 had a stroke,
including 25 who used Premarin. Those women were matched with
201 patients who didn&#8217;t have any heart events and were current
estrogen users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the research showed the risk of having a heart attack
for Premarin users was higher than those taking estradiol, the
findings weren&#8217;t statistically significant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer &#8220;strongly believes&#8221; in the use of conjugated
estrogens as a treatment option for women who have moderate to
severe menopausal symptoms, Jennifer Kokell, a company
spokeswoman, said in a statement. Premarin generated $1.07
billion in sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Conjugated estrogens have been used for over 70 years as
an effective treatment option for women experiencing menopausal
symptoms,&#8221; Kokell said. &#8220;Pfizer remains committed to helping
meet the needs of women going through menopause.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women should use hormones at the lowest dose for the
shortest amount of time, according to U.S. recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Health Risks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s
Premarin and Prempro, a combination of estrogen and progestin,
to treat their menopausal symptoms before they were linked in
2002 to health concerns such as breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Women&#8217;s Health Initiative, a U.S.-sponsored study of
disease and disability in postmenopausal women, was halted in
2002 after finding that women who took Pfizer&#8217;s Prempro had a
higher breast-cancer risk. That led to a decline in sales of
hormone replacement therapy pills. The Women&#8217;s Health Initiative
Estrogen-Alone Trial was stopped in 2004, a year earlier than
planned, because of an increased risk of stroke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration says that women shouldn&#8217;t
use hormone therapy to prevent heart attacks and strokes or
memory loss and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Studies also haven&#8217;t shown
the treatments prevent aging and wrinkles or increase sex drive,
the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hormone treatments may help relieve menopausal symptoms and
reduce a woman&#8217;s chance of getting osteoporosis, according to
the FDA. Still the drugs may raise the chance a woman gets blood
clots, heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer and gall bladder
disease. Women who have a uterus and take estrogen may have a
higher risk of cancer of the uterine lining, the FDA said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) bought Forties
crude for the first time in more than 19 months. Vitol Group
withdrew the only offer for Russian Urals in northwest Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya&#8217;s state-run National Oil Corp. maintained the
official selling price for benchmark Es Sider crude for October
at 30 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, according to a price
list obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;North Sea &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitol sold Forties cargo F1008 for Oct. 14 to Oct. 16
loading to Exxon at parity to Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. Exxon last bought a Forties lot in the window on
Feb. 7, 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Today&#8217;s trade was
15 cents to 35 cents more than deals on Sept. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total SA failed to buy Oct. 20 to Oct. 25 Forties at a 30
cent premium to Dated Brent, according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent for November settlement traded at $107.79 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $109.38 from the previous session. The December
contract was at $106.82, a discount of 97 cents to November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of Buzzard crude in the Forties blend fell to 45
percent in the week ending Sept. 29, down from 46 percent a week
earlier, according to data posted on BP&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Urals/Mediterranean &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitol withdrew an offer to sell 100,000 metric tons of
Urals crude at $1.60 a barrel less than Dated Brent for loading
at the Baltic ports of Primorsk or Ust-Luga Oct. 11 to Oct. 15,
the survey showed. The Russian crude last traded on Sept. 26 at
discounts of $2 and $1.90 to the benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO Surgutneftegas sold three Urals cargoes for loading in
October in a tender. The company sold a shipment loading from
Primorsk on Oct. 12 to Oct. 13 and another from Ust-Luga on Oct.
13 to Oct. 14 to Glencore Xstrata Plc, according to four people
who participate in the market, asking not to be identified
because the information is confidential. The third lot was
bought by OAO Lukoil for Oct. 18 to Oct. 19 loading from Ust-Luga, the people said. The cargoes traded at discounts of $1.75
to $2 a barrel to Dated Brent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgut also issued a tender for two Urals cargoes loading
at Primorsk on Oct. 20 to Oct. 21 and Oct. 23 to Oct. 24 and a
third consignment from Ust-Luga on Oct. 22 to Oct. 23. That
tender closes tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKN Orlen bought 100,000 tons of Urals for delivery to the
Butinge oil terminal in Lithuania, according to three people who
participate in the market, who also asked not to be identified
because the information is confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices for all Libyan grades, except Al-Jurf and Bouri, are
unchanged from this month, a price list obtained by Bloomberg
News showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya&#8217;s oil production exceeded 700,000 barrels a day,
almost 45 percent of installed capacity, on higher output from
the western region, Oil Ministry Measurement Director Ibrahim Al Awami yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protesters from the Amazigh community yesterday closed the
pipeline supplying the Mellitah terminal in western Libya with
oil from the Eni SpA-operated Wafa field, Mohamad Al-Ansari, the
oil ministry&#8217;s media executive, said today from Tripoli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;West Africa &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc offered 600,000 barrels of Qua Iboe at either $5.50
a barrel more than Dated Brent for Oct. 10 to Oct. 15 delivery
to Rotterdam, or plus $5.35 to Lavera in France on the Dilong
Spirit crude carrier, according to the survey. This is unchanged
from its previous offer on Sept. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian Oil Corp booked the Caesar supertanker to ship crude
from West Africa on Oct. 26 to India&#8217;s west coast, according to
three tanker reports including one from Marex Spectron Group.
The company bought 1 million barrels each of Nigerian Agbami and
Angolan Kissanje crudes for October loading from BP via a tender
in early August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian company&#8217;s third tender for crude loading in
November will close Oct. 3, with offers valid until the
following day, according to a document obtained by Bloomberg
News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan imported 313,842 kiloliters, or 1.97 million barrels
of crude from Africa in August, compared with 616,187 barrels in
July, according to data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple (AAPL) has unseated Coca-Cola as the
world&#8217;s No. 1 brand, as the company founded by Steve Jobs is a
leader in design and performance, according to a study of the
Top 100 brands by Interbrand Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc.&#8217;s brand value jumped 28 percent to $98.3 billion
and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s rose in second place at $93.3 billion. The
Coca-Cola Co. name slipped from the top spot after 13 years to
third place at $79.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every so often, a company changes our lives -- not just
with its products, but with its ethos,&#8221; Jez Frampton, chief
executive officer at New York-based brand consultancy
Interbrand, said in a statement. Current Apple CEO &#8220;Tim Cook
has assembled a solid leadership team and has kept Steve Jobs&#8217;
vision intact -- a vision that has allowed Apple to deliver on
its promise of innovation time and time again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual study, closely watched by the industry,
determines a brand&#8217;s value by examining its financial
performance, role in influencing consumer buying and ability to
secure earnings. The Top 10 is rounded out in descending order
by IBM, Microsoft, GE, McDonald&#8217;s, Samsung, Intel and Toyota.
The 100 have a combined value of $1.5 trillion, an 8.4 percent
increase from last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) will get 13.1 million shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
after exercising a warrant tied to a 2008 investment in the Wall
Street bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares will be delivered on Oct. 4 to Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, according to a Business Wire statement today
from the bank. The stake is valued at about $2.1 billion based
on the $159 closing price today of Goldman Sachs stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire becomes the seventh-largest shareholder of
Goldman Sachs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Buffett,
Berkshire&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, also got a $5
billion preferred stake for the original investment, which
Goldman redeemed in 2011 at a 10 percent premium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire can&#8217;t sell its shares until after the investment
bank reports third-quarter results this month. Buffett and
Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein have said that Berkshire
intends to remain a long-term investor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), MasterCard Inc. (MA) and
American Express Co. (AXP), the biggest U.S. payment networks,
proposed using &#8220;digital tokens&#8221; instead of account numbers for
processing purchases made online and with mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tokens provide an additional layer of security and
eliminate the need for merchants, digital wallet operators or
others to store account numbers,&#8221; the companies said today in a
joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard, to be applied worldwide, will be presented to
other payment firms and industry trade groups in coming weeks,
according to the statement. Tokens would be the digital
equivalent of magnetic stripes on the back of plastic bank cards
that contain customer information. They also may help to reduce
fraud by providing uniformity as companies such as Google Inc.
and Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) embrace mobile commerce and offer consumers
new ways to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mobile is the future,&#8221; Jim McCarthy, global head of
innovation and strategic partnerships at Foster City,
California-based Visa, said during the conference call. &#8220;We
haven&#8217;t evolved to create a standard. For the first time, we are
laying down the foundation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global card fraud losses for banks, merchants and
processors climbed 15 percent last year to $11.3 billion from
2011, according to the Nilson Report, a payments industry
newsletter based in Carpinteria, California. Gross fraud losses
in 2012 increased to 5.22 cents for every $100 in volume from
5.07 cents a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EMV-Chip &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokens also would complement so-called EMV-chip technology,
which has become a standard in Europe and much of the rest of
the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is among the last developed nations whose payment
system relies primarily on cards with magnetic stripes and
hasn&#8217;t yet adopted EMV. Standards for the technology are managed
by EMVCo, which was formed in 1999 by Europay International,
Visa and Purchase, New York-based MasterCard. New York-based
AmEx is also an EMVCo member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As merchants worldwide deploy more EMV terminals, fraud is
moving toward transactions conducted online or over the
telephone where physical payment cards aren&#8217;t present, according
to an August issue of the Nilson Report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has high fraud losses &#8220;because it leads the world
in online sales,&#8221; according to the trade publication. &#8220;Smaller
merchants who do not invest in fraud-fighting tools are
particularly vulnerable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

one to two days beyond yesterday&#8217;s deadline to hammer out an
accord, said the people, who sought anonymity because the
discussions are private. Talks may last longer, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish&#8217;s AutoHop technology, introduced in May 2012, presents
a obstacle to a deal. The one-button feature allows subscribers
to skip commercials on recorded broadcast TV shows, undermining
the effectiveness of network ads. Dish is embroiled in
litigation with ABC, CBS Corp. (CBS), Comcast Corp.&#8217;s NBC and 21st
Century Fox Inc.&#8217;s Fox over the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, is also trying to
build distribution for two new channels -- Fusion, a venture
with Univision Communications Inc. aimed at Hispanics, and the
SEC Network, which will feature Southeastern Conference college
sports beginning next year. Terms for both are being negotiated,
the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish, based in Englewood, Colorado, and Disney said
yesterday they agreed to a &#8220;short-term&#8221; extension of their
agreement, which was due to expire Sept. 30. The deal prevented
a blackout of ESPN and the Disney Channel for Dish subscribers,
including ABC viewers in markets where Disney owns the stations,
such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenhill  Co. (GHL) hired Daniel Wainstein, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s former head of investment-banking in Brazil, to open an office in Sao Paulo, the New York-based advisory firm&#8217;s first South American branch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wainstein, 43, will build a team able to advise major
Brazilian companies on global transactions, he said today in a
statement from Greenhill. Wainstein left Goldman Sachs in June
after 13 years, including 11 in Brazil, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenhill is expanding into Brazil as some international
banks pull back. Goldman Sachs halted an expansion there after
announcing plans in April to hire 50 people for the region. UBS
AG, based in Zurich, and London-based Barclays Plc have been
reducing staff in Brazil as competition with local lenders
intensifies. Economic growth decelerated last year to 0.9
percent, capping the slowest two years in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If a region is going through some cyclical economic
challenges, it can be an even more opportune time for us to
recruit,&#8221; Greenhill Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok, 54, said
today in a separate e-mailed statement. &#8220;Brazil will certainly
have its ups and downs, just like the U.S. market does, but
Brazil is clearly a large market that will see significant
economic growth over the long term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announced mergers and acquisitions involving companies in
Brazil declined 13 percent to $39.7 billion this year from the
same period in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, as
the outlook for economic growth worsened and volatility in
equity and exchange-rates markets led to some deals being
postponed. That&#8217;s the slowest pace for the period since 2007,
the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock Comparisons &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s benchmark Ibovespa index has lost about 13 percent
this year, compared with a 19 percent gain in the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wainstein was appointed chairman of Brazil investment
banking at New York-based Goldman Sachs in April 2012, when
Antonio Pereira and Fabio Bicudo were named co-chief operating
officers. Before working at Goldman Sachs, he spent two years at
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in New York, Greenhill said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wainstein was one of only two Goldman Sachs partners who
are Brazilian. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve has expanded its
scrutiny of banks&#8217; physical commodities operations to encompass
businesses run by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS)
that Congress had previously authorized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is examining all legal and regulatory exemptions
that allow banks to participate in the commodities markets, said
a person briefed on the process who asked not to be named
because the review is confidential. The appraisal, intended to
minimize potential risks to the financial system, widened since
the Fed said in July that it&#8217;s reconsidering its landmark 2003
decision to grant some lenders, such as Citigroup Inc. (C) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co., permission to expand into raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. law restricts banks from owning non-financial
businesses unless they get special exemptions. Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley were the two biggest U.S. securities firms until
they converted into banks in 2008. A 1999 law &#8220;grandfathers&#8221;
any commodities operations they had before Sept. 30, 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The way I read the statute, all commodities activities
are grandfathered forever, subject to appropriate risk-management controls,&#8221; said Randy Guynn, head of the financial
institutions group at law firm Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP, whose
clients include Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;

The Federal Reserve is conducting the review while U.S. lawmakers and regulators raise concerns that banks might abuse their various roles in commodities markets, such as by coordinating their trading platforms and ownership of materials or energy firms to influence prices and profit. Close

&lt;p&gt;Dish Network Corp. (DISH) and Walt Disney
Co. (DIS) reached a short-term extension of their programming
agreement, averting a blackout of Disney channels including ESPN
and ABC while the parties negotiate a long-term deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the extension weren&#8217;t disclosed, Englewood,
Colorado-based Dish, the third-largest U.S. pay-TV service in
total subscribers, said yesterday in a joint statement with
Burbank, California-based Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension temporarily prevents a blackout of ESPN, the
Disney Channel and some ABC stations for millions of pay-TV
subscribers. More than 3 million Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)
customers lost CBS Corp. (CBS) programming for a month before those
two companies agreed to a new retransmission contract on Sept.
2. Dish has about 14 million subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish Chairman and co-founder Charlie Ergen has lamented the
rising cost of sports programming for several years. He
suggested last month a pay-TV company may one day choose to go
without the top-rated all-sports channel -- a strategy that
would lower prices to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN charges pay-TV operators about $5.54 a month per
subscriber, according to research firm SNL Kagan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Somebody, sometime may decide that sports isn&#8217;t something
they have to have,&#8221; Ergen said on a conference call in August.
&#8220;There could be a day when, strategically, companies just can&#8217;t
get together, where they go opposite directions and they both
have strategies that work for them, and we&#8217;re prepared to go
either way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Network &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension affects ESPN, Disney Channel and ABC stations
owned by Disney in markets including New York, Los Angeles and
Chicago. Disney also is trying to build distribution for a new
channel, the SEC Network, that will feature Southeastern
Conference college sports in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish rose 1.1 percent to $45.50 at 11:28 a.m. in New York.
The shares had gained 24 percent this year through yesterday.
Disney, up 30 percent in 2013, climbed 1 percent to $65.14
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcast networks have been raising prices for so-called
retransmission rights -- fees paid by pay-TV services to carry
signals that are available free over government airwaves.
Content owners are also seeking to boost revenue from mobile
devices that extend delivery of their shows beyond the home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the earlier dispute, New York-based Time Warner Cable
agreed to pay a significant increase for the right to carry CBS,
approaching $2 per subscriber per month, people with knowledge
of the situation said in early September. Time Warner Cable
failed to obtain out-of-home rights for mobile devices, except
for CBS&#8217;s Showtime Anytime, they said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will buy an
8 billion-krone ($1.46 billion) stake in Dong Energy A/S,
Denmark&#8217;s largest utility, which is shoring up its balance sheet
after losing money on failed natural gas bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase will give New York-based Goldman a 19 percent
stake in Dong, which is controlled by the government, the
utility said late yesterday. Danish pension funds ATP and PFA
will pay 2.2 billion kroner and 800 million kroner to buy stakes
of about 5 percent and 2 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark&#8217;s government, which pulled a planned initial public
offering of Dong in 2008, said in February it will sell a stake
in the Skaerbaek, Denmark-based company as writedowns soared.
Dong yesterday said the parties have agreed to seek an initial
public offering when conditions &#8220;are right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new investors have an option to sell their holdings
back to the government should an IPO not be completed before the
release of Dong&#8217;s 2017 financial report, according to today&#8217;s
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman plans to &#8220;grow the business and provide
environmentally friendly energy and infrastructure for European
markets,&#8221; Andrew Wolff, head of Goldman Sachs Merchant Banking
Division in Europe, said in the statement. Goldman is buying 
the stake via funds managed by Wolff's division. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siena prosecutors requested that JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) stand trial for obstructing regulators as part of a wider probe into Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA&#8217;s purchase of Banca Antonveneta SpA, according to four people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege JPMorgan withheld information from regulators about a 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) financing the New York-based bank arranged for Monte Paschi&#8217;s takeover of Antonveneta in 2008, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the request is not public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan failed to oversee employees properly, according to the indictment request, the people said. A judge will review the request at a date that&#8217;s to be determined. Prosecutors also are seeking indictments against former Monte Paschi managers for obstructing regulators, as well as market manipulation and falsifying filings, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan should have informed the Bank of Italy that Monte Paschi had guaranteed it against losing money on the bond sale, the central bank said in an April 19 letter to prosecutors. The Bank of Italy said it may have withheld approval for the deal had it known about the indemnity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;No claim was ever made under the indemnity, which only existed for a matter of days, including either for the benefit of JPMorgan or any of its employees,&#8221; the U.S. bank said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We believe that JPMorgan and its employees acted correctly at all times. We will defend this action vigorously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Unprecedented Effort&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Monte Paschi bought Antonveneta from Banco Santander SA (SAN) in 2008 for 9 billion euros, 36 percent more than the Spanish lender paid for the Padua, Italy-based bank two months earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, told employees on Sept. 17 to prepare for more legal woes while the bank undertakes an &#8220;unprecedented effort&#8221; to comply with regulations. In the U.S., the lender is in talks to pay about $11 billion by state and federal authorities to end investigations into its mortgage-bond sales practices, a person familiar with the discussions said last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Elisa Martinuzzi in Milan at emartinuzzi@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Edward Evans at eevans3@bloomberg.net; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, appointed nonprofit executive Bruce McNamer to run
its global philanthropic initiatives as the company expands
charitable giving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McNamer will oversee all of JPMorgan&#8217;s donations in newly
created roles as chief executive officer of the JPMorgan Chase
Foundation and the corporation&#8217;s head of global philanthropy,
the company said in a statement today. He&#8217;s spent the last nine
years running TechnoServe, a charitable group that helps build
farms, businesses and industries in developing countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The private sector needs to step up and do its part to
address the critical challenges we face,&#8221; JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dalila Wilson-Scott, who has run the foundation since the
beginning of the year, will succeed Kimberly Davis as the
permanent president of the foundation, the company said. Wilson-Scott came from the corporate merger office and served in
strategic planning&#160;in the&#160;consumer and commercial banking
businesses, according to the New York-based lender. McNamer and
Wilson-Scott will report to Peter Scher, who oversees corporate
responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis left in November, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the matter who wasn&#8217;t authorized to comment
publicly on the departure. She&#8217;s listed as a managing director
on the website of Teneo Holdings, a New York consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Chase Foundation announced a partnership last
week with the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation to finance
technologies that fight killer diseases in low-income countries.

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve should give more
subtle guidance to financial markets rather than pin its policy
decisions on unpredictable targets, which can send confusing
signals if these fail to materialize as anticipated, said Jacob Frenkel, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets would benefit from a &#8220;guidance of economic
realities,&#8221; the former governor of the Bank of Israel said at
the Global Economic Symposium in Kiel, Germany today. &#8220;But you
have to be very subtle when you go about it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. central bank should also avoid giving dates for
policy changes such as an end to its bond buying or a change in
interest rates, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said in June he expected the
bank would complete its bond buying when the jobless level was
around 7 percent, linking a policy decision to specific
unemployment rates. Policy makers have pledged since December
that they won&#8217;t consider raising interest rates as long as
unemployment exceeds 6.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a decline in August to 7.3 percent for an unexpected
reason -- Americans giving up on finding work -- the Federal
Open Market Committee&#8217;s Sept. 18 decided not to taper its $85
billion in monthly bond buying, bucking economist predictions
that it would scale back the purchases that have bolstered
credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be very nice to have a guidance of economic
realities,&#8221; Frenkel said. Unemployment is not the right measure
for guidance as &#8220;U.S. unemployment declined much more
rapidly than expected by anyone but growth is not generated by
that as labor force participation shrank.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Confuse Matters &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For a long time the monetary authority decided not to
discuss exits, as they did not want to confuse matters, but
let&#8217;s face it, if you go into a highway, wouldn&#8217;t you like to
know before you enter if it is a dead-end or it has an exit,&#8221;
he said at a panel about the future of central banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central banks must also be freed from the burden of
&#8220;worrisome concerns about financial market stability,&#8221; he
said. To rebalance the situation, the financial industry needs
to increase banks&#8217; capital levels, while lowering their
leverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thirdly, liquidity must be higher than it used to be as
much of the crisis arises when we have a lack of liquidity,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue at the world&#8217;s biggest
investment banks may be down 18 percent in the third quarter
after a drop in their fixed-income, currencies and commodities
divisions, JPMorgan Cazenove analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter FICC revenue may decline 24 percent from the
previous quarter and by 35 percent from the same period last
year, analysts led by Kian Abouhossein wrote to clients today,
citing lower trading volume and tighter credit spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities sales are expected to fall by 13 percent from the
prior quarter because of low volatility and weak volume in
equity derivatives. Advisory and underwriting revenue may slip
by 14 percent, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global investment banks tracked by JPMorgan are Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN), UBS (UBSN) AG, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., Morgan Stanley (MS), Barclays Plc (BARC), Societe Generale SA and BNP
Paribas SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan recommends UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank,
because of its business mix and Deutsche Bank, which is the
cheapest among its peers based on price to earnings and price to
net asset value, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) hired three commodities
directors from JPMorgan Chase  Co. last month and an oil trader
from Citadel LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil trader Thomas Wiktorowski-Schweitz joined from
Citadel and is based in London, the bank said in an e-mailed
response to questions today. Rebecca Lee joined as director in
commodities sales in New York, Phil Hardwick is London-based
director in energy sales, and Thomas Horn was hired as director
in commodity-linked finance in Hong Kong. They all worked at
JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays said in May it was looking to make &#8220;selective&#8221;
hires in commodities after shrinking trading staff last year and
reining in value-at-risk, an estimate of potential trading
losses. Barclays tied with New York-based JPMorgan as the
leading provider of over-the-counter derivatives to companies
hedging energy and ranked second in hedging metals, a survey
from Greenwich Associates showed in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from raw materials at the 10 biggest investment
banks fell 20 percent in the first half, according to analytics
company Coalition. JPMorgan generated the most revenue from
commodities in the first six months this year, followed by
Goldman Sachs Inc. and Morgan Stanley, it said. JPMorgan plans
to get out of the business of owning and trading physical
commodities, it said in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve is examining legal and regulatory
exemptions that allow banks to participate in the commodities
markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years after returning to investment banking from the National Football League, Anthony Noto is tackling his biggest project yet: Twitter Inc.&#8217;s initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Noto, a dot-com era Internet analyst, is Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s head banker on Twitter. The IPO would be the largest for a U.S. technology company led by Goldman, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The microblogging service publicly released its IPO filing yesterday via the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, using a $1 billion placeholder amount. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twitter is helping Goldman Sachs bounce back after the investment bank was trounced by Morgan Stanley for the prime spot on social-media deals from LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) to Facebook Inc. (FB) Noto, who co-manages technology investment banking with George Lee, has helped drive new deals for New York-based Goldman Sachs since returning to his former employer from the NFL, where he was chief financial officer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The franchise was floundering for a bit in the tech IPO market,&#8221; said Lise Buyer, a former Internet analyst who now runs Class V Group LLC, an IPO consultancy in Portola Valley, California. Now Goldman Sachs is &#8220;clearly giving Morgan a run for their money,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won&#8217;t be able to seek
a second import ban against some handsets made by Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s
Motorola Mobility, though it can get damages under a ruling
issued by a U.S. appeals court today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. trade agency was wrong to say some of Motorola
Mobility&#8217;s products didn&#8217;t infringe one Microsoft patent, while
there was no violation of three others, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington said in an opinion
posted on its website today. The remaining patent expires in
December, so there won&#8217;t be enough time for a trade agency to
block the devices from being imported into the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling does give Microsoft ammunition to seek cash
damages from Motorola Mobility in a U.S. district court. Both
sides declared victory, with Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
saying it bolsters its efforts to get royalties from devices
running on Google&#8217;s Android, the world&#8217;s most popular operating
system. Motorola Mobility is one of the biggest holdouts of a
program started three years ago, Microsoft has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased the court determined Google unfairly uses
Microsoft technology and once again call on Google to join the
rest of the Android ecosystem in licensing our patents,&#8221;
Microsoft Deputy General Counsel David Howard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, which was bought by Mountain View,
California-based Google after the case was filed in 2010,
focused on the findings regarding the other three patents and
the court finding that Motorola Mobility designed around the one
that was infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s favorable opinion confirms our position that our
products don&#8217;t infringe the Microsoft patents,&#8221; said Matt Kallman, a Motorola Mobility spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;79 Percent &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had Motorola Mobility lost on any of the three other
patents, it would have faced another possible import ban. as
each has at least three years left on their terms, according to
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court didn&#8217;t rule on Google&#8217;s appeal of a separate
patent in the dispute before the U.S. International Trade
Commission. In that case, the ITC issued an import ban against
some Motorola Mobility phones. Microsoft has sued U.S. Customs
and Border Protection, claiming it hasn&#8217;t enforced the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android had 79 percent of the global market in the second
quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft&#8217;s
operating system was third with 3.6 percent, with Apple Inc.
having 13.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent claim that was revived against Motorola Mobility
involves a digital interface that presents relevant choices when
a user selects a computer resource, such as a picture file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ActiveSync Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Circuit said the ITC erred in its
interpretation of a key term in that patent. It sent the case
back to determine the type of infringement by the main group of
Motorola Mobility products and what, if any, the appropriate
remedy would be. Other devices that designed around the patent
were cleared of infringement by the appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-judge panel affirmed a finding that Motorola
Mobility doesn&#8217;t infringe a patent for synchronizing data. That
patent is similar to one involved in the infringement ruling
Google is appealing, relating to syncing calendar items between
mobile devices and computers. It involves Microsoft&#8217;s ActiveSync
software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court also upheld the ITC&#8217;s determination that
Microsoft hadn&#8217;t established that it was using the technology
covered by the other two patents, a requirement that&#8217;s unique to
the trade agency. The panel didn&#8217;t address the ITC&#8217;s finding
those patents weren&#8217;t infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Xbox Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Motorola Mobility case against Microsoft, seeking to
block imports of the Xbox video-gaming system, failed at the ITC
and is on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In connection with that case, Microsoft has accused
Motorola Mobility of demanding unreasonable fees on fundamental
technology used in many electronics. Microsoft won a trial last
week on its claims that Motorola Mobility breached obligations
to license its standard-essential patents on fair terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case that was ruled on is Microsoft Corp. v. ITC,
12-1445, while the pending case is Motorola Mobility LLC v. ITC,
12-1535, both U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Mobile
Devices, Associated Software and Components Thereof, 337-744,
U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) don&#8217;t
infringe a patent owned by SmartMetric Inc., a company that had
sought as much as $13.4 billion for alleged use of its
technology in &#8220;smart&#8221; debit and credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald in Los Angeles,
in a written ruling yesterday, affirmed his earlier tentative
decision from a Sept. 25 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parties here are comparing apples and oranges,&#8221; the
judge said in the written ruling. &#8220;The piecemeal similarities
that SmartMetric has identified in support of its claims do not
change the fact that claims 1 and 14 of the &#8217;464 patent are
simply not practiced by defendants, and no reasonable jury could
conclude otherwise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric sued Visa and MasterCard two years ago,
claiming they infringed its patent for a system for automatic
connection to a network. The company claimed it was entitled to
a royalty of 25 percent of the anticipated savings Visa and
MasterCard would receive from a drop in credit and debit-card
fraud by the introduction of so-called EMV cards in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EMV cards, which are already used in Europe, include a
microchip instead of a magnetic strip to access a payment
system. The SmartMetric patent pertains to the process by which
the payment system selects a network for a card transaction,
Patrick Bright, the company&#8217;s lawyer, said at the Sept. 25
hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric said in a statement today it will appeal the
non-infringement ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric fell 4 cents, or 20 percent, to 16 cents, today
in over-the-counter trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SmartMetric Inc. (SMME) v. MasterCard International
Inc., 11-cv-07126, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Ligand
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND) won U.S. approval for a drug to treat hot
flashes and osteoporosis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration cleared the drug, Duavee,
for moderate-to-severe hot flashes related to menopause in women
who haven&#8217;t had a hysterectomy, the agency said today in a
statement. The medicine, also approved to prevent post-menopausal osteoporosis, will be available in the first quarter
of 2014, Pfizer said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine from Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker,
will enter a market for hot-flash treatments that includes
Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical Co. (4530)&#8217;s Brisdelle. Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY)&#8217;s
Evista, which generated $1 billion in sales last year, was
approved in 1997 for prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis.
Duavee is the first FDA approved medicine that combines estrogen
with a compound that selects certain tissues to work on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duavee contains the ingredient bazedoxifene that can act
like estrogen on bone to protect density combined with a mixture
of estrogens. Pfizer, based in New York, sells Premarin, which
generated $1 billion in sales last year and is derived from the
urine of pregnant horses. Premarin has six uses, including the
two Duavee will be labeled to treat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ligand rose 7 percent to $47.99 at the close in New York,
it&#8217;s biggest gain in more than three months. Pfizer fell less
than 1 percent to $28.77. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common side effects of Duavee in clinical trials
were muscle spasms, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, among
others, the FDA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ligand, based in La Jolla, California, formed a research
deal with Pfizer-acquired Wyeth, which developed the medicine.
The FDA rejected bazedoxifene in 2009, after multiple delays, as
an osteoporosis treatment on stroke and clotting concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duavee will have the same boxed warning as other estrogen
products, the FDA said. Premarin warns against an increased risk
of cancer of the uterus and of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twin hurricanes that struck Mexico
last month are bolstering traders&#8217; conviction that the central
bank will lower borrowing costs for a third time this year to
alleviate any damage to economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest-rate swaps yesterday indicated a 76 percent chance
that Mexico&#8217;s central bank will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25
percentage point in the next three months to 3.5 percent. That&#8217;s
the highest odds since the eve of policy makers&#8217; half-point
reduction in March. Sixteen of 20 analysts in a Sept. 20 survey
by Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Banamex unit predict at least one more cut
this year, versus just three who anticipated the quarter-point
reduction on Sept. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel left at least 157 people dead,
with flooding that decimated crops such as tomatoes and chili
peppers while disrupting deliveries and emptying hotels in
Acapulco. While the destruction may push up inflation as food
prices rise, it will pressure the central bank to cut borrowing
costs to bolster an economy already growing at the slowest pace
since 2009, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The economy was already debilitated, and it was hammered
by this shock,&#8221; Alberto Ramos, the chief Latin America
economist at Goldman Sachs in New York, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;It makes sense for the central bank to ease more
after this devastation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Easing Potential &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the hurricanes, Ramos expected the central bank to
lower its 3.75 percent rate by 0.25 percentage point on Oct. 25
to a record-low 3.5 percent. The storms opened the door to a
half-point cut this month or another reduction to 3.25 percent
in December, he said. President Enrique Pena Nieto said the
storms were the most intense on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ricardo Medina Macias, a spokesman for Banco de Mexico,
didn&#8217;t respond to e-mail and voice messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manuel and Ingrid drove more than 50,000 people from their
homes and stranded 40,000 more in the resort city of Acapulco,
including tourists from Mexico City who were celebrating over
the country&#8217;s Independence Day holiday weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most Acapulco hotels were spared from damage,
occupancy rates have declined due to the closing of the highway
connecting the resort city to the nation&#8217;s capital, according to
Armando Uribe Valle, president of the Mexican Association of
Hotels and Motels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vacant Rooms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acapulco&#8217;s 18,000 hotel rooms registered with the
association have been about 20 percent occupied in the weeks
since the storms hit, Uribe said. The dropoff already has cost
$19 million to $23 million in lost room charges, and demand
could remain below normal for as long as two months, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember it ever being this bad in terms of
occupancy,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the 14 highways nationwide that were closed by the
storms remain blocked, Communications and Transportation
Minister Gerardo Ruiz Esparza said at an event with Pena Nieto
on Oct. 1. The government is aiming to have the infrastructure
of Michoacan, a grower of produce including limes and one of the
states hardest hit by Manuel, restored within four months, Ruiz
Esparza said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank, led by Governor Agustin Carstens, cut the
key rate to 3.75 percent on Sept. 6, surprising 19 of 20
economists in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Split Decision &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank was split in its decision, with two
members voting to maintain rates and wait until the Federal
Reserve clarified its plan for $85 billion monthly stimulus
program that has fueled demand for emerging-market assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was nine days before the storms hit, and the Fed on
Sept. 18 said it would refrain from paring the stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed announcement strengthened the peso and increased
the chances for another rate cut, according to Credit Suisse
Group AG&#8217;s chief Mexico economist, Alonso Cervera. In a Sept. 26
report he cut his forecast for this year&#8217;s growth in gross
domestic product to 1.1 percent from 1.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, the economy contracted by 0.7
percent from the prior three months, the first quarter-over-quarter drop since 2009. The third-quarter GDP report isn&#8217;t due
until November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hurricanes &#8220;have increased downside risks to GDP,&#8221;
wrote Cervera, who expects a quarter-point cut this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the destruction of crops may spur an increase in a
measure of inflation that includes farm and energy prices, &#8220;we
do not think that the potential spike in agricultural prices
will have implications on monetary policy,&#8221; Cervera said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Insurance Estimates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mexican Association of Insurance Institutions estimated
last week that the hurricanes caused 75 billion pesos ($5.7
billion) in damage, of which 12 billion pesos to 15 billion
pesos will be covered by insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finance ministry said Sept. 27 that about 12.5 billion
pesos from an emergency fund have been made immediately
available for reconstruction and another 5 billion pesos from a
repavement fund will be directed toward storm recovery. The
government will also work with legislators to allocate more
spending from next year&#8217;s budget to rebuilding, the ministry
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CI Banco&#8217;s Jorge Gordillo says Mexico&#8217;s central bank will
keep borrowing costs unchanged because of concern the Fed will
start to unwind the stimulus at its meeting this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Opposite Direction&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banxico doesn&#8217;t want to be going in the opposite
direction of the Fed,&#8221; Gordillo, CI Banco&#8217;s director of
economic analysis, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own Mexican government
dollar bonds instead of Treasuries fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 208 basis points at 4 p.m. in New York,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
five years with credit-default swaps rose one basis point to 121
basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent if a borrower fails
to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso fell 0.5 percent to 13.1735 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benito Berber, a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc.,
projects a quarter-point interest rate cut in October and says
there&#8217;s a 50 percent chance of another reduction in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you would have distributed or spread out the impact
over 12 months, it of course would not push the central bank to
cut,&#8221; Berber said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Given that it&#8217;s
concentrated in a particular time when the economy was expected
to recover after a very disappointing first half of the year, I
think it will open the door for cuts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Hannam, formerly one of JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s top merger advisers, is fighting a proposed
market-abuse fine with a &#8220;woolly, implicit understanding of
confidentiality,&#8221; lawyers for a U.K. regulator told a court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam is contesting a 450,000 pound ($728,000) civil
market-abuse fine from the Financial Conduct Authority in a
London trial that started in July. Hannam was seeking more
bidders for Heritage Oil Plc (HOIL), when he disclosed to an investor
in 2008 that another potential acquirer had made an offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the information Hannam passed on his client Heritage Oil
Plc is &#8220;not inside information, what is inside information?&#8221;
Richard Boulton, a lawyer for the FCA, said during closing
arguments today. If Hannam wins &#8220;it opens the floodgates to the
selective disclosure of inside information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam, who resigned from the New York-based bank after the
civil fine, is one of the highest-profile finance workers the
regulator has sought to fine. Hannam was among the bankers
advising Xstrata Plc before it was acquired by Glencore
International Plc. (GLEN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator &#8220;points to the fact that Mr. Hannam held a
very senior position at his firm and was a role model for
others,&#8221; Hannam&#8217;s lawyers said in court documents. &#8220;That does
not mean that it is appropriate to make an example out of him in
the name of deterrence by imposing a penalty that is not
warranted in the circumstances.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam&#8217;s lawyers also contested the size of the fine,
pointing to the fact it was &#8220;higher than many cases of
deliberate disclosure&#8221; by other dealers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two e-mail messages form the basis of the FCA&#8217;s case.
Hannam, has said the notes were in the &#8220;best interest&#8221; of his
client, Heritage Oil. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reserve Bank of India data showed the
highest ratio of short-term external debt to currency reserves
in more than a decade, raising alarm bells at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Nomura Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $97 billion maturing in less than a year amounted to
34.3 percent of reserves as of June 30, the highest since at
least March 2001, RBI figures released Sept. 30 show. The ratio
was 146.5 percent during a balance-of-payments crisis in March
1991, according to the report&#8217;s partial data for the 1990s.
Including longer-term debt, repayments due by June 2014 total
$170 billion, or 60 percent of reserves. Indonesia&#8217;s comparable
ratio is 55.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy faces significant risk as
banks and companies seek to refinance global borrowings, even as
the government acts to trim the current-account deficit, Goldman
wrote in a Sept. 30 research note. Nomura said the slowest
economic growth in a decade and a budget deadlock in the U.S.
will damp inflows, further straining India&#8217;s finances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect the focus to turn to India&#8217;s external
vulnerability amid a worsening global backdrop,&#8221; Sonal Varma,
an economist at Nomura in Mumbai, said in an Oct. 1 telephone
interview. &#8220;The worst in terms of the quarterly current-account
deficit is likely behind us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deficit in the broadest measure of trade was $21.8
billion in April through June, compared with $18.1 billion in
the previous quarter, the RBI said in a Sept. 30 statement. The
median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a $23
billion gap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deficit Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura predicts the widest shortfall among the largest
emerging markets will narrow to 3 percent of gross domestic
product in the fiscal year through March 2014 from a record 4.8
percent the previous period. Goldman analysts Tushar Poddar in
Mumbai and Vishal Vaibhaw in Bangalore forecast a 3.5 percent
gap as tariff increases curb gold imports and slower growth
limits domestic demand. GDP increased 5 percent in the year
ended March 31, official data show, the least in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current-account deficit will drop to 4 percent of GDP
this fiscal year, according to the median of 14 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. However, the shortfall in the
government&#8217;s budget will widen to 5.05 percent of GDP in the
same period, from 4.9 percent the prior year, according to the
median estimates in a separate survey, as Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh boosts spending ahead of elections due by May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debt Outflows &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global funds have cut holdings of Indian debt by $11.5
billion to $26.9 billion since May 22, when Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke first flagged a potential paring of
bond purchases. Since the Fed unexpectedly maintained its buying
on Sept. 18, the figure is down $891.5 million. Foreign reserves
fell to $277 billion in the week through Sept. 20 from $297
billion at the end of 2012, official data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;India is one of the countries with the most challenging
macro imbalances,&#8221; Goldman analysts including London-based
Thomas Stolper, wrote in a Sept. 30 note to clients. &#8220;High-frequency data on Indian capital flows indicate that, even after
the dovish Fed surprise, the funding of the large Indian
external deficit remains a challenge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman is selling the rupee against the euro, betting it
will weaken to 92 per euro from 83.9678 today. The Indian
currency advanced 1.2 percent to 61.7400 per dollar today, and
the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond fell nine basis points,
or 0.09 percentage point, to 8.64 percent. Local markets were
shut yesterday for a public holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Stimulus &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale SA on Oct. 1 closed its sell-rupee trade,
saying global risk sentiment has improved after the Fed
decision. BNP Paribas SA recommends investors buy the rupee,
saying the partial shutdown of the U.S. government will likely
prolong stimulus and boost the amount of cash available in the
global banking system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the fact that you&#8217;re going to see such a disruptive
end to the U.S. fiscal debate, the Fed may continue to feel that
they have to do the heavy lifting in terms of supporting
growth,&#8221; Mirza Baig, Singapore-based head of foreign-exchange
and interest rate strategy at BNP Paribas, said in a Sept. 30
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Bernanke, new RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan will also be
under pressure to manage the economy with little help from the
government before next year&#8217;s elections, according to
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEBA), or SEB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rajan Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his maiden policy review on Sept. 20, Rajan unexpectedly
raised the benchmark repurchase rate to 7.50 percent from 7.25
percent to curb inflation and counter outflows. He said taming
the fastest price increases among the largest emerging markets
is his top priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s last month reiterated it may downgrade
India&#8217;s debt rating to junk as fuel and food subsidies
threatened Prime Minister Singh goal of curbing the government&#8217;s
budget deficit. Credit-default swaps insuring the bonds of State
Bank of India (SBIN), a proxy for the sovereign, against non-payment
for five years have climbed 140 basis points from the year&#8217;s low
of 174 in May, according to data provider CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At least until the elections are done, Rajan is pretty
much on his own,&#8221; Sean Yokota, head of Asia strategy at SEB in
Singapore, said in a Sept. 30 telephone interview. &#8220;Considering
India&#8217;s huge funding needs, I wouldn&#8217;t consider buying the rupee
until we have clarity on Fed tapering.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Capital Partners, Horizon Capital and Vostok Nafta, TCS Chief
Executive Officer Oliver Hughes said on a conference call. None
of the selling shareholders is exiting, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinkov&#8217;s offering comes after Russian coal miner
Sibanthracite Plc (SIB) and railroad-freight carrier NTS Holding Plc
postponed London IPO plans this year. OAO Alrosa, the world&#8217;s
biggest diamond producer by output, plans to sell a 16 percent
stake in Moscow. TCS is seeking to benefit from Russia&#8217;s growing
consumer lending market, even as credit risk rises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very much an online company that enables investors
to tap into the Russian consumer,&#8221; Hughes said today. &#8220;We have
a very deep reach into Russia&#8217;s regions, there&#8217;s enormous
potential for growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;San Francisco &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s consumer-finance banks face an increase in bad
loans in the unsecured retail lending market, Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service Inc. said on Sept. 12, noting TCS among those with
&#8220;heightened risks.&#8221; Russian bank lending to households rose 34
percent earlier as of Aug. 1 from a year earlier, while
unsecured loans rose 39 percent, according to central bank data.
That is higher than the regulator deems &#8220;comfortable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The branchless bank of Tinkoff Credit is modeled on Capital
One Financial Corp. (COF) in the U.S., a pioneer of card distribution
via direct mail, which Tinkov said he encountered while living
in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hughes said 85 percent of TCS customers live outside Moscow
and St. Petersburg, Russia&#8217;s two biggest cities. The bank had
issued more than 3.5 million credit cards by the end of June,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCS Bank&#8217;s net income in the first half of the year rose to
$79 million, compared with $52 million in the same period a year
earlier, it said. Total assets equaled $2.42 billion as of June
30, with consumer deposits at $977 million and loans to
customers at $1.95 billion, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investor Interest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London stock market is the front-runner for an IPO
because there isn&#8217;t enough liquidity in Moscow and reporting
rules are too stringent in the U.S., Tinkov said in an interview
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think Tinkoff&#8217;s IPO will trigger a lot of global
investor interest,&#8221; Vadim Bit-Avragim, who helps manage about
$4.4 billion at Kapital Asset Management in Moscow, said by
phone. &#8220;This business is closer to the consumer sector, it has
fast growth. Tinkov is a well-known businessman, he is very
active and his views are liked by the investment community.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCS sees a &#8220;wide investor base&#8221; for the IPO, Hughes said,
declining to reveal if the lender has any anchor investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Sberbank CIB will be
managing the sale, while JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Renaissance
Capital will also be joint bookrunners, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) mistakenly
added about $1.5 million of interest costs to a Ford Motor Co. (F)
bond sale last week by using the wrong Treasury note as a
benchmark for the security, according to two people with
knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As compensation, Ford was charged a lower underwriting fee
for the offering of $1 billion of five-year, 2.875 percent notes
from its finance unit, said one of the people, who asked not to
be identified because the information is private. The automaker
paid 0.1 percentage point less in fees than in two previous
sales of similar-maturity debt, regulatory filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the sixth-largest underwriter of corporate
bonds worldwide this year, took Ford public in 1956 and a former
executive at the bank, John Thornton, sits on the carmaker&#8217;s
board. Such an error by the New York-based bank is rare across
capital markets, said AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB)&#8217;s Ashish Shah, who wasn&#8217;t involved in the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t recall the last time something like this
happened,&#8221; said Shah, the head of global credit at New York-based AllianceBernstein, which manages $435 billion. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
reminder that this is a human-led process,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
probably something that won&#8217;t be repeated for a long time at the
firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) rose
the most in a month in Mumbai trading after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) upgraded its rating, while New York City awarded the Indian
company naming rights to its annual marathon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy advanced as much as 4.2 percent to 2,030
rupees and traded at 2,024 rupees as of 11:12 a.m., headed for
the biggest gain since Aug. 30. The SP BSE Sensex (SENSEX) climbed 1.3
percent and the SP BSE India Information Technology Index, or
BSET, rose 2.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs upgraded India&#8217;s largest software exporter to
buy from neutral, citing rising revenue compared with its peers
amid an increase in global spending on information technology
services. Economic recoveries in the U.S. and Europe, along with
a tumbling rupee that boosts repatriated revenue from overseas
sales, have triggered a 41 percent jump in the BSET this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy &#8220;is well positioned to record sector
leading revenue in an improving demand scenario,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
said in a note dated yesterday. The firm revised its 12-month
price estimate for Tata Consultancy to 2,300 rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy also entered into an eight-year
partnership with the New York Road Runners to serve as lead
sponsor of the annual New York City Marathon beginning in 2014,
the company said in an e-mailed statement. Tata Consultancy has
served as a technology consultant for the Road Runners since
2010 and previously developed mobile applications used by
runners and spectators for the 2013 half marathon in New York,
which will be followed by a new application for forthcoming
races, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We aspire to make the TCS New York City Marathon a more
technologically-enriched and socially engaged experience for all
its participants and fans across the world, using our core
technology skills,&#8221; Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chief executive
officer of Tata Consultancy, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essent Group Ltd. (ESNT), the mortgage
insurer backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and billionaire
George Soros, added Wells Fargo  Co., its largest customer, to
the group of underwriters for an initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. home lender, accounted for 17
percent of Essent&#8217;s sales in the first six months of this year,
according to a regulatory filing today from the Bermuda-based
insurer. The firm also added Bank of America Corp., the third-largest mortgage originator, as an underwriter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage insurance, which covers losses when borrowers
default and foreclosures fail to recoup costs, is typically
selected by originators. Essent was founded amid the financial
crisis, when record homeowner defaults pushed some rivals from
the business. As home prices rise, firms that survived are
attracting investors looking for ways to bet on housing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;New capital would help fund Essent&#8217;s continued growth,&#8221;
Helen Remeza, an analyst at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, said in a
Sept. 23 research note. &#8220;A capital raise could also further
differentiate Essent Guaranty from its more weakly capitalized
peers with legacy exposures.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo (WFC) is the only customer to account for more than
10 percent of Essent&#8217;s revenue, according to the filing. New
York-based Goldman Sachs is leading the offering, with JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), the No. 2 mortgage lender, and Barclays Plc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chile&#8217;s economy will grow less than
the central bank and government forecast next year as it emerges
from the &#8220;Disneyland&#8221; of high copper prices and low global
borrowing costs, said a former head of the central bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product in the world&#8217;s largest copper
producer will expand 3.5 percent to 4 percent, compared with the
4.9 percent forecast by the government, said Vittorio Corbo,
senior investigator at Santiago-based think-tank Centro de
Estudios Publicos. The central bank is estimating growth of 4
percent to 5 percent next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve had three very good years,&#8221; said Corbo, who was
president of the central bank between 2003 and 2007, in an
interview in Santiago yesterday. &#8220;They were chasing Chilean
companies to lend them money. We were in Disneyland, but from
here on conditions won&#8217;t be the same.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surging investment in the mining industry that has enabled
economic growth to average 5.8 percent in the past three years
is set to weaken as rising costs and falling prices crimp profit
margins, said Corbo, who is a director of Banco Santander SA. A
three-year boom in consumer spending will also peter out soon,
paving the way for an interest rate cut before the end of the
year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the next few years, Chile will have to work hard in
order to grow and even to maintain an expansion of 4.5
percent,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everything points to one or two rate cuts
in the next six to 12 months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling From the Sky &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Sebastian Pinera told Charlie Rose in an
interview aired on PBS and Bloomberg Television that Chile can
maintain growth of 6 percent as long as it doesn&#8217;t rest on its
past achievements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have to be taking measures all the time to innovate,
to improve, to modernize the whole system,&#8221; Pinera said. &#8220;So
the worst danger is when you think that growth happens by
chance, or falls from the sky.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four pillars of growth will be education, innovation,
science and poverty reduction, Pinera said, comments that echoed
Corbo&#8217;s list of areas the government needs to concentrate on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal risk for Chile&#8217;s economy next year remains a
sudden slowdown in China and subsequent slump in copper prices,
Corbo said. The end of quantitative easing in the U.S. could
also push up global borrowing costs, draining funds from
emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interest Rates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile&#8217;s central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate
at 5 percent for the past 20 months as a forecast slowdown in
consumer spending failed to materialize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail sales leaped 12 percent in August from the year
earlier, bringing growth in the year to date to 10.2 percent,
the National Institute of Statistics said Sept. 30.
Manufacturing production stagnated over the same period,
creating a &#8220;dichotomy&#8221; for policy makers, the central bank
said in the minute of its September rate meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the figures from this week the central bank has
additional arguments to wait some more, but it isn&#8217;t going to
wait long,&#8221; Corbo said. &#8220;The bank will continue to be prudent
and from here to the end of the year it is possible we will have
the first rate cut.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-year swaps were unchanged at 4.67 percent today, as
traders priced in a rate cut as soon as Oct. 17. Once reduced,
rates won&#8217;t be coming back up again soon, Corbo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slowing Down &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With real wage growth slowing and consumer sentiment
weakening, policy makers may cut rates even before retail sales
start to ease, central bank President Rodrigo Vergara said Oct.
1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we have evidence of a relatively strong slowdown in
coming months, we could take monetary policy decisions even if
the current information isn&#8217;t showing the symptoms,&#8221; Vergara
said. The debate on consumer demand shouldn&#8217;t dominate rate
decisions, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corbo echoed Vergara&#8217;s confidence that the retail sales
boom will end soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The labor market is going to be less dynamic,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It is strange that consumption hasn&#8217;t slowed as we expected,
but it should start to do it soon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile may not be as vulnerable as policy makers had thought
to a withdrawal of foreign funds as the current account
stabilizes at about 4 percent of GDP, Corbo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaker internal demand, led by a slowdown in investment in
the mining industry, may provide a &#8220;positive surprise&#8221; for the
current account deficit, which is currently forecast to end the
year at about 4 percent of GDP, Vergara said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corbo put a number on the changed outlook for the broadest
measure of trade in goods and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The 4.8 percent current account deficit the central bank
is forecasting for 2014 is very unlikely,&#8221; Corbo said &#8220;It will
be close to 4 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. investment firms Lone Star
Funds, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)
are among the bidders for 25 Dublin properties being sold by
Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) as it exits Ireland, according to
people with knowledge of the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davy, Ireland&#8217;s largest securities firm, is also involved
in initial bids submitted before the Sept. 30 deadline, said two
of the people. All of the people declined to be identified
because the process is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., the broker managing the sale, is
seeking 140 million euros ($191 million) for a portfolio called
Ulysses that includes the Justice Ministry&#8217;s headquarters as
well as office buildings, stores and apartments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland&#8217;s real estate market, led by Dublin, is emerging
from the biggest slump in western Europe. Income returns from
office buildings in the capital are more than 10.5 percent a
year, the highest among cities covered by research firm
Investment Property Databank Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Goldman, Lone Star, Apollo and Jones
Lang declined to comment on the sale. Emile Abu-Shakra, a
spokesman for Lloyds, declined to comment in an e-mail. Davy is
advising an overseas institutional investor on the sale,
according to one of the people. A representative for the firm
also declined to comment on the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the Ulysses properties previously belonged to Liam
Carroll, one of the country&#8217;s biggest developers during its
real-estate bubble, who has seen many of his properties seized
by banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyds decided three years ago to close the Irish unit it
acquired as part of its 2008 takeover of HBOS Plc and sell or
run off the assets. The bank has taken 12.5 billion pounds ($20
billion) of impairment charges on Irish loans since the nation&#8217;s
real-estate market collapsed in 2008, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. won&#8217;t be able to seek
another import ban against some handsets made by Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s
Motorola Mobility, though it can get damages under a ruling
issued by a U.S. appeals court yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. trade agency was wrong to say some of Motorola
Mobility&#8217;s products didn&#8217;t infringe one Microsoft patent, while
there was no violation of three others, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington said in an opinion
posted on its website yesterday. The remaining patent expires in
December, so there won&#8217;t be enough time for a trade agency to
block the devices from being imported into the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling does give Microsoft ammunition to seek cash
damages from Motorola Mobility in a U.S. district court. Both
sides declared victory, with Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
saying it bolsters its efforts to get royalties from devices
running on Google&#8217;s Android, the world&#8217;s most popular operating
system. Motorola Mobility is one of the biggest holdouts of a
program started three years ago, Microsoft has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased the court determined Google unfairly uses
Microsoft technology and once again call on Google to join the
rest of the Android ecosystem in licensing our patents,&#8221;
Microsoft Deputy General Counsel David Howard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, which was bought by Mountain View,
California-based Google after the case was filed in 2010,
focused on the findings regarding the other three patents and
the court finding that Motorola Mobility designed around the one
that was infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The favorable opinion &#8220;confirms our position that our
products don&#8217;t infringe the Microsoft patents,&#8221; said Matt
Kallman, a Motorola Mobility spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court didn&#8217;t rule on Google&#8217;s appeal of a separate
patent in the dispute before the U.S. International Trade
Commission. In that case, the ITC issued an import ban against
some Motorola Mobility phones. Microsoft has sued U.S. Customs
and Border Protection, claiming it hasn&#8217;t enforced the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case that was ruled on is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. ITC,
12-1445, while the pending case is Motorola Mobility LLC v. ITC,
12-1535, both U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Mobile
Devices, Associated Software and Components Thereof, 337-744,
U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SmartMetric Loses Patent Ruling in Visa, MasterCard Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) don&#8217;t infringe a patent owned
by SmartMetric Inc., a company that had sought as much as $13.4
billion for alleged use of its technology in &#8220;smart&#8221; debit and
credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald in Los Angeles,
affirmed his earlier tentative decision from a Sept. 25 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parties here are comparing apples and oranges,&#8221; the
judge said in an Oct. 2 written ruling. &#8220;The piecemeal
similarities that SmartMetric has identified in support of its
claims do not change the fact that claims 1 and 14 of the &#8216;464
patent are simply not practiced by defendants, and no reasonable
jury could conclude otherwise.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric sued Visa and MasterCard two years ago,
claiming they infringed its patent for a system for automatic
connection to a network. The company claimed it was entitled to
a royalty of 25 percent of the anticipated savings Visa and
MasterCard would receive from a drop in credit and debit-card
fraud by the introduction of so-called EMV cards in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EMV cards, which are already used in Europe, include a
microchip instead of a magnetic strip to access a payment
system. The SmartMetric patent pertains to the process by which
the payment system selects a network for a card transaction,
Patrick Bright, the company&#8217;s lawyer, said at the Sept. 25
hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric said in a statement yesterday it will appeal
the non-infringement ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SmartMetric Inc. (SMME) v. MasterCard International
Inc., 11-cv-07126, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Government Shutdown Forces Cancellation of Inventors&#8217; Meeting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled its 18th
annual Independent Inventors Conference set for Oct. 11-12 in
Alexandria, Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a notice on the patent office website, the
office will stay open notwithstanding the government shutdown
that began Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent office said that it had to make &#8216;&#8216;difficult
decisions to ensure core patent and trademark operations are
maintained for as long as possible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office, which operates on user fees, said it is should
be able to stay open for about four weeks using previous year&#8217;s
fee reserves. &lt;/p&gt;

applied to register the term &#8220;Firetube&#8221; as a trademark,
according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application, filed Sept. 25, indicates that the
Seattle-based company plans to use the mark for a wide range of
services, including online social-networking, a mobile software
application, and the dissemination of advertising via the
Internet and other communications networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other uses for the mark, Amazon says, are the provision of
non-downloadable pre-recorded content via wireless networks,
communication through portable electronic devices, electronic
mail services and graphic design services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kentucky Restaurant Successful in Defense of &#8216;Derby Pie&#8217; Mark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kern&#8217;s Kitchen Inc., a Kentucky restaurant that&#8217;s been in
business for more than 50 years, won a trademark battle against
a restaurant that was started by the founder of the Kentucky
Fried Chicken chain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute was over a pie that is associated with the
Kentucky Derby horse race. According to the database of the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, Louisville, Kentucky-based Kern&#8217;s
Kitchen began using the name &#8220;Derby Pie&#8221; in 1964, and
registered it as a U.S. trademark in October 1969. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said on its website that the pie, which has
chocolate chips and walnuts among its ingredients, is a secret
recipe and &#8220;no one has ever been able to duplicate our special
filling and delicate crust.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That hasn&#8217;t stopped many people from trying. A Google
search for the terms &#8220;Derby Pie&#8221; and &#8220;Recipe&#8221; yields more
than 48,000 hits. Kern&#8217;s Kitchen has successfully filed other
trademark suits related to the pie&#8217;s name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kern&#8217;s Kitchen objected to the use of the term &#8220;derby
pie&#8221; to describe a dessert served at Claudia Sanders Dinner
Houses Inc., of Shelbyville, Kentucky, and filed an infringement
suit in federal court in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Dinner Houses website, the restaurant was
founded in 1968 by Harland Sanders, and originally known as
&#8220;The Colonel&#8217;s Lady.&#8221; Sanders sold his Kentucky Fried Chicken
company to a group of investors in 1964, and the chain is now a
unit of Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) He and his wife Claudia, inspired by
their &#8220;knowledge of Southern Recipes and their natural leaning
toward the restaurant,&#8221; then opened The Colonel&#8217;s Lady. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders died in 1980 at the age of 94, and his widow died
in 1996, at the same age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its complaint, Kern&#8217;s Kitchen said that it renewed its
trademark in 2009 and didn&#8217;t authorize the mark&#8217;s use by the
defendant. It asked the court for an order barring further
infringement and damages of $335,000 together with awards of
attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 1 a federal court in Frankfort, Kentucky, issued an
order permanently barring Dinner Houses&#8217; use of &#8220;Derby Pie,&#8221;
and dismissing all other claims. The court said each party must
pay its own attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner Houses&#8217; menu lists a dessert containing chocolate
chips and pecans that is now named &#8220;Claudia&#8217;s Kentucky Pie.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Kern&#8217;s Kitchen Inc. v. Claudia Sanders Dinner
Houses Inc., 3:13-cv-00013-GFVT, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Kentucky (Frankfort). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pennsylvania Theater Sued Again by Broadway Copyright Holders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entertainment Theatre Group, which does business as
American Music Theatre, was sued for the second time in two
weeks for infringing copyrights of Broadway musicals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first suit was filed in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Sept.
25 by the Walt Disney Co. (DIS), which objected to the allegedly
unlicensed use of content from its &#8220;Mary Poppins,&#8221; &#8220;The Lion
King&#8221; and &#8220;Spider-Man&#8221; in American Music Theater&#8217;s
&#8220;Broadway: Now and Forever.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second suit was filed by the Rodgers  Hammerstein
Organization, Andrew Lloyd Weber&#8217;s Really Useful Group Ltd., and
the Music Theatre International licensing agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content that is allegedly used without permission is
drawn from &#8220;The Producers,&#8221; &#8220;West Side Story,&#8221; &#8220;Jesus
Christ Superstar,&#8221; &#8220;Annie,&#8221; &#8220;Cats,&#8221; &#8220;Joseph and the
Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,&#8221; &#8220;Music of the Night,&#8221;
&#8220;Evita,&#8221; &#8220;Phantom of the Opera,&#8221; and &#8220;Les Miserables,&#8221;
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music organizations asked the court to bar the
unauthorized use of their content and for awards of money
damages, attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Music Theatre didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new case is The Rogers and Hammerstein Organization v.
Brubaker, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania
(Allentown). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier case is Disney Enterprises Inc. v.
Entertainment Theatre Group, 13-cv-05570, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Allentown). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Canada Defense Department Move May Be Security Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s Department of National Defense is taking a second
look at plans to move into facilities previously occupied by the
now-defunct Nortel Networks Corp. after listening devices were
discovered there, the Ottawa Citizen reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet and communications provider was the target of
industrial espionage beginning in 2000 and security analysts say
bugs and other devices from the Nortel era may still be found at
the site, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of National Defense hasn&#8217;t revealed whether
the bugs found were new or dated from Nortel&#8217;s occupancy, the
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s federal government, which has dedicated almost
$1 billion Canadian ($968 million) to the purchase and the
renovation of the site, has said it may consider having other
departments move there rather than the defense department,
according to the Citizen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. is talking to HTC
Corp. (2498) about adding its Windows operating system to HTC&#8217;s
Android-based smartphones at little or no cost, people with
knowledge of the matter said, evidence of the software maker&#8217;s
struggle to gain ground in the mobile market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terry Myerson, head of Microsoft&#8217;s operating systems unit,
asked HTC last month to load Windows Phone as a second option on
handsets with Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s rival software, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the talks are private.
Myerson discussed cutting or eliminating the license fee to make
the idea more attractive, the people said. The talks are
preliminary and no decision has been made, two people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its willingness to add Windows as a second operating
system underscores the lengths to which Microsoft will go to get
manufacturers to carry its software. HTC, the first company to
make both Windows and Android phones, hasn&#8217;t unveiled a new
Windows-based handset since June and has no current plans to
release any more, said one person. Microsoft, with 3.7 percent
of the market, is finding it necessary to make concessions after
agreeing to acquire Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset unit, which competes
with other smartphone makers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon stepped down as chairman of the lender&#8217;s
main bank subsidiary at the start of July, according to a person
briefed on the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who serves as CEO and chairman of the parent
company, handed off his post at the unit to William C. Weldon, a
JPMorgan board member and former head of Johnson  Johnson (JNJ), said
the person, who asked not to be named because details of the
move weren&#8217;t announced. A regulatory document released yesterday
listed Dimon as &#8220;chairman emeritus&#8221; of the subsidiary, which
runs JPMorgan&#8217;s deposit and consumer banking operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has sought to bolster corporate governance and
rebuild its relationship with watchdogs after probes by
regulators and a Senate panel faulted the firm for withholding
information from U.S. overseers during trading losses last year.
Dimon handed off the chairman title at the unit after company
attorneys recommended it for technical reasons, rather than
because of pressure from regulators or investors, said the
person, who&#8217;s familiar with the bank&#8217;s thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a company spokesman, declined to comment.
Dimon&#8217;s status as chairman emeritus at the unit was disclosed in
JPMorgan&#8217;s annual &#8220;living will,&#8221; describing to regulators how
the New York-based firm could be wound down in an emergency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) began returning workers
to shuttered Gulf of Mexico operations and Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. said it expected to follow suit as Tropical Storm Karen
weakened off Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron, which produces oil and gas
from the Tahiti and Blind Faith fields and has a stake in the
Perdido development, said on its website at 1 p.m. Eastern time
today that it would be resuming normal operations. It didn&#8217;t say
how long that would would take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm &#8220;doesn&#8217;t seem to be as significant as was once
thought, but we&#8217;re still monitoring the situation,&#8221; Vincent
Piazza, a Princeton, New Jersey-based oil production analyst for
Bloomberg Industries, said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said it was unclear how long the disruptions would last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko (APC), based in The Woodlands, Texas, halted production
and cleared employees from the Independence Hub and the Neptune,
Constitution and Marco Polo platforms. Workers on the latter two
may return later today, John Christiansen, a spokesman at
Anadarko&#8217;s headquarters, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies with Gulf operations, including London-based BP Plc (BP/), the largest leaseholder in the deepwater there,
kept energy production offline. Those producers and refiners
planned to remobilize as conditions allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 62 percent of Gulf oil production, some 866,000
barrels of oil per day, and 48 percent of natural gas output, or
1.8 billion cubic feet daily, was offline today, according to
the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BP Operations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP secured wells being drilled by rigs it operates in the
Gulf. The company also halted production at all four of its
platforms there -- Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Na Kika and Mad Dog
-- and evacuated non-essential workers. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)
cut rates at Louisiana and Alabama plants. BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP),
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) and the Williams Cos. (WMB) were
also among the companies curbing energy output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm, with top winds holding at 40 mph (60kph), was
130 miles south-southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, as of 2
p.m. New York time and had stalled, the National Hurricane
Center said in an advisory. Karen would be downgraded to a
tropical depression if sustained winds drop below 39 mph, which
the National Hurricane Center said will probably occur tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy markets expect the storm to be &#8220;kind of a blip,&#8221;
resulting in short-lived supply disruptions, Dave Hackett,
president of consulting firm Stillwater Associates, in Irvine,
California, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Lessons Learned&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There were a lot of lessons learned from Hurricane
Katrina and subsequent storms,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A big tropical storm
is wet, but don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll do any serious damage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline futures for November delivery slid 3.2 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.6076 a gallon yesterday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement since December. Oil
gained 0.5 percent, and natural gas rose 0.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell cut rates at its 85,000-barrel-a-day plant in Mobile,
Alabama, and Motiva Enterprises LLC reduced output at the
250,000-barrel-a-day Norco, Louisiana, refinery because of
shipment delays caused by Karen, Shell said on its website
yesterday. Motiva is a joint venture of Shell and Saudi Aramco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell, based in The Hague, also was removing some
nonessential personnel from drilling operations in the eastern
Gulf, the company said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valero Energy Corp. (VLO), Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC), Chevron and
other refinery operators said they were monitoring the storm and
hadn&#8217;t cut production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Four Platforms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based BP&#8217;s four deepwater platforms have a combined
capacity to produce 660,000 barrels of oil and 990 million cubic
feet of natural gas a day, according to BP&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marathon halted output and evacuated all workers from its
Ewing Bank platform 130 miles south of New Orleans, the Houston-based company said on its website. The company said it shut in a
total of 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melbourne, Australia-based BHP ceased production and
evacuated its Gulf of Mexico facilities, Jaryl Strong, a
spokesman for the company, said by e-mail yesterday. Williams
shut and evacuated the Canyon Station, Devils Tower and Blind
Faith platforms in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the company said
on its website yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destin Pipeline LLC, which can transport 1.2 billion cubic
feet of gas a day from the Gulf, declared force majeure Oct. 3,
saying in a notice to shippers that it&#8217;s incapable of providing
services from its offshore receipt points because of the storm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enbridge Inc. (ENB)&#8217;s Manta Ray and Mississippi Canyon gas
pipeline systems in the Gulf also declared force majeure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOOP LLC, the only U.S. port capable of offloading ultra-large crude carriers, suspended tanker operations, the
Covington, Louisiana-based company said in a statement on its
website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
most-read Bloomberg News reports from the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. First U.S. Shutdown in 17 Years Unavoidable With No Talks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government stands poised
for its first partial shutdown in 17 years at midnight tonight,
after a weekend with no signs of negotiations or compromise from
the Congress or the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Government Shutdown Begins as Congress Divides on Spending &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government began its first
partial shutdown in 17 years, idling as many as 800,000 federal
employees, closing national parks and halting some services
after Congress failed to break a partisan deadlock by a midnight
deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Goldman Said to Make $1.5 Million Error in Ford Bond Issue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. mistakenly
added about $1.5 million of interest costs to a Ford Motor Co.
bond sale last week by using the wrong Treasury note as a
benchmark for the security, according to two people with
knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Global Stocks Drop, Treasuries Gain as Government Shutdown
Looms &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Global stocks fell the most in a
month, trimming the biggest quarterly advance since the start of
2012, before a potential U.S. government shutdown. Treasuries
pared early gains while crude oil slid to the lowest level in
three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Schwarzman Says Selling BlackRock in 1994 Was &#8216;Heroic&#8217; Error &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Blackstone Group LP&#8217;s Steve
Schwarzman said his decision 19 years ago to sell what would
become the world&#8217;s largest money manager was a &#8220;heroic&#8221;
mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Stocks Climb as Treasuries, Commodities Fall Amid U.S.
Shutdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Stocks rebounded from yesterday&#8217;s
slide as investors speculated the economic effects from the
shutdown of the U.S. government will be limited and counteracted
by Federal Reserve stimulus. Treasuries fell as gold tumbled and
the dollar recovered from early losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Stocks Drop on U.S. Government Shutdown as Yen, Treasuries
Gain &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Stocks slid around the world and gold
rallied as the U.S. government shutdown entered a second day and
a report showed American employers added fewer jobs than
forecast. The dollar fell, while the yen and Treasuries rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Seaport Agrees to Merge With Global Hunter to Build Boutique &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Seaport Group LLC, the  credit-market brokerage founded in 2001, agreed to merge with boutique
investment bank Global Hunter Securities LLC to create a full-service firm with more than 300 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Debt Ceiling Wall of Worry Is Another Reason for Investing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. congressional standoff that
shut down the government for the first time in 17 years is a
buying opportunity for stock investors, if history is any guide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. Broncos&#8217; Point Spread Against Jaguars Seen Being NFL Record &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Peyton Manning&#8217;s record-setting start
to the season -- 16 touchdown passes as the Denver Broncos have
marched to 4-0 -- has oddsmakers eyeing what may be the highest
point spread in National Football League history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. JPMorgan&#8217;s Big Mistake Was Valuing Trades: William D. Cohan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- In the end, what have we learned
from JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $7.1 billion &#8220;London Whale&#8221;
trading debacle? For those who have lost track, the derivatives
trades resulted in losses of $6.2 billion plus an additional
$920 million in fines -- so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Steve Jobs Never Worried About Debt Ceiling: Caroline Baum &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Everyone knows, or has heard the
cliche, that markets hate uncertainty. It&#8217;s also a given that
the future is always uncertain. How, then, do markets ever
manage to function -- or, for that matter, businesses, which
must make decisions today about investments that will pay off in
the future? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. As Party Splinters, Boehner&#8217;s Leadership Collapses: Ezra
Klein &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- We&#8217;re used to brinkmanship in
Washington resulting from conflict between Democrats and
Republicans. But this shutdown is different. It&#8217;s a fight
between Republicans and Republicans -- or, more specifically,
Republicans and the Tea Party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Worried About Cancer? Ask Someone to Marry You: Virginia
Postrel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- When I mentioned my bout with
breast cancer to a new acquaintance, his first question was,
&#8220;Are you married?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Republicans Aren&#8217;t Crazy for Fighting Obamacare: Ramesh
Ponnuru &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- For many supporters of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, continued resistance to the
law isn&#8217;t just mistaken. It&#8217;s downright pathological. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MULTIMEDIA &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Draghi Says ECB Ready to Act to Control Money Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank President Mario
Draghi speaks at a news conference in Paris about euro-area
inflation, money-market rates, economic activity and the process
of an asset-quality review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Bitcoin Price Swings as Startups Draw Regulators&#8217; Glare &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin, the digital currency, has
gained prominence this year for its wild price swings and for
piquing the interest of regulators from New York to Germany.
Bloomberg&#8217;s Stephanie Baker reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Italy&#8217;s Letta Urges Lawmakers to Seize the Moment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta
addresses lawmakers in the Senate in Rome seeking their support
to save his government in a confidence vote. (This report is in
Italian.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Cruise the Med on a Super-Yacht for $444,000 Per Week &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Bloomberg Television takes a trip
from Nice to Monaco in the Mediterranean Sea on a super-yacht
that costs $444,000 a week to rent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. The Million Dollar Cars of Christian Von Koenigsegg &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) --  Bloomberg&#8217;s Joel Weber reports on
the rare, million dollar cars of Christian Von Koenigsegg. He
speaks with Deirdre Bolton on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Money
Moves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
