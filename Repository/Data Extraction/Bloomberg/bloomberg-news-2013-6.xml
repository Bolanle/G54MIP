&lt;p&gt;Deepak Gulati, a former head of
global equity proprietary trading at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
started investing at his own hedge fund after raising about $300
million, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentiere Capital AG, run by Gulati, 35, and a team of
former colleagues from JPMorgan, started trading yesterday from
its base in Zug, Switzerland, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the move hasn&#8217;t been made public. The fund
will focus on volatility trades, betting on the rate at which
stocks rise or fall. Gulati declined to comment on the
fundraising or his backers yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He joins a growing group of traders who&#8217;ve left banks since
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 prompted
U.S. regulators to try to limit risk-taking by lenders, through
the so-called Volcker rule, a law that tries to prevent lenders
from using federally-insured deposits to make speculative bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Nomura Holdings
Inc. executives who left to start hedge funds in the past three
years have already shut their firms down after they lost money
amid markets dominated by Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis.
Pierre-Henri Flamand, former head of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s biggest
proprietary-trading unit, and Herve Gallo, a former equity-derivatives trader at Nomura, have both shut their funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentiere, named after a skiing village in the French
Alps, has 15 employees, including seven former JPMorgan workers
focused on trading and investment analysis, the people said. The
firm plans to stop seeking additional investors if assets climb
to $750 million, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm also has portfolio managers who make event-driven
bets and others who make quantitative wagers. Event-driven
investors try to profit from corporate actions such as
acquisitions, bankruptcies and buybacks, while quant investors
use mathematical models to predict changes in asset prices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney fighting with a malfunctioning robot of Abraham Lincoln -- what great fodder for a juicy operatic scene. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You wouldn&#8217;t guess that from watching Philip Glass&#8217;s &#8220;The Perfect American,&#8221; having its U.K. premiere at English National Opera. At the end of Act 1, robo-Lincoln and Walt tussle. The music chugs without excitement. The curtain comes down quietly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a robotic American president going crazy, for heaven&#8217;s sake. Shouldn&#8217;t there be a chorus screaming? Some brass playing comical raspberries? Some tension? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There should, and there isn&#8217;t. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s symptomatic of the problems in Glass&#8217;s 25th opera, which presents the imaginary memories of Disney as he lies dying in 1966. Even though Rudy Wurlitzer&#8217;s libretto (based on a novel by Peter Stephan Jungk) is bitty, it does offer a few moments which cry out for big musical brush-strokes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The malfunctioning Lincoln-bot provides one such scene. There&#8217;s another when megalomaniacal Walt insists he will never die, and forces his family and friends to salute the American flag and repeat the words &#8220;Never say die.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It could be a chilling set piece. Glass simply repeats the same few familiar chord progressions, and studiously avoids emotional peaks and troughs. You&#8217;d find more variety in the monitor of a coma patient going beep-beep-beep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gradual increase in U.S. interest
rates will have limited impact on Hong Kong equities because
benefits from a stronger economy will outweigh the negatives,
according to JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve may slow its asset purchases in the
second half of this year if the U.S. labor market continues to
improve, and may start raising interest rates from mid- to late
2014, said Tai Hui, Hong Kong-based chief market strategist for
Asia at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees about $1.5
trillion globally. A liquidity withdrawal caused by U.S.
interest-rate hikes will have little impact on the city&#8217;s equity
market because most of the fund flows associated with
quantitative easing have been into fixed income, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As long as it&#8217;s not a shock to the upside in interest
rates, Hong Kong should be able to withstand it,&#8221; Hui said in
an interview on May 29. &#8220;We still like equities despite
acknowledging the event of the Fed cutting back on quantitative
easing and raising interest rates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Index surged 21 percent from September
through January as the Federal Reserve undertook a third round
of quantitative easing. Cash inflows forced the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority to intervene in foreign-exchange markets for
the first time in three years in order to protect the Hong Kong
dollar&#8217;s peg to the U.S. currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve members are debating when to reduce
stimulus that includes holding benchmark interest rates in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent and $85 billion a month of bond
purchases. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said last week that the
central bank could begin winding that back if the economy shows
sustained improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worst Market &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with increasing evidence of a recovery in the world&#8217;s
largest economy, Hong Kong&#8217;s benchmark Hang Seng Index is down
1.7 percent this year, the worst among developed markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowing growth in China and government efforts to damp
property prices in Hong Kong and the mainland have weighed on
equities. Brokerages and the International Monetary Fund lowered
their forecasts for world&#8217;s second-biggest economy last month.
Government data on June 1 showed the nation&#8217;s manufacturing
expanded last month, while a private survey yesterday from HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics signaled a contraction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When Chinese growth is not matching expectations, it will
be a struggle for Hong Kong to perform well,&#8221; Hui said. &#8220;Over
the long run, we still think China is cheap. There&#8217;s a lot of
potential, but you need earnings to really set the house on fire
and that&#8217;s just not happening.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buying Opportunities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there&#8217;s buying opportunities in Chinese companies
listed in Hong Kong and in the mainland, Hui said, without
naming any companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial companies have room for organic growth, he said.
Valuations are attractive after shares priced in potential
credit quality concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gauge of banks, developers and insurers in the MSCI China
Index is down 3.7 percent this year and is trading at 6.9 times
estimated earnings. That compares with a global financials
measure, which trades for 12 times estimated earnings after
gaining 8.7 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer companies may have steady growth and investors are
willing to pay a premium, Hui said. Exporters and materials
companies should be avoided because of the slow European economy
and a sluggish recovery in the U.S., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian equities will offer returns through the second-half
of this year and into 2014, according to Hui. The upside for
equities relative to bonds is much more attractive because
capital gains for fixed income will be limited, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been advocating to clients they should really
start to tip-toe back into equities,&#8221; Hui said, noting that the
company may increase its equity allocation further. &#8220;When
earnings start to cooperate, we will advocate an even more
aggressive stance on equities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in Los Angeles weakened
for a second straight day as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) restored
operations at the Torrance refinery following a power failure
last week and a maintenance turnaround. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance plant near Los
Angeles was scheduled to flare gases through June 5 as it
restarted units, Gesuina Paras, a spokeswoman at the refinery,
said by e-mail. The refinery is &#8220;working to normalize&#8221;
operations after a power failure May 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torrance complex also began a turnaround on equipment,
including crude, alkylation and coker units, around May 3 that
was expected to last several weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
dropped 3.25 cents to a premium of 4.25 cents a gallon against
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 3:23 p.m.
New York time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prompt delivery
there slipped 0.23 cent to $2.8276 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco declined 3.25 cents to a premium of
6.25 cents a gallon. Prompt-delivery dropped 0.23 cent to
$2.8476 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for San Francisco Carbob versus the same fuel
in Los Angeles was unchanged at 2 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail gasoline in the state, which typically trails the
spot market, fell 0.5 cent to $3.987 a gallon, Heathrow,
Florida-based AAA, the nation&#8217;s largest motoring organization,
said today on its website. Prices at the pump are down 5.8
percent from a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CARB Diesel &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco was
unchanged versus ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures on the Nymex at
a discount of 1.5 cents a gallon. The same fuel in Los Angeles
gained 2 cents to a premium of 3 cents a gallon, the largest
since April 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/)&#8217;s 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson refinery in Southern
California was scheduled to shut a coker this week for planned
repairs, according to two people familiar with the schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil-products tanker Nave Bellatrix, anchored off the
coast of Panama, was scheduled to load clean products June 9 on
the U.S. West Coast for delivery to Chile, ship-fixture data
compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. West exported 73,000 barrels of distillate fuel
oil a day in March, up 22 percent from a year earlier, according
to data from the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department&#8217;s statistical arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Portland Gasoline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Portland, Oregon, conventional, 84-octane gasoline
climbed 0.5 cent to a discount of 0.5 cent a gallon. Low-sulfur
diesel there dropped 3 cents to 8 cents a gallon under ULSD
futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland gasoline&#8217;s discount to Los Angeles Carbob narrowed
3.75 cents to 4.75 cents a gallon versus Los Angeles Carbob,
after the gap stretched to the widest in a month last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles widened a third
day, gaining 1.4 cents to $18.76 a barrel at 4:24 p.m. New York
time. The spread, a rough measure of refining margins, is at the
highest level in more than two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is cutting the price of its Windows software for small tablets, seeking to shore up foundering efforts to combat Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the mobile-computing market, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is using the changes to try and get more manufacturers to adopt Windows RT, a version of its flagship software for tablets, said the people, who asked not to be identified because pricing is confidential. The price cuts affect Windows RT for small-sized tablets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A year after unveiling the first Windows RT machines aimed at eroding Apple and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s lead in the $64 billion tablet market, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is struggling. Global device makers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and HTC Corp. (2498) are shunning the system, leaving a dearth of RT machines in stores and giving Windows RT less than a percentage point of market share in the first quarter, compared with 40 percent for Apple, according to IDC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You need more breadth of equipment manufacturers making the devices, you need lower prices, you need a better selection of devices,&#8221; said Wes Miller, an analyst at Kirkland, Washington-based Directions on Microsoft. That&#8217;s calling into question &#8220;the long-term viability&#8221; of Microsoft&#8217;s Windows RT strategy, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co (KO). Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent marked the return of the world&#8217;s largest soda maker to Myanmar after 60 years by opening a bottling plant and pledging more investment in the newly opened economy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company will invest $200 million in the next five years and a second plant will open in a month&#8217;s time, Kent said in an interview with Haslinda Amin on Bloomberg Television. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a great moment in history, just like it used to be when we opened up our business in east and central Europe in the former Soviet Union right after the fall of the Berlin wall,&#8221; Kent said. &#8220;We can retain and grow our leadership that we already have in this market today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#8217;s new plant begins in earnest a race with PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) to control beverage markets in the Southeast Asia nation, which reopened its borders last year to foreign investment. Myanmar President Thein Sein has allowed more political freedom and loosened economic controls since coming to power two years ago, attracting companies such as Ford Motor Co., MasterCard Inc. (MA) and Unilever NV. (UNA) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The country is boosting economic, military and political ties with Western nations after years of isolation that left its 64 million people among Asia&#8217;s poorest. Its transition to democracy last year after about five decades of military rule prompted the U.S. to ease sanctions last May. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Boosting Ties &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola will need to focus on distribution to win over the nation&#8217;s consumers, Kent said. PepsiCo has been building drinks distribution in the country, will soon distribute snacks there and is pursuing plans for a factory. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;As important as price, it is availability, it is serving the product in the right conditions, making it available, making it at an arms reach of desire,&#8221; Kent said. &#8220;We have plans to ensure that we have the best, most modern 21st century consumer distribution system in the country.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Coca-Cola left Myanmar about 60 years ago, PepsiCo has more recent experience in the nation. The world&#8217;s largest snack maker pulled out of Myanmar in 1997 after activists urged the company to sever ties with the military dictatorship because of human-rights violations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unilever has said it will focus on opportunities in new markets in Southeast Asia, such as Myanmar, which could be &#8220;another Vietnam&#8221; in 20 years, according to Peter Ter-Kulve, the London- and Rotterdam-based company&#8217;s chief executive officer for Southeast Asia. The company is already selling its products through 100,000 outlets in the country, he said in an interview last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Duane D.

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest seller of computer services, agreed
to buy SoftLayer Technologies Inc., a cloud-computing storage
provider that will help it compete with Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is paying almost $2 billion for Dallas-based SoftLayer,
according to a person familiar with the deal, who declined to be
named because the financial terms aren&#8217;t being released.
SoftLayer had $335 million in revenue in 2012, Chief Executive
Officer Lance Crosby said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM plans to add SoftLayer to its SmartCloud unit to create
a new Cloud Services division to capitalize on a market that
researcher IDC estimates may more than double to $105 billion by
2016 from last year. SoftLayer specializes in public clouds --
data-center networks that manage computing and software for
businesses remotely -- where Amazon dominates. IBM is pairing
those capabilities with private-cloud operations, building
dedicated systems for individual customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a new division through acquisition &#8220;allows us to
get focused,&#8221; said Ric Telford, IBM&#8217;s vice president of cloud
services. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about acceleration. We had been building
out but we saw SoftLayer and the acquisition was too compelling
to pass up,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s California
Adventure, bolstered by a $1.1 billion expansion, led the
world&#8217;s largest theme parks with a 23 percent surge in visitors
to 7.78 million last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendance at the top 25 parks worldwide increased 5.2
percent to 205.9 million visitors in 2012, according to a report
today by the Themed Entertainment Association and the consulting
firm Aecom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market in North America was, this year as last year,
driven by major reinvestment at the major operators&#8217; parks,&#8221;
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest theme park operator, tripled
its investment in its resorts division between 2008 and 2012,
spending $9.2&#160;billion on two new cruise ships and improvements
to its properties. The company&#8217;s net income jumped 32 percent to
$1.51 billion in the second quarter, in part due to higher
attendance and a surge in profits at its parks business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s California Adventure park in Anaheim opened its
Cars Land attraction in June 2012, drawing tourists to a new
area based on the Pixar &#8220;Cars&#8221; films. Neighboring Disneyland
was the only park among the world&#8217;s largest to register fewer
visitors last year, with attendance shrinking 1.1 percent to 16
million, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
trader Fabrice Tourre lost a bid for a ruling that he wasn&#8217;t
liable under U.S securities laws for foreign transactions while
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission won a ruling that
Tourre violated a provision of U.S. securities law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre had sought summary judgment, or a ruling before
trial, in a lawsuit filed against him by the SEC. U.S. District
Court Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan today denied his
motion and granted the SEC a partial ruling that Tourre had
violated a provision of the Securities and Exchange Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, citing a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, claimed he
couldn&#8217;t be held liable under U.S. securities laws for foreign
transactions, such as those he made for Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, which allegedly lost almost
all of its $150 million investment, and ABN Amro Bank NV, which
assumed the credit risk associated with a portion of a CDO
called Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Morrison v. National Australia Bank ruling by the
Supreme Court, Tourre argued the SEC&#8217;s claims should be
dismissed because they involved transactions outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fraud Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forrest ruled that the SEC had established a domestic
component of its fraud claim against Tourre tied to
misrepresentations he made in connection with ACA Management
LLC&#8217;s sale of protection on $909 million of the Abacus notes,
which defaulted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge granted the SEC its request for partial summary
judgment on an Interstate Commerce claim that Tourre used the
telephone, Internet or e-mail to accomplish his fraud, and a
claim that the fraud occurred in connection with a transaction
in which liability was incurred in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued the London-based trader in April 2010, saying
he defrauded investors by not disclosing that hedge fund Paulson
 Co. had helped pick the underlying securities for Abacus and
planned to bet against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To make the showing, the SEC must prove only that the
offeror was in the United States at the time he or she made the
relevant offer,&#8221; Forrest said in her ruling. &#8220;The SEC has
satisfied that burden. It has cited to record evidence that
would allow a reasonable jury to find that Tourre worked in New
York at all relevant times. It has also cited to record evidence
that would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that he e-mailed
and called both IKB and ABN to discuss possible transactions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reaching a $550 million settlement with New York-based Goldman Sachs, the SEC filed a new claim against Tourre,
saying he gave the company &#8220;substantial assistance&#8221; as it
misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones, who presided
over Tourre&#8217;s case before leaving the bench, dismissed some
claims involving IKB and ABN Amro, citing the Supreme Court
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high court ruled that U.S. securities laws don&#8217;t
protect foreign investors who buy stocks on overseas exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Rogers Chepiga, a lawyer representing Tourre, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a voice-mail message left at her office
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased with the decision and look forward to

&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Brown, who helped lead
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s municipal finance business after
serving as California&#8217;s state treasurer, is retiring after 12
years with the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown, 67, was chairman of investment banking for the
Midwest, according to a memo from Richard J. Gnodde, David Solomon and John S. Weinberg, the firm&#8217;s co-heads of investment
banking. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based
bank, confirmed the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Kathleen has played an integral role in building the
firm&#8217;s public sector and infrastructure franchise,&#8221; the memo
reads. &#8220;She has developed trusted relationships with many of
the firm&#8217;s clients and has led many important transactions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown ran the firm&#8217;s West Coast municipal finance team
until 2010, when she moved to a newly created post in Chicago
and helped lead the public finance unit in the Midwest. The move
came in part to avoid any conflict of interest after her brother
Jerry Brown was elected California&#8217;s governor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown&#8217;s father, Edmund &#8220;Pat&#8221; Brown Sr., also served as
governor and Brown herself was the 1994 Democratic nominee,
losing to Pete Wilson. She served as treasurer of the state from
1991 to 1995. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown worked at Bank of America Corp. before joining
Goldman Sachs in 2001 with its private wealth management group,
according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Newswires reported Brown&#8217;s retirement earlier
today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management boosted its
Treasury holdings in recent weeks to take advantage of higher
yields and on the expectation the Federal Reserve will maintain
an accommodative monetary policy to spur growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark 10-year yield climbed to the highest level in
14 months last week amid speculation improving U.S. economic
data will prompt the Fed to scale down its asset-purchase
program. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said last month the Fed could
reduce stimulus if there are indications of economic growth will
be sustained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve got an ambiguous growth picture,&#8221; said Nick Gartside, international chief investment officer for fixed
income in London at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees
about $1.5 trillion. &#8220;That&#8217;s Treasury supportive because it
means the risk is that central banks keep monetary policy looser
as opposed to tightening it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury 10-year yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.13 percent at 12:07 p.m. in New York
after climbing to 2.23 percent on May 29, the highest level
since April 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management increased its holdings of
Treasuries to &#8220;neutral-ish&#8221; from underweight &#8220;a week or so
ago,&#8221; Gartside said. An underweight position means it owns
fewer securities than recommended in the benchmark index it uses
to track performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed, which is buying $85 billion of government and
mortgage-backed securities each month, will probably taper its
purchases at some point, Gartside said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To us it&#8217;s just part of the natural evolution of central
bank policy but I think the message is that it will still look
loose as opposed to tight, irrespective of the degree of
tapering,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company prefers German and Japanese government bonds to
Treasuries due to the differences in central-bank policy that
will probably develop in light of the weaker underlying
economies of Japan and the euro area, Gartside said. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Simon Kennedy" date="Jun 04, 2013  4:48 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-04/goldman-sachs-s-hatzius-says-fed-could-taper-buying-in-september.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Hatzius Says Fed Could Taper Buying in September</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve could announce a
reduction of its monthly bond purchases as early as September if
employment and inflation strengthen enough, said Jan Hatzius,
chief economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs&#8217;s forecast remains for Fed officials to
wait until December before slowing their $85 billion of monthly
asset purchases, Hatzius said yesterday that so-called tapering
could occur sooner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A September tapering is certainly possible, I think that
is going to depend on the data,&#8221; Hatzius said in a Bloomberg
Television interview at Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Global Macro Conference
in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation that a strengthening U.S. economy will allow
the Fed to reduce its monetary stimulus has helped propel the
yield on the 10-year Treasury bond to its highest since April
2012 even as Chairman Ben S. Bernanke expresses caution over
trimming the program too soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The likelihood that the economy will continue to grow about
2 percent over the next couple of quarters with inflation &#8220;well
below&#8221; target will probably stay the Fed&#8217;s hand until December,
Hatzius said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, an earlier pullback could occur if payrolls
regularly increase by more than 200,000 a month or inflation
outside of food and energy costs speeds up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a mosaic of different indicators,&#8221;
Hatzius said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the broad picture.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consider Tapering &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernanke said May 22 during a response to questions
following Congressional testimony that the central bank could
consider reducing the amount of assets it buys within &#8220;the next
few meetings&#8221; if officials see signs of sustained improvement
in the labor market. Still, he has warned that &#8220;premature
tightening&#8221; could reduce inflation and jeopardize the economic
expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With unemployment lingering at 7.5 percent, higher than
before the last recession, the policy-setting Federal Open
Market Committee announced May 1 it will increase or decrease
the pace of its monthly purchases in response to changes in
inflation and the labor market. Policy makers agreed to maintain
monthly buying of $40 billion in mortgage securities and $45
billion of U.S. Treasuries in a bid to boost employment. The
purchases have expanded Fed assets to about $3.4 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Very Resistant&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with global bond markets posting their biggest monthly
losses in nine years in May, led by a 2 percent drop in
Treasuries, Hatzius said the Fed is going to be &#8220;very resistant
to a large tightening of financial conditions precipitated by a
bond-market sell off.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He predicted the 10-year Treasury bond yield will end 2013
at 2.5 percent and 2014 at 3 percent, up from 2.12 percent
yesterday. Goldman Sachs anticipates U.S. economic growth of 1.9
percent this year and 2.9 percent in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not in his outlook is a repeat of 1994 when a sudden and
sharp increase in interest rates from the Fed surprised many
investors. Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
said May 2 that the current rate environment has parallels to
then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed increased its benchmark rate 3 percentage points
from February 1994 to February 1995, from a then record-low 3
percent to 6 percent. The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury
bond surged above 8 percent in late 1994 from below 6 percent 12
months earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, employment and inflation are weaker than two decades
ago, while the Fed has become more transparent and better at
communicating its plans to financial markets, Hatzius said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not expecting a 1994,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, the
transatlantic combination of London-based law firm Norton Rose
LLP and U.S. law firm Fulbright  Jaworski LLP was completed
yesterday as the firm announced its leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merger creates a 3,800-lawyer firm with more than 50
offices in Europe, the Americas, Asia, Australia, Africa and the
Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Martyr will continue to lead the global executive
management team&#160;and is joined by Fulbright&#8217;s former managing
partner Kenneth Stewart. The firm&#8217;s global chairman is Adrian Ahern, based in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Norton Rose Fulbright has a strong business model and
culture. We also have momentum,&#8221; Martyr said in a statement.
&#8220;This combination endorses our position on the global stage.
This is one of the largest transatlantic legal combinations
completed to date and confirms Norton Rose Fulbright as a global
legal practice. We have an exciting future ahead.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the firm has more than 750 lawyers at 11 U.S.
offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combined firm, which operates under a Swiss verein, a
corporate structure that allows the firms to keep separate
profit pools, will rank among the top 10 wealthiest law firms
with its combined gross revenues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norton Rose has lawyers across a range of practices. The
firm said in a statement its key industry sector strengths are
financial institutions; energy; infrastructure, mining and
commodities; technology and innovation; transport; and life
sciences and health care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mid-America to Buy Colonial Properties in $2.2 Billion Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter LLP was legal adviser to Mid-America
Apartment Communities Inc. (MAA), a Memphis-based residential
landlord, which agreed to buy Colonial Properties Trust (CLP) for
about $2.2 billion in stock to expand as demand climbs for U.S.
apartment rentals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell  Berkowitz PC also
advised Mid-America. Burr  Forman LLP and Hogan Lovells LLP
advised Colonial Properties. Burr  Forman partners Mike
Atchison and Ed Hardin, who are outside co-general counsel for
Colonial, worked on the deal. Burr partners Jack Stephenson and
April Mason also worked on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colonial investors will receive 0.36 newly issued Mid-America shares for each share of Colonial they own, the
companies said in a statement yesterday. Based on Mid-America&#8217;s
closing share price of $67.97 on May 31, that indicates a price
of $24.47, about 11 percent more than Birmingham, Alabama-based
Colonial&#8217;s last close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter&#8217;s deal team was led by Gil Menna, and
included partners Yoel Krantz, Mark Opper, Craig Todaro and Neal Sandford on tax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker Donelson&#8217;s partners include Robert J. DelPriore and
Richard F. Mattern, corporate, and William H.D. Fones Jr., tax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hogan Lovells team consisted of Washington corporate
partners Paul Manca, Warren Gorrell, Joe Gilligan, and
Washington tax partner Cristina Arumi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latham  Watkins LLP is advising JPMorgan in the
transaction with a corporate team led by Orange County partner
Charles Ruck, and Los Angeles partner Julian Kleindorfer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal would create a real estate investment trust with
about 85,000 rental units, primarily focused on the U.S. south.
Demand for rental homes is rising among Americans who can&#8217;t
qualify for a mortgage or don&#8217;t want to own property after the
worst housing crash since the Great Depression. The nation&#8217;s
apartment-vacancy rate was 4.3 percent in the first quarter, the
lowest in more than a decade, according to Reis Inc. (REIS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The scale of the combined company will support
accelerated growth,&#8221; Mid-America Chief Executive Officer H. Eric Bolton Jr. said in the statement. The merger will &#8220;drive
higher margins as a result of synergies and advantages
generated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mid-America shareholders will own about 56 percent of the
combined company&#8217;s equity with Colonial owners holding the rest.
Bolton will be chairman and CEO, while Mid-America&#8217;s chief
financial officer and chief operating officer will also assume
those roles at the combined company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;International Project Finance Partner to Join Milbank in Tokyo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milbank, Tweed, Hadley  McCloy LLP&#160;announced that project
finance lawyer&#160;Aled Davies, previously the head of Allen  Overy
LLP&#8217;s Asia Pacific projects group, will join the firm in Tokyo
in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davies, who will be a member of Milbank&#8217;s global project
finance group, recently advised on the Ichthys LNG project, a
liquefied natural gas facility being developed in Western
Australia and the Northern Territory, Australia, the firm said.
The $34 billion Ichthys LNG project is the largest project
financing ever, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to his project work, Davies often advises
clients on asset-based financings, including tax-based leasing
of large drillships and other vessels used in energy
exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are fortunate to gain the talents of Aled Davies, who
has led high-profile financings in every corner of the globe,
with an emphasis on high-impact energy and natural resource
development,&#8221; Milbank chairman&#160;Scott Edelman said in a
statement.&#160;&#8220;His arrival also underscores our commitment to
Japan, where we recently marked our 35th anniversary as the
first international law firm in Tokyo.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milbank&#8217;s project finance practice teams has more than 100
lawyers, who closed on more than 140 project financings, raising
more than $125 billion in the last three years, the firm said.
Milbank is headquartered in New York and has 600 lawyers at 11
offices in the Americas, Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Herbert Smith Global Funds Partner Joins Bingham &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bingham McCutchen LLP is expanding its global funds
practice with the addition of Herbert Smith Freehills LLP&#8217;s
Thiha Tun as a partner in the London office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tun, who joins the firm in September, represents investment
funds, investment managers and others in the funds industry. He
works with private equity, real estate, infrastructure and hedge
funds, the firm said. He will work closely with partner John
Holton, who relocated his international funds practice to the
London office from Boston in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thiha has built a strong practice that will augment our
growing international funds and financial regulatory
capabilities,&#8221; Bingham investment management practice group
leader Roger Joseph said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bingham has about 1,000 lawyers in 14 offices in the U.S.
Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Akin Gump Adds Corporate Partner Chen in Beijing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akin Gump Strauss Hauer  Feld LLP added to its corporate
practice in Asia with the hire of Chen Li as a partner in the
firm&#8217;s Beijing office. She was previously at Milbank, Tweed,
Hadley  McCloy LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen&#8217;s practice concentrates on outbound and cross-border
mergers and acquisitions and foreign direct investment, with a
focus on major Chinese state-owned enterprises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Outbound MA is emerging as a key driver of growth and
consolidation for Chinese companies,&#8221; Greg Puff, head of Akin
Gump&#8217;s Asia practice said in a statement. &#8220;Li has proven skills
helping Chinese companies navigate these transactions and a
track record as a well-respected lawyer with a profound
appreciation of her clients&#8217; needs and goals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akin Gump has more than 850 attorneys in offices throughout
the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Fights U.S. E-Books Pricing Claims in Antitrust Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL), accused by the U.S. of being the ringleader in
a conspiracy with publishers to fix prices of electronic books,
went to trial in a case that will feature evidence from the
company&#8217;s dead founder, Steve Jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for the U.S. Justice Department began his opening
statement in Manhattan federal court yesterday in a rare
antitrust trial to determine whether Apple orchestrated an
illegal price-fixing agreement when it entered the e-books
market in 2010 with the introduction of the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple and five of the six biggest U.S. publishers
&#8220;consciously committed to a scheme to raise e-book prices
throughout the industry&#8221; that cost consumers hundreds of
millions of dollars, Justice Department lawyer Lawrence Buterman
told U.S. District Judge Denise Cote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple claims it did nothing wrong and says it benefited
consumers by bringing innovation and competition to an e-books
market that was dominated by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Apple&#8217;s lawyer,
Orin Snyder, a partner at Gibson Dunn  Crutcher LLP, yesterday
echoed Apple&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook in his opening
statement yesterday, calling the government&#8217;s case &#8220;bizarre.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apple is going to trial because it did nothing wrong,&#8221;
Snyder said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is the last defendant remaining in the case after the
five publishers sued by the government avoided trial by
settling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You don&#8217;t see a lot of these antitrust trials,&#8221; said
Andrew M. Friedman, a partner with the law firm Patton Boggs LLP
in Washington. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty unusual.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is part of an upsurge in antitrust litigation by
the Justice Department, reflecting an Obama administration that
has been more aggressive than its predecessors in challenging
companies. The government is seeking an order barring Apple from
anticompetitive actions, including price-fixing, in the market
for digital books. The U.S. isn&#8217;t asking for money damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of states is also seeking fines and unspecified
damages. If Apple is found liable in the trial, damages will be
determined in a separate proceeding. A win for the government
may fuel class actions by private plaintiffs seeking triple
damages permitted under antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government team is led by Mark W. Ryan, the director of
litigation for the Justice Department&#8217;s Antitrust Division. Ryan
joined the division after a career in private practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan supervised a lawsuit that challenged beermaker
Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)&#8217;s proposed $20.1 billion purchase of
Grupo Modelo SAB. The suit was settled in April. Ryan is joined
by Buterman, who represented the government in a 2011 case that
killed HR Block Inc. (HRB)&#8217;s proposed $287.5 million acquisition of
the maker of TaxAct products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Gervey, a lawyer in the Texas attorney general&#8217;s
office, is the lead lawyer for the states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Apple Inc., 12-cv-02826, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Robert E. Rice Named as Chief Counsel to SEC Chairwoman White &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert E. Rice was appointed Securities and Exchange
Commission Chief Counsel, Mary Jo White said yesterday in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rice is a former federal prosecutor and most recently, the
head of governance, litigation and regulation for the Americas
at Deutsche Bank AG in New York. He was also the global co-head
of its governance, litigation and regulation operating
committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the SEC, Rice will be a senior legal and policy adviser
to White and provide advice and counsel on regulatory matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rice, 57, began his legal career in 1987 as an associate at
Simpson, Thacher  Bartlett LLP, in New York, and spent from
1991 to 2000 in the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s
Office in the Southern District of New York. He investigated and
prosecuted securities fraud, mail and wire fraud, and money
laundering cases and was named Deputy Chief of the Criminal
Division, according to the SEC statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Deutsche Bank in 2004, he spent four years
at McDermott, Will  Emery LLP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Singapore Ex-Law Professor Jailed Five Months for Corruption &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tey Tsun Hang, a former associate professor of law at
National University of Singapore, was sentenced to five months
in prison for abusing his position by having sex with a student
and accepting gifts from her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Corruption must be stamped out effectively and swiftly,&#8221;
Chief District Judge Tan Siong Thye said in imposing the
sentence at a Singapore subordinate court yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan imposed a longer term than had been sought by
prosecutors, who had recommended that Tey, 42, be jailed for at
least 12 weeks for violating the &#8220;sacred&#8221; position of a
teacher and undermining the university&#8217;s reputation. Tey&#8217;s
lawyer Peter Low had sought only a fine for his client, or if
necessary, he said, a short jail term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan raised Tey&#8217;s bail to S$150,000 ($119,000) from
S$100,000. Tey was handcuffed and led away by four police
officers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low said his client will be released once the bail is
processed and will appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tey was sentenced to three months in jail for having sex
with the student and two months for accepting the gifts, to be
served consecutively. He was given the same terms for a second
sex charge and three other charges of accepting gifts, which are
to run concurrently. Each charge carried a maximum sentence of
five years in jail and a S$100,000 fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tey, fired by the university after his conviction, had said
the gifts and sex were part of a consensual relationship he had
in 2010 with the student, now 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Prosecutor v. Tey Tsun Hang. DAC027011/2012.

(JPM) may see as much as $1.6 billion go down an Alabama (BEESAL) sewer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank by assets agreed to forgive $842 million of debt owed to it by Jefferson County, Alabama, where it took the lead in arranging risky securities deals that pushed the county into the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy, in November 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That agreement follows a $722 million settlement in 2009 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to the Jefferson County financing. JPMorgan&#8217;s total costs amount to a quarter of the $6.2 billion trading loss in 2012 from corporate-credit bets by a trader known as the London Whale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth C. Seymour, a bank spokeswoman, had no comment on the accord announced yesterday. If accepted by the court, it would cap almost a decade-long fiscal disaster in Alabama&#8217;s largest county, where JPMorgan initially reaped substantial fees arranging interest-rate swaps that subsequently proved tainted by municipal corruption and devastating to taxpayers during the 2008 credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everybody thought there was a free lunch and they could all take advantage of it at the same time,&#8221; said Christopher Taylor, the former executive director of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. &#8220;It burned them all.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s Supreme Court revoked the seizure of Chevron Corp.&#8217;s (CVX) assets in the country six months after an embargo that threatened to derail plans to develop shale deposits with state-run YPF SA. (YPF) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The embargo was rejected in a five-page ruling, overturning a November decision by Judge Adrian Elcuj Miranda ordering 40 percent of Chevron&#8217;s Argentine bank accounts to be held in escrow at the request of Ecuadorean plaintiffs to enforce a $19 billion award against the second-biggest U.S. oil company, according to the ruling posted late yesterday on the Supreme Court&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &#8220;decision from Argentina&#8217;s Supreme Court confirms that the Ecuadorian embargo should not have been issued in the first place,&#8221; James Craig, a spokesman for San Ramon, California-based Chevron, said yesterday in an e-mailed response to questions. &#8220;This is a significant development further demonstrating the illegitimacy of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs&#8217; attempt to enforce their fraudulent judgment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ecuador has blamed Texaco Inc. (677004Q), which Chevron acquired in 2001, for destroying the environment in the Lago Agrio region through its oil exploration activities and damaging the living conditions of 30,000 inhabitants. The Ecuadorean plaintiffs filed the attachment order in Argentina under an international treaty signed by Ecuador, Argentina and Colombia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Shale Deposits &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We respectfully disagree with the ruling,&#8221; Enrique Bruchou, the Argentine lawyer for the Ecuadorean plaintiffs, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The trial court, a unanimous Court of Appeals, and especially senior Judge Carlos Fayt in his dissent, all appreciated, Chevron&#8217;s Argentine subsidiaries do have the right to be heard in Ecuador. We will continue pursuing the defense of the rights of the Ecuadorean plaintiffs against the Argentine subsidiaries of Chevron.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Ecuadorean plaintiffs rights to sue Chevron&#8217;s Argentine units haven&#8217;t been affected by this ruling, which refers exclusively to a precautionary ruling for the seizure of assets, Bruchou said. The Ecuadorean plaintiffs filed the attachment order under an international treaty signed by Ecuador, Argentina and Colombia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ruling unfreezing Chevron&#8217;s accounts paves the way for a $1.5 billion venture between Chevron and YPF (YPFD) to develop shale oil and gas at what may be the &#8220;the world&#8217;s second-largest shale oil reservoir,&#8221; according to Ali Moshiri, Chevron&#8217;s head of Latin America and Africa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vaca Muerta &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;YPF rose 2.2 percent to 123.15 pesos at the close in Buenos Aires, the biggest gain since May 29. Chevron slid 1.1 percent to $121.57 in New York trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chevron, the fourth-largest producer of oil in Argentina, signed an accord on May 15 establishing terms for a definitive agreement with YPF (YPF), Argentina&#8217;s biggest energy company, to develop an area at the shale formation of Vaca Muerta. The total investment in the venture could reach $15 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any deal to work with YPF in exploring the nation&#8217;s shale formations must be preceded by a lifting of the embargo on Chevron&#8217;s assets, Chairman and CEO John Watson said on March 12. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alejandro Di Lazzaro, a spokesman for YPF in Buenos Aires, declined to comment in a telephone call. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;YPF has struggled to proceed with plans to tap non-conventional oil and gas deposits in Argentina to boost output a year after President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner seized a 51 percent stake in the company from Spain&#8217;s Repsol SA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;YPF increased energy imports this year after a fire in April at its largest refinery in La Plata lowered output levels. The company has been shut out of international capital markets because of double-digit borrowing costs for Argentine issuers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Pablo Gonzalez in Buenos Aires at pgonzalez49@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) hired former Citigroup

&lt;p&gt;Chevron &#8220;has contracted Martin Lovegrove to an advisory

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), whose
shariah-compliant bond program was questioned by Islamic
scholars in 2011, led its first sukuk in more than three years
after helping a Saudi property developer raise $450 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank was a lead arranger on Dar Al Arkan Real Estate
Development Co. (ALARKAN)&#8217;s sukuk on May 21, reforging links with the
Riyadh-based real estate company after helping arrange the sale
of its $450 million five-year bonds in February 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank is seeking to catch up with U.S.
competitors as demand accelerates for securities that conform to
Islamic principles. Global sales reached a record $46.5 billion
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while
issuance has increased 4 percent to $18.3 billion in 2013.
Citigroup Inc. (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are U.S. banks that have
appeared among the global top 10 underwriters for Islamic bonds
in the last five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an area of growing importance as a source of
funding&#8221; for borrowers, Martin Weber, head of debt capital
markets for Europe Middle East  Africa growth markets at
Goldman Sachs, said by phone yesterday. &#8220;Our presence in the
region and connectivity with local issuers has gone up. You have
seen us on Dar Al Arkan, and there is going to be more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic financial assets could more than double by 2015 to
as much as $3 trillion, Standard and Poor&#8217;s said in September.
Emerging market sukuk have returned 0.3 percent this year,
according to the HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai Sukuk Total Return Index.
That compares with a loss of 1.9 percent for debt in Bloomberg
USD Emerging Market Composite Bond Index. (BEM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai Electricity  Water Authority secured more than $5
billion of bids for the $1 billion of Islamic bonds it sold in
February. Islamic Development Bank, the Saudi Arabia-based
multinational lender, last week received $1.5 billion in bids
for $1 billion of securities as it paid the lowest yield of the
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Islamic industry is growing faster than conventional,
so every financial institution is looking at it,&#8221; Afaq Khan,
chief executive officer of Standard Chartered Saadiq, said by
phone this week. &#8220;If clients are demanding Shariah-compliant
solutions, you must develop accordingly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GE Sukuk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman in 2009 helped arrange the sale of GE Capital&#8217;s
$500 million Islamic bond, ranking it 24th on the list of global
sukuk underwriters. The bank was 17th in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;International sukuk issues, which is where houses such as
ours would historically add value, had better times three years
ago,&#8221; said Weber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman has yet to issue from its own $2 billion sukuk
program. The sukuk, blessed at the time by eight of the world&#8217;s
top scholars, was criticized by some Islamic advisers for not
ensuring the debt would be traded at par value as mandated by
Islamic law. Advisers including Riyadh-based Mohammed Khnifer of
Edcomm Group Banker&#8217;s Academy in New York also said it&#8217;s unclear
how Goldman will use the funds it raises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lack of product and industry knowledge could up-end the
essence of Shariah-compliance,&#8221; Hatim El-Tahir, director of
Deloitte&#8217;s Islamic Finance Knowledge Centre, said by e-mail this
week. &#8220;It could threaten the risk-return profile of both
industry and product.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growth Strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks &#8220;need to see a buoyant product, and right now that
is sukuk,&#8221; Rizwan Kanji, Dubai-based partner at King 
Spalding, said by phone this week. &#8220;That is what is driving
these players.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has hired a &#8220;big name&#8221; in Hussein Hassan, former
global head of Islamic structuring at UBS AG (UBSN), which proves the
bank&#8217;s commitment to the industry, Kanji said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BofA Merrill Lynch was a lead manager as Asya Katilim
Bankasi AS (ASYAB) raised $250 million in Tier 2, 10-year bonds on March
28. The issue was the first of its kind from Europe, Turkey or
the Middle East, King  Spalding said. Kanji worked on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BofA Merrill Lynch has done a lot of conventional
issuance in Turkey,&#8221; said Kanji. &#8220;The bank has played to its
strengths to build an Islamic platform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for JPMorgan and BofA Merrill Lynch weren&#8217;t
available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased competition in the industry could work in banks&#8217;
favor, said Standard Chartered (STAN)&#8217;s Khan, as lower fees increase
the chances borrowers will come to market and more banks means a
greater profile for the Islamic industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-three banks have underwritten global sukuk sales this
year, compared with 30 in the year-earlier period, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Forty-four companies and governments
have sold Islamic bonds, up from 36 in the year-earlier period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The more people we have talking about a product and
Islamic solutions to their clients, the deeper the market
becomes,&#8221; said Khan. &#8220;So while a few fees may go down, the
absolute size of the market will increase.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), facing lackluster
sales of tablets running its software, said it will include the
popular Outlook e-mail program in a new version of Windows RT,
after a previous application met with customer complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlook 2013 RT will be part of the free Windows 8.1 update
that will be publicly tested starting June 26 and officially
released later this year, the company said in a blog posting.
Users of Windows RT -- Microsoft&#8217;s software for devices running
chips with ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology -- said the previous e-mail program was more basic and lacked many Outlook features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose executives are speaking today at the
Computex computer show in Taipei, are trying to jump-start sales
of Windows RT-based tablets after just 200,000 units were
shipped in the first quarter, according to IDC. In an effort to
woo device makers that have avoided using the operating system,
the company is rolling out price cuts for partners who opt to
use RT in smaller tablets, people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re always listening to our customers,&#8221; the company
said in the blog. &#8220;One piece of feedback was that people want
the power of Outlook on all their Windows PCs and tablets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Chief Financial Officer Tami Reller will unveil the
addition of Outlook as part of a speech at the conference, and
Antoine Leblond, a Windows vice president, will give the first
public demonstration of Windows 8.1. The company announced some
features of the updated software last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ARM Tablets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows RT is a version of Windows 8 for machines running
chips based on ARM designs. Of five such devices that have gone
on sale since the program was released in October, only
Microsoft&#8217;s own Surface tablet remains widely available, Reller
said last month. Computer makers such as Acer Inc. (2353) and Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) have steered clear of the operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows RT already comes with several Office programs,
including Word and Excel for spreadsheets. Instead of including
Outlook, which also lets users manage contacts and calendars,
the company built a new mail app for this version of Windows,
prompting complaints from customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one Microsoft partner also asked the company to
reconsider. Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang
has said he wants Microsoft to include a version of Outlook that
works on RT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Give me Outlook and I&#8217;ll use it every day,&#8221; Huang, whose
company makes chips used in Microsoft&#8217;s Surface RT and other
devices based on the software, said in May. The executive said
in March that he was disappointed with sales of RT-based
tablets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will lend
$500 million to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as the company seeks
$8 billion of loans, two people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pledge by the New York-based bank forms part of a
facility that will cut debt costs for China&#8217;s biggest e-commerce
company, the people said yesterday, asking not to be identified
because the details are private. Edward Naylor, a spokesman for
Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alibaba is locking in three- and five-year loan financing,
introducing a smartphone operating system and buying a stake in
China&#8217;s biggest Twitter-like service -- steps considered a
prelude to an initial public offering that may value the company
at as much as $100 billion. Investment banks are keen to form
relationships with Alibaba to increase their chances of being
selected to help with the share sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs wants to use this as an opportunity for
further chances of cooperation,&#8221; including the IPO, said Alex Wang, a Beijing-based analyst at Internet consulting group
iResearch. &#8220;These banks might not come across a chance like
this in years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Alibaba, said
he had &#8220;no comment on speculation regarding who may have joined
the syndication&#8221; when asked about the company&#8217;s financing
plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commodities are trailing equities for
the longest stretch in almost 15 years as Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Citigroup Inc. predict the end of the decade-long bull
market even as the global economy expands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
lagged behind the MSCI All-Country World Index for six months,
the longest stretch since 1998. Hedge funds cut combined bullish
bets across 18 U.S. raw-material futures by 51 percent from a
16-month high in September and are bearish on six of them.
Commodities will return 1.6 percent in a year as losses in
agriculture and precious metals diminish gains from energy and
industrial metals, Goldman said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors pulled a record $23.3 billion from commodity
funds this year as global equities attracted $182 billion,
according to EPFR Global, which tracks money flows. Prices that
more than doubled in 10 years spurred expansions at mines, farms
and oil fields. Gluts are emerging as the International Monetary
Fund predicts global growth of 3.3 percent this year, from 3.2
percent in 2012. The group cut last week its estimates for
China, the top consumer of metals, grains and energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are times when you probably should be avoiding
commodities, and I think this is one of them,&#8221; said John Stephenson, who helps oversee about C$2.7 billion ($2.61
billion) at First Asset Investment Management Inc. in Toronto.
&#8220;Anytime you have a whole lot of inventory and visible supply,
prices are going to be under pressure. The real issue for
commodities is the source of demand, China, is weak.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Natural Gas &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI dropped 2.8 percent this year, as 17 members
of the gauge retreated. Silver led the decline, falling 25
percent. Corn and gold also entered bear markets in April,
joining copper, sugar, wheat, soybeans and coffee. Natural gas
is leading the gainers with a 14 percent advance, while cotton
rose 13 percent. The commodity index is 29 percent below its
record close in July 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI equity gauge gained 6.7 percent since the end of
December, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the SP 500
Index reaching records last month. The dollar strengthened 2.2
percent against six major trading partners. Global bonds
measured by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Broad
Market Index lost 1.5 percent in May, the most since April 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities are diverging from equities as the supercycle,
or longer-than-average period of rising prices, is eclipsed by
the supply surge, Jeffrey Currie, Goldman&#8217;s head of commodities
research in New York, wrote in a report May 14. The agricultural
segment of the SP GSCI will drop 13 percent in 12 months as
livestock and precious metals lose 4 percent, he said. Energy
and industrial metals will advance 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Domestic Consumption &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most commodities will drop this year as China&#8217;s economy
moves from a focus on infrastructure to domestic consumption and
services, Citigroup&#8217;s Ed Morse said in a May 20 report. That
means investors should pay more attention to supply and demand
rather than just broad economic trends, he said. The bank
predicted the end of the supercycle in November. UBS AG and
Credit Suisse Group AG made similar forecasts this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI more than tripled since the end of 1999,
including 11 gains over the past 13 years, setting records in
everything from oil to gold to copper. Producers struggled to
keep up as China&#8217;s economy expanded more than fivefold. That
attracted a surge of investment and assets under management
totaled $409 billion in March, from $154 billion at the end of
2008, Barclays Plc estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corn Supply &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pessimism about commodities is focusing on the price of raw
materials as the pace of growth in consumption slows. China will
use 5.2 percent more copper this year, from a gain of 6.8
percent in 2012, Barclays estimates. The nation is still using
enough copper in cables each month to circle the globe almost 90
times, government data show. It will consume more than one in
every five tons of global corn supply this year as its hog herd
reaches 447 million animals, six times the U.S. figure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., where builders use about 400 pounds of copper
in a single-family home, sales of new properties in April
reached the second-fastest pace since July 2008. Central banks
in the U.S., Europe and Asia are still printing unprecedented
amounts of money to boost growth, adding to the almost doubling
of global sovereign debt to $23 trillion since the end of 2008,
a Bank of America index shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biggest Exporter &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supply expansions may fall short of forecasts as bad
weather curbs crops in the U.S., the biggest exporter, and
mining is disrupted. Farmers in Iowa, the largest U.S. corn and
soybean grower, had their wettest April and May in records going
back to 1873. Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc.&#8217;s Grasberg
operation may be shut for as long as three months after a tunnel
collapsed last month. The Indonesian mine is the biggest source
of copper after Escondida in Chile, where port strikes have
disrupted metal shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The outlook for commodities is likely to be brighter,&#8221;
said Alan Gayle, a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital
Management in Richmond, Virginia, which oversees about $48
billion of assets. &#8220;The outlook will turn bullish when demand
starts moving higher. I&#8217;m not jumping in yet with both feet and
am going to let the story develop first, which I expect to
happen over the next few months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for
Chinese growth this year and next on May 29. It&#8217;s now predicting
7.75 percent, from an earlier projection of 8 percent for 2013
and 8.2 percent for 2014. The U.S. economy grew at a 2.4 percent
annualized rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department
said May 30, cutting its previous estimate of 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Largest Retailer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheaper raw materials may boost margins for companies from
McDonald&#8217;s Corp. to General Mills Inc. to Boeing Co., while
keeping inflation in check and allowing the Federal Reserve to
continue stimulus. Kraft Foods Group Inc. cut the cost of its
Gevalia coffee by 6 percent last month and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
the world&#8217;s largest retailer, is reducing grocery prices. U.S.
retail gasoline fell 4.5 percent from this year&#8217;s peak in
February, American Automobile Association data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and other large speculators are holding a net-long position of 652,708 futures and options across 18 U.S.
commodities, from 1.3 million in September, government data
show. Supply will exceed demand for 12 of 18 of the metals and
agricultural products, according to estimates from Barclays and
Rabobank International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate crude oil will average $90 a barrel
this year, from $94.15 in 2012, Citigroup estimates. U.S.
inventories reached the highest since 1931 on May 24, government
data show. New drilling technology is unlocking supplies trapped
in shale formations, helping the U.S. meet the highest
proportion of its own energy needs since 1986. Crude rose 2.7
percent in New York trading this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exchange Traded &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold dropped 17 percent, the worst start to a year since
1982. Holdings through exchange-traded products tumbled 19
percent to the lowest since May 2011. Bullion will drop this
year for the first time since 2000, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 38 analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LMEX index of six industrial metals fell 6.3 percent.
Copper stockpiles tracked by exchanges in London, Shanghai and
New York more than doubled in the past year. Production will
outpace demand for the first time in four years in 2013, Morgan
Stanley predicts. Prices will decline about 6 percent in 12
months, Goldman estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers around the world will harvest the biggest grain and
soybean crops ever, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
estimates. Corn will extend this year&#8217;s 22 percent decline by
another 3.2 percent in six months, as wheat drops 11 percent,
Goldman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have the combination of higher production together
with slower growth in China,&#8221; said Adrian Day, who manages
about $135 million of assets as the president of Adrian Day
Asset Management in Annapolis, Maryland. &#8220;For rest of the year,
you have a potential surplus of production over demand, which
obviously means lower prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
won a key part of a protest over the Central Intelligence
Agency&#8217;s cloud-computing contract with Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Government Accountability Office, which arbitrates
federal contract disputes, today sustained Armonk, New York-based IBM&#8217;s challenge of the four-year award, which has a
maximum value of $600 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GAO recommended that the CIA reopen negotiations with
the companies and amend the solicitation &#8220;if necessary,&#8221; said
Ralph White, the office&#8217;s managing associate general counsel for
procurement law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intelligence agency failed to properly evaluate prices
and waived one contract requirement only for Amazon, according
to the GAO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GAO denied IBM&#8217;s assertion that the CIA failed to
properly evaluate Amazon&#8217;s past performance, including service
outages that occurred in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM filed the protest Feb. 26. The full decision wasn&#8217;t
publicly released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We now anticipate the reopening of the contract proposal
process,&#8221; said Clint Roswell, an IBM spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials with the CIA and Amazon didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to calls and e-mails seeking comment about today&#8217;s
decision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should turn to leveraged-loans to preserve income as volatility in the high-yield bonds
sparks outflows, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-largest underwriter of the debt in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record money flowing into funds that purchase floating-rated debt and issuance of collateralized loan obligations has
supported senior ranking debt in the face of a bond sell-off in
the last two weeks, the New York-based lender said in a report
yesterday as it it&#8217;s overweight loans this month versus bonds.
Returns of 0.12 percent on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s/LSTA 100 index
outpaced U.S. junk bonds for the first time in six months, which
lost 0.5 percent in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds sold by companies in the U.S. suffered losses on
concern that Federal Reserve policy makers may consider reducing
stimulus measures that had fueled demand for higher yielding
debt. Loans funds have received record deposit on expectations
the debt will deliver positive returns during a period of rising
rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Loan prices are being supported by demand for floating
rate instruments amid concerns about QE tapering,&#8221; JPMorgan
strategists led by Jan Loeys wrote in the report. &#8220;This is
helping to keep the loan market particularly steady in the face
of higher volatility in high-yield bond markets. A strong
payroll report on Friday will likely further hurt HY bonds and
support their floating rate counterparts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 22, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the
Fed could slow the pace of its $85 billion of bond purchases in
its &#8220;next few meetings,&#8221; in testimony to the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonds Lose &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, U.S. junk bonds have lost 2.3 percent, to trim
gains this year to 3 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show. That compares with a 2.6 percent advance for
the SP/LSTA 100 index this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors added $930 million last week to funds that
purchase loans, pushing year-to-date deposits to more than $28
billion, according to a May 30 report from Bank of America Corp.
That represents an increase of about 36 percent in net assets
for the year, outperforming funds that purchase credit assets
such as U.S. and emerging market corporate debt. CLO issuance
climbed to $35 billion for the year at the end of last month,
according to SP Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary  Data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK)&#8217;s iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond
exchange-traded fund reported investor redemptions of 3.3
million shares, or about $305 million, from the fund June 4, its
biggest one-day outflow on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans are a form of high-risk debt that carry
ratings of less than Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and below
BBB- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. lender, raised 105.6 billion yen ($1.1 billion) in the
largest sale of Samurai bonds since October as overseas
borrowers flock to a market flush with stimulus cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four-part offering includes 51.5 billion yen of 0.462
percent three-year bonds priced to yield 10 basis points more
than the yen swap rate, and 27 billion yen of 2018 notes at a
spread of 14 basis points, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The New York-based lender also sold 10-year fixed-rate and three-year floating-rate debt, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan follows Rabobank Nederland and Nordea Bank AB in
offering Samurai notes as Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda&#8217;s plan to double the monetary base helps bolster demand
for higher-yielding debt. HSBC Holdings Plc&#8217;s banking unit,
Credit Agricole SA and the Slovak Republic are planning
offerings this month, according to regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are looking to shift their portfolios from
government bonds, but they can&#8217;t really go into the more
volatile securities like stocks,&#8221; Mana Nakazora, Tokyo-based
chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas SA, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;The issuers are taking advantage of the strong
investor appetite for foreign bonds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world&#8217;s
largest smartphone maker, fell the most in more than nine months
in Seoul after analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut profit
estimates, citing slowing demand for its flagship Galaxy S4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares declined 6.2 percent to 1,427,000 won as of the
close of trade, the largest drop since Aug. 27. The stock was
the biggest drag on the MSCI Asia Pacific index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orders for the S4 smartphone, which went on sale last
month, are slowing on weak demand in Europe that may impact
profit margins, analysts led by JJ Park said in a report dated
yesterday, citing supply chain checks. JPMorgan cut its share-price estimate for Samsung by 9.5 percent to 1.9 million won and
lowered its 2013 earnings estimates by 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Compared to S3, S4 had stronger momentum in the first
quarter of launch,&#8221; the analysts wrote, affirming their
overweight rating on the stock. &#8220;But the following quarter&#8217;s
shipment is expected to be disappointing and its peak-quarter
number seems way below our previous estimates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan now expects Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung&#8217;s
shipments of the S4 to be 60 million this year, compared with a
previous estimate of 80 million. Samsung sold 10 million units
of the S4 within 27 days, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also unveiled a smaller, less-powerful version of the
phone last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, Roberto Setubal set out to challenge Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Setubal was chief executive officer of Banco Itau SA, one of Brazil&#8217;s biggest retail and commercial banks. At the time, investment banking in the country was dominated by U.S. and European firms, with Goldman Sachs the perennial leader in advising on mergers and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The single Brazilian bank competing with the outsiders was Banco Pactual SA -- and it was bought in 2006 by Zurich-based UBS AG (UBSN), Bloomberg Markets will report in its July issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More from the July issue of Bloomberg Markets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setubal launched his quest by acquiring a small rival, Banco BBA Creditanstalt SA, in 2003. He renamed it Banco Itau BBA SA and told its CEO, Fernao Bracher, that his job was to dislodge foreign banks from their perches atop the investment-banking ranks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Setubal opened the coffers of Banco Itau, now Itau Unibanco Holding SA, to help Bracher do it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;By maintaining Itau BBA as a different company, we kept the sophistication, agility and flexibility in decision making of an investment-banking boutique and at the same time gave this boutique the power to use the huge capital base of Itau,&#8221; Setubal, 58, says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     June 7 (Bloomberg) -&#8211; IDFC Ltd. (IDFC), India&#8217;s biggest financier
of clean-energy projects, will increase its investment in wind
power, joining Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in adding to holdings in
the nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDFC&#8217;s alternative assets arm will invest about 2.5 billion
rupees ($44 million) over the next six months in its Green Infra
Ltd. unit, Raja Parthasarathy, partner at IDFC Alternatives,
said in an interview. That will boost its investment in Green
Infra to 12 billion rupees to help the unit fund acquisitions
before a planned initial public offering, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will raise its investment in India&#8217;s ReNew
Wind Power Pvt. by $135 million to $385 million, spokesman
Edward Naylor said in an e-mail yesterday. Wind power producers
in India are buying smaller companies and consolidating in an
effort to amass larger portfolios that generate cheaper power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are excellent opportunities in the market for
companies with the capital,&#8221; Parthasarathy said in the May 31
interview by phone. The additional funding will allow Green
Infra to expand faster by buying already operating wind and
possibly solar assets, he said. &#8220;You will see us a lot more
active on acquisitions of operating assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed to acquire a majority stake in ReNew
Wind for 10 billion rupees in September 2011. The wind producer
plans to have 1,000 megawatts of generation capacity by 2015,
the companies said in a statement at that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planned IPO &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Delhi-based Green Infra, a renewable-energy developer
set up by IDFC in 2008, will consider an IPO once it has
increased capacity, Parthasarathy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To get to the public market, Green Infra needs to be of a
size and scale that will allow for a successful listing,&#8221; he
said. That should be in about 18 months as the company raises
operating capacity to 500 megawatts, from 320 megawatts
currently, the executive said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling shares in Singapore, London&#8217;s Alternative
Investment Market or locally are among the possibilities Green
Infra will evaluate, Parthasarathy said. Hyderabad-based Mytrah
Energy Ltd. (MYT), backed by IDFC&#8217;s infrastructure arm, and the wind
unit of Mumbai-based lender Infrastructure Leasing  Financial
Services Ltd. are also evaluating share sales in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDFC has invested 39 billion rupees in clean-energy
companies, more than the state-backed Indian Renewable Energy
Development Agency, making it the industry&#8217;s biggest funder,
according to IDFC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those include investments in Moser Baer India Ltd. (MBI)&#8217;s solar
photovoltaic unit and wind-turbine maker Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL)&#8217;s SE
Forge unit. IDFC swapped its SE Forge shares into those of the
listed parent two years ago, then sold off its Suzlon stake
recently, Parthasarathy said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) showcased &#8220;Lone
Ranger&#8221; and &#8220;Monsters University&#8221; characters tied to its
Infinity video-game platform, which goes on sale in August and
is designed to boost the company&#8217;s money-losing interactive
unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The play sets, drawing on characters from the forthcoming
Disney movies, feature plastic figurines that are set on top of
a base unit and appear on screen. The characters were shown
yesterday with the Infinity system at E3, the video-game
industry&#8217;s annual conference in Los Angeles that runs through
this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, unveiled
Infinity in January, saying it would reduce costs and improve
earnings at its interactive division by incorporating characters
from multiple Disney movies in the same game. The company also
has been promoting other characters for the platform, including
from its &#8220;Cars&#8221; and &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8221; films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You play your way and it is as fun for you as anyone
else,&#8221; said John Blackburn, chief executive officer of
Avalanche Software, a Disney Interactive unit. &#8220;We want this to
be deep enough for a father to play with his sons but we wanted
it to be easy enough where kids can play as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burbank, California-based Disney will sell the figures,
which will come with &#8220;power discs&#8221; that add special powers,
weapons and vehicles from Disney movies. A starter kit with the
base and figures from the &#8220;Pirates&#8221; and &#8220;Monsters&#8221;
franchises and &#8220;The Incredibles&#8221; is priced at $75, and the
game can be played by four people over an Internet connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players can use characters from the starter pack across
other games. An area called &#8220;Toy Box&#8221; allows users to create
their own game in genres including racing, sports, fighting and
world-building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strong &#8216;Buzz&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infinity&#8217;s combination of video-game play with collectible
figures is similar to &#8220;Skylanders,&#8221; a game from Activision
Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) that generated more than $500 million in sales in
the U.S. last year. Infinity comes out Aug. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think the buzz around Infinity is very strong,&#8221; Sean McGowan, an analyst at Needham  Co., said in an e-mail. &#8220;It
comes at a time when parents are being asked to shell out a lot
of money for gadgets -- tablets and new consoles that already
have a solid claim on some of that discretionary budget, but if
it&#8217;s a quarter the success of &#8216;Skylanders,&#8217; it&#8217;s a big hit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney earlier this year pushed back the release date for
Infinity from June and said in a May 7 conference call that the
interactive division would report a loss in the current fiscal-third quarter similar to the $54 million shortfall it
experienced in the prior three-month period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe in Infinity,&#8221; Bob Iger, chairman and chief
executive officer, said on the call. &#8220;We think it will be a
great product and it&#8217;s going to help drive profitability for
fiscal year 2014.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 1.6 percent to $63.83 at the close today in New
York. The stock has gained 28 percent this year, compared with a
15 percent advance for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $85
million of notes tied to the Topix index of Japanese stocks, the
largest such offering since December 2010, after increasing the
size twice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six-month securities, $15 million of which were most
recently issued on June 4, yield the gains and losses of the
benchmark with all capital at risk, according to a prospectus
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The New
York-based bank sold the first $50 million offering on March 21
and $20 million more on May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s stocks have gained the most among developed markets
this year after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to beat
deflation and the Bank of Japan embarked on unprecedented
stimulus measures. The central bank plans to buy more than 7
trillion yen ($71 billion) of bonds a month to increase
inflation to 2 percent within two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As Japan continues to pursue these policies, it is
helping to bolster domestic and foreign interest in their stock
market,&#8221; said Michael Woolfolk, global markets strategist in
New York at Bank of New York Mellon Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Topix, as the Tokyo Price Index is known, climbed 29
percent to 1,111.97 this year as of the close of trading on June
10. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, the most common equity
benchmark tied to U.S. structured notes, rose 15 percent to
1,642.81 during the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank estimated the value of the original offering as
98.9 cents on the dollar, a prospectus filed with the SEC shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bigger Offerings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been two larger offerings tied to the Topix
index since 2010, when Bloomberg started collecting
comprehensive data on structured notes. The biggest, $174.2
million of 16-month notes, was issued by the Scandinavian lender
Eksportfinans ASA on Dec. 8, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New
York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), seeking to position its Xbox One entertainment console as the premium living-room choice for gamers as well as families, showed exclusive titles such as &#8220;Halo&#8221; and set a price that surprised analysts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Xbox One will hit stores in November for $499 in the U.S., Microsoft executives said today at the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles. The console will have 13 exclusive next-generation games, said Don Mattrick, president of the company&#8217;s interactive entertainment unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is using E3 to blunt the perception that the console de-emphasizes games in favor of movies, sports and functions like Skype video-calling. The company today showed major titles like Electronic Arts Inc. (EA)&#8217;s &#8220;Battlefield 4&#8221; with some exclusive content, and highlighted features that make games more interactive, social and hyper-realistic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;As we&#8217;ve been promising, it&#8217;s all about the games,&#8221; Mattrick said from the stage at E3. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The machine, first announced on May 21, uses improved Kinect voice commands and motion sensing to recognize users and switch between games, TV shows and Skype calls. The emphasis on other content led to grumbling among serious gamers, concerns Microsoft set out to answer today showing the new Xbox&#8217;s advanced features can lift traditional game play as well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next version of &#8220;Halo,&#8221; Microsoft&#8217;s top-selling science-fiction game that has anchored the Xbox, will arrive in 2014, the company said. It will run at 60 frames per second, more than double the speed of most movies today. &#8220;Plants vs. Zombies,&#8221; another Electronic Arts game, will be exclusive to Xbox. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Price Tag &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exclusive Xbox One titles with advanced graphics also include &#8220;Sunset Overdrive,&#8221; from Insomniac Games Inc., and Crytek&#8217;s &#8220;Ryse: Son of Rome.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analysts said they were surprised at the $499 price tag for the console, an upfront cost that could potentially be lowered by contracts for content such as for Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Live service. The machine will cost 499 euros ($662) in most of Europe and 429 pounds ($668) in the U.K., Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It seems expensive,&#8221; said Brian Blau, an analyst with researcher Gartner Inc. &#8220;It really seems like they are trying to create a different type of premium product, like Apple creates a premium product with high-end design, and comes in at a high price. It certainly seems Microsoft is putting enough resources behind it to put a lot of games into the ecosystem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Price Debate &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xbox One will compete against Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s coming PlayStation 4, which also will be selling by the holidays, in addition to consoles, tablets and other devices that have eaten away at the traditional video-game market. Nintendo Co. (7974)&#8217;s Wii U, released in November, sells for about $300 in the U.S. and has missed sales targets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Xbox Live service, content partnerships with the NFL, access to Skype video calls and unique features such as the SmartGlass app that allows users to switch between screens set Microsoft apart, Mattrick said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re overdelivering value against other choices,&#8221; Mattrick said. &#8220;Any modern product these days, when you look at it, $499 isn&#8217;t a ridiculous price point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Microsoft showed a lot of games, the high price could work against it, Blau said. In the last generation of consoles, Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 3 lost its lead pursuing a similar premium pricing strategy. The Wii sold the most units in that generation and the Xbox has sold the most in the past two years or so. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge price increase,&#8221; Blau said. &#8220;Creating that premium product hasn&#8217;t really worked in the games industry. I&#8217;m skeptical.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Loyal Users &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Xbox one will probably be subsidized, said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. He said Microsoft is probably calculating it can fetch the higher price for the first 10 million units, pulling in an extra $1 billion, and it can cut the price if it has to. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will come out of the pockets of their most faithful,&#8221; Pachter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Xbox 360 ranges from about $199 to $299, depending on accessories bundled with it, such as Kinect. Microsoft unveiled a new, slimmer version of the current-generation machine today at E3. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Special Features&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xbox One titles include &#8220;Forza Motorsport 5,&#8221; which takes advantage of the console&#8217;s social capabilities to create an avatar that learns the player&#8217;s driving habits and stands in for them to keep playing while they&#8217;re away, for example at work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another title called &#8220;Project Spark&#8221; allows users to create their own games. The company also played up integration with the SmartGlass app. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developers are looking for the first new consoles in almost seven years to pull the video-game industry out of a two-year slump in retail sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our goal is to make sure that we really do take advantage of whatever special features the machines are going to bring,&#8221; said Tony Key, vice president of sales and marketing at Ubisoft SA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After some gamers criticized Microsoft for its lack of clarity on used games and how new ones will be played, the company said last week consumers may sell their games back to retailers or give them to friends, provided they have approval from the publisher. All games must be authenticated at least once every 24 hours to continue playing, the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stock Rise &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;John Reseburg, a spokesman for Electronic Arts (EA), and Alan Lewis, a spokesman for Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO)., declined to comment on whether their companies would place limits on used games sales, trade-ins or swaps among friends. A spokeswoman for Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI), the largest publisher, didn&#8217;t return a e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 0.6 percent to $35.47 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 33 percent this year, compared with an advance of 15 percent for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Cliff Edwards in San Francisco at cedwards28@bloomberg.net; Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Anthony Palazzo at apalazzo@bloomberg.net; Thomas Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chicago gasoline weakened to the
lowest level in a week versus New York futures as Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) completed maintenance at a Joliet, Illinois, refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, in Chicago fell
10 cents to a premium of 50 cents a gallon above futures traded
the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 4:15 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the smallest differential
since May 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread narrowed for a fifth consecutive day after Exxon
said it completed a refinery-wide turnaround at the 238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet plant, the fifth-largest in the U.S.
Midwest. The work, which began April 14, shut all operating
units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s what has us coming off today,&#8221; Steve Mosby, vice
president of supply consultant ADMO Energy LLC in Kansas City,
Missouri, said in a phone interview. &#8220;Exxon isn&#8217;t out there
buying, so we seem to be cooling off. Joliet is also a large
plant and it&#8217;s going to put a lot of material out there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline inventories in the U.S. Midwest, or PADD 2, were
48.4 million barrels in the week ended May 31, after falling to
4.76, the the lowest level since Nov. 30, earlier in the month,
according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may take awhile for Joliet&#8217;s output to reach the market,
Mosby said. BP Plc (BP/) said on June 6 that it plans to restart this
month its Whiting, Indiana, refinery&#8217;s largest crude unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chicago-Gulf &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return of oil refineries in the Midwest may also spur
exports of gasoline and diesel from the U.S. Gulf Coast,
according to Fotis Giannakoulis, a New York-based analyst at
Morgan Stanley. Plant restarts will boost Midwest capacity by
more than 300,000 barrels a day, he said in an e-mailed report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing, Oklahoma, dropped $3.05 to $40.87 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, on the Gulf
Coast strengthened 3.5 cents to a discount of 11.75 cents a
gallon versus Nymex futures at 3:59 p.m., the strongest level
since Feb. 27. Reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, advanced 1.5
cents to 1.5 cents a gallon above futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differentials widened after Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)
said a fluid catalytic cracker remained shut at its 81,500-barrel-a-day Texas City, Texas, refinery following a leak on
June 7. Crude units were brought back online at the plant over
the weekend, said Jamal Kheiry, a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrocracker work at Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)&#8217;s Port Arthur,
Texas, refinery also continued today, said Bill Day, a company
spokesman based in San Antonio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread on the Gulf, based on WTI, gained 39
cents to $21.24 a barrel, while the same spread for Light
Louisiana Sweet oil increased 69 cents to $12.04 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC AG (CCH) is issuing its
first bonds since the world&#8217;s second-biggest bottler of the soft
drink switched its stock listing to London from Athens as
European borrowing costs climb to a three-month high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Liquide SA (AI), the French maker of industrial gases, and
Poste Italiane SpA, the state-owned postal service, are also
raising debt as the average yield investors demand to hold
investment-grade company bonds in euros rose to 1.90 percent
from a record low of 1.64 percent reached May 17, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC moved its listing to London to access a wider
pool of investors, Chief Financial Officer Michalis Imellos said
in April. Borrowing costs are climbing after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central bank could taper asset
purchases if the employment outlook shows sustainable
improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s an element of some of these companies looking to
get into the market before nervousness spreads further,&#8221; said
Duncan Warwick-Champion, the London-based head of corporate
research at ECM Asset Management Ltd. which oversees $9.5
billion. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of discussion about the potential for
yields rising further so some of the companies that haven&#8217;t
locked in their refinancing for 2013 and 2014 are looking to do
so now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coca-Cola &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC wants to sell 800 million euros ($1.1
billion) of seven-year notes that will be priced to yield 105
basis points more than the benchmark midswap rate, according to
a person familiar with the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottler is also offering to buy back any or all of the
500 million euros of 7.875 percent notes due 2014 to lower its
interest costs and improve its debt profile, the company said
today in a statement. Philip Walters, an external spokesman for
Coca-Cola HBC, declined to comment on the new bond sale, which
needs to be completed before the buyback can begin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Liquide is raising 700 million euros from notes in
three tranches, according to a person familiar with the
transaction. The Paris-based company is selling 250 million
euros of six-year fixed-rate bonds, 250 million euros of two-year floating-rate notes and 200 million euros of three-year
floating-rate notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poste Italiane is raising 750 million euros of bonds from
its first sale since 2002. The company is offering five-year
securities to yield 225 basis points, according to a person
familiar with the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna Maria Morsucci, a spokeswoman for the Rome-based
company, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment
on the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rolls-Royce &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSE Plc (SSE), the U.K.&#8217;s second-biggest energy supplier, is
selling its first bonds this year. The Perth, Scotland-based
company is raising 600 million euros from seven-year bonds that
will be priced to yield 70 basis points more than swaps,
according to a person familiar with the offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/), Europe&#8217;s largest maker of
aircraft engines, has mandated banks to organize a call with
investors today before a possible sale of securities in euros
and pounds. It would be the London-based company&#8217;s first bond
issue since 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the high-yield market, Groupe SMCP, a French distributor
of women&#8217;s apparel, is selling 290 million euros of seven-year
securities through its subsidiary, SMCP SAS, to yield about 8.75
percent, according to a person familiar with the deal. The
proceeds will be used to repay existing debt and finance part of
its acquisition by KKR  Co., Moody&#8217;s Investors Service reported
on June 4 when it provisionally rated the notes B3, six levels
below investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM). will fight &#8220;till the end&#8221; anyone who sues claiming they were misled over more than $6.2 billion in losses at the chief investment office last year, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was no hiding, there was no lying, there was no bulls----ing, period,&#8221; Dimon said today at a conference sponsored by Morgan Stanley in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While he conceded the company made some mistakes, &#8220;no one at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), not one single solitary person, from CIO, to risk, to finance, to myself -- and a lot of people looked at it -- thought we had a big problem&#8221; when the bank reported earnings on April 13, 2012, the day Dimon dismissed news reports about the trade as a &#8220;complete tempest in a teapot,&#8221; he said. Executives thought they had losses that might cost about $200 million, Dimon said, &#8220;not a $6 billion problem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trading book had already lost more than $1 billion by that time, according to documents turned over to the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which released a 301-page report in March that accused the largest and most profitable U.S. bank of hiding losses, deceiving regulators and misinforming investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, said the New York-based company would vigorously defend against lawsuits tied to the losses. &#8220;Anyone who sues, we&#8217;re going to fight that one till the end, too, by the way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So keep that in mind.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. (6758) unveiled the PlayStation 4, its first new console in seven years, taking the battle to Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) (MSFT) with a lower-priced machine, original content and fresh titles as it targets a return to video-game dominance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The PS4 will cost $399 in the U.S., 20 percent less than Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox One, Sony executives said yesterday at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles. The machine, with sharp edges and blue highlights, allows unlimited used-game sales and doesn&#8217;t require an Internet connection, a contrast to two unpopular Microsoft features. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The console is crucial to Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai&#8217;s plan to turn around Tokyo-based Sony&#8217;s electronics business. A successful PS4 would bolster Hirai&#8217;s financial resources as he focuses on making television manufacturing profitable after nine years of losses. Sony won the first round, according to Damian Thong, an analyst at Macquarie Securities Ltd. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We now think Sony and its PS4 have the edge over Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox One,&#8221; Thong wrote in a report today. &#8220;The PS4 offers gamers a more powerful machine at $100 cheaper than the Xbox One.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To expand sales, Sony and Microsoft are looking to broaden their audiences beyond gamers by adding music, films and TV shows, with some of that content exclusive. The challenge for both companies is to capture mainstream consumers, who would otherwise play on smartphones or tablets, without alienating serious gamers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy producers must deal with the
&#8220;legitimate concerns&#8221; that gas development associated with
hydraulic fracturing is unsafe by adopting tougher standards,
Chevron Corp. (CVX) Chief Executive Officer John Watson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc&#8217;s 2010 oil spill at its deepwater well in the Gulf
of Mexico -- the worst in U.S. waters -- fueled public
skepticism of the industry, Watson said today in Washington.
Fracking, a drilling technique that has increased production by
extracting oil and gas trapped in shale rock, has drawn oil and
gas companies to rural communities that aren&#8217;t familiar with the
development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent developments add to public awareness of the risks of
drilling, and the industry needs to do a better job in resolving
the concerns, Watson said at a Center for Strategic and
International Studies event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Public expectations are very high, and there&#8217;s no reason
they shouldn&#8217;t be high,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;There are some risks
out there. Some risks are overstated. But we have to engage them
either way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurt Glaubitz, a Chevron spokesman, said Watson was
referring to concerns with truck traffic and the disposal of
hazardous wastewater from the fracking process as areas of
concern the industry needs to confront. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Air, Water &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, producers shoot a
mixture of water, sand and chemicals underground to break apart
shale rock formations to free trapped oil and gas. The technique
has led to record production of natural gas and sent domestic
oil output to its highest level in two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opponents say fracking creates air and water pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has joined environmental groups including the
Environmental Defense Fund to establish the Center for
Sustainable Shale Development that has crafted 15 performance
standards to be followed by oil and gas producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe any company would be certified today, but
we&#8217;re moving towards those standards,&#8221; Watson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Energy Information Administration said yesterday
that oil and gas from shale formations are greater than
previously estimated. Tight oil resources could be 345 billion
barrels worldwide, and shale gas estimates were increased by 10
percent from 2011, to 7,299 trillion cubic feet, according to
the EIA, which tracks and analyzes energy data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson said it may take &#8220;a lot of time&#8221; to develop some
of the resources because infrastructure is in short supply. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chicago gasoline weakened for a
sixth day, the longest streak of declines since December, on
speculation inventories of the motor fuel will get a boost from
the restart of Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Joliet, Illinois, refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for conventional, 85-octane gasoline slid 22
cents to 28 cents a gallon versus futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 2:39 p.m., the smallest premium since May
29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differential tightened 57 cents in the past six days of
trading after Exxon completed maintenance at the 238,000 barrel-a-day Joliet refinery, the fifth-largest in the U.S. Midwest.
The plant-wide turnaround, which began April 14, shut major
operating units for the duration of the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return of Joliet may boost stockpiles in the region, which
Energy Information Administration data show were 152,000 barrels
below the five-year average for the time of year as of May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon got caught in a position where maintenance may have
taken longer than expected,&#8221; Patrick DeHaan, a Chicago-based
gas analyst at GasBuddy.com, said by phone. &#8220;They were caught
buying between when they originally thought they&#8217;d be done and
what the reality was and the market may have overreacted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago gasoline peaked at a premium of 85 cents a gallon
versus Nymex futures on June 3, the highest level in data going
back to 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockpiles of motor fuel in the Midwest, known as PADD 2,
were 48.4 million barrels in the week ended May 31, after
dropping to a five-month low in early May, EIA data showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing, Oklahoma, dropped $6.71 to $34.16 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ING U.S. Inc. (VOYA), the insurer that had
its initial public offering last month, declined 3 percent in
New York trading after JPMorgan Chase  Co. gave the stock a
neutral recommendation, citing risks related to annuities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, majority-owned by ING Groep NV (INGA), fell to $27.57
at 1 p.m. after dipping as low as $27.25. Analysts at JPMorgan
led by Jimmy Bhullar set a 2014 year-end price target of $28 for
the New York-based insurer. The IPO price was $19.50 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ING U.S. is coping with liabilities from variable
annuities, in which the company ensures minimum returns to
clients on portfolios of stocks and bonds. ING U.S. has scaled
back from selling the retirement products. JPMorgan analysts
said in a research note that they expect return on equity to
&#8220;remain sub-par.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These factors, along with the prospect of secondary
offerings, justify the stock&#8217;s discount valuation,&#8221; the
analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ING Groep is required to sell off its stake in the U.S.
business by the end of 2016. ING U.S., which is changing its
name to Voya Financial, was the fourth-largest seller of
variable annuities in 2007 and had dropped out of the top 20 by
2011, according to data from industry group Limra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. (C) and
Deutsche Bank AG also rated the shares the equivalent of neutral
in research notes today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ratings are in line with our expectations and confirm
what we&#8217;ve been saying all along,&#8221; Dana Ripley, an ING U.S.
spokesman, said in a phone interview. &#8220;We need to focus on the
execution of our retirement-readiness strategy and our ROE-improvement program, which were two of the key elements of our
investment narrative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Moore" date="Jun 11, 2013 12:12 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-11/jpmorgan-chase-credit-rating-outlook-changed-to-negative-by-s-p.html"><headline>JPMorgan&#8217;s Credit Outlook Cut by S&amp;amp;P as U.S. Support Wanes</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s credit-rating
outlook was revised to negative by Standard  Poor&#8217;s, which said
the likelihood of &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; government support for the
largest U.S. banks is waning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlook on JPMorgan&#8217;s long-term rating of A was lowered
from stable, SP said today in a statement. That brings JPMorgan
in line with the seven other &#8220;systemically important&#8221; banks
including Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
whose outlooks were held at negative. New York-based JPMorgan is
the biggest U.S. bank, with $2.4 trillion in assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP may stop giving weight to the implied taxpayer support
that has bolstered credit ratings at eight of the largest U.S.
bank-holding companies. In the wake of the 2008 credit crunch,
investors have assumed the federal government would bail out
lenders in a renewed crisis because their failure would be
catastrophic for the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is becoming increasingly clear that holding company
creditors may not receive extraordinary government support,&#8221;
SP analysts led by Matthew Albrecht wrote in the statement. He
cited the framework regulators are developing that could be used
to dismantle and liquidate distressed banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP analysts believe that the U.S. government would still
stand by the operating subsidiaries of the largest banks,
Albrecht said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Absorbing Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Regulators are intent on asking holding-company creditors
to absorb losses ahead of operating-company creditors, and
they&#8217;re putting mechanisms in place that could make that more
likely,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe the U.S. government is
becoming less supportive, simply less supportive to a certain
class of creditors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If SP entirely removed U.S. support from the credit rating
of the bank-holding companies, it could result in a one- to two-level cut in their grades, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s shares dropped 0.9 percent to $53.90 at 11:52
a.m. in New York, compared with a 0.7 percent decline in the KBW
Bank Index. Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for the bank, didn&#8217;t
respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP said it will review progress that regulators make on
their new &#8220;orderly liquidation authority&#8221; as it determines
whether to stop including government support in its bank
ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lehman Bankruptcy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and U.K. regulators have been working on plans to
allow large international banks to fail without damaging the
rest of the financial system. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in 2008 helped trigger a worldwide economic
meltdown that threatened to destroy other global lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We may remove the ratings uplift we currently incorporate
if we believe that regulators and lawmakers are increasingly
likely to ask holding-company bondholders to bear losses in the
event of a liquidation of a systemically important bank,&#8221; SP
said. &#8220;We currently believe those creditors will be supported
to prevent the contagion of a crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Bank of England and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. foresee that a wide range of unsecured creditors could
face losses during a bank&#8217;s failure, according to a paper
released in December. Unsecured senior bondholders and uninsured
depositors are among those who could take a financial hit, the
paper said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk about liquid assets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) accepted almost 15,000 bottles of fine wine as loan collateral from a former high-ranking executive, according to a regulatory filing last month. Andrew Cader, a former senior director at Goldman Sachs&#8217;s specialist-trading unit, pledged a secured interest in the wines, which are primarily from the Burgundy and Bordeaux regions of France, the filing showed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s move stands out because private banks that lend money to wealthy clients against assets such as artwork and real estate have been less willing to extend loans backed by fine wines, said four specialty lenders and attorneys. While investment-grade wines have outperformed the stock market over the past decade, the asset class has been prone to fraud, prompting billionaire William Koch to file a series of lawsuits to deter counterfeiting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a lot of very highly valued wines here,&#8221; said David Parker, the head of Benchmark Wine Group in Napa, California, adding that the collection cited in the filing had an estimated market value in the low-seven-digit dollar range. &#8220;The Bordeaux are all first growth and other classified-growth and the Burgundies are all grand cru and top premier cru.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lal Krishna Advani, a senior leader
of India&#8217;s main opposition party, has withdrawn his resignation
from key positions healing a rift that threatened to damage the
party&#8217;s fortunes ahead of next year&#8217;s elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advani changed his mind after leaders of the Bharatiya
Janata Party told him that his concerns about its functioning
would be addressed, the party&#8217;s president Rajnath Singh said at
press conference today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advani offered to resign yesterday, a day after Narendra Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat, was appointed to lead the
party&#8217;s election campaign. While not directly mentioning Modi&#8217;s
appointment as the trigger for stepping down, Advani said he no
longer agreed with the direction of the party, which he said had
become a vehicle for personal agendas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advani was home minister and deputy prime minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee&#8217;s government. Ahead of the 2009 elections, the
BJP projected Advani as its pick for premier. When questioned
about his political ambitions in recent months, Advani refused
to rule himself out as a contender for the country&#8217;s top
government office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. oil company, said it plans to sell its interest in two
Nigerian shallow-water leases in the oil-rich delta of Africa&#8217;s
top producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale of interest in oil-mining leases 83 and 85 is

&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the third-largest producer in the West African
country, operates a joint venture in which it holds a 40 percent
stake and state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. owns 60
percent. The company holds interests in 10 deepwater oil blocks
in Nigeria, including its 250,000 barrel-a-day Agbami field

&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s PlayStation 4 won the initial skirmish over next-generation video-game consoles by exploiting the weak spots in Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s plan for the Xbox One: price and used-game policies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In dueling press conferences this week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, Sony and Microsoft each made their pitch to the serious gamers whose opinions set the trend in the $37 billion market for console-based video games and hardware. Then customers were able to start reserving the new console of their choice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The result has been a rapid shift in expectations for the two machines, with Sony gaining the upper hand with fans and early sales against Microsoft, the console leader for the past two years. The Xbox One will sell for a premium-priced $499 and limit users&#8217; ability to buy, trade and resell games. Sony, once dominant in the industry, came in $100 cheaper and won&#8217;t limit transactions, and has been rewarded with a boom in orders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sony essentially kicked Microsoft&#8217;s ass,&#8221; said Gabe Bethke, 19, a sophomore at Occidental College in Los Angeles, who watched online and owns an Xbox 360. &#8220;A lot of people who are hardcore gamers are going to be turned off by the Xbox One. It has too many rules and restrictions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, began
cutting U.S. jobs today as part of a global restructuring plan
announced in April, a person familiar with the move said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reduction targets employees with a range of seniority,
from rank-and-file staff to executives, said the person, who
asked not to be named because the information is private. Some
U.S. workers began to receive notifications of the cuts last
night, according to Lee Conrad, a coordinator for Alliance@IBM,
an employee group. The restructuring will cost $1 billion
worldwide, including severance expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM announced the job-cutting effort after releasing
disappointing first-quarter results in April. The Armonk, New
York-based company posted profit of $3 a share in the period,
missing the $3.05 predicted by analysts -- the first earnings
shortfall since 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
IBM said at the time that the job reduction would be
concentrated overseas and mostly complete by the end of June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is probably cutting 6,000 to 8,000 jobs
globally, based on the $1 billion cost figure, said Laurence Balter, an analyst at Oracle Investment Research in Fox Island,
Washington. That would represent less than 2 percent of IBM&#8217;s
total workforce of 434,246 as of Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)
and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. will pay $2.15 billion to
Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and a partner to settle litigation over unauthorized
sales of the heartburn drug Protonix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, will receive
64 percent of the settlement while partner Takeda Pharmaceutical
Co. will get the rest, New York-based Pfizer said in a statement
today. Teva will pay $1.6 billion, including $800 million this
year and the rest in 2014, according to a company statement. Sun
said it will pay $550 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased with today&#8217;s settlement, which recognizes
the validity and value of the innovation that led to Protonix,&#8221;
Amy Schulman, Pfizer&#8217;s general counsel, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva and Sun (SUNP) began selling generic versions in 2008 only to
lose a challenge to a patent on the medicine two years later.
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit was seeking $2.7 billion from Teva and Sun,
saying it was entitled to a share of the revenue from those
generic versions, as well as compensation for sales it lost to
the copycat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trial over Pfizer&#8217;s claims began June 3 in federal court
in Newark, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to put this matter behind us as we
continue to focus on delivering safe and affordable medicines to
patients around the world,&#8221; Richard Egosi, Teva&#8217;s chief legal

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s asset-management unit hired Prashant Sharma as head of international
fixed-income investments for insurance clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharma will be based in London and report to Nick Gartside,
international chief investment officer of fixed-income, New
York-based JPMorgan said today in an e-mailed statement. Sharma
previously worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s asset-management
business and has a decade of experience working as a fixed-income portfolio manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset managers including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock Inc.

mandates from insurance companies as low interest rates pressure
income from bond portfolios. JPMorgan, which oversees about $50
billion for the industry, recently made additions in Hong Kong
and Tokyo for the insurance solutions business and last year
named Douglas Niemann, who previously worked at American
International Group Inc., to lead strategy and analytics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fixed-income investing is extremely important to insurance
clients, particularly in the current low interest-rate
environment,&#8221;&#160;Gartside said in the statement.&#160;&#8220;However, their
investment needs as a client group are unique, and as our

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., the
petrochemical venture of U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp. (CVX) and
refiner Phillips 66 (PSX), is exploring ways to expand in the Middle
East, including building a new plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. partnership would consider setting up a site on
its own or in a joint venture, and the &#8220;entire&#8221; region is
under consideration, Benny Mermans, head of Europe and Africa at
Chevron Phillips Chemical&#8217;s international operations, said in an
interview at a petrochemical conference in Frankfurt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical company&#8217;s owners are &#8220;very supportive&#8221; of
growth plans, Mermans said. Woodlands, Texas-based Chevron
Phillips, also known as CPChem, is already spending about $5
billion on a new ethylene plant, or cracker, and two factories
making polyethylene in Baytown, Texas, to take advantage of
cheap natural gas, which is used as a raw material as well as an
energy source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Look at our ownership structure,&#8221; Mermans said. &#8220;We
represent a fair share of their net income. By having that
support, by creating margins, that provides us with a lot of
legroom&#8221; for gaining resources for growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips has three joint ventures in the Saudi
Arabian industrial city of Jubail as well as partnerships in
Qatar in Messaieed and Ras Laffan, Melanie Samuelson, a
spokeswoman at the U.S. company, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Funding Sources &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expansion would be financed by the chemical business
itself, and Chevron Phillips would tap capital markets for
further cash should the need arise, Mermans said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Availability of cheaper shale gas in the U.S., extracted by
the hydraulic fracturing process known as fracking, means that
Europe is being &#8220;squeezed on all sides,&#8221; Mermans said. The
company will focus on more specialty chemicals in the region and
is expanding a plant in Tessenderlo, Belgium, to add sulfur-based organic products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., Chevron Phillips is the first company in more
than a decade to build an ethylene plant, Mermans said. The
cracker, which will produce 1.5 million metric tons of the
gaseous chemical a year, is on schedule to start operations in
2017, with the company&#8217;s board expected to give final approval
in the third quarter, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical Co. (DOW), the largest U.S. chemical maker by sales,
and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the biggest U.S. oil company, have said
they plan similar-sized ethylene plants in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a race,&#8221; Mermans said. &#8220;CPChem is well placed to
be first.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s missteps
advising speech-recognition pioneer Dragon Systems Inc. in a
merger weren&#8217;t egregious enough for the bank to be found in
violation of a Massachusetts law, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Patti B. Saris in Boston, citing a jury
verdict in January that rejected a $580 million negligence suit
filed by Dragon founders Jim and Janet Baker and two other
shareholders, denied the plaintiffs&#8217; request for claims against
Goldman Sachs under the state&#8217;s Unfair Trade Practices statute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge called the investment banking team assigned to
the all-stock sale of Dragon to a Belgium competitor in 2000
&#8220;professionally negligent&#8221; because it didn&#8217;t fully vet buyer
Lernout  Hauspie Speech Products NV, which collapsed in an
accounting fraud rendering the deal worthless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The reasons why small startup companies like Dragon go to
a place like Goldman to assist with hatching their golden eggs
is because they don&#8217;t have their own expertise to analyze
revenue projects by asking tough questions to potential merger
partners,&#8221; the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Still, I give weight to the fact that the jury found for
the defendant on this claim and there was sufficient evidence to
support that finding even if I conclude otherwise,&#8221; Saris said
in yesterday&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bakers&#8217; attorney, Alan Cotler of Reed Smith LLP, said
yesterday in an e-mail that his firm was still studying the
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said yesterday in a statement it was pleased
the judge respected the jury&#8217;s unanimous verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jury&#8217;s Conclusion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The evidence showed, and the jury concluded, that the
banking team satisfactorily performed its role for Dragon
Systems in all respects,&#8221; the New York-based bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bakers, who started Dragon in 1982 in their Newton,
Massachusetts, home, along with shareholders Robert Roth and
Paul Bamberg, lost about $300 million along with the
intellectual property, the judge found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs may have been brilliant mathematicians and
scientists, but they had no financial experience with mergers
and acquisitions,&#8221; Saris said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman team was lead by Richard Wayner, then 31, and
included two bankers in their 20s, and a technology strategist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge found Wayner should have spoken up at a key
Dragon board meeting and told members that Goldman Sachs wanted
further review of LH&#8217;s revenue figures in Asia, which were
later revealed as a fraud. Instead, Wayner deferred to Janet
Baker, who was eager to complete the sale and made positive
comments about the pending deal, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Due Diligence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the very least, in my view, the Goldman team should
have disclosed their continuing due diligence concerns,&#8221; Saris
said. &#8220;However, there is no evidence that their failure to do
so was egregious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs argued Goldman Sachs should have told Dragon
that the bank&#8217;s own Principal Investment Area considered an
investment in LH in the late 1990s and decided against risking
the bank&#8217;s money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge found none of the bankers on the Dragon deal knew
about the work known as &#8220;Project Sermon,&#8221; and no one at
Goldman withheld information about why the bank never invested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LH created bogus customers, booked circular transactions
with shell companies and recorded loans as sales from 1996 to
2000, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
trader Fabrice Tourre&#8217;s request to exclude a scheme liability
claim was opposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
in its lawsuit over collateralized debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This court should deny the defense motion to preclude
evidence or argument concerning Tourre&#8217;s scheme to defraud and
his transactions, practices and courses of business that
operated as a fraud or deceit on others,&#8221; the SEC said in a
filing today in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre said in a May 30 motion that the SEC for three years
has accused him of making misleading statements and omissions,
not of participating in a scheme to defraud investors. The SEC
only sought to press a scheme liability claim in court filings
two months ago, Tourre said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This abrupt pivot to scheme liability is undoubtedly
driven by the SEC&#8217;s well-founded concern that certain evidence
it would like to introduce against Mr. Tourre is inadmissible
under the misstatements theory that has been the basis of the
SEC&#8217;s case for over three years,&#8221; according to Tourre&#8217;s May 30
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC initially sued the London-based trader in April
2010, saying he defrauded investors by not disclosing that hedge
fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities for a
collateralized debt obligation called Abacus 2007-AC1 with the
intention of betting against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reaching a $550 million settlement with New York-based Goldman Sachs, the SEC filed a new claim against Tourre,
saying he gave the company &#8220;substantial assistance&#8221; as it
misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is scheduled for trial July 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Coffey, Tourre&#8217;s lawyer, said he hadn&#8217;t seen the SEC&#8217;s
filing yet and couldn&#8217;t comment on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-03229, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline and diesel in Los
Angeles advanced against futures as Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s El Segundo
plant was said to be planning repairs on two crude units and
five tankers were scheduled to load fuel in the West for export. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s 279,000-barrel-a-day El Segundo refinery, the
largest in California, will shut the No. 4 crude unit next month
for short-term repairs, a person familiar with the schedule said
today. The No. 2 crude unit will also be brought down in August
for a maintenance turnaround expected to last several weeks,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/), based in London, chartered the Valle Bianca to load
clean products off the West Coast June 16 for delivery to Chile
and chartered the Eagle Express to load fuel on June 24 for
delivery to the South and Central America region, ship-fixture
data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hague-based Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) has scheduled the
Marlin Topaz to take fuel off the coast on June 22 to Chile. The
Atlantic Titan and the Nave Bellatrix were also chartered to
load products in the West this week for delivery to Chile, the
data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
advanced 4.5 cents against futures gasoline futures traded on
the New York Mercantile Exchange to a premium of 29.5 cents a
gallon at 4:21 p.m. New York time, the fuel&#8217;s highest level for
this season in five years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Prompt-delivery surged 9.62 cents to $3.1563 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for Los Angeles Carbob versus the same fuel in
San Francisco widened 4.5 cents to 8.5 cents a gallon, the most
in more than five weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diesel Spreads &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles jumped 1
cent against ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures to a premium of 3.5
cents a gallon, the highest in four days. CARB diesel in San
Francisco climbed 0.5 cent to 5.5 cents a gallon above futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular gasoline at pumps in California slipped 0.2 cent to
$3.632 a gallon, according to Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the
nation&#8217;s largest motoring organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot, conventional gasoline in Portland, Oregon,
strengthened 0.75 cent against futures to a premium of 8.75
cents a gallon. Low-sulfur diesel there jumped 5.5 cents against
ULSD futures to a premium of 0.5 cent a gallon, the highest
level in more than two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland gasoline&#8217;s discount to Los Angeles Carbob widened
3.75 cents to 20.75 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles gained 21 cents to
$26.28 a barrel. The spread, a rough measure of refining
profits, reached a three-month high earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, has fired
at least 1,300 workers in a round of U.S. job cuts that began
yesterday, according to the employee group Alliance@IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job reduction includes at least 222 people in marketing
for the software business and 165 in semiconductor research and
development, according to Lee Conrad, a coordinator for
Alliance@IBM, which is affiliated with the Communications
Workers of America union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is part of a global restructuring plan that IBM
announced in April after releasing disappointing first-quarter
results. The cuts target employees with a range of seniority,
from executives to rank-and-file workers, said a person familiar
with the effort, who asked not to be identified because the
information is private. The restructuring will cost $1 billion
worldwide, including severance expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Just about every division at every location is being
impacted,&#8221; Conrad said, including IBM hubs near Raleigh, North
Carolina; Burlington, Vermont; Austin, Texas; and New York&#8217;s
Hudson Valley. &#8220;Everything&#8217;s getting hit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York-based company posted profit of $3 a
share last quarter, missing the $3.05 predicted by analysts --
the first earnings shortfall since 2005, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB) is
buying the riskiest slice of a commercial-mortgage bond
transaction for the first time as sales soar of debt tied to
skyscrapers, hotels and shopping centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment manager is teaming with Raith Capital
Partners, a New York-based real estate debt firm, in purchasing
the B-piece, designated as the first to take any losses, in an
upcoming deal from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said two people
familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be identified
because it hasn&#8217;t been announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lured by higher returns with the Federal Reserve (FDTR) holding
benchmark interest rates at about zero percent since 2008,
AllianceBernstein is joining hedge funds Saba Capital Management
LP, Ellington Management Group LLC and Perella Weinberg Partners
LP in making debut B-piece purchases this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in those portions traditionally included real
estate specialists such as Rialto Investments and Eightfold Real
Estate Capital, which last year purchased 16 of the 27 B-pieces
issued, according to data from Deutsche Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from AllianceBernstein, Raith and Perella
didn&#8217;t immediately return telephone calls seeking comment and
spokesmen at Goldman Sachs, Saba and Ellington declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of commercial mortgage-backed securities are poised
to climb by more than 50 percent to $70 billion in 2013,
according to Credit Suisse Group AG. Banks have arranged about
$36.6 billion this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO), the U.S. oil
producer that has been expanding exploration from Ethiopia to
Texas, picked as its next chief executive officer the Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) engineer who helped oversee the global portfolio of
the world&#8217;s largest energy company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee M. Tillman, 51, formerly Exxon&#8217;s vice president of
engineering, will succeed Clarence Cazalot as Marathon&#8217;s CEO and
president on Aug. 1, the Houston-based company said in a
statement today. Cazalot, who has been CEO of the company since
it was formed in 2002, is ending a 41-year career in the energy
industry with his Dec. 31 retirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillman will need to adjust to operating at a smaller
company with fewer resources than Exxon, Fadel Gheit, a New
York-based analyst at Oppenheimer  Co., said in a telephone
interview today. His appointment was a surprise because Tillman
doesn&#8217;t come from a company with Marathon&#8217;s narrow focus on
exploration and production, Gheit said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If he can adapt very quickly, I&#8217;m sure he will be a
tremendous success,&#8221; Gheit said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not forget that this
guy has an incredible background and is obviously very
qualified.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillman joined Exxon in 1989 after studying chemical
engineering at Texas AM University and Auburn University. His
international assignments included postings in Scotland,
Indonesia and Equatorial Guinea. The Texas native said in a 2012
interview with Dice Holdings Inc.&#8217;s Rigzone website that he had
a &#8220;passion for cars&#8221; and that if he hadn&#8217;t become an engineer
he would have been a Formula 1 race car driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cazalot&#8217;s Legacy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Warren, a Marathon spokeswoman, said neither Cazalot
nor Tillman were available for interviews today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marathon rose 2.9 percent to $34.37 at the close in New
York and was the best-performing oil producer in the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Energy Index. The stock has increased 12 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cazalot, 62, led Marathon through its split from what
became U.S. Steel Corp. (X) in 2002 and the consolidation of the
company&#8217;s fuel-making business through the acquisition of
Ashland Inc. (ASH)&#8217;s stake in a joint venture three years later. In
2011, Cazalot reversed course and shed the refining unit after
saying the effort to mimic the so-called integrated model of
larger oil producers such as Exxon had failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Cazalot&#8217;s tenure, Marathon achieved average annual
gains of 29 percent, outperforming Exxon&#8217;s 17 percent increases
and Chevron Corp.&#8217;s 16 percent advances, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marathon&#8217;s lead director, Dennis H. Reilley, will become
chairman of the board upon Cazalot&#8217;s departure, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. named Manuel Esteve head of equity syndicate for Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esteve succeeds Greg Chamberlain, who will become head of
the U.K. equity capital markets team, according to the memo,
which was confirmed by a spokeswoman for the New York-based
bank. Jonathan Wilcox, who has run U.K. equity capital markets,
will move to U.K. investment banking to focus on corporate
clients as a coverage banker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esteve previously ran the Iberia and Greece ECM team.
Francesco Cardinali will add Iberia and Greece to his current
responsibilities as head of Italy and Turkey equity capital
markets, the memo shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan ranked No. 6 in managing share sales in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The U.S. bank was the sole manager of Volkswagen
AG (VOW)&#8217;s 1.2 billion-euro ($1.6 billion) convertible sale earlier

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s touted two new drugs
aren&#8217;t selling as fast as the company anticipated, a top
executive said today, though the drugmaker expects the pills
should still become blockbusters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliquis, a blood thinner, and Xeljanz, a rheumatoid
arthritis medicine, were approved late last year and projected
to be the backbone of new sales growth at the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker. The pills are competing against well-entrenched
products, though, and Pfizer hasn&#8217;t been able to gain as much of
the market in the first months of sales as it had hoped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trajectory isn&#8217;t what we would have liked it to have
been,&#8221; Geno Germano, who heads New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s
specialty drugs and oncology businesses, said of Xeljanz. With
Eliquis, he said, two competing pills have made early sales
harder. &#8220;I think some of the low-hanging fruit has been taken
by the entries that came before Eliquis,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is counting on the new drugs and cancer treatments
and vaccines in development, to return the company to sales
growth after losing top product Lipitor to generic competition
in November 2011. Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has shed non-drug units to focus on developing new brand-name therapies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliquis may generate $613 million in annual sales for
Pfizer by 2016, according to the average of three analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Xeljanz may have $1.6 billion
in sales by then, according to the analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 1.5 percent to $28.85 at 1:07 p.m. New York
time. The stock gained 28 percent in the 12 months through
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blood Thinner &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliquis is competing to replace warfarin, a generic pill
used to prevent strokes, and with Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH&#8217;s
Pradaxa, and Bayer AG (BAYN) and Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s Xarelto. While
Eliquis is considered to have superior clinical data, its rivals
were approved earlier and have had time to establish themselves
with doctors and patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think some of us are a little bit surprised, given the
strength of the label, the strength of the field force,&#8221; said
Jami Rubin, an analyst with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Germano&#8217;s
comments came today at an investor conference hosted by Goldman.
&#8220;The trajectory of the launch is a little bit below what some
of us had expected,&#8221; Rubin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is splitting promotion and sales of Eliquis with New
York-based Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) A direct-to-consumer ad
campaign should begin soon, Germano said, without giving a
timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think that ultimately, the profile will prevail,&#8221;
Germano said of Eliquis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sluggish Start &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubin said Xeljanz&#8217;s first months of sales also were below
expectations. &#8220;From our perspective, it does look a little bit
lower than I would have thought,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xeljanz is approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis. It
competes directly with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV)&#8217;s Humira, an injection, and
is approved for use after patients fail a first-line therapy,
typically methotrexate. Germano said that about half of the
patients now taking Xeljanz had failed treatment on
methotrexate, and the other half were those who no longer
responded to Humira or related medications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everything I see and hear is positive,&#8221; Germano said.
&#8220;Changing practice just takes a lot of work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some health insurers and drug benefit managers were
limiting access to Xeljanz and forcing patients to try multiple
other therapies before getting access to the new drug, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are issues for all of us. I&#8217;m not going to say we
don&#8217;t have those issues. But we don&#8217;t seem to have a pattern of
reimbursement that&#8217;s different.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Risk
Officer John Hogan is returning to the bank in a new role after
taking almost five months off and may decide to leave the firm
altogether later this year or next, Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon told employees in a memo today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hogan will return to Dimon&#8217;s operating committee and assume
a newly created job as chairman of risk while interim CRO Ashley Bacon takes over in a permanent capacity starting next week,
Dimon said in the memo. Bacon will also join the operating
committee, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;John plans to carry out this important transition for
several months,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;We then hope he will stay at the
firm in another senior role, but he may choose to do something
different outside of our company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of the memo was obtained by Bloomberg News, and its 
contents were confirmed by Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the 
New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said Hogan &#8220;did a superb job as head of risk when we
needed him most&#8221; and that he respects Hogan&#8217;s decision to
return to the bank in a different role. Hogan took leave in
January for personal reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very glad to have John back -- his judgment and
candor make all of us better,&#8221; Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street&#8217;s biggest bond dealers
are telling clients to shift from most fixed-income markets into
U.S. stocks as deepening concern the Federal Reserve will pare
unprecedented stimulus fuels the worst debt losses since 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the most-active underwriter of
corporate bonds since 2007, last week joined Barclays Plc (BARC), Bank
of America Corp. (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. in
recommending stocks over most bonds as equity returns outpace
company notes by the most since at least 1997. The Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate  High Yield Index&#8217;s 0.73
percent loss this year through June 11 compares with a 15.1
percent gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. (SPX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities from Treasuries to junk bonds are showing their
vulnerability to a potential pullback from Fed actions that have
pumped more than $2.5 trillion into the financial system since
2008. Debt &#8220;remains most tied up with the search for yield&#8221;
and faces more volatility than equities as interest rates rise,
JPMorgan strategists led by Jan Loeys said in a June 7 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve now seen a little bit of a rotation out of bond
funds,&#8221; said Hans Mikkelsen, head of U.S. investment-grade
credit strategy at Bank of America in New York. &#8220;You could see
a very quick change in asset allocation on the retail side that
the institutional side can&#8217;t keep up with it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAP AG (SAP) won a U.S. patent office

verdict over a way to customize pricing, in the first challenge
under a new rule for reconsidering business methods patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office said June 11 that the

be canceled because they seek to cover a mental process rather
than an actual invention. In May, an appeals court upheld the
infringement verdict and damage award while the validity of the
patent wasn&#8217;t an issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by the PTO&#8217;s Patent Trial and Appeal Board
could give SAP more ammunition in its petition asking for a
reconsideration of the May decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which specializes in
patent law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With modifications and interest, the jury award has grown
to more than $400 million, Versata lawyers have said. SAP, the
largest maker of business-management software, reported $11.8
billion in gross profit on sales of $16.2 billion last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent office review was the first of its kind under a
new proceeding created by Congress to reconsider issued patents
for finance-related business methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP successfully asked to have the review expedited, so the
decision came six months after the process was instituted, said
Steve Baughman of Ropes  Gray in Washington, who also
represented SAP. The law sets a one-year timeline, while a
typical review under old rules could take years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lawsuit filed in March against the patent office,
Versata said its patent isn&#8217;t for a financial product or service
so shouldn&#8217;t be subject to the new proceeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Versata Software Inc. v. SAP America Inc., 12-1029, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The lower court case is Versata Software Inc. v.
SAP America Inc., 07cv153, U.S. District Court, Eastern District
of Texas (Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pfizer Receives $2.15 Billion From Teva, Sun Over Protonix &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) and Sun Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (SUNP) will pay $2.15 billion to Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and a
partner to settle litigation over unauthorized sales of the
heartburn drug Protonix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, will receive 64
percent of the settlement while partner Takeda Pharmaceutical
Co. will get the rest, New York-based Pfizer said in a statement
yesterday. Teva will pay $1.6 billion, including $800 million
this year and the rest in 2014, according to a company
statement. Sun said it will pay $550 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased with today&#8217;s settlement, which recognizes
the validity and value of the innovation that led to Protonix,&#8221;
Amy Schulman, Pfizer&#8217;s general counsel, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva and Sun began selling generic versions in 2008 only to
lose a challenge to a patent on the medicine two years later.
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit was seeking $2.7 billion from Teva and Sun,
saying it was entitled to a share of the revenue from those
generic versions, as well as compensation for sales it lost to
the copycat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trial over Pfizer&#8217;s claims began June 3 in federal court
in Newark, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to put this matter behind us as we
continue to focus on delivering safe and affordable medicines to
patients around the world,&#8221; Richard Egosi, Teva&#8217;s chief legal
officer, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case marked a rare instance in which a brand-drug
company was seeking compensation for the early release of a copy
of its medicines. Typically, generic-drug makers wait until the
patents expire or they get a court ruling that clears the way.
Teva has undertaken more than a dozen such at-risk market
entries, betting that it would eventually win the case. It
usually did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the trial in Newark, Pfizer attorney William Lee told
jurors that Teva and Sun were unwilling to wait until the patent
expired on Protonix before they began selling their cheaper
copies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They decided to take a risk,&#8221; said Lee in his opening
statement on June 4. By starting generic sales, the market for
branded versions of the drug was &#8220;destroyed,&#8221; he said.     &#8220; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Altana Pharma AG v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA
Inc., 04-cv-02355, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
(Newark). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Barnes  Noble Defeats Alexsam&#8217;s Patent Infringement Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS), the New York-based bookstore chain,
didn&#8217;t infringe a patent related to gift-card processing, a jury
found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company and other retailers were sued in federal court
in Marshall, Texas, in 2010 by Alexsam Inc., a Texas-based
patent holder. Alexsam had sought money damages and court orders
barring further unauthorized use of its technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May a jury rejected Barnes  Noble&#8217;s claims that the
patents were invalid because the technology it covered wasn&#8217;t
new. The trial on Barnes  Noble&#8217;s alleged infringement of
patent 6,189,787 followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a five-day trial, the jury on June 7 said the
bookstore chain didn&#8217;t infringe the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexsam&#8217;s claims against other remaining retailers will be
heard later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Alexsam Inc. v. Barnes  Noble Inc., 2:13-cv-00003-MHS-CMC, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas
(Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FIFA Says Brazil World Cup Soccer Trademark Abuse More Than 2010 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soccer&#8217;s governing body FIFA said it found more cases of
intellectual property infringement related to next year&#8217;s World
Cup in Brazil than it did a year before South Africa hosted
sports&#8217; most-watched event in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auke-Jan Bossenbroek, FIFA&#8217;s legal counsel responsible for
protecting the Zurich-based organization&#8217;s trademarks, said
action has been taken in the past six months against about 100
companies that don&#8217;t have permission to use protected words or
logos related to the World Cup, which kicks off in Rio de
Janeiro June 12, 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIFA and the local organizing committee have sold
sponsorship rights to the monthlong event to 20 companies whose
combined involvement is $1.4 billion through a mixture of direct
cash payments and services. Coca Cola Co. (KO), one of FIFA&#8217;s
longest-tenured sponsors, is providing 5 million beverages for
the tournament and Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) will deliver 1,400 vehicles
to transport officials and teams in 12 host cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIFA has been accused by small-business owners of being
heavy-handed in its protection of rights at its flagship
competition, which is responsible for about 90 percent of its
income. Marketing Director Thierry Weil said FIFA has a
responsibility to partners who have &#8220;invested quite a
significant amount of money to be part of the event.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIFA has registered slogans including Brazil 2014 and Copa
2014 as trademarks, and also the image of its current gold
trophy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the majority of cases have been solved &#8220;by a phone
call,&#8221; Bossenbroek said, there have been instances of large
corporations trying to use the popularity of the World Cup in
marketing material and promotional activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 2010 tournament in South Africa, FIFA filed
charges against organizers of an ambush marketing campaign for a
Dutch beer brand during a match between the Netherlands and
Denmark. FIFA&#8217;s reaction to the incident, which featured about
30 women wearing identical orange dresses, meant that Lieshout,
Netherlands-based Bavaria, the company behind the stunt, got
publicity for several days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the cases in Brazil have been the result of local
businesses not understanding the rules related to using World
Cup logos, Bossenbroek said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;University of Kansas Claums &#8216;KUBoobs&#8217; Infringes Trademarks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Kansas told the operator of an account
with Twitter Inc.&#8217;s short-messaging service that products it
promotes and its domain name infringe the school&#8217;s trademarks,
the Topeka Capital-Journal reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school was objecting to the use of its &#8220;KU&#8221; trademark
with the @KUBoobs Twitter account, the www.kuboobs.com domain
name, and the sale of &#8220;I heart KU Boobs&#8221; wristbands, according
to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Twitter account solicited photographs of women&#8217;s chests
with something with a KU logo, saying these photos were a good
luck ritual, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school said the KUBoobs activities could potentially
create unfair competition, and cause the public to believe,
mistakenly, that some affiliation existed between the entities,
according to the Capital-Journal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chinese National Gets 12 Years in Prison for Pirated Software &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Chinese national was ordered to serve 12 years in a U.S.
prison for selling more than $100 million worth of software
pirated from American companies, including Agilent Technologies
Inc. (A), from his home in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xiang Li, 36, was sentenced June 11 in federal court in
Wilmington, Delaware, after pleading guilty to copyright and
wire fraud conspiracy charges in connection with software sales
from his China-based website, prosecutors said in a release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li and his wife, of Chengdu, China, were accused of running
a website called &#8220;Crack 99&#8221; that sold copies of software for
which &#8220;access-control mechanisms&#8221; had been circumvented, the
U.S. said in an unsealed 46-count indictment. The pair was
charged with distributing more than 500 copyrighted works to
more than 300 buyers in the U.S. and overseas from April 2008 to
June 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li is the first Chinese citizen to be &#8220;apprehended and
prosecuted in the U.S. for cybercrimes he engaged in entirely
from China,&#8221; prosecutors said in court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was hard for me to accept that Mr. Li deserved&#8221; a 12-year sentence for his actions, Mingli Chen, Li&#8217;s lawyer, said in
a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court filings, Li was arrested by federal
agents in June 2011 in Saipan, an island about 120 miles (193
kilometers) northeast of Guam in the western Pacific Ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li agreed to travel there from his home in southwest China
to deliver pirated software and 20 gigabytes of proprietary data
from a U.S. software company to undercover agents posing as
businessmen, according court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pirated software included programs made by Santa Clara,
California-based Agilent and Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based
Ansys (ANSS) Inc., prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark in
to sentence Li to more than 17 years in prison over the illegal
software sales. Li will be deported to China once he serves his
prison term, the government said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Li, 10-cr-112, U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;N.J. Tech Council Head Says Don&#8217;t Halt Immigration Reforms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrest June 5 of a foreign-born worker in a trade
secrets case involving Becton Dickinson  Co. (BDX) medical technology
is no reason to derail immigration reform, the head of New
Jersey&#8217;s technology business trade group said, NJBiz reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maxine Ballen, president and chief executive officer of the
New Jersey Technology Council said such incidents are too rare
to derail industry&#8217;s need for foreign talent and the easing of
restrictions on visas for skilled workers, according to NJ Biz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told NJBiz that companies can&#8217;t afford to do without
skilled workers from abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballen said that while she was &#8220;appalled&#8221; at the recent
arrest of an ex-BD employee, it is still important to increase
rather than constrict the immigration pool, according to NJBiz. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Union antitrust regulators
invited comments on Visa Europe Ltd.&#8217;s offer to cut
&#8220;significantly&#8221; the fees it sets for processing cross-border
credit-card payments in a bid to end an EU antitrust probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe&#8217;s offer from last month would bring its fees
into line with those of its main competitor MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
European Commission said in an e-mailed statement today. The
operator of the EU&#8217;s largest payment-card network has also
offered to overhaul its rules so that banks will be able to
apply a reduced interbank fee when they compete for clients
across borders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the proposals address the commission&#8217;s competition
concerns, the commission may decide to make them legally binding
on Visa Europe&#8221; in exchange for ending the probe, the regulator
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission sent a formal complaint to Visa about the
interchange fees last year, as part of a broader campaign it has
waged against such charges. MasterCard has started a legal
challenge against a settlement it reached with the commission in
2009 to avoid a daily penalty of as much as 3.5 percent of
sales. The EU is also probing MasterCard&#8217;s bank fees on foreign
card payments such as when tourists go shopping in the 27-nation
bloc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU regulator also announced today that it has closed a
probe into the European Payments Council, an association of
banks that seeks to standardize payments practices, after the
body stopped its work on e-payment rules at the center of the
probe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the New
York-based bank planning as much as 300 billion yen ($3.19
billion) in renewable energy investments in Japan, is eyeing
offshore wind power after building up holdings in more
established clean energy sources such as solar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan Renewable Energy Co. was set up by Goldman in August
after Japan began offering above-market rates to producers of
clean energy. The incentives, or feed-in tariffs, have spurred
investments in renewables, setting Japan on course this year to
become one of the world&#8217;s largest solar markets by annual
installations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company sees offshore wind as promising, Shigeru Yasu,
a representative director at Japan Renewable Energy, said in an
interview in Tokyo yesterday. Geothermal and biomass power also
hold potential, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It takes three to four years to do an environmental
impact study for an onshore wind project with more than 10
megawatts of capacity,&#8221; Yasu said. &#8220;Projects with larger
capacity are more attractive because an environmental study
requires the same amount of time even for a 500-megawatt
offshore farm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Five-Year Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan Renewable Energy plans in the next five years to
invest as much as 50 billion yen directly into clean energy
projects with capital provided by GS Infrastructure Partners. It
will take as much as 250 billion yen of loans for project
financing, Takahisa Nakagawa, also a representative director at
Japan Renewable Energy, said in the interview. The investments
and loans will amount to about 1,000 megawatts of clean energy,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wind power is more challenging than solar for a developer
because it requires prior investment such as an environmental
impact study, Nakagawa said, adding that his company has the
advantage of having people with expertise in wind power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s offshore wind market -- 31 megawatts in cumulative
capacity -- lags behind countries like the U.K. and Denmark with
3,093 megawatts and 923 megawatts of capacity, respectively,
according to 2012 data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offshore wind typically requires approval from local
fishermen before projects can move ahead and costs more for
installation and maintenance than onshore wind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan Renewable Energy is considering more than 300
megawatts worth of solar projects, Nakagawa said. The company
will use panels by LS Industrial Systems Co. (010120), a South Korean
electric and industrial equipment maker, at least for its first
four plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Panel Supplier &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSIS was picked because it offers quality products for less
compared with Japanese makers and because panels aren&#8217;t the only
product the company produces, the officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are big pureplay solar panel companies that went
bankrupt and that&#8217;s worrisome,&#8221; Yasu said. &#8220;Even though a
company offers 20 years of warranty, it&#8217;s no good if the company
won&#8217;t be around 20 years later.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is set to overtake Germany as the world&#8217;s largest
solar market, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers may install 6.9 gigawatts to 9.4 gigawatts of
solar in Japan in 2013, the London-based research agency said.
Germany led solar installations in 2012 with 7.6 gigawatts of
capacity. Cumulative global solar energy installations reached
102 gigawatts for the first time in 2012, according to
preliminary BNEF data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP),
India&#8217;s biggest drugmaker by market value, fell the most in two
weeks in Mumbai after agreeing to pay more than five times what
it had provisioned to settle patent litigation with Pfizer Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun shares declined 2.7 percent to 954 rupees as of 9:56
a.m. local time, headed for the biggest loss since May 31, while
the benchmark SP BSE Sensex Index dropped 0.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) will pay $2.15
billion to Pfizer and a partner to settle litigation over
unauthorized sales of the heartburn drug Protonix, Pfizer said
in a statement yesterday. Sun will pay $550 million as
settlement, the Mumbai-based company said, compared with the
5.84 billion rupees ($100 million) it had set aside for the
potential damages in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cash which will go out is going to come from Sun
Pharma&#8217;s books, so to an extent, it&#8217;s going to hold up their&#8221;
expansion plans, said Hitesh Mahida, an analyst at Fortune
Equity Brokers (India) Ltd. in Mumbai. &#8220;They usually get a
premium for their higher margins and high amount of cash.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun and its group companies had 53.6 billion rupees of cash
and short-term investments at the end of March, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian drugmaker will continue to sell in the U.S.
pantoprazole, the drug ingredient in Protonix, Sun said.
Pfizer&#8217;s patent ended in January 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer Ltd. (PFIZ), the Indian unit of New York-based
Pfizer, (PFE) rose 1.8 percent in Mumbai trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Corp. (WLT), a U.S. miner of
coal used in steelmaking, canceled a plan to refinance $1.55
billion of loans as yields on bonds from the riskiest to the
most creditworthy borrowers in the U.S. reached a 10-month high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter had explored options including a new secured term
loan facility, a new revolving credit facility and unsecured
debt financing, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said in a
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it has no material debt principal payments
due until 2015 and doesn&#8217;t need incremental funding right now.
The shares earlier dropped as much as 20 percent to $11.76 in
New York, the biggest intraday decline since August 2011, before
being halted after Forbes reported the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter joins Odebrecht SA, the Brazilian construction and
engineering firm, and U.S. candle producer Yankee Candle Co. in
terminating or delaying bond sales this week because of market
conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on bonds from the riskiest to the most creditworthy
borrowers in the U.S. reached 3.91 percent yesterday, the
highest since August, and up from a record-low 3.35 percent on
May 2, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S.
Corporate  High Yield index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical coal prices have dropped as miners haven&#8217;t
cut output quickly enough to match falling demand. Prices no
longer cover cash production costs, even for mining companies
considered to be low-cost producers, Mitesh Thakkar, an analyst
at FBR  Co. (FBRC) In Arlington, Virginia, wrote in a note yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Challenging&#8217; Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While met markets have been challenging for marginal
assets, we now believe that spot met prices have fallen to a
level where they no longer cover full cash costs (including
attributable corporate expenses) even for some of the low-cost
producers,&#8221; Thakkar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter investors rejected five nominees to its board
proposed by activist shareholder Audley Capital Advisors LLP on
April 25. Audley had called on the mining company to reduce debt
and corporate expenses to boost profit. It was the second
attempt by London-based Audley&#8217;s co-founder and Managing Partner
Julian Treger to compel change at Walter, which has posted two
consecutive quarterly losses and seen its shares drop 65 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corn fell, capping the biggest
weekly slump since April, on signs of easing global demand as
farmers complete planting of a projected record crop in the
U.S., the world&#8217;s top exporter. Wheat and soybeans declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export sales of corn in the week ended June 6 slid to
149,460 metric tons, the lowest since January, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Farmers may harvest
14.005 billion bushels, 30 percent more than a year earlier,
boosting global production by 12 percent to a record, the agency
said on June 12. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its price forecast
yesterday, citing the U.S. recovery from last year&#8217;s drought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Global supplies are on the rise, and that has reduced
demand for U.S. corn,&#8221; Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness
for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;The weather forecasts for warm
temperatures and regular rains should improve U.S. crop
potential. We are shifting to a more plentiful supply outlook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn futures for delivery in December fell 0.4 percent to
close at $5.33 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. This week, the price dropped 4.6 percent, the most since
the five days ended April 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman cut its price forecasts for corn to $4.75 and $11 a
bushel for soybeans in three, six and 12 months. The previous
estimates for the latter two periods were $5.25 for the grain
and $12.50 for the oilseed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soybean futures for delivery in November slipped 0.2
percent to $12.9825. This week, the price dropped 2.4 percent.
The U.S. harvest will surge 12 percent this year to a record
3.39 billion bushels, according to the USDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn and soybeans for July delivery rose as farmers
withheld remaining supplies from last year&#8217;s harvest that was
reduced by drought, Grow said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For July, corn advanced 1.8 percent to $6.55 and soybeans
gained 0.4 percent to $15.165. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheat futures for July delivery declined 0.7 percent to
$6.8075 a bushel. This week, the price dropped 2.2 percent as
harvesting advances across the U.S., the largest exporter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, plans to break off its private-equity unit as an
independent firm as the business raises a new fund backed by
outside investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Equity Partners will still make direct investments on
behalf of JPMorgan for an &#8220;interim period&#8221; and continue to
manage the bank&#8217;s existing group of portfolio companies, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business eventually will be split off as those
investments mature, according to a person with direct knowledge
of the plan. One Equity manages about $4.5 billion for the bank,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The One Equity team has produced strong returns over the
years,&#8221; Matt Zames, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief operating officer, said in
the statement. &#8220;The time is right for them to seek new capital
to strengthen their global strategy, as they continue to manage
our existing portfolio to maximize value to the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are expanding businesses overseeing client money as
they seek more stable forms of revenue, such as management fees.
JPMorgan&#8217;s private-equity results have been uneven in recent
quarters, swinging from a $50 million profit in the fourth
quarter to a $182 million loss in the first three months of this
year, according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volatile Earnings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings within the unit will likely be volatile and
&#8220;influenced by capital-markets activity, market levels, the
performance of the broader economy and investment-specific
issues,&#8221; the company said in a May 8 filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Equity typically invests from $50 million to $250
million per transaction, the firm said, concentrating in North
America, Europe, Asia and South America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federally backed banks face restrictions in how much they
can invest in private-equity and hedge funds under the so-called
Volcker rule, a provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. The rule
limits investments to no more than 3 percent of the fund or 3
percent of the lender&#8217;s Tier 1 capital. JPMorgan had about $7.7
billion in total private-equity holdings and $163.8 billion in
Tier 1 capital as of March 31, according to regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guggenheim Partners LLC, the debt
manager with more than $180 billion in assets, hired Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s co-head of U.S. leveraged finance capital
markets Tom Stein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stein, who will start in September, will report to Michael
Damaso and Anthony Minella co-heads of corporate credit,
according to Thomas Mulligan, a spokesman for Guggenheim at
Sitrick and Co. Stein will will focus on the firm&#8217;s capital
market business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Stein
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stein, who co-headed the leveraged finance unit at Goldman
Sachs with Kevin Sterling and David Lischer, joined the firm in
2005 from Wachovia Corp. Stein previously served on the board of
directors of the New York-based trade group, the Loan
Syndications and Trading Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been $531.6 billion of leveraged loans arranged
in the U.S. this year, an increase from $285 billion during the
same time period in 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are rated below BBB-by
Standard  Poor&#8217;s and less than Baa3 at Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside potential for
agriculture prices is the biggest trading opportunity across
commodity markets for analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as
production recovers, according a report from the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank recommends initiating a short position for new-crop corn and soybeans, analysts Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report dated yesterday. Goldman lowered its
forecast to $4.75 a bushel for corn and to $11 a bushel for
soybeans in three, six and 12 months. That compares with a
previous prediction of $5.25 and $12.50 for six and 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn, soybean and wheat futures that surged as drought cut
output in 2012 have tumbled into bear markets this year on
expectations harvests will rebound. Record U.S. corn output will
more than double inventories before the harvest in 2014, and
soybean production will be an all-time high, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said June 12. Corn futures are the second worst-performing commodity on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI gauge of 24
raw materials this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While U.S. corn and soybean production levels remain
uncertain, we still expect that production will recover relative
to last year&#8217;s level under most weather outcomes,&#8221; the report
said. &#8220;It will require a significant weather shock to limit the
rebuild in corn and soybean inventories given the record large
realized South American harvests and current weak global
consumption.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank recommended a basket short two December 2013 corn
contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade and short one November
2013 soybean contract as it sees a lower soybean to corn price
ratio under most weather outcomes, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we may be too early in entering this trade, we
prefer that to being late given our belief that current prices
embed a large weather premium and that prices could decline in
the next six weeks,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Smith was so taken by the mix of white sand, blue waters and modern offices when her cruise ship called at the Cayman Islands that the New Jersey accountant found a job and moved to what she calls paradise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We still have regulatory deadlines and long hours, but if I need a break, our office is right across from the beach,&#8221; said Smith, 29, who has worked the past three years at financial services company BDO Cayman Islands, and has no plans to leave. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine going anywhere else.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet foreign workers face that prospect and new arrivals could find it tougher to make the island their home as restrictions tighten. With unemployment among local citizens exceeding 10 percent, the offshore financial center is reining in the number of staff that funds, accounting firms, construction companies and hotels hire from abroad. Limits on expatriates, who make up half the island&#8217;s 39,000 workforce, will ensure more jobs for Caymanians, said Eric Bush, the nation&#8217;s chief immigration officer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll always need a certain level of foreign labor, but it&#8217;s about finding that right balance,&#8221; Bush said in a phone interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re a small nation that cannot have an influx of individuals who may turn out to be a burden.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 2,000 foreigners face expulsion in October when their work visas expire. Premier Alden McLaughlin, who took office last month, has made it &#8220;quite clear&#8221; to his immigration department that he wants to find a way to keep them while still reducing unemployment for Caymanians, Bush said. The island also wants to remain hospitable to its offshore finance industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Seeking Balance &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In seeking a balance, McLaughlin&#8217;s ruling party has vowed to require foreigners work on the island for 10 years before they can apply for citizenship, up from seven now. The government also plans to scrap a provision that enables companies to pick &#8220;key&#8221; workers who could extend their stay for two-year increments indefinitely, which is &#8220;effectively controlled by employers and unfair to employees&#8221; and prevents Caymanians from getting the same jobs, according to a report on term limits completed for the government last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Calls by Caymanians and politicians to tighten immigration rules have risen as unemployment among Cayman citizens rose to 10.5 percent last year from 9.7 percent in 2011. In contrast, 2.4 percent of expatriates were out of work compared with 3.1 percent in the same time periods, labor statistics show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of the job losses have been in construction and hotel services, yet those have &#8220;exacerbated&#8221; tensions with locals in financial companies that rely on foreign workers, said Chris Duggan, president of the Cayman Islands Chamber of Commerce. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Financial Industry &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies are training more locals for financial industry jobs, he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a wave of well-educated Caymanians come through the ranks of finance one day,&#8221; Duggan said. &#8220;For now, we don&#8217;t have enough to fill these positions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A British Overseas Territory located about 270 miles south of Cuba, the Cayman Islands has registered at least 10,900 funds, more than any other Caribbean island. Financial services account for 8.9 percent of jobs, according to its statistics agency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service affirmed Cayman Islands bonds at Aa3 in February, the same as Bermuda and China, citing incomes of $53,253 per capita that help buffer the population against natural disasters. Even so, tourism and finance contribute more than 70 percent of gross domestic product, &#8220;a sign of limited diversification&#8221; that leaves the country vulnerable during a downturn, Moody&#8217;s said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While there are steady openings for fund managers and legal jobs, companies are under pressure by the government to hire locally and face costly fees to bring in foreign workers, said Gillian McMahon, a job recruiter with the Grand Cayman-based employment agency Baraud. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hire Caymanians &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a want to fill positions with someone from Cayman whenever possible,&#8221; McMahon said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a consideration with every hire if it&#8217;s going to be Caymanian or foreign.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A two-year work permit for a foreign auditor can cost $16,500 and large firms may pay more than $21,000 for a visa for financial controllers, according to McMahon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The situation facing the 2,000 foreigners whose visas are scheduled to expire in October arises from immigration changes in 2004 when the government adopted a seven-year term limit instead of the indefinite policy that had existed. Foreigners would have to leave for at least a year, though companies could apply to have &#8220;key employees&#8221; exempted. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Limit Eligibility &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The law is meeting its purpose of limiting the number of people eligible to become permanent residents or apply for citizenship, which is possible in the eighth year of residency, the report found. As the seven-year limit, known locally as the &#8220;rollover,&#8221; approached in 2011, the government allowed terms to be extended for up to two years while a review committee completed its report and to allow changes in the laws to be adopted. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rollover will destroy my life as I have given 14 years to this island,&#8221; said one unnamed survey respondent in comments included in the study. &#8220;Have made this my home and now you want to kick me out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the Cayman Islands tightens conditions for expatriates, Bermuda has loosened them, ending a limit on how long foreigners can work there as it seeks to lure funds and reinsurance companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abolishing limits &#8220;will help spark economic growth and create employment opportunities for Bermudians,&#8221; Home Affairs Minister Michael Fahy said in a Jan. 30 statement after the rule was changed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bermuda Unemployment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 10 percent of Bermudians were unemployed last year compared with 2 percent of foreigners, with financial services and &#8220;international business activity&#8221; accounting for the largest number of jobs, according to a 2012 labor survey by island nation&#8217;s government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cayman&#8217;s restrictions on foreign workers have made it harder to recruit employees and caused office tensions between islanders and expatriates, according a survey of about 100 business owners that was commissioned as part of last year&#8217;s report for the government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In responses of 384 Caymanians in that same survey, 58 percent said they wanted &#8220;keep or modify&#8221; foreign work restrictions, with one saying that it was &#8220;unfair&#8221; that foreigners held jobs when &#8220;Caymanians needed a chance at moving up the corporate ladder.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 2,600 expatriates worked as fund administrators and accountants in the Caymans as of December, 2011, the most after service jobs such as bartenders and beach attendants, the report found. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Have Roots &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a worry that people will have to leave,&#8221; said Joanna Boxall, who runs a website for expatriates working on the island, caymannewresident.com. &#8220;Accountants and lawyers have bought houses, they have roots here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Law firms are booming, banks are doing well, and they still need experts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As long as she has an accounting job at BDO, Smith said it&#8217;s &#8220;only a matter of time&#8221; before she and her husband probably buy a home on the Caymans and settle in. He moved with her from Jackson, New Jersey, and also has a job in accounting. Both have renewed their initial two-year visas and hope to stay as long as possible, at least for the seven years currently allowed and longer if allowed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would feel like leaving family if we were to uproot ourselves and leave the island,&#8221; Smith said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Eric Sabo in Panama City at esabo1@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Andre Soliani at asoliani@bloomberg.net; Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John C. Bogle, the founder of
Vanguard Group Inc. who popularized index-based investing, said
proposed rules for money-market mutual funds don&#8217;t go far enough
to protect investors and the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s June 5
proposal to make only the riskiest money funds, known as prime
funds, adopt a floating share price is a &#8220;compromise&#8221; forced
by the fund industry&#8217;s resistance to reform, Bogle said
yesterday in remarks at the Morningstar Investment Conference in
Chicago. Regulators should force all money funds to float their
share price, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact is money-market fund net-asset values fluctuate
and they don&#8217;t want to let the world know,&#8221; Bogle said,
referring to fund-company executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogle, 84, has spent his career advocating for lower costs
and investor-friendly practices in the financial industry,
sometimes putting him at odds with the firm he founded in 1975.
Vanguard was among a group of firms including Fidelity
Investments and Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) that earlier this year
urged regulators to exempt retail-oriented money funds from
regulation and focus only on those prime funds that cater to
institutional clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators have debated how to make money funds safer
since the September 2008 collapse of the $62.5 billion Reserve
Primary Fund. Former SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro championed a
plan in late 2011 and 2012 that envisioned changing the
accounting standard for all money funds, including those that
invest only in government securities or municipal bonds. After
running into opposition from the fund industry, the SEC, now led
by Mary Jo White, approved a set of narrower proposals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU Nations Broker Provisional Deal to Overhaul Markets Rulebook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union nations reached a provisional deal on a
sweeping overhaul of the bloc&#8217;s financial market rulebook that
would toughen oversight of high-frequency trading and push more
transactions onto regulated platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambassadors from the EU&#8217;s 27 nations overcame obstacles to
an accord at meetings June 12 and yesterday in Brussels,
according to EU and national officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft plans, which must also be approved by the
European Parliament to take effect, are set to be detailed and
reviewed over the coming days so a deal can be confirmed
following talks on June 17, according to the two officials, who
can&#8217;t be cited by name, in line with their organizations&#8217;
policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland, whose EU presidency runs out on June 30, urged
countries this month to accept &#8220;difficult compromises&#8221; for the
sake of an accord on the law, which triggered clashes between
the U.K. and Germany over provisions to boost competition in the
market for clearing derivatives trades. Ireland is targeting a
deal on the law next week, according to a spokeswoman for the
presidency, who can&#8217;t be identified under government rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU Authorizes Exchange of Information With U.S. on Audit Probes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audit regulators in the European Union won EU approval to
swap information with their U.S. counterparts in a step that
makes it easier for watchdogs to probe potential malpractice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have internal secrecy
and confidentiality rules that are sufficiently robust to allow
information sharing, the European Commission said in a statement
published in the EU&#8217;s Official Journal yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision means that EU regulators can share documents
seized during raids on audit firms, and also take part in joint
investigations, according to the statement, dated June 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under earlier EU rules, audit regulators could only share
such data with a counterpart based outside the bloc with a
ruling by the commission. The new commission decision is valid
from Aug. 1, 2013, to July 31, 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Singapore Regulator Said to Plan Bank Rebuke on Rate Rigging &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore&#8217;s central bank plans to reprimand banks in the
city-state as early as today following an 11-month review into
how benchmark interest rates are set, five people with knowledge
of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Singapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee, which
includes the Monetary Authority of Singapore and banks, plans to
separately announce changes to the rate-setting process on the
same day, two of the people said June 12, asking not to be
identified before the announcements are made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island nation&#8217;s review into possible manipulation of
the Singapore interbank offered rate follows a global crackdown
on rigging of benchmark borrowing costs by banks and brokers.
Barclays Plc (BARC), UBS AG (UBSN) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc were
fined $2.5 billion to settle claims with U.S. and U.K financial
regulators. A British markets supervisor is considering opening
a probe into potential manipulation in currency markets, another
person briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sibor, used to price debt ranging from commercial term-loans to home mortgages, is calculated on behalf of the
Association of Banks in Singapore, based on submissions by banks
including London-based Standard Chartered Plc (STAN), Singapore&#8217;s DBS
Group Holdings Ltd. and New York-based JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
Edinburgh-based RBS last year withdrew from the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenny Feder, chairman of the SFEMC and group head of
financial markets at London-based Standard Chartered, didn&#8217;t
return three calls to his mobile phone. John Lim, an external
spokesman for the Association of Banks, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monetary authority isn&#8217;t planning to impose criminal
sanctions on the banks or any employees, said two of the people.
MAS will probably require some of the banks to set aside funds
as a deposit with the central bank for a period of time and
strengthen their internal controls, two people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visa Europe&#8217;s Bid to End EU Card-Fee Probe Faces Market Test &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union antitrust regulators invited comments on
Visa Europe Ltd.&#8217;s offer to cut &#8220;significantly&#8221; the fees it
sets for processing cross-border credit-card payments in a bid
to end an EU antitrust probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe&#8217;s offer from last month would bring its fees
into line with those of its main competitor MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
European Commission said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The
operator of the EU&#8217;s largest payment-card network has also
offered to overhaul its rules so that banks will be able to
apply a reduced interbank fee when they compete for clients
across borders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the proposals address the commission&#8217;s competition
concerns, the commission may decide to make them legally binding
on Visa Europe&#8221; in exchange for ending the probe, the regulator
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission sent a formal complaint to Visa about the
interchange fees last year, as part of a broader campaign it has
waged against such charges. MasterCard has started a legal
challenge against a settlement it reached with the commission in
2009 to avoid a daily penalty of as much as 3.5 percent of
sales. The EU is also probing MasterCard&#8217;s bank fees on foreign
card payments such as when tourists go shopping in the 27-nation
bloc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe declined to comment beyond statements made when
the commitments were offered last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Bradford  Bingley Banker May Be Fined in Secret FCA Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Willford, former group finance director at
nationalized lender Bradford  Bingley Plc, may be fined as much
as 100,000 pounds ($157,000) for risk management failures after
losing a court appeal yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority&#8217;s predecessor properly
notified Willford of the fine in 2010, Judge Martin Moore-Bick
said. Willford&#8217;s identity had been secret throughout the three-year-old dispute until the court yesterday overturned
restrictions that limited the press to calling him &#8220;C.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradford  Bingley was rescued by the British government in
2008 after credit markets froze in the wake of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s collapse. Willford didn&#8217;t do enough to warn the
board about its deteriorating financial position, FCA lawyer
Michael Brindle said at a February court hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCA&#8217;s decision to fine Willford 100,000 pounds was
overturned by a judge in May 2012 because he ruled the
regulator, then known as the Financial Services Authority,
didn&#8217;t give proper reasons in the notice of its decision. The
court of appeal reversed that ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine hasn&#8217;t been confirmed and Willford may still
challenge it at a higher tribunal that hears regulatory
disputes. Willford is now chief operating officer at online
storage company My Wealth Cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikunj Kiri, his lawyer, declined to comment after the
ruling. Chris Hamilton, a spokesman for the FCA, also declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Moore-Bick rejected Willford&#8217;s request for an
extension of the privacy order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is The Queen on the Application of Christopher
Willford v. Financial Services Authority, Court of Appeal,
Queen&#8217;s Bench Division (Administrative Court) C1/2012/1551. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Austrian Central Banker Charged on Syrian Money Bribe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austrian prosecutors charged nine people, including the
vice-governor at the national bank, with bribery and money
laundering in connection with money-printing deals in Syria and
Azerbaijan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfgang Duchatczek, 63, and the unnamed co-defendants paid
14 million euros ($18.6 million), or as much as 20 percent of
order volumes, to win contracts, according to a statement from
Nina Bussek, a spokeswoman for the Vienna prosecutor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges follow an 18-month investigation into
Oesterreichische Banknoten-und Sicherheitsdruck GmbH, the money-printing press owned by the central bank. Duchatczek headed the
unit&#8217;s supervisory board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duchatczek&#8217;s lawyer, Gabriel Lansky, said via telephone
that his client isn&#8217;t guilty. Duchatczek, whose term ends in
July, said when reached by mobile phone that he wouldn&#8217;t comment
before having the opportunity to study the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank&#8217;s general council will hold a special
meeting June 18 to discuss the matter, according to a statement
from the Vienna-based institution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s political opposition
splintered less than a year before the next election as the
largest ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party severed ties over its
aversion to the growing power of Gujarat leader Narendra Modi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Janata Dal (United), which had run a coalition
government in the eastern state of Bihar with the BJP and has 20
lawmakers in the lower house of parliament, yesterday announced
after a meeting of senior leaders in Patna, the province&#8217;s
capital, it was quitting the National Democratic Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not mentioning Modi by name, Janata Dal chief Nitish Kumar said he&#8217;d &#8220;been compelled&#8221; to pull out as the BJP&#8217;s new
leadership was following a path that violated his party&#8217;s
principles. Sharad Yadav, another JD(U) leader, said the BJP had
been warned of repercussions ahead of its June 9 convention
where Modi was appointed to run the party&#8217;s campaign for polls
due by May 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a big jolt to the BJP as they can&#8217;t win power
alone and need allies,&#8221; said Sanjay Kumar, a New Delhi-based
analyst at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies.
&#8220;The toughest challenge to the BJP and Modi in the run up to
elections is going to be to keep everyone together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi, 62, has fended off challengers within the party to
emerge as the BJP&#8217;s preeminent force. While the BJP is seeking
to translate his reputation among business leaders as an
economic reformer and able administrator into votes amid the
slowest growth in a decade, some parties are concerned they may
lose the support of Muslim voters who blame Modi for failing to
control riots in Gujarat in 2002 that targeted the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One-Man Party &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you are trying to form a government, you should
follow an agenda that will attract more allies,&#8221; Kumar told
reporters in Patna yesterday. &#8220;The BJP is not trying to do
that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;BJP was never a one-man party in the past and we fear
it will be a one-man party in the future,&#8221; Devesh Chandra
Thakur, a JD(U) leader, told CNN-IBN television channel in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political temperature is rising in India as the
Congress Party of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is struggling to
shake off corruption allegations, reboot Asia&#8217;s third-biggest
economy and enact a stalled legislative agenda. Leaders of the
Congress, which has lost the support of two key allies since
September, have stepped up attacks on Modi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Third Front &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as opinion polls point to no clear mandate for either
of the two big parties once votes are counted, smaller regional
groups are bidding to revive a so-called Third Front coalition.
Kumar has said he has held consultations with other parties and
the chief ministers of West Bengal and Odisha on forming a
political alternative to the Congress and BJP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While similar attempts have collapsed before recent
elections, a grouping of provincial parties did govern India
from 1996 to 1998, propped up by the Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is hard to see a Third Front forming,&#8221; said Ramesh
Dixit, a professor of politics at Lucknow University, based in
the capital of Uttar Pradesh, the country&#8217;s most populous state.
&#8220;Many of the smaller parties that would need to come together
to form a government clash because of different ideologies or
compete locally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi&#8217;s promotion has triggered a tumultuous week for the
BJP. Lal Krishna Advani, who drove it from the political fringes
in the late 1980s to the seat of power a decade later, briefly
resigned his posts June 10, citing a takeover by leaders he said
were putting personal ambition before the party. He rescinded
the decision after visits from BJP chiefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gandhi Role &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Congress nor the BJP is yet to name an official
candidate for prime minister. That hasn&#8217;t stopped the local
media from portraying the coming battle has a face off between
Modi and Rahul Gandhi, scion of the Nehru-Gandhi family that has
dominated Indian politics since independence from British rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gandhi, 42 and son of the Congress President Sonia Gandhi
and assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, was appointed as
his party&#8217;s vice president in January and will lead its election
campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh&#8217;s second term as prime minister has been punctuated
by corruption scandals -- including over the award of mobile-phone permits and coal mines. Protests in parliament paralyzed
policy making for almost two years. In his latest bid to inject
new energy into his administration, Singh will today announce a
cabinet overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rupee Slide &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram last week vowed
more steps to boost economic growth and stabilize the rupee
after it slid to a record low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty-one percent of those polled last month for CNN-IBN
said Singh should be replaced as prime minister, while 37
percent supported him continuing in the post. About 67 percent
said Singh&#8217;s government has lost its credibility in the face of
graft scandals and rising prices. Only 31 percent said the
Congress party-led coalition represented the best option for
running India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 38 percent want Modi as the country&#8217;s next prime
minister, only 14 percent favor Gandhi, according to the poll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A C-voter survey for the Times Now TV channel found in
April that a drop in support for Congress would slash its
strength in parliament after an election. The party may win 113
seats, a fall of 90, in the 545-member lower house, it said. The
main opposition alliance led by the BJP was on course to make
only marginal advances as regional parties are gaining in
strength, the survey said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s $10 billion Angola
LNG plant shipped its first cargo today after an 18-month delay
prompted by fires, labor shortages and U.S. shale drilling that
erased demand for African fuel in the world&#8217;s largest gas
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipment of gas that was cooled to -256 degrees
Fahrenheit (-160 degrees Celsius) to shrink its volume was sold
to state-owned Sonangol EP for transport to Brazil aboard the
ship Sonangol Sambizanga, Artur Pereira, chief executive officer
of Angola LNG Marketing, said in an e-mailed statement today. A
&#8220;large number&#8221; of LNG sales from the plant have been signed or
are in negotiation, the London-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the world&#8217;s third-largest energy company by market
value, has made LNG a linchpin of its goal to raise its
worldwide output by 20 percent through the end of 2017 to the
equivalent of 3.3 million barrels of crude a day. The company is
spending more than $77 billion on two LNG projects in Australia,
and in December acquired a 50 percent stake in the proposed
Kitimat LNG terminal on Canada&#8217;s Pacific Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;First gas at Angola LNG is an important milestone in
support of our strategic plan to grow our production,&#8221; George Kirkland, vice chairman of San Ramon, California-based Chevron,
said in a statement distributed by Business Wire today. &#8220;This
project will commercialize natural gas resources in western
Africa to meet growing demand in the region and
internationally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shipments Planned &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production at the liquefaction plant, with a capacity of
5.2 million metric tons a year, was postponed because of fires,
pipeline collapses and a lack of skilled workers, three people
with knowledge of the situation said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facility in Soyo in northern Angola plans one or two
shipments in June and July before performing checks on its
systems and resuming output in the fourth quarter, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global LNG demand is expected to exceed production around
the end of this decade with the deficit growing to 100 million
metric tons a year by 2025, Chevron Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer John Watson said in a presentation to analysts in New
York on March 12. Demand for the fuel will increase at an
estimated average rate of 15 million tons a year through 2025,
led by growth in Asian nations such as Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan, Watson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reduced Flaring &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Angola LNG is entering the market at an exciting time,&#8221;
Pereira said. &#8220;The world LNG market is expected to remain tight
over the coming years, with very limited new LNG capacity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is Angola LNG&#8217;s largest shareholder with a 36.4 
percent stake. BP Plc (BP/), Eni SpA (ENI) and Total SA (FP) each hold 13.6
percent, while Sonangol has 22.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Angola LNG&#8217;s vision is to be a reliable and competitive
supplier, a strong community partner, and a role model for the
economic development of Angola,&#8221; Sonangol Chairman Antonio
&#211;rfao said in the same e-mail. &#8220;The project provides a solution
to minimize flaring and environmental pollution by gathering
associated gas from Angola&#8217;s offshore oil fields.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angola produced 1.87 million barrels of oil a day in May,
equal to Nigeria, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Chevron and its partners built Angola LNG in part to market gas
that otherwise would have been burned off because of the lack of
a local demand for the fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is the world&#8217;s largest energy company by
market value, followed by PetroChina Co. (857), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. oil company, issued $6 billion of bonds in four parts for
its first sale of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s $750 million of 0.889 percent, three-year
notes yield 40 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries; $2 billion of 1.718 percent, five-year securities
pay a relative yield of 65 basis points; $1 billion of 2.427
percent, seven-year debt pay an 85 basis-point spread; and $2.25
billion of 3.191 percent, 10-year bonds yield 100 more,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company canceled plans to offer floating-rate notes due
in 2016 and 2018, according to a person familiar with the
transaction, who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the bonds, expected to be rated Aa1 by
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, will be used to refinance commercial
paper, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron &#8220;is finding it increasingly difficult to expand
production and add reserves as many of the remaining pools of
cheap, easily accessible resources&#8221; are owned by governments
and national oil companies, David Schivell, an analyst at
Chicago-based research firm Morningstar Inc., wrote in a note
today. &#8220;Still, the company maintains a rock solid balance
sheet,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;November Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morningstar estimated a fair-value spread of 45 basis
points on the new three-year bonds, 55 basis points on the five-year, 70 for the seven-year and 90 on the 10-year, according to
the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron last sold debt in November, issuing $2 billion each
of 1.104 percent, five-year debentures at a spread of 47 basis
points and 2.355 percent, 10-year securities at 72 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. The bonds due December 2022 traded at 95
cents on the dollar to yield 2.96 percent on June 11, or a
relative yield of 75 basis points, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average new issue concession on investment-grade bonds
in the U.S. reached 11 basis points last week, the highest since
the five days ended June 28, 2012, according to data from
Barclays Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Morgan Stanley and Wells
Fargo  Co. managed the offering for San Ramon, California-based
Chevron, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell as stocks advanced before this week&#8217;s Federal Reserve
policy meeting. Chevron Corp. is offering $6 billion of debt in
four parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
1.9 basis points to a mid-price of 82.2 basis points at 4:42
p.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
index has dropped from a more than two-month high of 87.5 on
June 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders are trying to determine when the Fed will scale
back $85 billion of monthly bond purchases, known as
quantitative easing, that have suppressed benchmark yields and
pushed investors into riskier assets such as corporate bonds.
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is scheduled to speak after the
central bank&#8217;s decision on June 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year Treasury note&#8217;s yield has fallen to 2.18
percent from a 14-month high of 2.23 percent on June 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is generally feeling better about rates
stabilizing a bit and that Ben Bernanke will not pare back QE,&#8221;
Scott Carmack, co-portfolio manager at Leader Capital Corp. in
Portland, Oregon, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chevron Issue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron (CVX), the second-largest U.S. oil company by market
value, may sell $750 million of three-year notes to yield 40
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, $2 billion
of five-year securities at a relative yield of 65 basis points,
$1 billion of seven-year debt at a 85 basis-point spread and
$2.25 billion of 10-year bonds at 100, according to a person
with knowledge of the transaction, who asked not to be
identified because terms aren&#8217;t set. Proceeds will be used to
refinance commercial paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company canceled plans to offer floating-rate notes due
in 2016 and 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index fell 11.1 basis points to 402.4 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average relative yield on speculative-grade, or junk-rated, debt fell 4.3 basis points to 551.7 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below
Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and less than BBB- at SP.
The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 (SPX) Index gained 0.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Credit is tracking the equity market in general,&#8221; Mirko Mikelic, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset
Management in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;I think everybody agrees the Fed will be on hold.
It&#8217;s more the timing when the Fed takes the foot off the
pedal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

(AAPL), the world&#8217;s most-valuable technology company, received as many as 5,000 requests for customer information from U.S. law enforcement authorities amid widening revelations of government data collection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between 9,000 and 10,000 accounts or devices were specified in the requests between Dec. 1 and May 31, the Cupertino, California-based company said in a statement. Facebook Inc. (FB) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said they received thousands of warrants for data from government entities during the second half of 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The role of technology companies has come under scrutiny since Edward Snowden, a computer technician who did work for the National Security Agency, disclosed this month that the NSA is collecting data under a U.S. government program code-named PRISM. The project traces its roots to warrantless domestic-surveillance efforts under former President George W. Bush. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Like several other companies, we have asked the U.S. government for permission to report how many requests we receive related to national security and how we handle them,&#8221; Apple said in the statement. &#8220;We have been authorized to share some of that data, and we are providing it here in the interest of transparency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) named Ina De
and Conor Hillery co-heads of its U.K. investment banking
business, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De, currently co-head of equity capital markets for Europe,
the Middle East and Africa, and Hillery, head of the U.K.
financial institutions group, will report to Chairman Tim Wise,
the memo shows. Its contents were confirmed by a spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
have been increasing their share of European investment-banking
fees, the New York-based research firm Freeman  Co. reported
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s broking clients include the U.K.&#8217;s largest
fixed-line telecommunications company, BT Group Plc (BT/A), as well as
car-repair business Halfords Group Plc. (HFD) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurence Hollingworth, previously head of investment
banking in the U.K., will take over from Jake Donavan as the
head of industry coverage in the EMEA region. Donavan will
become senior country officer of Benelux and the Nordics, the
bank said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the largest computer-services provider, said it will sell
software over the Internet direct to corporate executives, going
beyond the traditional model of doing business with chief
information officers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM will market more than 100 cloud applications to heads
of marketing, supply chain, human resources and others, changing
the way it sells software as competition from Silicon Valley
startups mounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the company&#8217;s second big move into cloud delivery this
month, following the purchase of SoftLayer Technologies Inc., a
cloud-computing storage provider that will help it compete with
Amazon.com Inc. Many of IBM&#8217;s customers are just starting to
become interested in software delivered via the Internet, known
as software-as-a-service or SaaS, said Marc Dietz, the director
of SmartCloud solutions for IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re serving a growing demand with a new way that we&#8217;re
going to market,&#8221; Dietz said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really an expansion and a
comprehensive cloud strategy for our clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With SaaS, customers buy software as they use it and can
access it through the Internet, as opposed to signing multiyear
contracts for installation and support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, is also adding new software
to the portfolio, including a social-media analytics product
that will allow businesses to monitor customer sentiment on
Facebook and Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader
Fabrice Tourre lost a bid to present evidence that he
&#8220;reasonably relied&#8217; on the advice of lawyers when working on a
transaction at the center of a fraud lawsuit filed by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing Tourre to use that defense without meeting legal
requirements &#8216;&#8216;would give the defendant all of the essential
benefits of an advice of counsel defense without having to bear
the burden of proving any of the elements of the defense,&#8217;&#8217; U.S.
District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan ruled. Tourre&#8217;s
trial is scheduled to begin July 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued the London-based trader in April 2010, saying
he defrauded investors by not disclosing that hedge fund Paulson
 Co. had helped pick the underlying securities for a
collateralized debt obligation, or CDO, called Abacus and
planned to bet against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reaching a $550 million settlement with New York-based Goldman Sachs, the SEC filed a new claim against Tourre,
saying he gave the company &#8216;&#8216;substantial assistance&#8217;&#8217; as it
misled investors. The SEC is also pursuing claims that Tourre
violated securities laws related to ACA Management LLC&#8217;s sale of
protection on $909 million of the Abacus notes, which defaulted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre sought to offer evidence showing that: Paulson&#8217;s
counsel reviewed or was copied on various documents; counsel for
ACA reviewed certain transaction documents; and in-house or
outside counsel for Goldman Sachs drafted or reviewed disclosure
language, according to Forrest&#8217;s ruling issued late yesterday
and made public today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Several Lawyers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trader also wanted to show that several people part of
the process were lawyers, such as David Gerst, a member of the
trading desk, who was an attorney at a law firm before joining
at Goldman Sachs, Forrest said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;It would be confusing and unduly prejudicial for Tourre
to present extensive evidence on the presence and involvement of
lawyers -- who are presumably paid to ensure that any
disclosures comply with the relevant legal requirements -- while
at the same time professing not to have relied on their advice
in preparing or disseminating those disclosures,&#8221; Forrest
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre argued he was one of six people on the Goldman Sachs
trading desk that worked on the transaction and that internal
and external lawyers as well as the company&#8217;s compliance
department reviewed offering documents for the CDO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that lawyers saw and commented on disclosure
language could be understood as &#8216;blessing&#8217; the sufficiency of
that disclosure,&#8221; the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Primarily Responsible&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forrest said Tourre could use the words &#8220;counsel,&#8221;
&#8220;lawyer&#8221; and &#8220;attorney&#8221; and present evidence &#8220;tending to
show that he was not the person primarily responsible for the
transaction and that the transaction occurred in the context of
a sophisticated financial institution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Rogers Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre, declined to
comment through Chris Kittredge, a spokesman for her at Sard
Verbinnen  Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Nester, a spokesman for the SEC, declined to comment
on Forrest&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transactions at issue in the case involved IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG (IKB), which allegedly lost almost all of its $150
million investment, and ABN Amro Bank NV, which assumed the
credit risk associated with a portion of the Abacus CDO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-03229, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. hired Anwar Zakkour from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) as co-head of global
telecommunications, media and technology investment banking,
according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zakkour will remain based in New York, reporting to global
head of investment banking Christian Meissner, according to the
memo, whose contents were confirmed by a Bank of America
spokesman. His co-head will be Chet Bozdog, currently head of
global technology investment banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zakkour, recently vice chairman of investment banking,
follows top bankers such as Jim Woolery in leaving JPMorgan this
year. Bank of America trails JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. in advising on MA globally this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman at JPMorgan declined to comment. The firm and
Bank of America are the largest U.S. banks by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zakkour joined JPMorgan in 2005 and later advanced to
global head of telecommunications, media and technology MA
before becoming vice chairman in 2011. He recently advised
MetroPCS Communications Inc. on its merger with Deutsche Telekom
AG&#8217;s T-Mobile USA, after earlier working on ATT Inc.&#8217;s failed
$39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zakkour was part of the team that advised General Electric
Co. on its two-stage sale of NBC Universal to Comcast Corp.
Comcast first bought a 51 percent stake in the media company in
2011 and this year purchased the rest. His other significant
deals include the restructuring and the merger that created
Sirius XM Radio Inc. and News Corp.&#8217;s acquisition of Dow Jones 
Co. in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lancashire Holdings Ltd. (LRE) fell the
most in three months after JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its rating
on the Lloyds of London insurer for the first time in at least
three years, citing softening premium rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares dropped as much as 5.9 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since March 20, and were down 2.6 percent at
762 pence at 12:40 p.m. in London. The volume of shares traded
was almost twice the three-month daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A softening rate outlook across Lancashire&#8217;s portfolio
will cap underwriting progress,&#8221; Andreas van Embden, an analyst
at JPMorgan, said in a note. &#8220;We see a lack of immediate
catalysts for the shares ahead of the hurricane season.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property catastrophe reinsurance rates for June have fallen
about 15 percent, reflecting the lack of hurricanes in Florida
and increased competition, Nick Johnson, a London-based analyst
at Numis Securities Ltd., wrote in a note dated June 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catastrophe insurance premiums have eased in the U.S. as no
hurricane has made landfall in Florida, the fourth-most populous
state, since 2005. This year, there is a 16 percent chance a
Category 3 hurricane, with winds of at least 111 miles per hour
(179 kph), will hit Florida, Colorado State University
researchers forecast in April. That&#8217;s down from 21 percent in an
average year. The six-month hurricane season began on June 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UBS List &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Embden cut his rating on the stock to neutral from
overweight and lowered his 12-month price target by 7 percent to
800 pence. Van Embden has had an overweight rating on Lancashire
since he started covering the insurer for JPMorgan in 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancashire remains an attractive income stock with a
special dividend of 65 pence a share, offering a yield of 9
percent, likely to be announced in the second half, van Embden
said. The stock is fully valued compared with its returns, the
analyst said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s downgrade comes five days after UBS AG initiated
coverage with a buy recommendation and added Lancashire to its
key calls list of small and medium-capitalization companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancashire had achieved the highest returns in the
industry, coupled with the lowest volatility, between 2008 and
2012, UBS analyst Angela Gu, who set a 12-month price target of
850 pence, said in a note to clients. Its prospective total
dividend yield of 10 percent for the next three years was the
highest in the industry, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numis&#8217;s Johnson and EVA Dimensions also both upgraded the
stock this month. The drop in the share price had left
Lancashire&#8217;s valuation in line with its competitors, Johnson
wrote, upgrading his rating to add from hold. The shares fell 21
percent between March 4 and June 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancashire&#8217;s &#8220;nimble strategy and relatively small capital
base will enable it to sustain superior operating performance
versus peers,&#8221; Johnson wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A police sketch artist and &#8220;the
world&#8217;s smallest film&#8221; are helping to sell soap and technology
for Dove and IBM as advertisers unleash a wave of more subtle,
intelligent and entertaining campaigns to lure a jaded public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unilever NV (UNA)&#8217;s six-minute &#8220;Dove Sketches&#8221; film, in which a
former San Jose Police Department sketch artist helps women
realize &#8220;You are more beautiful than you think,&#8221; became the
most viewed online ad of all time in May with more than 114
million views. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s
researchers manipulated individual atoms to depict a youngster
playing with a ball. The result is &#8220;A Boy and His Atom,&#8221; which
holds the record as the world&#8217;s smallest stop-motion movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These spots from WPP Plc (WPP)&#8217;s Ogilvy  Mather agency weren&#8217;t
part of a traditional TV and newspaper campaign, yet racked up
millions of views online at YouTube. As the divide between
content and marketing narrows, a new category called native
advertising is advancing. In addition to expensive films and
mini-documentaries, it includes sponsored newsfeeds on Facebook
and LinkedIn (LNKD), and branded content for magazines and newspapers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ad industry is getting smarter about putting the
right ads in front of the right people,&#8221; said Jonathan Nelson,
chief executive officer for digital at Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC), the
second-largest advertising company. &#8220;We&#8217;re not trying to dupe
the customer into not knowing it&#8217;s an ad, but in a world with so
much fragmentation it&#8217;s hard to get attention.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

WPP Chief Executive Officer Martin Sorrell said in an interview, &#8220;I&#8217;ve always been of the view that the dividing line between editorial and advertising would blur, and that was fine as long as you made it quite clear to the consumer.&#8221; Close

&lt;p&gt;GameStop Corp. (GME), the largest video-game specialty retailer, rose to its highest price in more than
four years after Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) reversed a policy that would
have curbed trading and reselling of used games on its Xbox One
unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GameStop, based in Grapevine, Texas, jumped 6.3 percent to
$40.94 at the close, its highest price since Sept. 12, 2008. The
stock has risen 63 percent this year compared with an 11 percent
gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said yesterday it will drop curbs on reselling,
trading and lending used titles and the need for regular
Internet connections on its Xbox One in order to play disc-based
games. Sony Corp.&#8217;s rival new PlayStation 4 console doesn&#8217;t have
any game transaction limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-owned games, which GameStop customers trade in for new
versions, were 31 percent of first-quarter revenue, while new
ones represented more than 37 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 will go on sale in the
U.S. in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) recently canceled an
early stage project looking at ways to combine its Bing Web
search with shopping, the company said without explaining why
the effort was abandoned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The project was a small scale incubation effort to enable
a more direct commerce model between customers and brands and
merchants,&#8221; the largest software maker said in a statement.
&#8220;The project was recently canceled, but we remain committed to
finding new and differentiated ways to enable a richer, more
task-oriented approach to e-commerce and online advertising.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search engine, which lags market-dominating rival Google Inc. (GOOG), has experimented for several years
with shopping programs, including an effort that ended in 2010
which gave customers cash back on purchases. Besides increasing
search traffic, Microsoft has looked at options for bolstering
an ailing display advertising business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, called Brazil, and its cancellation were
reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal, which described it
as effort to compete with online retailer Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and
Web marketplace EBay Inc. (EBAY) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said in its
statement that it&#8217;s &#8220;inaccurate to characterize Project Brazil
as conceived to compete with Amazon or EBay.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s biggest
entertainment company, dropped the most since November 2012
after Goldman Sachs  Co. downgraded the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney slid 3.7 percent to $61.98 at the New York close.
The stock fell the most among the 30 companies in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU), which declined 2.3 percent after the Federal
Reserve said it may cut back its bond purchases. The shares
have gained 24 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s ESPN faces rising costs for sports broadcast
rights and new competition from News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s Fox Sports 1, which
begins airing in August, Drew Borst, an analyst at Goldman
Sachs (GS), wrote in a report published today. He lowered Disney&#8217;s
rating to neutral and removed the Burbank, California-based
company from the firm&#8217;s &#8220;conviction buy&#8221; list. Borst didn&#8217;t
change his 12-month price target of $70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN, which provides about 45 percent of Disney&#8217;s operating
income, will be less profitable next year due to the higher cost
of airing NFL football, Major League Baseball and college
sports, Borst wrote. Fox Sports 1 will drive up prices by
competing for  TV rights. ESPN&#8217;s NBA basketball contract expires
after the 2015-2016 season and its Nascar rights expire next
year, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s cable channels, including ESPN and ABC Family,
produced $5.7 billion in operating income on revenue of $13.6
billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 29. In that same
period, Disney reported total operating profit of $9.96 billion
on $42.3 billion in revenue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  is shutting the
crude distillation unit at the Torrance, California, refinery
for a week or two of repairs related to a metallurgical issue, a
person familiar with the operations said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the units at the 150,000-barrel-a-day plant
near Los Angeles will operate at about half of normal rates
while the crude unit is out of commission, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gesuina Paras, an Exxon spokeswoman at the refinery, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crude unit returned to full rates earlier this month
after parts were shut for a planned turnaround that also
included work on a coker and alkylation unit, two people
familiar with the schedule said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torrance refinery, which processes mostly heavy crude
from California&#8217;s San Joaquin Valley, makes almost 10 percent of
the state&#8217;s gasoline and provides jet fuel to Los Angeles
International Airport by pipeline, Exxon&#8217;s website shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moncler picked six securities firms
led by Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
manage an initial public offering as soon as this year,
according to three people with direct knowledge of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering may raise 800 million euros ($1 billion) to 1
billion euros as investors sell 30 percent to 35 percent of the
company, one person said. Mediobanca SpA (MB) will also be a global
coordinator of the IPO, while Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP), JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and UBS AG (UBSN) will be joint bookrunners along with the
global coordinators, said the people, who asked not to be
identified before the company makes an announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moncler is planning an IPO in Italy for the second time in
two years, allowing French private-equity firm Eurazeo to reduce
its stake after it bought 45 percent of the company in 2011 when
the maker of ski jackets abandoned the earlier listing. The 
purchase, in which Eurazeo replaced Carlyle Group as Moncler&#8217;s 
largest investor, valued the clothier at no less than 1.2 
billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An external spokeswoman for Eurazeo and a spokesman for
Milan-based Moncler, Domenico Galluccio, declined to comment on
the IPO plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moncler may separate the luxury apparel brand from its
other clothing businesses ahead of the IPO, Chairman Remo Ruffini said in an interview in October. In addition to selling
$1,395 ski jackets and $995 handbags under the Moncler brand, 
Moncler also owns the Marina Yachting, Henry Cotton&#8217;s and Coast 
Weber  Ahaus sportswear labels, and holds the license for 
Cerruti 1881. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*), Mexico&#8217;s largest
construction company, will sell its minority stake in a Mexican
tollway operator to partner Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and use the
proceeds to pay short-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mexico City-based builder said it expected to receive
5.07 billion pesos ($380 million) from the sale of its 18.7
percent stake in Red de Carreteras de Occidente, which is
majority-owned by Goldman Sachs. The deal needs approval by
Mexico&#8217;s antitrust regulator and the Ministry of Communications
and Transportation, ICA said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICA shares have tumbled more than 30 percent since May 16,
the day before Moody&#8217;s Investors Service downgraded the
company&#8217;s credit rating citing its high leverage and delays in
public-works spending by President Enrique Pena Nieto. The
company&#8217;s sales dropped 27 percent in the first quarter while
debt climbed 14 percent to 54.2 billion pesos from its Dec. 31
level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are significantly strengthening our financial
position,&#8221; ICA Chief Executive Officer Alonso Quintana said in
the statement. &#8220;The sale of ICA&#8217;s investment in RCO is a clear
example of our strategy of selective recycling of capital in our
asset portfolio and creating value for ICA&#8217;s shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICA fell 2.8 percent to 21.28 pesos at 9:18 a.m. in Mexico
City as Mexico&#8217;s benchmark IPC index dropped 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decade-long outperformance of
developing-nation assets has ended, according to the Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. economist who predicted the rise of the biggest
emerging markets in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five trends that spurred outsized gains during the past
10 years -- surging growth in the so-called BRIC nations, higher
commodities, improved government finances, slower inflation and
lower U.S. bond yields -- are halting and in some cases
reversing, Dominic Wilson, the chief markets economist at New
York-based Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While cyclical opportunities will come and go, the era of
structural outperformance for EM is probably over,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks, bonds and currencies tumbled today
amid speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will reduce monetary
stimulus that has spurred $3.9 trillion of capital inflows into
developing nations during the past four years. Wilson, who
predicted Brazil, Russia, India and China would join the ranks
of the world&#8217;s largest economies in a 2003 research report while
working with economist Jim O&#8217;Neill, now says their contribution
to global growth is peaking. O&#8217;Neill, who retired from Goldman
Sachs this year, coined the BRIC moniker in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index sank 3.2 percent to an 11-month low of 916.17 at 8:32 a.m. in New York, while currencies
in India, the Philippines and South Korea weakened more than 1
percent and South African bond yields surged. Fed Chairman Ben
S. Bernanke said yesterday policy makers may start reducing debt
purchases and end the program in 2014 should risks to the U.S.
economy abate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lower Returns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the recent losses, the MSCI emerging index has
climbed about 214 percent since the end of 2002, compared with
an 85 percent gain in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. (SPX) JPMorgan
Chase  Co.&#8217;s gauge of developing-nation currencies has returned
103 percent in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the next decade, EM assets are unlikely to deliver
the kind of risk-reward that investors had become used to in the
last one,&#8221; Wilson wrote. &#8220;And absolute returns will likely be
much lower.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan Dehn, the head of research at Ashmore Investment
Management, says declines in emerging markets are a buying
opportunity because valuations have gotten cheap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI gauge trades for 1.4 times net assets, a 28
percent discount versus the MSCI World index of developed-nation
shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
with an average discount of less than 1 percent during the past
five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Relative Value &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The right thing to do here, obviously, is to buy,&#8221; Dehn
said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuations in developing-nation debt and currency markets
have become more expensive in the past decade, according to
Wilson. The extra yield investors demand to own emerging-market
government bonds over Treasuries has dropped to about 1.1
percentage point from 4 percentage points, excluding Argentina
and Venezuela, he wrote. The average emerging-market currency is
now 10 percent overvalued, according to Wilson, who cited a
Goldman Sachs model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economist said investors may need to focus on country-specific drivers, instead of relying on a repeat of the
widespread rally in emerging markets that defined the last
decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we may be seeing is a return to conventional EM
investing, where differentiation rather than broad exposure to
the asset class becomes a larger part of the investment
process,&#8221; Wilson said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time Roseann Sdoia attended
a road race, terror shattered the course and left her with a leg
amputated above the knee. Tonight, she&#8217;ll be back to sound the
starting horn as racing returns to downtown Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have mixed emotions because I should be there running,
but I&#8217;m not,&#8221; said Sdoia, 45, who has undergone three surgeries
since the April 15 Boston Marathon bombing that killed three and
injured more than 260 people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight&#8217;s 3.5-mile J.P. Morgan Corporate Challenge race,
which starts at 7:20 p.m., is one of the first organized
competitions in downtown Boston since the terrorist attack. It
begins at the Boston Common and runs parallel to the last mile
or so of the marathon course. For many participants, the event
is an emotional return to a neighborhood devastated by the twin
bomb blasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The race itself symbolizes a lot of the running community
and the Boston community coming together and really slowly
taking back the city and taking back running,&#8221; said Cara
Bednar, 28, who finished the marathon in under four hours, about
10 to 15 minutes before the first blast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 12,000 people from 569 companies are registered for
tonight&#8217;s race, said Erich Timmerman, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which is organizing the event.
JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, is donating all registration
fees, about $500,000, to One Fund Boston, which was created to
assist victims of the bombings and their families, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tata Group&#8217;s solar unit is expanding
its business building plants for customers, forecasting that
offices and factories will be paying more for grid power than
solar by 2016 in most Indian states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar installations for commercial and industrial energy
consumers, such as cement factories, information technology
parks and car manufacturers, seeking to generate their own power
represent a market of about 80 billion rupees ($1.3 billion),
said Ajay Goel, chief executive of Tata Power Solar Systems
Ltd., a unit of India&#8217;s biggest industrial group that owns
Jaguar Land Rover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, formerly known as Tata BP Solar Ltd., is
seeking to diversify from making panels after an oversupply from
Chinese competitors crushed prices globally and idled Indian
factories. Customers for whom it has already completed solar
plants for self-generation include Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL), the
country&#8217;s biggest carmaker, and the local units of Dell Inc. (DELL) and
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing a huge uptake as we get closer and closer to
grid parity,&#8221; Goel said in a phone interview. &#8220;Corporate
customers are coming to us to install solar on their rooftops or
land on the side of their factories because it can provide
energy cheaper than from the grid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombian armed groups are reaping
profits from illegal gold mining that are five times greater
than returns from cocaine, according to Colonel Hector Paez,
acting director of the country&#8217;s rural police division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocaine typically takes six months to produce and requires
considerable knowledge, while an illegal mining operation in the
Colombian jungle can extract two kilograms of gold a week, Paez
said in a June 19 interview in Bogota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Illegal mining has risen in this country - for gold,
coltan, limestone and construction materials,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They
are earning more money from gold than cocaine or kidnappings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold, which slumped below $1,300 an ounce for the first
time since September 2010 in New York yesterday, has become
Colombia&#8217;s biggest export after oil and coal. A kilogram of
cocaine can sell for about 5 million pesos ($2,570) in the
Colombian jungle while a kilogram of gold can fetch 19 times
that, or similar to global market prices, Paez said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precious metal is also relatively easy to legalize
while cocaine remains banned. &#8220;As soon as it&#8217;s excavated and
away from the mine it&#8217;s legal,&#8221; said Paez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombian armed groups include the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the National Liberation Army, or
ELN, and organized crime gangs with links to Colombia&#8217;s
decommissioned paramilitaries. The FARC have been engaged in a
five-decade armed struggle against the Colombian government and
are currently participating in peace talks in Havana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coca Crop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FARC and other armed groups profit by taxing gold
production and machinery use, as well as operating their own
illegal mines, said Paez. Rural police have shut 336 illegal
mines this year, topping last year&#8217;s total of 330, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the mines run by rebel groups or criminal gangs,
Colombia&#8217;s mining industry also includes thousands of artisan
miners operating without permits. Cesar Diaz, president of the
Colombian Mining Chamber, said a &#8220;very important&#8221; percentage
of the country&#8217;s gold production comes from the informal sector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The two big gold producers in Colombia, Mineros SA (MINEROS) and
Gran Colombia Gold Corp. (GCM), make up about 10 to 15 percent of
total production. So what is there in the other 85 percent? You
can draw your conclusion,&#8221; Diaz said in an interview last
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia exported about 70 metric tons of gold in 2012,
according to data from the mining chamber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As illegal mining surges, Colombia&#8217;s coca crop dropped a
record 25 percent in 2012, newspaper El Tiempo reported June 16,
citing United Nations data. Natalia Arango, head of
communications in the UN Office on Drugs and Crime for Colombia,
said a report including 2012 coca crop figures will be published
July 2. She declined to comment on El Tiempo&#8217;s story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s real, Chile&#8217;s peso and
Turkey&#8217;s lira may fall &#8220;significantly&#8221; to curtail widening
current account deficits, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lira, South African rand and India&#8217;s rupee would need
to depreciate about 30 percent on a trade-weighted basis, while
the real and peso need to fall about 20 percent, London-based
analyst Themistoklis Fiotakis wrote in a note today. While the
assessments aren&#8217;t forecasts, they signal where the currencies
&#8220;might ultimately belong,&#8221; the analyst said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currencies are among the worst performers in emerging
markets over the past month, with the real falling 10 percent
since May 21, as the Federal Reserve signaled plans to taper off
monetary stimulus. Rising bond yields in U.S., Germany and Japan
are attracting funds away from emerging markets, making it more
difficult for the countries to finance the deficits in their
current accounts, the broadest measure of international trade
and service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A larger exchange rate depreciation might be necessary,
which will bring external accounts back into full balance,&#8221;
Fiotakis wrote. &#8220;Although some of the recent shifts may prove
to be overshoots in the short term, the EM bond and FX selloff
of the last month is likely to constitute only a small part of a
longer trend for EM assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s current account deficit widened to a record $73
billion in the year through May, equivalent to 3.2 percent of
gross domestic product, according to a central bank report
today. Chile&#8217;s deficit reached 4 percent of the GDP in the first
quarter, the widest since 1998, while Turkey&#8217;s amounted to 5.9
percent at the end of March, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron respects the right of individuals to express

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Merck  Co. (MRK) Inc.,
Amgen Inc. and other technology-focused companies are joining
forces to seek U.S. tax code changes that wouldn&#8217;t put at a
disadvantage income earned from patents and intangible assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are part of the newly formed Tax Innovation
Equality Coalition, whose other members include Xilinx Inc. (XLNX),
Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) and Netflix Inc. (NFLX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based group, which announced its formation
today, is responding to proposals -- including one from House
Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp -- that would apply different
tax rules to income earned from intangible assets. Changes to
those laws could raise these companies&#8217; taxes to pay for lighter
burdens on the foreign income of all U.S.-based multinational
corporations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It only makes sense that any tax reform proposal would
try to cut the benefits of the members of this coalition,
because they have the lowest effective tax rates,&#8221; said Martin
Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts in Falls Church,
Virginia. &#8220;This coalition is playing defense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camp, a Michigan Republican, this month endorsed a carrot-and-stick approach that would apply a 15 percent immediate tax
to such income regardless of where it&#8217;s earned. That would give
the companies a tax increase abroad and a tax cut at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;25% Rate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other corporate income would be subject to a 25 percent
rate on domestic profits and almost no U.S. tax on foreign
income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies would feel less pressure to shift income to
low-tax jurisdictions because that income would be taxed at the
same rate -- whether it is earned in the United States or
Bermuda,&#8221; Camp said at a June 13 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the current U.S. tax system, companies can move
intangible assets derived from intellectual property across
borders and can structure their businesses in ways that minimize
foreign taxes. They can then avoid U.S. taxes by keeping the
money overseas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TIE Coalition is the latest in a series of groups that
have formed as Congress considers a rewrite of the U.S. tax
code. Other groups are focusing on the corporate tax rate and
changing international tax rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coalition isn&#8217;t advocating or opposing a particular
plan, said Mark Nebergall, president of the Washington-based
Software Finance  Tax Executives Council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All these proposals, with a few exceptions, seem to pick
on intangible property,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Proposals that do not
discriminate against intangibles are the ones that deserve the
most scrutiny.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tax Credits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress should be careful not to impose tax changes that
could cost jobs in industries reliant on intellectual property,
said Matthew Slaughter, a Dartmouth College professor who
conducted a study for the coalition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In many ways, tax policy being one, there are literally
dozens of other countries in the world that are moving
aggressively to try to build their capacity&#8221; in these
industries, he said in a phone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current U.S. system already gives these companies
breaks, Sullivan said. They are eligible for the research tax
credit and can take advantage of the mobility of intangible
assets, which can be transferred more easily than factories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to value and it&#8217;s hard to locate,&#8221; Sullivan
said, &#8220;and so that makes it easy to put a lot of profit into a
tax haven.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors in Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the
world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, oversubscribed to a program to
exchange some or all of their shares for those of its former
animal-health unit, Zoetis Inc. (ZTS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will retire about 405 million shares, or about $11.4
billion worth, at today&#8217;s price, as investors tried to exchange
more Pfizer shares than there was Zoetis stock. Shareholders
will get 24 percent of the 1.68 billion shares tendered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share exchange completes the New York-based company&#8217;s
restructuring plan, in which it dropped two non-drug units, the
animal health business and an infant nutrition line. Zoetis
began trading as a separate company on February 1, surging 19
percent in its debut after raising $2.24 billion in an initial
public offering. As a result of the spinoff completion, the
company expects adjusted earnings of $2.10 to $2.20 a share,
from a previous projected range of $2.14 to $2.24, according to
its statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer offered investors the Zoetis stock at a 5.4 percent
discount. For every $100 of Pfizer stock traded in, they&#8217;ll get
$105 of Zoetis shares in return, which Pfizer gave as an
incentive to participate in the exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoetis is based in Florham Park, New Jersey, and makes and
sells drugs and treatments for animals. Livestock products make
up 65 percent of its sales, while medicines for pets account for
the rest. Much of the company&#8217;s growth depends on rising wealth
levels around the world, as people eat more meat and care for
companion animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Board Appointment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company today also said it appointed Michael McCallister, a former chief executive officer at the Louisville,
Kentucky-based health insurer Humana Inc. as Zoetis&#8217;s non-executive chairman. He replaces Chief Financial Officer Frank D&#8217;Amelio, who will remain on the Zoetis board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoetis shares fell 1.8 percent to $30.05 at 10:25 a.m. in
New York. Pfizer declined by less than 1 percent to $28.20 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ian Read is now deciding whether to
split the company in two to separate its generic drug&#8217;s
business. The split could happen in the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley managed the deal. Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher  Flom LLP acted as legal adviser. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
shield Pfizer Inc. (PFE) from some asbestos lawsuits connected to its
Quigley Co. subsidiary, a bankrupt unit that stopped most
operations in 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices today rejected Pfizer&#8217;s appeal of a ruling
that opened the New York-based drugmaker to some claims related
to Quigley, which made asbestos-containing products for the
steel industry from the 1940s to the 1970s. Pfizer acquired
Quigley in 1968. Asbestos, once widely used an insulator, was
later shown to cause cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, contended that
Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy proceedings insulated the parent company
from suits filed under Pennsylvania state law by the Baltimore
law firm of Peter Angelos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm began suing Pfizer in Pennsylvania state courts in
1999, saying the company was legally responsible for some claims
because its logo appeared on Quigley products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer says it played no role in making or selling the
Quigley products. A federal appeals court in New York said the
claims against Pfizer could go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration urged the high court to reject
Pfizer&#8217;s appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
Supreme Court case is Pfizer v. Law Offices of Peter Angelos,
12-300. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of New York
Mellon Corp. are the two U.S. banks likely to have the largest
capital shortfall if regulators double the so-called leverage
ratio without exempting cash and government bonds, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. analysts wrote in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Tier 1 leverage ratio is about 4.5 percent
and Bank of New York&#8217;s 3.9 percent, the farthest behind the 6
percent requirement said to be under consideration, Goldman
Sachs analysts led by Richard Ramsden said today in a note. The
average Tier 1 leverage ratio for large banks is 5.5 percent,
the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators are considering doubling the amount of
capital the largest banks must hold to 6 percent of total
assets, four people with knowledge of the talks said last week.
Last year, rulemakers proposed implementing a 3 percent
international requirement for what&#8217;s known as the simple
leverage ratio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bank of New York and Morgan Stanley screen as outliers as
outsized cash/repo books meaningfully inflate their asset
bases,&#8221; the analysts wrote. Both companies are based in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
forecasts for gold through 2014 after selling quickened as
investors priced in expectations of reduced asset purchases by
the U.S. Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank cut its target for the end of this year to $1,300
an ounce from $1,435 and lowered its prediction to $1,050 from
$1,270 for the end of 2014. Investors are assuming an earlier
tapering of quantitative easing and a Fed fund rate increase
sooner than the bank&#8217;s economists expect, analysts Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold has fallen 23 percent this year, heading for the
biggest annual drop since 1981, as speculation increased that
the Fed would pare monetary stimulus that helped the metal cap a
12-year bull run last year. Prices slumped to the lowest since
September 2010 last week after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
the central bank may slow its bond-buying program if the U.S.
economy continues to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The momentum in gold prices leaves risk to current prices
as skewed to the downside,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;Medium term,
we expect that gold prices will decline further given our U.S.
economists&#8217; forecast for improving economic activity and a less
accommodative monetary policy stance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold for August delivery on the Comex in New York slid 0.7
percent to $1,282.60 an ounce as of 1:41 p.m. in Singapore after
tumbling to $1,268.70 on June 21, the least expensive since
Sept. 16, 2010. Investors sold 533.3 metric tons from bullion-backed exchange-traded products this year, wiping out more than
$54 billion from the value of the funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ETP Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holdings in ETPs declined to 2,098.605 tons on June 21, the
least since February 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Assets are down 20 percent in 2013 after climbing
every year since the first product was listed in 2003. Goldman
expects ETPs to decline at a steady pace of 1 million ounces a
month, &#8220;slightly below their recent pace but twice as fast as
we had previously expected,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman joins Credit Suisse Group AG and Societe Generale
SA in predicting further declines. Prices will drop to an
average of $1,200 in the fourth quarter, Societe Generale
forecasts. Credit Suisse sees the metal at $1,100 in 12 months,
according to Ric Deverell, head of commodities research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, when gold entered a bear market, a buying frenzy
from China to India and the U.S. followed the biggest price drop
in 30 years, driving prices up more than $150 an ounce. Russia
and South Korea were among nations that added gold to reserves
this year, after central banks around the world bought 534.6
tons last year, the most since 1964, according to World Gold
Council estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to expect that continued central bank gold
buying will not be sufficient to offset this decline in
prices,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;Further, we would expect this
decline in prices to coincide with rising jewelry demand, which
we view as price responsive and not price setting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in Los Angeles
strengthened for the first time in four days as Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Torrance refinery was said to be running at about 66
percent capacity as the crude unit prepares to restart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance plant in Southern
California is waiting to return parts of the crude unit, shut
since June 19, to service and will run at reduced rates until
the equipment is restarted, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. The unit, shut
last week to repair a metallurgical issue, is expected to take
about two days to return, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles, rose
0.5 cent to a premium of 20 cents a gallon over futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg at 4:11 p.m. New York time. Prompt-delivery of the
fuel climbed 0.27 cent to $2.9248 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gesuina Paras, an Exxon spokeswoman at the Torrance
refinery, declined by e-mail today to comment on the status of
the crude unit work. She said June 20 that other equipment at
the refinery would run at reduced rates during the repairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro Corp. (TSO)&#8217;s 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson refinery in
Southern California was running normally yesterday after planned
maintenance, Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at the company&#8217;s
headquarters, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco tumbled 7 cents to a premium of 8.5
cents a gallon, the lowest level in almost three weeks. The
discount for Carbob in San Francisco versus the fuel in Los
Angeles widened 7.5 cents to 11.5 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chevron Richmond &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) started a co-generation plant at the 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond refinery in Northern California yesterday,
a notice to Contra Costa County regulators shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro&#8217;s 170,000-barrel-a-day Golden Eagle refinery near
San Francisco also reported a unit startup June 23, a separate
notice to the county shows. The plant was operating normally
today, Barbee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail gasoline in California slipped 0.4 cent to $4.063 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation&#8217;s largest
motoring organization, said today on its website. Prices are up
from $3.845 a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of Californians traveling at least 50 miles for
the July 4 holiday is expected to decline to about 4.7 million
this year, a 0.7 percent drop from a year earlier, according to
AAA Northern California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for spot, conventional gasoline in Portland,
Oregon, was unchanged at a premium of 15 cents a gallon.
Portland gasoline&#8217;s discount to Los Angeles Carbob widened 0.5
cent to 5 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles narrowed a fourth
day, losing 17 cents to $17.43 a barrel at 4:13 p.m. New York
time. The spread, a rough indicator of short-term refining
margins, is down 47 percent from this year&#8217;s high of $32.74 a
gallon reached on June 19. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley lowered its forecasts
for gold, joining Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG in paring
estimates on prospects that the U.S. Federal Reserve will scale
back monetary stimulus as the economy recovers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank cut its 2013 target to $1,409 an ounce from
$1,487, reduced its prediction for 2014 to $1,313 from $1,563,
and trimmed its 2015 estimate to $1,300 from $1,450. Morgan
Stanley also lowered its gold and silver forecasts through 2018,
analysts Peter Richardson and Joel Crane wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts from BNP Paribas SA to Standard Bank Plc are
cutting their outlook for gold as the precious metal heads for
its biggest annual drop in more than three decades. Bullion has
fallen 24 percent in 2013 after rallying for 12 years, slumping
to the lowest level since September 2010 last week after Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central bank may slow its
bond-buying program if the U.S. economy continues to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With investor demand for safe-haven assets waning against
the backdrop of a strengthening U.S. dollar and rising U.S. bond
yields, market conditions for gold and silver have become
markedly less favorable,&#8221; Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1,276.09
today after tumbling to $1,269.46 on June 21, the cheapest since
Sept. 16, 2010. Investors sold 541.5 metric tons from bullion-backed exchange-traded products this year, erasing $56 billion
from the value of the funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ETP Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holdings in ETPs declined to 2,090.4 tons yesterday, the
least since June 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Assets are down 21 percent in 2013 after climbing every year
since the first product was listed in 2003, as waning investor
faith turned more serious, said Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This historic and fundamental change in one of the key
drivers of the gold bull market is highlighting a sharp decline
in the desirability of this form of investment,&#8221; Richardson and
Crane wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which expects ETPs to decline at a steady pace of
1 million ounces a month, cut its 2013 year-end price target to
$1,300 from $1,435 and lowered the 2014 prediction to $1,050
from $1,270. Investors are assuming an earlier tapering of
quantitative easing and a Fed fund rate increase sooner than the
bank&#8217;s economists expect, analysts Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a June 23 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernanke said on June 19 that the central bank, which buys
$85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt each month, may begin
reducing purchases this year and end the program in 2014. This
will keep gold prices under pressure, according to James Steel
and Howard Wen at HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., who yesterday
reduced their 2013 forecast to $1,396 from $1,542 and trimmed
their 2014 estimate to $1,435 from $1,600. Credit Suisse Group
Inc. lowered its estimates today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The initiative will provide water experts with a real-time intelligent dashboard to harness information so it can be

&lt;p&gt;Is the house that Windows built reinventing itself as an ad giant? At an advertising industry confab in Cannes last week, Microsoft constructed a huge white box on the beach just off the city&#8217;s Promenade de la Croisette boardwalk to woo executives from hundreds of companies, like Coca-Cola and Toyota Motor, and ad agencies such as Publicis Groupe. The point was to show off Microsoft's latest technologies -- and emphasize what great advertising vehicles they make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's the new Xbox One, which will hit stores in November. The video-game console uses its built-in camera to detect a person&#8217;s heart rate, whether she's happy, and which muscles are doing the most work during exercise games. And of course, Microsoft was quick to point out the ad space available on the home screen where users choose games, films, music and television channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second display featured a retail service that lets home shoppers see 3-D images of housewares like lamps and sofas in different colors and shapes, which can be saved to a wish list. When you enter a store, the application downloads the list of that company&#8217;s products to your phone. And if you&#8217;re out at the mall while your partner is at home, you can video chat to choose the stuff you want. Once you&#8217;ve finally agreed what to buy, you can pay for it using the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and 7-Eleven Inc.
sued Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) over card fees after
rejecting a multibillion-dollar settlement in an antitrust case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retailers and about 30 others filed a lawsuit in
federal court in Manhattan against the card companies and
several major banks. The companies are among more than 7,000
that have dropped out of the $7.25 billion accord over the fees,
which are borne by merchants when customers use credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once Visa and MasterCard acquired substantial market
power over merchants, they maintained it by forcing merchants to
pay even higher interchange fees to continue to fund these
price-fixing schemes,&#8221; the retailers said in the complaint
filed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, under consideration by a federal judge in
Brooklyn, New York, would put to rest about eight years of
litigation in the nationwide suit. Dozens of retailers have said
they&#8217;re opposed to the accord because it would give Visa and
MasterCard too much freedom to raise rates in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These same tired arguments were already raised repeatedly
over the course of the litigation,&#8221; Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman
for the Electronic Payments Coalition, which represents card
companies and banks, said in a statement. &#8220;Had these arguments
had any merit or strength, they would have been included in the
final settlement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Retailers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other retailers that dropped out of the settlement have
also filed their own lawsuits, including  CVS Pharmacy Inc. (CVS) and
a group led by Target Corp. (TGT) and Macy&#8217;s Inc. (M) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa sued Wal-Mart Stores Inc. this month over concerns
that the world&#8217;s largest retailer would also file a separate
swipe-fee complaint. The payment network said in a complaint
that it wanted to prevent &#8220;the continuation of endless,
wasteful litigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is 7-Eleven Inc. v. Visa Inc., 13-cv-4442, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB) is building an application for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Windows 8, adding one of the most popular programs missing from the operating system designed to help the software maker gain tablet customers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flipboard Inc., which lets users combine articles into a digital magazine, and the National Football League will also create apps for Windows 8, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said at a conference today in San Francisco. There are now more than 100,000 apps for Windows 8. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft commanded just 3.7 percent of the tablet market in the first quarter as a lack of some high-profile features, including a Facebook app, limited the appeal of Windows 8 and the software maker&#8217;s Surface tablet. Twitter&#8217;s app for Windows 8 was released in March. Microsoft is courting developers and adding features to Windows 8 to gain share in a tablet market dominated by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft today released a test version of its Windows 8.1 software, which restores some old Windows features, like a start button and rolls out new ones in a bid to reignite interest in its flagship operating system. Some customers had complained about the software&#8217;s usability without the familiar start button. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The finished version of Windows 8.1 will be available later this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flipboard plans to release its app, and a version for Windows Phone, later this year, Eric Feng, chief technology officer for the developer, said in an interview. The NFL program is a fantasy football app. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s shares rose 2 percent to $34.35 at the close in New York, leaving them up 29 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- Editors: Lisa Rapaport, Niamh Ring &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s long-anticipated Office Mobile app for Apple (AAPL)&#8217;s iOS operating system turns out to be a total non-event. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever since the iPhone ushered in the era of ubiquitous mobile computing -- and especially since the release of the first iPad began a shift away from traditional personal computers -- the question has been whether and how Microsoft Office would adapt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here&#8217;s the answer: Grudgingly, and not very well. Office Mobile, which slipped into Apple&#8217;s App Store with little fanfare, turns out to be a stripped-down add-on that will leave both Office and Apple users wondering, &#8220;Is that all there is?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Office Mobile is technically free. But it&#8217;s useless unless you&#8217;ve already paid at least $100 for a year of Office 365, Microsoft (MSFT)&#8217;s effort to convert its traditional shrink-wrapped, purchase-one-time-only software business into a pay-as-you-go subscription model. (By contrast, the version of Office Mobile included on devices running Microsoft&#8217;s own Windows Phone software doesn&#8217;t require an Office 365 subscription.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s just one of the limitations the company has imposed on its iOS app. Another is that it&#8217;s intended only for the iPhone; there&#8217;s no separate version designed to take advantage of the iPad&#8217;s larger display. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. praised the U.S. Supreme Court after a ruling
today that struck down a federal law that denies benefits to
same-sex married couples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is good for our company and clients, but more
importantly, it&#8217;s the right thing to do,&#8221; JPMorgan Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a statement from the New
York-based bank, the largest in the U.S. by assets. &#8220;The rights
of all people are important and must be protected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court overturned by a 5-4 majority the U.S. Defense of
Marriage Act, rejecting many of the justifications for treating
same-sex and heterosexual couples differently. The court also
reinstated a judge&#8217;s order allowing gay marriages in California,
the nation&#8217;s largest state by population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the biggest financial firms have criticized
prohibitions of same-sex marriage, saying the measures could
make it harder to recruit staff. Insurer Chubb Corp., which
highlights the benefits it offers to domestic partners, said in
2011 that DOMA &#8220;imposes burdens&#8221; on businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marriage equality lowers burdens and challenges imposed
on employers, and will lead to building successful businesses
and a strong American economy,&#8221; New York-based Goldman Sachs
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We strongly support the Supreme
Court&#8217;s affirmation today of marriage equality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s non-operating Quigley
Co. can end almost nine years in bankruptcy under a plan that
will resolve most asbestos claims against the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker and its former maker of insulation products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in Manhattan today
approved a Chapter 11 plan under which Pfizer will contribute
assets worth $964 million. He rejected a prior plan almost three
years ago, saying Pfizer was improperly using Quigley&#8217;s
bankruptcy to shield itself from asbestos claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein found in September 2010 that Pfizer&#8217;s proposed
$216.2 million contribution to a prior plan wasn&#8217;t enough
considering court testimony that Quigley may face $4.45 billion
in claims over 42 years, and that asbestos claimants could have
fared better by suing the company under civil tort law. A
company reorganizing in bankruptcy is shielded from lawsuits,
including tort, or wrongful-injury claims. Once it emerges, it
is a new legal entity, and often can no longer be sued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley, which made asbestos-containing products from the
1940s to the 1970s, including Insulag, a powdered insulation,
was bought by Pfizer in 1968. It stopped most operations in 1992
and filed for bankruptcy in 2004, facing 160,000 lawsuits. Many
also named Pfizer, whose name appeared on Insulag packaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has said throughout the case that it never made or
sold Quigley&#8217;s products and it doesn&#8217;t have liability for them.
Asbestos, once widely used as an insulator, was later shown to
cause cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Objection &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Trustee, a bankruptcy watchdog for the Justice
Department, sought to have the case thrown out in 2010, saying
that while it&#8217;s pending, creditors with alleged asbestos-related
health problems have been unable to sue New York-based Pfizer,
and many have died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilentz, Goldman  Spitzer was the sole objector to the
current plan. The Woodbridge, New Jersey-based law firm called
it yet another flawed plan after &#8220;nine years of afflicted
deals&#8221; in which Pfizer has tried to buy votes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-bk-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The appeals
case is 11-2635, 11-2767, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KKR  Co. (KKR) has named four banks
including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) to manage
an initial public offering of French floor maker Tarkett SA,
according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG and Bank of America Corp. have also been
selected, the people said, asking not to be identified as the
process isn&#8217;t public. The IPO could raise about 500 million
euros ($651 million) and is planned for the second half of the
year, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR, the private-equity firm run by Henry Kravis and George
Roberts, sought to sell its 50 percent stake in Tarkett this
year in a deal that would have valued the firm at as much as
$3.8 billion, people familiar said March 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarkett, which manufactures and sells PVC, wood, laminate,
sports and other specialty flooring products, increased sales 11
percent to 2.3 billion euros in 2012, helped by acquisitions and
demand in Eastern Europe, Asia and North America. The company,
based in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, has been jointly owned by
KKR and the Deconinck family since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for KKR, Bank of America, JPMorgan, HSBC and
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on any process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, said it will buy back $10 billion in stock after
earlier this week announcing it will retire about $11.4 billion
in shares through the spinoff of its animal-health unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buyback is the fourth major share repurchase program
for New York-based Pfizer in the past 2 1/2 years. During that
time, the company has announced $39 billion in share buybacks,
including today&#8217;s. Pfizer has $3.9 billion left on its current
repurchase program, the company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Read, Pfizer&#8217;s chief executive officer, has said that
share repurchases are the best uses of Pfizer&#8217;s cash, compared
with acquisitions or increasing the dividend. Read has shed non-drug units to focus on developing and selling new, brand-name
therapies. The company, which had a market capitalization of
about $200 billion as of today&#8217;s close, is looking at whether it
will split itself and get rid of its generics drug business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer earlier this week announced the completion of a deal
to exchange shares of its own stock for equity in Zoetis Inc. (ZTS),
its former animal-health unit. That exchange is expected to
retire about $11.4 billion in Pfizer shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares gained 1.4 percent to $28.58 in extended
trading at 5:35 p.m. New York time after the buyback was
announced. The company&#8217;s stock has increased 25 percent in the
past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong stocks are set for the biggest decline among developed markets this half as concern about China&#8217;s economy drives valuations 22 percent below the five-year average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Index tumbled 9.8 percent in 2013, trailing the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index by the most in 15 years and wiping more than $145 billion from the value of shares. The losses dragged the gauge&#8217;s valuation to 9.7 times estimates earnings, compared with a five-year average of 12.5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. say Hong Kong stocks may get even cheaper as a manufacturing slowdown in China collides with the worst cash shortage in a decade. The waning outlook for the world&#8217;s second-biggest economy is exacerbating declines spurred by the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s plan to dial back unprecedented stimulus measures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait for a better entry point,&#8221; Grace Tam, a Hong Kong-based global market strategist at JPMorgan, which oversees about $1.5 trillion, said in a phone interview. &#8220;China&#8217;s data continues to be weak. They&#8217;re not going to do any stimulus because they now want to focus on structural reforms and controlling credit activity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Index&#8217;s drop, the biggest among 24 developed equity markets tracked by Bloomberg, compares with an 12 percent climb for the SP 500. That&#8217;s the Asian gauge&#8217;s worst relative performance since the first half of 1998, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp (MSFT)., which for decades has refreshed its popular Office corporate software just once about every three years, says it will soon switch to weekly updates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a radical shift as Microsoft overhauls its Internet-based programs, seeking to stay in sync with the fast-changing technology industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For much of Microsoft&#8217;s 38-year history, infrequent upgrades made sense for businesses seeking predictable improvements. That&#8217;s changed as nimbler entrants such as Dropbox Inc., Box Inc., Jive Software Inc (JIVE) (JIVE). and Google Inc. refine features and deliver automatic updates over the Web. That tinkering has helped lure customers and put pressure on margins at Microsoft&#8217;s biggest division, which accounted for $24 billion in sales last year, or a third of the total. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft, on this every-three-year schedule for the massive wave of new products, looks like a dinosaur,&#8221; said Melissa Webster, an analyst at market-research firm IDC, based in Framingham, Massachusetts. &#8220;Three years is a lifetime in tech these days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That message has gotten through. Within a year, users of Internet-based versions of Office productivity software, as well as e-mail, telephony and collaboration tools, will have parts of their software refreshed weekly, Jeff Teper, an Office vice president, said in an interview. Microsoft has been moving toward more frequent updates with other programs, including Windows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accenture Plc (ACN), the world&#8217;s second-largest technology-consulting company, tumbled the most in
almost two years after its sales forecast trailed analysts&#8217;
estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock fell 10 percent to $71.96 at 4 p.m. in New York
trading, the biggest decline since August 2011. The plunge
dragged down stocks of rivals, including International Business
Machines Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accenture is grappling with a change in the behavior of its
clients, who in recent quarters have been deferring decisions on
short-term contracts and favoring longer-range information-technology projects. That means investors have to get used to
waiting for the revenue to show up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve got this continuous strength in bookings but this
inability to gain traction on revenue, and it&#8217;s becoming a
growing concern,&#8217; said Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones 
Co. in Des Peres, Missouri. &#8216;&#8216;The fourth quarter is going to be
a challenge, and the trend could play out into their next fiscal
year.&#8221; Olson has a hold rating on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM slipped 2.3 percent to $191.11.  Before today,
Accenture, which ranks second to IBM in consulting revenue, had
jumped 21 percent this year through yesterday, outperforming
IBM&#8217;s gain of 2.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal fourth-quarter revenue will be $6.7 billion to $7
billion, Dublin-based Accenture yesterday in a statement. That
fell short of the $7.36 billion average estimate of analysts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Missing Guidance&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income attributable to Accenture rose 18
percent to $810.3 million, or $1.21 a share, from $689.2
million, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. Excluding a reduction
in reorganization liabilities, earnings were $1.14 a share in
the period, which ended in May. Analysts had predicted $1.13 on
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve had some areas of our business where the activity
is much different than we would have expected, some of which
would have been tough to predict,&#8221; David Rowland, Accenture&#8217;s
new chief financial officer, said on a conference call. &#8220;We are
not in the business of missing guidance and we don&#8217;t find that
to be acceptable, so that would not be our expectation going
forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accenture is considered a bellwether for the information-technology market because its earnings cycle ends one month
sooner than competitors. Revenue for the quarter was $7.2
billion, missing the $7.43 billion analysts had predicted on
average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Early Look &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We always want to get an update from them on the overall
IT services spending environment,&#8221; said Jason Kupferberg, an
analyst at Jefferies LLC in New York. &#8220;The numbers have not
looked great.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is seeking to boost growth by expanding its
Accenture Interactive division, which caters to chief marketing
officers who want to improve their investments in Internet
outreach. Accenture announced plans in May to spend $316 million
to buy Hong Kong-based marketing company Acquity Group Ltd. (AQ) to
bolster the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, is scheduled to report its
earnings in three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index snapping a streak of seven monthly gains, as comments from Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy Stein spurred concern the central bank may begin to reduce stimulus in September. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Accenture Plc (ACN), the world&#8217;s second-largest technology-consulting company, slumped 10 percent after its quarterly sales forecast missed analysts&#8217; estimates. International Business Machines Corp. lost 2.3 percent for the biggest retreat in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. (INDU) BlackBerry, the Canadian smartphone maker, fell the most in 12 years after reporting a surprise quarterly loss. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 (SPX) fell 0.4 percent to 1,606.28 at 4 p.m. in New York. The index extended today&#8217;s decline into the close of trading as investors adjusted positions at end of the quarter. The Dow lost 114.89 points, or 0.8 percent, to 14,909.60 today. About 10.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 53 percent above the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are hearing all these various Fed governors speak and the message they&#8217;re trying to send isn&#8217;t necessarily any clearer than what was talked about by Bernanke last week,&#8221; Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners LLC, said by phone. His firm manages about $1.4 billion. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t really seen a reason to step up to be a buyer on the pullback we had and I didn&#8217;t see a lot of follow through at least on the institutional level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 yesterday capped the biggest three-day rally since early January on better-than-estimated economic data and assurances on stimulus efforts from Fed officials. Stein said today the central bank is providing more clarity about how it will wind down its $85 billion in monthly bond buying as unemployment falls toward 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Primary Weight&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the Fed makes a decision to begin reducing purchases in September, Stein said in New York, &#8220;it will give primary weight to the large stock of news that has accumulated since the inception of the program and will not be unduly influenced by whatever data releases arrive in the few weeks before the meeting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fed Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker, who dissented against additional stimulus at every Fed meeting last year, said financial markets will remain volatile as policy makers debate how and when to curtail the central bank&#8217;s asset purchases program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;VIX Increase &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, the measure of options on the SP 500 known as the VIX, has climbed 49 percent since hitting a six-year low in March. The gauge was unchanged at 16.86 today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has rallied 13 percent so far this year, the best performance since a 17 percent gain in the first six months of 1998. It has dropped 3.8 percent since May 21 as Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled the central bank could taper quantitative easing as the economy improves. The gauge slid 1.5 percent in June, its first monthly decline since October. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Business activity in the U.S. cooled more than projected in June, a regional report showed. The MNI Chicago Report&#8217;s business barometer dropped to 51.6 from 58.7 in May, which was the highest in more than a year. A reading of 50 is the dividing line between expansion and contraction. The median forecast of 55 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 55. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consumer sentiment fell less than forecast in June from an almost six-year high a month earlier. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan said its final index of confidence eased to 84.1 this month from 84.5 at the end of May, which was the highest since July 2007. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 83 in the gauge after a preliminary reading of 82.7. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Continued Volatility &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised to see some pullback from three days of strength,&#8221; Michael James, a managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles, said in an interview. &#8220;But bulls are still not willing to let things come in too much with the end of quarter today. Only thing we can count on for the rest of today and next week is continued trader-driven volatility, in both directions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. stock trading accelerated into the close, with about 3.8 billion shares, or 38 percent of today&#8217;s total, changing hands after 3:59 p.m. Trading volume averaged about 7.1 billion shares this month, the busiest since November 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The volume figure got a boost today as Russell Investments concluded the annual revisions to its equity benchmark gauges. Russell&#8217;s annual revisions usually spur one of the busiest sessions of the year. Today&#8217;s total was the second highest in 2013 after 10.8 billion shares changed hands June 21, an options expiration day. Last year&#8217;s reconstitution on June 22 helped fuel a jump in volume to 9.73 billion shares, the highest total of the year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Russell Reconstitution &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Russell&#8217;s global stock indexes, including the Russell 1000 Index and the Russell 2000 Index, are used as benchmarks for $4.1 trillion in assets, according to the company&#8217;s website. In three of the previous four years, the reconstitution day ranked in the top 20 busiest trading sessions, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health-care shares and phone companies fell the most today, losing more than 0.7 percent, as eight of 10 industries retreated. Energy stocks and companies that rely on consumer discretionary spending gained, adding at least 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Accenture tumbled 10 percent to $71.96 after saying fiscal fourth-quarter revenue will be $6.7 billion to $7 billion. That fell short of the $7.36 billion average estimate of analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. IBM (INDU), the world&#8217;s largest seller of computer services, fell 2.3 percent to $191.11. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;BlackBerry Sales &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry (BBRY) fell 28 percent to $10.46, the biggest decline since April 2000. The company reported a quarterly loss and lower-than-projected sales, hurt by sluggish demand and currency restrictions in Venezuela. The loss in the three months through June 1 was 13 cents a share, excluding some items. Analysts had estimated a profit of 8 cents on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Molycorp Inc., a producer of rare-earth minerals, jumped 11 percent to $6.20. The company said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recommended no enforcement action be taken after completing an investigation into Molycorp&#8217;s public disclosures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft in New York at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department is
stalling a regulatory investigation of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s
business dealings with convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff,
an inspector general told lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Thorson, the Treasury Department&#8217;s internal watchdog,
wrote to lawmakers on June 20 to complain that the Justice
Department&#8217;s civil division hasn&#8217;t acted to move the case
forward despite his request for assistance &#8220;many weeks&#8221; ago,
making it impossible to resolve &#8220;an important issue involving
one of the country&#8217;s largest financial institutions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department doesn&#8217;t comment publicly on internal
deliberations. An official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the agency is continuing to review the complex legal issues
involved and hasn&#8217;t shelved the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flap arises from an inquiry by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, a part of the Treasury, which has
been reviewing JPMorgan&#8217;s ties to Madoff. The former investment
adviser maintained accounts with the bank for two decades before
confessing to running a fraud that caused investors to lose
about $17 billion in principal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thorson stepped into the fray when he was asked late last
year by the OCC to make sure that JPMorgan wasn&#8217;t impeding their
investigation by withholding some documents under attorney-client privilege. The inspector general worked out an agreement
with the bank that would allow a federal judge to review the
documents and decide whether the privilege was properly invoked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Electric Co. (GE) is seeking
buyers for its CareCredit health-care financing division in a
sale that may fetch $1 billion, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to solicit
bids, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the process is private. Second-round bids for CareCredit, part
of GE Capital, were submitted about a month ago, one of the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling CareCredit would extend Chief Executive Officer
Jeffrey Immelt&#8217;s efforts to shrink GE Capital as he boosts
profit from industrial products such as locomotives and jet
engines. GE Capital faces heightened regulatory scrutiny from
the Federal Reserve, which identified it as a potential risk to
the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell Wilkerson, a spokesman for GE Capital, declined to
comment in an e-mail. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CareCredit is the largest issuer of consumer health-care
financing in the U.S., according to the New York Attorney
General&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE Capital had $538 billion in assets as of March 31,
larger than all but six U.S. banks, according to data compiled
by the Fed. The unit&#8217;s $45 billion in revenue was 31 percent of
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE&#8217;s total sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential sale was reported earlier by Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hachette Book Group agreed to buy
Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s Hyperion, a 22-year-old publisher of books
such as Mitch Albom&#8217;s &#8220;The Five People You Meet in Heaven.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the deal is completed, Hachette will become the
publisher of the more than 1,000 books for adult readers that
Hyperion has put out since it was started in 1991, according to
a statement today. Disney will continue to publish Disney-Hyperion branded kids&#8217; books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction gives Hachette more than 250 best-selling
works, including &#8220;Always Looking Up&#8221; by Michael J. Fox and
&#8220;Jamie&#8217;s Food Revolution&#8221; by chef Jamie Oliver. Hyperion also
is scheduled to publish about 25 new books that Hachette will
now oversee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hyperion&#8217;s strong nonfiction list in particular is a

&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter LLP is closing its
San Diego office at the end of the law firm&#8217;s fiscal year,
leaving about two-thirds of the 34 lawyers and staff without a
job on Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four partners, six other lawyers and 12 staff members will
be let go, Lee Feldman, a firm spokesman, said today in an e-mail. The remainder will be offered opportunities to relocate or
pursue other work arrangements. The office has six partners, 12
associates and 16 staff members, according to a memo by Chairman
Regina M. Pisa and managing partner Robert S. Insolia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When we opened the office in March 2007, we envisioned
that the San Diego office would be a significant source of
corporate transactional work, particularly in the life sciences
and biotech areas,&#8221; Pisa and Insolia said in the memo. &#8220;While
this was the case initially, and while these practices have
continued to grow nationally at the firm, we haven&#8217;t been able
to realize our initial vision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some law firms are trimming payrolls because of a slowdown
in business since the 2008 financial meltdown and competition
from lower-cost legal-service providers. Weil, Gotshal  Manges
LLP, based in New York, said this week that it will fire 60
salaried lawyers and 110 staff and cut some partners&#8217; pay.
Patton Boggs LLP, based in Washington, fired 65 employees in
March, including 22 associates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;California Sites &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter said in the memo that it plans to build the
firm&#8217;s life sciences and biotechnology practice in California
through its three other offices in the state -- in Los Angeles,
San Francisco and Silicon Valley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boston-based firm was ranked 39th on the American
Lawyer magazine&#8217;s list of wealthiest U.S. law firms with
$715.5 million in gross revenue last year, a 2.9 percent
increase from the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Diego closing will leave Goodwin Procter with about
800 lawyers at eight offices in the U.S., London and Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 31 percent of clients who
employ corporate counsel recommend their primary law firm, down
from 36 percent last year and 42 percent two years ago, BTI
consulting Group found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Secondary law firms providing better customer service and
showing a willingness to adjust to client needs are gaining
ground the fastest on primary law firm turf,&#8221; the consulting
group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusions of the survey, in its 13th year, resulted
from 300 interviews with chief legal officers and general
counsel at Fortune 1000 companies and large organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those surveyed reported their dissatisfaction with their
primary law firm because of their inflexibility and
unwillingness to do anything other than what is asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTI found that 48 percent of corporate clients replaced one
of their two primary firms in 2012, an increase from 39 percent
in 2010. The new work went to a firm that had been in a
secondary role, BTI said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Duane Morris Names Pittsburgh Office Managing Partner &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duane Morris LLP appointed Kenneth M. Argentieri managing
partner of the firm&#8217;s Pittsburgh office. Argentieri succeeds
George Medved, who has held the role since the office opened in
2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentieri, a litigation partner, has been vice-chairman of
the products liability and toxic torts division of the trial
practice group. He&#8217;s handled defamation, environmental,
securities, class action and commercial law, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pittsburgh office handles domestic and international
clients in construction, products liability, commercial and
bankruptcy litigation, as well as corporate legal matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since joining us in 2007, Ken has played an increasingly
substantial part in shaping the Pittsburgh office&#8217;s strategic
focus and has proven himself to be a talented and market-savvy
lawyer,&#8221; Duane Morris chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Soroko said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duane Morris has more than 700 attorneys in 24 offices in
the U.S., London and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuatrecasas Names Baena to Head Spanish Law Firm&#8217;s London Office &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuatrecasas, Gon&#231;alves Pereira, a Spanish law firm
specializing in corporate clients with about 950 lawyers, named
Antonio Baena to head its office in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baena, who will focus on mergers and acquisitions and
corporate finance, takes over from managing partner Inigo Rubio,
who will return to the firm&#8217;s main office in Madrid, Cuatrecasas
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baena has worked in the securities markets and has been a
legal adviser for Spain&#8217;s Frob bank bailout fund and for Sareb,
its so-called bad bank that absorbed troubled assets from
nationalized banks, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transaction and Regulatory Lawyer John Williams Joins Milbank &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milbank, Tweed, Hadley  McCloy&#160;LLP said&#160;John Williams, who
focuses on complex transactional and regulatory work in the
derivatives space, has joined as a partner in New York. He was
formerly a partner in the New York office of Allen  Overy LLP,
where he was head of its U.S. derivatives practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams advises clients on derivatives products and on the
cross-border implications of U.S. derivatives regulations
enacted in response to the financial crisis, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;John saw the financial crisis as the game-changing event
it was, and realized that a top-tier transactional practice
would now depend on offering comprehensive regulatory counsel as
well,&#8221; Milbank Chairman&#160;Scott Edelman said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among his past work, Williams was principal U.S. counsel to
the International Swaps and Derivatives Association in its
revisions to the credit derivatives product in 2009. He has also
advised clearing members of ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear
Europe, as they have dealt with the derivatives clearing mandate
under Dodd-Frank and the related regulation, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the regulatory ground continues to shift within the
derivatives industry, I looked for a firm with a premier
financial practice that could provide the room for growth that
the derivatives field demands,&#8221; Williams said in a statement
about Milbank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milbank has 600 lawyers at 11 offices in the Americas,
Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goodwin Procter Adds to Securities  White Collar Groups &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant P. Fondo&#160;has joined Goodwin Procter LLP&#8217;s Silicon
Valley office as a partner in the securities litigation and
white collar defense group. He was previously with the U.S.
Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Northern District of California, where
he was an assistant U.S. attorney in the criminal division for
almost five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fondo will focus on representing technology, life sciences
and venture capital clients in litigation and investigative
matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his time as an AUSA, Fondo prosecuted white-collar
crime -- including investment, bank and securities fraud -- as
well as drug trafficking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwin&#8217;s&#160;Silicon Valley office&#160;opened in 2007 and has more
than 50 attorneys who handle business law and litigation
services in private equity, venture capital, technology and life
sciences, intellectual property, SEC investigations, and labor
and employment matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter has 860 lawyers at nine offices in the
U.S., Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Davidoff Hutcher Adds Partner to Head International Practice &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davidoff Hutcher  Citron LLP said Judith Joan Sullivan
joined the firm as a partner and chairwoman of its international
practice group.&#160;She was formerly at Anderson Kill  Olick PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sullivan will continue her New York/New Jersey corporate
law practice which focuses on mergers and acquisitions
counseling, commercial transactions, board governance,
shareholder rights, securities law and private equity
investments, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her past work has included handling matters for Emirates
Airlines, Honeywell International, KPMG, Quest Diagnostics and
TD Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davidoff Hutcher has over 50 attorneys at four U.S.
offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Terance A. Gonsalves Joins Katten&#8217;s Litigation Practice &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP announced that Terance A.
Gonsalves joined the firm in Chicago as a partner in the
litigation practice. He was formerly vice-president and deputy
general counsel of litigation for Career Education Corp., an
educational services company that provides post-secondary
education options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gonsalves will focus his practice on complex litigation,
regulatory and compliance matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katten has more than 600 attorneys at offices in the U.S.,
London and Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BP Has Buyer&#8217;s Remorse Over Spill Accord as Law Firms Circle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until this year, Tampa attorney Kevin McLean specialized in
suing nursing homes for neglecting patients. In January he
switched the focus of his practice to a fund BP Plc (BP/) established
to compensate business losses from the 2010 oil spill in the
Gulf of Mexico, Bloomberg Businessweek&#8217;s Paul Barrett reports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its attempt to dilute a legal and public-relations mess
of epic proportions, BP began paying claims within weeks of the
disaster and has so far spent more than $25&#160;billion for cleanup
and compensation. That hasn&#8217;t stemmed demands for more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installation last year of a particularly generous
claims administrator prompted scores of additional plaintiffs&#8217;
attorneys to swarm onto the scene, signing up a new wave of
clients, many located far from the once-sullied shoreline. Just
five months after his pivot, McLean&#8217;s three-attorney firm has
260&#160;clients with claims ranging from $20,000 to $4&#160;million each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The craziest thing about the settlement,&#8221; he wrote in a
solicitation letter, &#8220;is that you can be compensated for losses
that are UNRELATED to the spill.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of McLean&#8217;s clients, a real estate agent in Brandon,
Florida, an hour from the Gulf of Mexico, wants $80,000 from
London-based BP, reflecting a revenue dip in 2010 that &#8220;had
nothing to do with the spill,&#8221; the attorney candidly admits.
The culprit was the bursting of the Florida real estate bubble.
Under the settlement, though, &#8220;that&#8217;s a good claim,&#8221; McLean
said, &#8220;and we&#8217;re going to get paid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has millions of reasons to be confident. A construction
company in northern Alabama, 200&#160;miles from the coast, was
recently awarded $9.7&#160;million, even though it does no work near
the Gulf, according to court records. Attorneys are submitting
claims on their own behalf. A law office in central Louisiana
that actually enjoyed improved profits in 2010 collected $3.3
million. The compensation process is confidential, so claimants&#8217;
identities aren&#8217;t a matter of public record, though the amounts
are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blowout of the Macondo well cost 11&#160;men their lives
and, according to the government, spewed 4&#160;million barrels of
oil into the Gulf. It shut down fisheries and despoiled beaches.
Oystermen and charter boat captains lost months and, in some
cases, years of work. While much of the Gulf economy has
recovered, degraded oil remains in coastal marshes in Louisiana.
Some ruined small businesses never reopened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weil, Gotshal  Manges LLP&#8217;s announcement this week it is
firing 60 associates and 110 support staffers, and cutting the
pay of about 30 partners, is the start of a wave of such
downsizings, according to law firm consultant Bruce MacEwen,
publisher of the blog Adam Smith, Esq. The cuts put Weil in a
stronger position, he says, but that&#8217;s not always the case. He
discusses how to tell if a firm is making cuts from a position

&lt;h2&gt;Global Cartel Fines Dip Before Libor, Car-Parts Penalties &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global criminal cartel fines dipped during the first part
of the year in a pause before hefty penalties are likely to be
imposed in probes of Libor and car parts, law firm Allen  Overy
LLP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penalties so far this year have totaled $677 million,
less than a fifth of the more than $5 billion levied during
2012, Allen  Overy said in a report yesterday. The drop-off was
most pronounced at the two biggest antitrust regulators, the
U.S. and European Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen  Overy partner John Terzaken said the EU is likely
to levy large fines later this year in probes of car parts and
the London interbank offered rate, where it lags behind its U.S.
colleagues. The U.S. and U.K. have already fined three banks
about $2.5 billion in the Libor probes and almost $1 billion in
fines have been issued in the U.S. and Japan in the
investigation of auto-parts makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There will be some judgments by the end of the year,&#8221;
said Terzaken, a former director of criminal enforcement at the
U.S. Department of Justice&#8217;s antitrust division. &#8220;They want to
show some momentum and keep the cases moving along.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. criminal antitrust fines in the first six months of
the year were $192 million, compared with $1.1 billion in all of
2012. The EU fines so far this year totalled $72 million,
compared with $2.3 billion in 2012, according to London-based
Allen  Overy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. and EU fines have slowed, regulators in
China, Australia, Brazil and South Africa are &#8220;coming into
their own,&#8221; Terzaken said. The South African regulator this
week issued a 1.46 billion rand ($146 million) penalty against
15 construction companies and China prosecuted an international
cartel for the first time, leading to a 353 million yuan ($57.4
million) fine against makers of liquid-crystal display panels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The antitrust practice has been global for a long time,
but it has become more global as the years have gone by,&#8221;
Terzaken said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Regulator&#8217;s Top Lawyer Recuses Himself From PGE Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Public Utilities Commission General Counsel
Frank Lindh recused himself as chief advisory attorney in
investigations into a PGE Corp. (PCG) pipeline explosion that killed
eight people in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindh will be replaced by retired CPUC assistant general
counsel Arocles Aguilar, according to an e-mailed statement from
the agency. Some CPUC lawyers working on the probes and proposed
penalties for PGE had asked to be reassigned, the regulator
said June 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL), the largest
bottler of the soft drink in Latin America, agreed to buy
Brazil&#8217;s Cia. Fluminense de Refrigerantes for $448 million in
cash to expand in the region&#8217;s largest country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase will bolster Coca-Cola (KO) Femsa&#8217;s Brazilian
business by linking two other areas it serves, clearing the way
for &#8220;the reconfiguration of the supply chain of our combined
operations,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Carlos Salazar said
yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fluminense deal caps a $4 billion acquisition spree in
the past two years by Mexico City-based Coca-Cola Femsa, which
also has purchased four Mexican bottlers and control of Coca-Cola Co.&#8217;s Philippines bottling operation. Fluminense, which was
founded in 1949 in the state of Rio de Janeiro, posted sales of
about $232 million in the year ending March 31, shipping 56.6
million unit cases of beverages, including beer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This acquisition highlights the long-term strategic
importance of the Brazilian market for Coca-Cola Femsa as we
believe in the attractive domestic consumption prospects and
socio-economic dynamics,&#8221; Salazar said in the statement. &#8220;This
transaction underscores our commitment to continue focusing on
the opportunities that the Latin American Coca-Cola bottling
system presents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa will seek to increase sales by offering a
broader range of products, adding coolers at retailers and
serving more points of sale, according to investor relations
chief Jose Castro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beverage Breakdown &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is subject to approval by Brazil&#8217;s antitrust
regulator, said Coca-Cola Femsa, which is controlled by
Monterrey, Mexico-based Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB. (FEMSAUBD) The
bottler also will seek approval from Atlanta-based Coca-Cola.
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter,
Castro said, and is being funded with the company&#8217;s existing
cash balances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluminense had an estimated $40 million in consolidated
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
in the 12 months ended March 31, Coca-Cola Femsa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With one bottling plant and four distribution centers, it
operates in parts of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais
states. Carbonated soft drinks make up 86 percent of its
business, with 8 percent coming from beer, 5 percent from non-carbonated beverages and 1 percent from water, Castro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa sold 494.2 million unit cases last year in
Brazil, up 1.8 percent from a year earlier, the company said
Feb. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
