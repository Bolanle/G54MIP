<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s biggest
software maker, said it settled an eight-year legal battle with
a Singapore company over a patent on technology to deter piracy. </p>
<p>Financial terms weren''t disclosed, said David Cuddy, a
Microsoft spokesman. The companies reached a final and
mutually agreeable resolution to a dispute begun in September
2003. A trial was under way before a federal jury in Providence,
Rhode Island, to determine how much Microsoft should pay Uniloc
USA Inc. and Uniloc Singapore Private Ltd. for infringing the
patent. </p>
<p>A different jury in 2009 had said Microsoft infringed the
Uniloc patent and awarded $388 million in damages. An appeals
court upheld the verdict and threw out the dollar figure, saying
it was fundamentally tainted by the numbers used at trial to
calculate how much Microsoft should pay. </p>
<p>The case concerned a Microsoft product known as
Clearinghouse that activates Microsoft programs including
Windows XP, Office XP, Office 2003 and Windows Server 2003. The
trial that began last week was to determine how much Microsoft
should pay to use the invention through Nov. 11, 2011, according
to court documents. </p>
<p>The patent covers a software registration system to deter
illegal copying. The user enters information, such as a serial
number, to determine whether the program is an authorized
version. </p>
<p>Uniloc has filed suit over the same patent against software
companies in federal court in Tyler, Texas, including Symantec
Corp. (SYMC) and Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) Some of those, including Adobe,
have reached settlement agreements. Uniloc Singapore owns the
patent and Uniloc USA is the exclusive licensee. </p>
<p>The court case is Uniloc USA Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.,
03cv440, U.S. District Court, District of Rhode Island
(Providence). </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) closed above $200 for the first time, driven higher as
technology companies seize leadership in the U.S. stock market
as the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index rally enters its fourth year. </p>
<p>IBM rose 0.9 percent today, crossing a level never before
seen when stock splits are factored in. The Armonk, New York-
based company has advanced 9.1 percent in 2012, and 140 percent
since the bull market for U.S. equities began on March 9, 2009.
Computer-related stocks in the SP 500 have climbed 15 percent
since the end of December, the most among 10 industries. </p>
<p>The world''s largest computer-services provider posted a
third straight annual gain in 2011 as the SP 500 (SPX) stalled after
surging 39 percent in 2009 and 2010. The shares have increased
3.8 percent since Feb. 21, when their price-earnings ratio
dropped to the lowest level since June versus the valuation for
SP 500 technology companies, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Virginia Ginni Rometty succeeded Sam Palmisano this
year, becoming the first female chief executive officer in the
company''s 100-year history. She inherits a five-year plan that
includes boosting software to half of IBM''s earnings, with a
focus on programs that help businesses analyze and project
trends, as well as on cloud computing and emerging markets. </p>
<p>In January, IBM reported revenue of $107 billion for 2011
and earnings of $13.06 a share, and forecast 2012 earnings that
exceeded analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>IBM has the biggest weight in the 30-company Dow Jones
Industrial Average, accounting for 12 percent of its value. The
Dow slipped 14.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,962.81 today,
while the SP 500 lost 0.4 percent to 1,364.33. </p>
<p>IBM''s advance came as Apple Inc. (AAPL) sank below a milestone
reached last week. The stock dropped 2.2 percent to $533.16
today, sending Apple''s market capitalization below $500 billion.
The maker of iPhones and iPad tablet computers became only the
sixth U.S. company to climb above that threshold, according to
data compiled by SP. The others are Microsoft Corp., General
Electric Co., Cisco Systems Inc., Intel Corp. and Exxon Mobil
Corp., in chronological order. </p>

<p>Ed Silva has grown accustomed to
saying no after his health-care technology company began getting
queries from possible buyers about once a week last year. </p>
<p>The interest in IDL Solutions Inc. of Germantown,
Wisconsin, came after it won one of 16 seats on a federal
contract valued at $4 billion over 10 years, said Silva, 47, the
company''s senior vice president. </p>
<p>Slots on such multi-award contracts have become coveted
prizes in government contracting, as the U.S. pours more funding
into them even as it plans reductions in total awards. Companies
losing out on the deals are increasingly deploying an
alternative strategy to get aboard: They''re purchasing others
already selected for the contracts. </p>
<p>You need to buy so you''re not shut out for five, or in
some cases seven or in some cases even 10 years, said Jean Stack, a McLean, Virginia-based managing director at investment
bank Houlihan Lokey. </p>
<p>In the past two years, top contractors including General
Dynamics (GD) Corp., Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) and Mantech
International Corp. (MANT) have made acquisitions to gain or increase
eligibility for awards. In one case, General Dynamics acquired a
company that had itself bought someone else on a contract. </p>
<p>Government spending on multiple-award contracts, or MACs,
increased 49 percent to $121 billion in fiscal 2010 from $81
billion in fiscal 2006, according to a Bloomberg Government
study. Total contract spending increased at about half that rate
to $534 billion from $429 billion during the same period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Buying Incumbents </h2>
<p>Under MACs, agencies hold competitions to pick multiple
suppliers rather than a single provider. Once chosen for the
pool, the contractors bid against each other for orders as
specific needs arise. </p>
<p>Buying an incumbent is always an option if you don''t win
a spot on a contract, said Mark Amtower, who owns a Highland,
Maryland, firm that advises contractors on how to win government
business. It''s perfectly legal, perfectly ethical. </p>
<p>Some small businesses view their positions on the
multibillion-dollar umbrella contracts as a way to cash in, he
said. </p>
<p>The government has taken some steps to prevent large
companies from getting access to contracts through acquisitions
of small businesses. A planned Department of Homeland Security
contract for information technology, for example, contains a
provision to remove companies that are purchased by large
competitors. </p>

<p>Four times, the U.S. Energy
Department offered terms to Bright Automotive Inc. for a loan
the startup company was seeking to finance production of
electric commercial vans. </p>
<p>Each successive, conditional offer arrived with stiffer
terms, Chief Operating Officer Mike Donoughe said in an
interview. He likened the experience to offering to buy a car
for $20,000 and having the dealer try to bargain up to $40,000.
Chrysler Group LLC Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne
made similar comments before the company last month withdrew its
application to the same program. </p>
<p>While Energy Secretary Steven Chu says the vehicle program
is evaluating applications, it hasn''t awarded new money since
the bankruptcy of solar-panel maker Solyndra LLC, which won a
$535 million loan guarantee through another department program. </p>
<p>In an election year, there will be more caution and delay
as a result, said Julian Zelizer, a political historian at
Princeton University. Solyndra''s bankruptcy filing put a damper
on all Energy Department loans, Zelizer said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Inevitably it will slow down the program the closer we
get to the election, he said. </p>
<p>The $25 billion vehicle-loan program, created in 2008, last
made an award in March 2011. </p>
<p>Republicans subpoenaed documents about the Solyndra loan
from President Barack Obama''s administration, questioning
whether campaign fundraiser George Kaiser, whose family
foundation was the company''s biggest investor, pressed for the
loan guarantee. </p>
<h2>Bright, Chrysler </h2>
<p>Bright, based in Rochester Hills, Michigan, said last week
it''s shutting down because it can''t wait any longer to receive
money from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing
Program. </p>
<p>Chrysler, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, and controlled
by Fiat SpA (F), withdrew its application for less than $3.5 billion
in loans Feb. 16, about six weeks after Marchionne told
reporters at the North American International Auto Show in
Detroit, You ask yourself whether it''s worth it -- that''s the
question I keep on asking myself. </p>
<p>In January, the department canceled a loan commitment of
$730 million to OAO Severstal (SVST), Russia''s second-largest
steelmaker, saying the company had done much of the work for
which it had requested the loan in 2009. </p>
<p>Fisker Automotive Inc., which was awarded $529 million in
loans in April 2010, last month halted work on the Wilmington,
Delaware, auto factory where it planned to produce its first
U.S.-made plug-in electric vehicle. It disclosed that the Energy
Department had blocked access to most of its loan money since
May because of unmet milestones. </p>
<h2>Taxpayer Interests </h2>
<p>Aptera Motors Inc., a California electric-car company
supported by Representative Darrell Issa, chairman of the U.S.
House committee leading a probe of the department''s loan
programs, closed in December after it couldn''t get private
financing to match a $150 million conditional loan commitment
from the Energy Department. </p>
<p>The department is proceeding with loan application reviews
carefully even as markets for private capital improve, Chu said. </p>
<p>We''re continuing to look at the loans and process the
loans, Chu told reporters on March 1. In all the loans, we
are certainly committed to looking out after the taxpayer money.
This is a very fundamental part of this. While we were asked
through the Congress to invest in innovative new technologies,
we also have to balance that with looking out after the taxpayer
money. </p>
<h2>Ford, Nissan </h2>
<p>The Energy Department has awarded $8.4 billion from the
vehicle-manufacturing loan program since 2009 to companies
including Nissan Motor Co. (7201), which sells the Leaf plug-in car;
Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA), maker of the electric Roadster; and Ford
Motor Co. (F), which last week said its plug-in Focus was certified
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to offer the
equivalent of 105 miles (169 kilometers) per gallon of gasoline. </p>
<p>Bright wanted to benefit from Obama''s push to buy more
energy-efficient vehicles for the U.S. government fleet,
Donoughe said. The company planned to manufacture vehicles at a
closed AM General LLC plant in Indiana and had the support of
Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, and Democratic and
Republican Congress members from Indiana, according to letters
provided by the Energy Department. </p>
<p>It''s unfortunate that more companies have not been
approved, but we are looking at options to ensure that the
initiative will continue to help manufacturers create American
jobs, Stabenow, who helped create the program, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<h2>Disband It'' </h2>
<p>Obama, who has set 2015 for all light-duty vehicles bought
for the U.S. fleet will be alternative-fuel, on March 1 said in
a speech in Nashua, New Hampshire, that by that year, all
vehicle purchases will be of fuel efficient cars and trucks. </p>
<p>Energy Department staff were in Bright''s offices as
recently as last month, spending three days reviewing the
operations for the loan, Donoughe said, estimating the agency
spent as much as $10 million reviewing the application, which
was submitted in December 2008. </p>
<p>By the fourth offer, the loan terms were so one-sided to
make the applicant say I can''t meet those terms so we''ll go
away,'' Donoughe said. They kept ratcheting up the terms to
the point at which we just couldn''t abide by them. </p>
<p>Chu today is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at a
conference on fuel-efficient technologies for commercial
vehicles. The speech will be in Indianapolis, less than an
hour''s drive from Anderson, Indiana, where Bright plans to wind
down operations and look for new jobs for its workers. </p>
<p>In my mind, not only should they close the program, they
should take the whole lot of the loan-program office and disband
it, Donoughe said. </p>

<p>A record 181,900 applications were filed in 2011, WIPO

<h2>Trademark </h2>
<h2>Australia Said to Face WTO Complaint Over Ban on Tobacco Logos </h2>
<p>Australia may face a complaint at the World Trade
Organization over its decision to ban trademarks and logos on
tobacco products, according to two people with direct knowledge
of the matter. </p>
<p>The complaint, which says the plain-packaging law violates
global intellectual-property rules, will probably be lodged with
the Geneva-based trade arbiter this month, as soon as this week,
said one person. </p>
<p>Australia is the first country to require identical
cigarette packaging. As of Dec. 1, 2012, cigarettes there will
have to be sold in dark brown packets, with no company logos or
images and the same font for all brands. Imperial Tobacco Group
Plc (IMP), British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) and Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) are
among companies that have challenged the law, which Australia is
extending to include cigars and loose-leaf tobacco products. </p>
<p>The law violates several provisions of agreements
protecting intellectual-property rights, Ukraine said at a Feb.
28 WTO meeting on the matter </p>
<p>Countries including Chile, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican
Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Indonesia, Jordan, Mexico,
Nicaragua, Nigeria, Turkey, Zambia and Zimbabwe also say the
Australian ban breaks trade rules. They have challenged
Australia''s scientific evidence and said the law will
unnecessarily restrict commerce because the country''s public-
health goal can be met by other means. </p>
<p>The missions of Ukraine, Zimbabwe, Mexico, Indonesia and
Nigeria in Geneva didn''t return calls or declined to comment. </p>
<p>Australia said at the Feb. 28 WTO meeting that it had
comprehensively responded to all the claims made by the
Dominican Republic and others. </p>
<p>The rule is not anti-trade, it''s anti-cancer,
Australian Trade Minister Craig Emerson said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday in Canberra. It''s in the public-health
interests of the Australian people and the Gillard government
will never give up on Australia''s sovereign right to look after
the health of its people. </p>
<p>The World Health Organization''s Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control, the first international treaty aimed at cutting
tobacco use, includes provisions on non-pricing measures to
lower demand, including regulations on packaging and labeling. </p>
<p>While the treaty doesn''t specifically address the use of
trademarked brands or logos, it requires signatories to ensure
that packaging and labeling don''t promote a tobacco product by
any means that are false, misleading, deceptive or likely to
create an erroneous impression about its characteristics, health
effects, hazards or emissions. </p>
<p>WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said on Nov. 23 that
major tobacco companies were harassing governments including
Australia, Norway and Uruguay in a bid to overturn cigarette
package-labeling rules. </p>
<p>The European Union is also considering plain packaging for
tobacco products. </p>
<h2>EU to Decide on Future of Google Antitrust Probe Next Month </h2>
<p>European Union regulators must decide next month on the
future of their antitrust probe into Google Inc. (GOOG), the region''s
competition commissioner said. </p>
<p>Joaquin Almunia said investigators still must define their
objections and clarify concerns over the world''s largest search
engine. Last year he said that the probe focused on whether the
company is a gate keeper to the Internet that can influence
users'' behavior. </p>
<p>Next month I will have to decide how to continue this
investigation, Almunia said in an interview with Bloomberg HT
television. First we have to define our objections. We need to
clarify the concerns after a year-and-a-half of complex
investigation. And we will communicate these to Google and we''ll
see what happens. </p>
<p>Google, based in Mountain View, California, is under
growing pressure from global antitrust agencies probing whether
the company is thwarting competition in the market for Web
searches. While Microsoft Corp. and partner Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) have
about a quarter of the U.S. Web-search market, Google has almost
95 percent of the traffic in Europe, Microsoft said in a blog
post last year, citing data from regulators. </p>
<p>The EU is investigating claims Google discriminated against
other services in its search results and stopped some websites
from accepting rival ads. Microsoft and shopping-comparison site
Foundem are among companies that asked for a review of Google''s
actions. </p>
<p>Investigators should report to Almunia at the end of March
or the beginning of April on the status of the very difficult
and complex investigation, he said. </p>
<p>Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels, said the
company continues to work closely and cooperatively with the
European commission to explain how our business works. </p>

<h2>U.S. Files Formal Request With New Zealand to Extradite Dotcom </h2>
<p>The U.S. government has formally asked New Zealand to
extradite Megaupload.com founder Kim Dotcom, who was indicted in
Virginia on charges of involvement in the country''s biggest
copyright infringement conspiracy. </p>
<p>The extradition papers for Dotcom; Finn Batato, the chief
marketing officer at Megaupload; Mathias Ortmann, co-founder and
director of the file-sharing website; and Bram van der Kolk, who
oversaw programming at the website, were received at the North
Shore District Court near Auckland on March 2, said Magila
Annandale, a New Zealand Ministry of Justice spokeswoman. </p>
<p>Dotcom ran a Mega Conspiracy, U.S. prosecutors said in
a Feb. 17 revised indictment filed in a court in Alexandria,
Virginia, accusing him of generating more than $175 million in
criminal proceeds from the exchange of pirated film, music, book
and software files. He faces as long as 20 years in prison for
each of the racketeering and money-laundering charges in the
indictment. </p>
<p>The U.S. extradition papers weren''t immediately available
from the North Shore District Court. A judge has to approve
requests from people not involved in the case for access to
files after receiving a written application and obtaining views
of all parties in the matter, Annandale said in an e-mail
yesterday. </p>
<p>Dotcom, 38, was also charged in the U.S. with five counts
of criminal copyright infringement and five counts of wire
fraud. The defendant, who legally changed his family name from
Schmitz, has denied any criminal misconduct. </p>
<p>He was released from jail on Feb. 22 over objections from
the U.S., after Judge N.R. Dawson ruled he wasn''t a flight risk.
Dotcom is restricted to his rented $18 million mansion and
subject to electronic monitoring, according to the bail
conditions. </p>
<p>An extradition hearing has been scheduled for Aug. 20. </p>

<h2>China Proposes Certifying Professionals as Lawyers, Xinhua Says </h2>
<p>China''s State Council is seeking public feedback on a
proposed law that will allow some professionals to apply to
become lawyers, Xinhua News Agency said, citing the Cabinet''s
Legislative Affairs Office. </p>
<p>Professionals with bachelor''s degrees and at least 15
years'' experience in international trade, intellectual property
rights, finance, environmental protection, high technology,
journalism or medical accidents will be eligible under the
proposed law, the official news service reported. </p>
<p>In 1980, Chinese government regulations defined lawyers as
state legal workers, and were regarded as civil servants
working in legal advisory officers. </p>
<p>It took another 15 years for understanding of the legal
profession to evolve to the point at which a 1996 Chinese law
defined them as professionals providing legal service to
society, according to a 2003 doctoral dissertation by
Professor Ethan Michelson, a social scientist at the University
of Indiana. By the end of 2002, Beijing had no more state-owned
law offices, Michelson said in his dissertation. </p>
<p>In an essay published in 2010 by the Brookings Institution,
Michelson noted that the legal profession has grown
dramatically, from only a few thousand in 1979 to almost 150,000
by 2007. </p>
<p>In a survey he conducted in 2009, whose results are
published in the essay, Michelson said of the more than 2,600
who responded, 9 percent reported incomes above $73,000, with
five reporting annual incomes in excess of $1.5 million. </p>
<p>Some of the lawyers who responded to his survey had only
junior-college degrees, although most had at least an
undergraduate degree. Their incomes were relative to the amount
of education they received. </p>

<p>Affiliates of a consumer group sued
eight drugmakers including Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and
GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), accusing the companies of illegally
offering coupons to reduce copayments for brand name drugs. </p>
<p>Affiliates of Boston-based Community Catalyst contend that
cutting co-pays for the drugs destroys the incentive to use
cheaper generic drugs, in a suit filed today in federal court in
Newark, New Jersey, against Merck  Co. (MRK) Identical cases were
filed in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago. </p>
<p>A recent study estimated that these kickbacks will
increase health benefit providers'' prescription drug costs by
$32 billion over the next 10 years, plaintiffs'' lawyer Lisa J. Rodriguez of Haddonfield, New Jersey, said in one complaint. </p>
<p>Also sued were Amgen Inc. (AMGN), AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), Bristol-Meyers
Squibb Co. (BMY) and Novartis AG. (NOV) </p>
<p>Given the larger cost-sharing burden being placed on
patients, Pfizer supports the use of company-sponsored programs
which help patients with out-of-pocket expenses for the
medicines prescribed by their physician, Christopher Loder, a
Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. The company
will fight the claim, he said. </p>
<p>The lawsuits were filed by the AFSCME District Council 37
Health  Security Plan Trust, the Sergeants Benevolent
Association Health and Welfare Fund, the New England Carpenters
Health and Welfare Fund and the Plumbers and Pipefitters Local
572 Health and Welfare Fund. </p>
<h2>Health Plans </h2>
<p>The community group said in a statement the health plans,
struggling with rising costs, provide drug benefits for civilian
and uniformed municipals workers, retirees and their dependents
throughout the city of New York, plumbers from Florida to Ohio,
and carpenters throughout New England. </p>
<p>Our lawyers still have not received the brief; we won''t
comment before we''ve had an opportunity to review the brief,
said Mary Klem, an Amgen spokeswoman. </p>
<p>Sarah Lindgreen, an AstraZeneca spokeswoman; Ron Rogers, a
spokesman for Merck; Sabrina Oei, a Novartis spokeswoman; Adelle Infante of Abbott; Laura Hortas of Bristol-Meyers; and officials
of Glaxo didn''t immediately respond to voice and e-mail messages
seeking comment on the lawsuits. </p>
<p>Some of the drugs named in the lawsuits are Pfizer''s
Celebrex and Lipitor, Novartis''s Diovan, Amgen''s Enbrel, Merck''s
Nasonex and Vytorin, and AstraZeneca''s Crestor and Nexium. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), FedEx
Corp. (FDX) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) are among 20 stocks that may be
most hurt should oil supplies dwindle, said Jonathan Golub,
chief U.S. market strategist at UBS AG. </p>
<p>Auto, transportation, materials, banking and diversified
financial companies would be most affected by a supply
disruption, Golub wrote in a note today. He cited a March 4
report from UBS oil analyst Julius Walker, who outlined
scenarios related to Iran, and said Brent crude might rise to
between $130 and $270 a barrel, though he expects any increase
to be short-lived. Brent for April settlement rose 1.6 percent
to $123.90 a barrel at 12:13 p.m. New York time today. </p>
<p>Brent climbed 22 percent from Oct. 4 through yesterday as
West Texas Intermediate rose 38 percent, amid improved economic
data and central-bank quantitative-easing and low-rate policies,
Golub said in the note. Concern U.S. and European sanctions
against Iran will lead to military conflict in the Persian Gulf,
home to more than half the world''s oil reserves, has also
boosted prices. </p>
<p>These stocks should lag in the event of a supply shock,
New York-based Golub said in the note where he named the 20
stocks including Goldman and FedEx. Energy and defensive
sectors should outperform on a relative basis. </p>
<p>Golub said that at current levels, energy prices support
continued profit growth and are consistent with his year-end
price estimate for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index of 1,475, and
his prediction for earnings per share of the gauge''s components
of $103. The SP 500 rose 0.6 percent to 1,351.52 today. </p>

<p>Low interest rates proved mightier
than concern about Europe''s precarious economics in 2011. The
opportunity to refinance debt at low rates drove $2.9trillion
in corporate bond sales, the second-highest total on record,
after 2009''s $3.2 trillion. </p>
<p>Corporate and sovereign-bond deals around the world
generated a total of $13.6 billion in fees for bankers, down
from $14.9 billion in 2010, according to data compiled for
Bloomberg Markets'' ranking of the best-paid investment banks. </p>
<p>JPMorgan led the list, taking or sharing the top spot for
the fourth straight year as it earned $1.05billion, down from
$1.26 billion in 2010. Barclays Capital jumped to No.2 from No.
4 in 2010, after earning $906 million in fees, up from $870
million in 2010, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its April
issue. </p>
<p>As of early March, bond markets were off to a promising
start in 2012, with financial company debt leading the way,
according to Arthur Tetyevsky, a credit strategist at Jefferies
Group Inc. (JEF) in New York. He expects U.S. investment-grade
corporate bonds to return from 4 to 5 percent more than
Treasuries in 2012. </p>
<p>We are encouraged by the strong demand for credit,
Tetyevsky says. </p>
<p>Fees fell in 2011 because investors pulled back from the
market in the third quarter as Europe''s financial troubles
deepened. A strong start to the year, spurred by the expectation
that rates would rise, helped stoke demand for high-yield bonds
and spurred corporations to act before borrowing costs
increased. </p>
<h2>High-Yield Swoon </h2>
<p>We had a very active first half when the high-yield index
tightened to an all-time low of 6.75percentage points in May,
which drove issuance in that market, says Andy O''Brien, global
co-head of debt capital markets at JPMorgan (JPM), referring to the
JPMorgan index that measures the average spread of high-yield
bonds against Treasuries. As concern about Europe increased, the
spread widened to 10 percentage points in October, before ending
the year at 8 percentage points, O''Brien says. </p>
<p>Bond issuance slowed dramatically in the second half,
pushing down fees for the year. For the top five banks in the
ranking, fees for high-yield debt issuance, which earns higher
commission rates for firms, dropped 26.3 percent last year
compared with 2010. Investment-grade fees for the five fell 9.5
percent, while commissions from western Europe dropped
21.7percent, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<h2>Wheels Come Off </h2>
<p>The third quarter really took everyone''s wheels off,
says Richard Zogheb, co-head of capital markets origination for
the Americas at Citigroup (C), No. 3 in the bond fee ranking. It
became very scary that it was possible that the European crisis
could spread beyond Greece, Ireland and Portugal and encompass
Italy andSpain. </p>
<p>The European crisis led to an increase in the issuance of
bonds denominated in U.S. dollars by banks and companies outside
the country -- debt known as Yankee bonds. </p>
<p>More than 40 percent of U.S. dollar-denominated deals
came from Yankee issuers last year, and we were a clear
beneficiary of that trend, says Jim Glascott, head of global
debt capital markets at Barclays Capital. </p>
<p>There was also a rise in issuance of so-called dollar-
covered bonds -- mortgage-backed debt securities of which the
issuing bank keeps a portion on its balance sheet, reducing
risk. About $40 billion in issuance of U.S. dollar covered bonds
helped Barclays (BARC) Capital boost fee income last year. The market
saw no volume in the securities in 2009 and $28 billion in 2010,
Glascott said. </p>
<p>That''s a market that didn''t exist before, and now we''re
the No. 1 bookrunner, so that''s been helpful, he says.
Issuance of the bonds was led by European and Canadian banks,
with Australian banks entering the market at the end of last
year. </p>
<h2>Verizon''s Big Deal </h2>
<p>In the corporate sector, the largest dollar-denominated
bond deal of the year was Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)''s March
sale of $6.25 billion of notes to repay part of the cost of its
$1.74 billion acquisition of Terremark Worldwide Inc. </p>
<p>Debt worldwide fromthe most-creditworthy companies to the
neediest returned 5.99 percent from the end of November through
yesterday, compared with a 4.86 percent gain in all of 2011,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Broad
Market Corporate  High Yield Index. </p>
<p>The need for yield continues to exist, says Jim Casey,
co-head with O''Brien of debt capital markets at JPMorgan.
Investors can''t satisfy their need for yield away from credit
markets. </p>

<p>For investment bankers, 2011 started
with a shout and ended with a whimper -- causing fees to shoot
up in the first half, then fizzle at year''s end. </p>
<p>Early on, Dallas-based ATT Inc. (T) and Frankfurt-based
Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) announced bold plans to acquire competitors
across the Atlantic. Initial public offerings surged in the
first half to levels not seen since before the near collapse of
the U.S. financial system in 2008. Pipeline operator Kinder
Morgan Inc. (KMI) went public with a $3.3 billion IPO in February that
raised $1 billion more than projected, Bloomberg Markets
magazine reports in its April issue. </p>
<p>Investor appetite for IPOs was even hotter by May: Shares
of social-networking website LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) surged 109 percent
to $94.25 in their first day of trading. </p>
<p>Activity continued to build to a crescendo even after the
tragedy in Japan, says Paul J. Taubman, investment banking
chief at Morgan Stanley (MS), speaking of the 9.0 megathrust
earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March. </p>
<p>The high point of the year came in mid-July, when London-
based Apax Partners LLP launched the biggest leveraged buyout
since late 2008 with a $5.7 billion bid for medical-device maker
Kinetic Concepts Inc. (KCI), in which Morgan Stanley advised Apax and
designed the financing package. </p>

<p>Reading electricity meters isn''t
typically a dangerous profession -- unless you happen to be
employed by AES Eletropaulo. </p>
<p>Robson Dourado said residents of Sao Paulo''s Morro do Indio
slum watch him warily as he makes his rounds, worried he''ll
detect rogue wires siphoning away power illegally. Some co-
workers have lost teeth in encounters with angry customers. </p>
<p>To avoid confrontations with the street toughs who walk
around with guns tucked into their trousers, Dourado, 28,
practices a studied indifference, Bloomberg Businessweek reports
in its March 12 issue. I just keep on doing what I''m doing
until they come speak to me, he said. If there''s trouble, I
leave. </p>
<p>Electricity theft is rampant across much of Latin America,
so much so that statisticians have devised a formula that uses
the purloined wattage to measure the size of a country''s
informal economy. In some parts of Brazil, power losses reach as
high as 20 percent. </p>
<p>To combat the problem and avoid violent encounters,
utilities are turning to smart meters. The devices, which cost
about $150 to $400 each, including hardware, communications
software and installation, let power companies monitor
customers'' usage remotely and in real time. </p>
<p>The meters can detect unusually heavy demand, which may
signal an illegal hookup. They can also be used to shut off
service to households and businesses that don''t pay their bills.
The devices remove the human factor from the equation, so
customers can no longer collude with dishonest meter readers to
cheat the power company. </p>
<h2>Perfect Solution'' </h2>
<p>Smart meters are the perfect solution, said Fabio de
Oliveira Toledo, chief technology officer for the distribution
unit of Light SA (LIGT3), a Rio de Janeiro-based utility that has
installed more than 150,000 of them. They save you money,
they''re easy to install, and they require little maintenance. </p>
<p>Andre Pepitone da Nobrega, director of the national
electricity regulator, Agencia Nacional de Energia Eletrica ,
said the meters may save utilities as much as 8 billion reais
($4.5 billion) a year. </p>
<p>Makers of the wireless gadgets, including Toshiba Corp. (6502)''s
Landis + Gyr AG (LGYZ), Echelon (ELON) Corp. and Elster Group SE (ELT), are
increasingly counting on developing markets to offset shrinking
revenue in the U.S., where government funding to support smart
meter deployment has dried up. </p>
<p>Sales of smart meters in Latin America are expected to
generate $24 billion in revenue through 2020, two-thirds of it
in Brazil, according to Northeast Group LLC, a Washington-based
research company. </p>
<p>Lots of U.S. companies are excited about Latin America
and Brazil, said Jeff Lund, vice president of business
development at San Jose, California-based Echelon. </p>
<h2>Latin American Demand </h2>
<p>Brazilian utilities may install as many as 63.5 million
smart meters by the end of the decade, at a cost of
approximately $15.2 billion, according to Northeast Group. The
company estimates that Mexico will deploy 22.4 million,
Argentina 4.9 million and Chile 3.2 million over the same
period. </p>
<p>Brazil is a clear regional leader, in smart grid
development, said Ben Gardner, president of Northeast Group.
Mexico is next in line. </p>
<p>Elster, based in Essen, Germany, has retooled its factory
in southern Brazil to produce smart meters as well as the
regular variety. Hong Kong-based ATC International Group is
considering teaming up with a local partner to open a facility
in the country by 2013. </p>
<p>Brazil will become one of the world''s top five markets,
for smart meters, predicts ATC''s chief executive officer, David
Liang. </p>
<h2>Making Preparations </h2>
<p>In Rio de Janeiro, utilities are taking advantage of
preparations for the 2014 World Cup soccer championship and 2016
Olympic Games to deploy the meters. </p>
<p>Before August about 80 percent of electricity in Tabajara
and Morro dos Cabritos, two of the city''s more violent slums,
was stolen through illegal connections, said Geraldo Guimaraes,
vice president for Latin America at Elster''s Integrated
Solutions division. </p>
<p>After police established a constant presence in the favelas
last year, Light began installing 50,000 of Elster''s meters.
Theft has dropped to zero since, Guimaraes said. Now everyone
receives invoices, and if they don''t pay them, they''re
disconnected. </p>
<p>Companies like Elster are anticipating a substantial
payday. Brazil may require utilities to replace all of the
country''s 67 million existing power meters with smart devices
under a program expected to be introduced by year-end, said
Brazil''s electricity regulator. </p>
<p>If that happens, Landis + Gyr will be ready. The company

<p>Some shale formations in Europe and
China are impervious to drilling techniques that opened vast
reserves of natural gas and oil from Texas to Pennsylvania, said
Rex Tillerson, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s chief executive officer. </p>
<p>New methods and tools will need to be invented to tap many
of the shale fields that energy companies and governments expect
eventually to yield a bonanza of fuel, Tillerson said during a
meeting with analysts in New York today. </p>
<p>Exxon, the largest U.S. gas producer after its 2010
acquisition of shale driller XTO Energy (XTO), failed in its first two
efforts to crack gas-rich shale fields in Poland. Gas discovered
in a pair of wells finished during the final three months of
last year didn''t flow, even after the company used high-pressure
jets of water and sand to create fissures in the rocks. </p>
<p>Some of the shales don''t respond as well to hydraulic
fracturing, Tillerson said during a meeting with reporters
after his presentation to analysts. It''s going to take
research and time in the lab to understand that. </p>
<p>Some parts of U.S. shale formations also have proven
impervious to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, he said. The
company is studying whether using different fluids, proppants or
pumping techniques will be successful, Tillerson said. Proppants
are tiny granules of sand or ceramic used to hold open fissures
that allow oil and gas to flow through rock. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Bank of
America Corp. documents that were deemed confidential in a
lawsuit filed against them by Overstock.com Inc. (OSTK) must be made
public, a state court judge in San Francisco ruled. </p>
<p>The case involves a 2007 lawsuit by Overstock, an online
retailer, claiming that the banks manipulated its stock from
2005 to 2007, causing its shares to fall. State Court Judge John
Munter dismissed the case on Jan. 10, ruling that the conduct
took place outside of California. Overstock appealed, and also
asked Munter to make public those documents he put under seal. </p>
<p>Munter granted Overstock''s request to make public a large
chunk of documents, ruling Goldman Sachs and Bank of America''s
Merrill Lynch  Co. failed to demonstrate an overriding
interest that overcomes the right of public access to the
records. He said the transactions are at least four years old,
and much of the material was discussed at a Jan. 5 hearing. </p>
<p>The subject matter of this action is of substantial
public interest, Munter ruled. This case concerns publicly
traded securities and the operation of the national securities
markets, and those are of great public interest. </p>
<h2>Financial Data </h2>
<p>Munter also ruled that other documents dealing with a
staggering amount of financial data, should remain under
court seal. Those exhibits to court filings are laced with
identifying information about hundreds of thousands of financial
transactions of third parties not connected to the litigation. </p>
<p>David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>Bill Halldin, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America, said in an e-mailed statement that the
bank is reviewing the decision. </p>
<p>Our primary goal has been to ensure that the
confidentiality of sensitive client information be protected,
Halldin said. </p>
<p>Salt Lake City-based Overstock claims that large portions
of its stock was the subject of naked shorting, where investors
sell shares they don''t own in anticipation of making a profit by
paying for the stock after its price has fallen. </p>
<p>The clearing operations at Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch,
the brokerage acquired by Bank of America in 2009, intentionally
failed to locate and deliver borrowed shares for clients,
allowing the firms to earn fees and interest on phantom
securities transactions, lawyers for Overstock said in court
filings. Overstock sought millions of dollars in damages against
Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. </p>
<h2>Market Flaws'' </h2>
<p>Overstock Chief Executive Officer Patrick Byrne was
thrilled with the judge''s ruling, he said in a statement. </p>
<p>I could not imagine that a post-2008 public would be
denied access to this evidence, which displays in living color
the flaws in our capital markets and in the regulatory structure
that governs them, he said. </p>
<p>Now the public will have a window through which to view
this evidence and judge for itself the fraudulent and
systematically risky behavior at issue in this case, he said. </p>
<p>Four media organizations, including Bloomberg LP, the New
York Times, Wenner Media and The Economist, intervened in the
case and joined Overstock''s motion for the unsealing. </p>
<p>The case is Overstock.com v. Morgan Stanley, CGC-07-460147,
Superior Court of California, San Francisco. </p>

<p>The Morgan Stanley (MS) employee who
prosecutors said was with a New York woman during her arrest
last month for running a brothel is David Spencer Walker,
according to a person briefed on the matter. </p>
<p>Anna Gristina, a Scot and British citizen who''s a legal
permanent resident of the U.S., was with a Morgan Stanley
banker who she counts as a close friend when arrested, said
Assistant District Attorney Charles Linehan, according to a
transcript of the court proceedings on Feb. 23, a day after she
was arrested in Midtown Manhattan. </p>
<p>Gristina was at Walker''s office for a meeting in which
she was trying to solicit money to fund what we believe is
another illicit business venture on the Internet that involves
matching up male clients with female prostitutes, said
Linehan, a member of the district attorney''s official corruption
unit. </p>
<p>Gristina knowingly advanced and profited from
prostitution by managing, supervising, controlling and owning,
either alone or in association with others, a prostitution
business, according to the indictment, filed in Supreme Court
of the State of New York. </p>
<p>Prosecutors haven''t accused Walker of wrongdoing or
identified him publicly. He works for Morgan Stanley Smith
Barney, the firm''s retail brokerage, said the person, who didn''t
want to be identified because Walker wasn''t named in the case.
Fox Business Network reported his name yesterday. </p>
<p>Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr., declined to confirm the identity of the Morgan
Stanley employee or say whether that person is being
investigated. </p>
<h2>Joint Venture </h2>
<p>Walker has been registered with Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority firms since 1988, and worked at New York-
based Morgan Stanley from 1999 to 2005. He moved to Citigroup
Inc. (C) before the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture
between the two companies was formed in 2009, bringing him back
to Morgan Stanley, according to Finra records. </p>
<p>We''re investigating this matter, said Jim Wiggins, a
spokesman for Morgan Stanley. At this point, no individual at
Morgan Stanley has been charged with any crime. </p>
<p>Walker has been placed on administrative leave during the
investigation, Wiggins said. Walker said he wasn''t present
during Gristina''s arrest and never did business with her,
according to the website DNAinfo.com, citing an interview with
the broker. </p>
<h2>Online Dating </h2>
<p>Peter Gleason, a lawyer for Gristina, said the business
venture mentioned by Linehan was a proposed online dating
service meant to rival Match.com, the New York Times reported. </p>
<p>Walker didn''t return phone calls left at his home and
office yesterday, and Gleason didn''t return a call to his
office. </p>
<p>The investigation resulted in at least one eyewitness
account of a sexual encounter arranged by Gristina in which
minors were involved, Linehan told New York Supreme Court
Justice Juan M. Merchan, according to the transcript. </p>
<p>The indictment blanks out the name of a second defendant.
Gristina, a mother of four, has business contacts worldwide,
made millions of dollars and counts many affluent people as
friends and clients, according to the transcript. </p>
<p>The case is People v. Anna Gristina, 751/12, New York
Supreme Court (338265L) (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) sold $2.75 billion of
bonds, including short-term notes that pay less interest than an
interbank lending benchmark, taking advantage of corporate
borrowing costs that are near the lowest on record. </p>
<p>The world''s largest soft-drink maker issued $1 billion each
of two- and three-year notes today, as well as $750 million of
six-year notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
two-year notes pay a floating rate that''s five basis points less
than the three-month London interbank offered rate, the first
time a U.S. company paid less than the measure in over a month. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola''s three-year notes have a 0.75 percent coupon,
while the six-year notes pay 1.65 percent a year, Bloomberg data
show. Libor was set at 0.474 percent today. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, is taking advantage of
increasing investor demand for highly rated debt to reduce its
borrowing costs. The average yield on investment-grade bonds was
3.45 percent yesterday, near the record low of 3.4 percent
reached on March 2, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. </p>
<p>The soft-drink producer is following competitor PepsiCo
Inc. to the bond market. Last month, Purchase, New York-based
PepsiCo paid the least interest it ever had on a three-part bond
sale, issuing $750 million of 0.75 percent notes due in March
2015, $1.25 billion of 2.75 percent securities maturing in March
2022 and $750 million of 4 percent, 30-year bonds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>On Feb. 1, Procter  Gamble Co. issued $1 billion of
floating rate notes that pay 8 basis points less than Libor,
which is the rate banks say they charge to lend to each other.
It was the first to pay less than Libor since 2006. </p>

<p>Proxy adviser Glass Lewis  Co. is
opposing five nominees to the board of Walt Disney Co. (DIS), citing
deficient links between performance and executive pay, and one
director''s ties to a failed lender. </p>
<p>Four of the nominees served on the TV, theme-park and film
company''s compensation committee, Glass Lewis said in a report.
The fifth nominee served on the board of a bank that was seized
by regulators in 2008, resulting in losses for the investors. </p>
<p>The firm joins proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder
Services Inc. and Connecticut Treasurer Denise L. Nappier in
opposing Disney directors up for a vote at the March 13 annual
meeting in Kansas City, Missouri. Glass Lewis opposes half the
nominees. A third proxy adviser, Egan-Jones Proxy Services,
supports the company''s nominees and other issues on the ballot. </p>
<p>Much of the opposition relates to Disney''s decision last
year to give Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger the additional
title of chairman at the annual meeting. The company hasn''t had
one executive in both positions since then-chief executive
Michael Eisner gave up the chairman title in 2004 under pressure
from shareholder groups that said an independent chairman would
lead to better shareholder stewardship. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 0.5 percent to
$42.24 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 13 percent
this year. </p>
<p>Glass Lewis prefers companies split the jobs of chairman
and chief executive or have a lead director who isn''t an
executive of the company, the firm said in the Feb. 23 report. </p>
<p>While Disney said it will appoint an independent lead
director, the company doesn''t appear to have done so and Glass
Lewis said it is monitoring the issue. </p>
<h2>Planned Transition </h2>
<p>The decision to combine the positions was part of a
transition plan that was carefully thought out by the board,
retiring Chairman John Pepper said in a statement March 7. </p>
<p>Nine out of the ten directors will be independent,
including an independent lead director with duties and
responsibilities that exceed in scope those recommended by
governance advisers, Pepper said. </p>
<p>Of the 100 biggest Standard  Poor''s companies, 68 percent
have a joint chairman and CEO, Pepper said. In a filing last
week, the company cited better long-term stock performance than
peers such as News Corp. (NWSA), Time Warner Inc. (TWX), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), CBS
Corp. (CBS) and Viacom Inc. </p>
<h2>Board View </h2>
<p>The Board rightfully considered Mr. Iger''s performance
over the course of his tenure when viewed in relation to the
industry peers against which both he and his compensation
package are most fairly measured, Disney said in the filing.
On that measure Mr. Iger''s compensation is fully warranted. </p>
<p>In backing the nominees, Egan Jones said in its March 6
report the audit, compensation and governance-nominating
committees were composed of independent, outside directors. </p>
<p>According to Glass Lewis, Disney overall paid more than its
peers, while performing moderately worse. The adviser based its
analysis on 29 similarly sized companies, including four in
consumer products and six in movies and entertainment. </p>
<p>Glass Lewis also cited the role of Orin Smith on the audit
and governance committee of Washington Mutual when that lender
was seized by regulators in September 2008. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, said state and federal governments will play an
important role in the safe and efficient development of North
American (PAL) crude and natural-gas resources that are transforming
the continent''s energy supplies. </p>
<p>Development of petroleum sources in the U.S. and Canada
from shale-gas formations, tight-oil reservoirs, oil sands and
deep-water projects will help shape projects globally, Chief
Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said today at CERAWeek, a
Houston conference held by IHS Cambridge Energy Research
Associates. </p>
<p>Our industry has not and cannot achieve these results
alone, however, Tillerson said. Government has an
indispensable role in this quest. </p>
<p>Policies related to access, taxes and regulations can have
profound implications on the industry''s ability to develop
new resources and share the enormous economic benefits they
promise, Tillerson said. New technologies such as hydraulic
fracturing have allowed the industry to tap previously
unavailable resources, he said. </p>
<p>The industry is working to develop Canadian oil sands,
Tillerson said. In 2010, unconventional resources contributed
more than $76 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product, he
said. </p>
<p>Gas demand is expected to rise by 60 percent by 2040,
Tillerson said, and gas will satisfy more than 25 percent of
global energy needs, Tillerson said. </p>
<h2>Energy''s Role </h2>
<p>Policy makers with various political backgrounds are
recognizing that energy is essential to growth, Tillerson said,
citing President Barack Obama''s call to develop every available
source of U.S. energy. Some American and Canadian citizens have
questions about new unconventional development, Tillerson said. </p>
<p>Exxon has advocated disclosure of fluids used in fracturing
in the U.S., working with other companies and state regulatory
agencies as they set up the FracFocus website, Tillerson said.
That allows companies to voluntarily submit fluid data on
drilling, he said. </p>
<p>We will be calling on our government and industry
partners to implement in Europe the same level of openness and
accountability that FracFocus has delivered in the United
States, Tillerson said. </p>
<p>Tillerson said the recent decision that went against
TransCanada Corp. (TRP)''s Keystone XL pipeline was a product of
political calculations in Washington. That project would have
benefited both the U.S. and Canada by linking oil-sands output
with refining operations, he said. </p>
<h2>Multiple Agencies </h2>
<p>Regulation once gave U.S. businesses rules on how to get
things done, Tillerson said, while now the process involves
multiple and duplicative agencies that can be an obstacle. </p>
<p>It has become the tool of opponents of development and
special interest groups, Tillerson said. </p>
<p>The Canadian approach to regulation is very rigorous,
while being defined and enabling issues to be worked through
during a process, Tillerson said. </p>
<p>Government can help speed up technological innovations by
supporting research, he said. It should let markets operate
openly, not picking energy winners and losers through subsidies,
mandates and punitive taxes, he said. </p>
<p>Government is most effective when it acts as a research
catalyst, not as a venture capitalist, Tillerson said. </p>

<p>The Morgan Stanley (MS) executive accused
of assaulting a New York cab driver is charged with violating a
Connecticut hate-crime law that has been used to convict one man
for uttering a racial epithet and another for shouting a gay
slur while threatening to set a man on fire. </p>
<p>William Bryan Jennings, 45, arrived today at Connecticut
Superior Court in Stamford where he is expected to enter a plea.
He is accused of calling the Egyptian-born driver, Mohamed
Ammar, 44, an expletive and saying I''m going to kill you. You
should go back to your country during a dispute over a fare.
The hate-crime law brings the same five-year maximum sentence as
the assault charge. </p>
<p>You can''t punish somebody merely through speech, but you
can punish him when he''s threatening to beat people up, Martin
B. Margulies, a professor at Quinnipiac University School of Law
in Hamden, Connecticut, said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Jennings, who served as the bank''s bond-underwriting chief
in the U.S. before he was placed on leave, was charged Feb. 29
in the December incident. He''s accused of attacking Ammar with a
2 1/2-inch blade at the end of a 40-mile ride from New York to
the banker''s Darien home. </p>
<p>The Connecticut hate-crime statute, signed into law in
2000, makes it a felony to cause or threaten physical damage to
a person or to property with a specific intent to intimidate or
harass a person because of the actual or perceived race,
religion, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation or gender
identity or expression of such other person. </p>
<h2>No Threat </h2>
<p>Jennings''s lawyer, Eugene J. Riccio, declined to comment on
the bias charge. Jennings denied threatening to kill Ammar or
telling him to go back to his country, according to the banker''s
statement to the police. </p>
<p>The state hate-crime law is one of the very few crimes
where motive enters into the definition of the offense,
Margulies said. The test is whether you perceive your victim
to belong to certain ethnicity. </p>
<p>In Connecticut, there were 243 arrests and 33 convictions
under the hate-crime statute from 2007 to 2011, according to
Rhonda Stearley-Hebert, a spokeswoman for the State Judicial
Branch office. </p>
<p>In 2010, an appeals panel upheld the jury conviction of a
man who used anti-gay slurs when he tried to set another man on
fire as they drank in a wooded area in Willimantic. The victim,
Scott Beattie, had taken off at least some of his clothes and
had earlier been drinking with a gay man, according to the
decision. </p>
<h2>Already Home </h2>
<p>The jury reasonably could have determined that the
defendant had the requisite specific intent to intimidate or to
harass Beattie on the basis of Beattie''s actual or perceived
sexual orientation, the court wrote. </p>
<p>In 2007, a Connecticut appeals panel found that the hate-
crime law wasn''t unconstitutionally too broad or vague as
applied to a defendant convicted of violating it. The court said
the law protects against true threats. </p>
<p>In a 2003 incident in Stamford High School''s parking lot
that gave rise to that case, a white man used a racial epithet
and said, This is a white man''s neighborhood to a black man
while making two fists. </p>
<p>In the case of Jennings, who had attended a bank holiday
party at a Manhattan hotel before hailing Ammar''s cab, the
incident began when he refused to pay the agreed-upon $204 fare
when they arrived in the driveway of his $3.4 million home,
Ammar said. </p>
<p>Jennings said he did not feel like paying because he
was already home, Ammar said. The banker offered to pay $50,
Ammar said, while Jennings told police the driver demanded $294
and that he offered to pay $160. </p>
<h2>Fight Ensued </h2>
<p>Ammar said after the banker refused to pay, he backed out
of the driveway to seek a police officer. Ammar said he had
tried to call 911 but was hampered by poor cellular reception in
the wealthy Fairfield County suburb. A fight ensued as they
drove through Darien. That was when Jennings made the threats
and allegedly cut Ammar, according to the police report, filed
in state court in Stamford. </p>
<p>Jennings said the driver cut his hand trying to grab the
knife from him, which he said he wielded because he feared he
was being abducted, possibly back to the city. Ammar denied he
tried to take Jennings back to New York. </p>
<p>The banker, who eventually fled the cab and turned himself
in two weeks later after a vacation in Florida, was charged with
second-degree assault, theft of services and intimidation by
bias or bigotry. The charge for not paying the cab fare is a
misdemeanor with a maximum three-month sentence. </p>
<h2>Higher Penalty </h2>
<p>Michael Lawlor, undersecretary in the state Office of
Policy and Management, co-sponsored the hate-crime bill when he
was a state representative. The law assigns a higher penalty to
assault or vandalism that is motivated by hatred, he said in a
phone interview. </p>
<p>It''s not a crime to hate people, he said. You can
hate people all you want. </p>
<p>He said the state would have to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt as to why Jennings allegedly picked this victim. </p>
<p>If it was just over the cab fare, then it would not be a
hate crime, Lawlor said. If they were doing it and claiming
self-defense, that''s another law, too. </p>
<h2>Racial Slurs </h2>
<p>Max Simmons, a criminal-defense and civil-rights lawyer in
New Haven, said in a phone interview he could recall only one
client being charged with it, a case that was dropped for
reasons unrelated to the alleged racial slurs used. </p>
<p>It has to be a pretty clear-cut case, Simmons said.
There''s always a First Amendment challenge lurking in the
background of a statute like that. </p>
<p>Under the hate-crime law, Ammar would also be able to sue
Jennings for damages. In May 2011, in a lawsuit in the same
court as Jennings''s criminal case, such a claim was allowed to
go forward against a Greenwich police officer. In that case, a
black man who worked as a livery driver said he was racially
profiled when he was stopped while driving a client''s Mercedes. </p>
<p>The case is State of Connecticut v. Jennings 12-0176761,
Superior Court for the State of Connecticut (Stamford). </p>

<p>A Morgan Stanley (MS) unit and Wainbridge
Capital Ltd. reached a joint-venture agreement to develop London
real estate, the two companies said in a statement today. </p>
<p>The partnership will seek to unlock significant value
through redevelopment, refurbishment and other asset management
initiatives from office buildings in London, according to the
statement. </p>
<p>A fund of funds managed by Morgan Stanley Alternative
Investment Partners will take a 49 percent stake in FC200, a
164,000 square foot office development at Park Royal in west
London, as the first joint project. It was bought by
Wainbridge''s Global Opportunities London fund in September and
both sides will pay an undisclosed amount to complete the
building, according to the statement. </p>
<p>There are still significant investment opportunities in
the London office market, and the relationship can enable our
investors to benefit from Wainbridge''s expertise, David Boyle,
executive director and portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley AIP
Real Estate, said in the statement. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, named Justin Gmelich global
head of credit trading as part of management changes in the wake
of high-level departures. </p>
<p>Jeffrey L. Verschleiser will become global head of mortgage
trading, according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg

Donald R. Mullen until his departure earlier this year. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, confirmed the
memo''s contents. </p>
<p>Paul Russo, Michael Daffey, and R. Martin Chavez were named
co-chief operating officers of the equities division, according

<p>The promotions follow the departure earlier this year of
David B. Heller, who was the securities division chief with the
most experience in equities trading. Enrico Gaglioti was named
global head of equities sales, and John Willian will be global
head of securities services, futures, and clearing, according to
the memo. </p>
<p>Ashok Varadhan, who was recently named to the firm''s
management committee, will become global head of macro trading,
encompassing currencies, interest-rate products and fixed-

evaluating its experimental treatment for heart disease because
it didn''t work. </p>
<p>Carbo Ceramics Inc. (CRR)  rallied 4.3 percent to
$102.23, the highest price since Feb. 2. The maker of ceramic
granules was raised to equal-weight from underweight at Morgan
Stanley, which said demand concerns are overblown. The Equal-
weight rating means Morgan Stanley expects the stock''s risk-
adjusted total return in the next 12 to 18 months to be in line
with the average for industry companies covered by the analyst. </p>
<p>Dynegy Inc. (DYN)  fell 35 percent to 50 cents, extending
a record low. The third-largest independent U.S. power
producer''s bankruptcy should be taken over by a court-approved
trustee who will better protect creditors, the U.S. Trustee
monitoring the case for the federal government said in court
papers. </p>
<p>Equifax Inc. (EFX)  had the biggest gain in the Standard
 Poor''s 500 Index, climbing 3.4 percent to $44.09. The provider
of consumer-credit information was increased to buy from neutral

poised to deliver sustainable above-average growth in sales
and earnings. </p>
<p>Fuelcell Energy Inc. (FCEL)  rose 7.3 percent, the most

<p>Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG)  added 2.6 percent to $48.19,
the highest price since December 2007. The biggest U.S.

from $46 by Citigroup Inc., which said the company''s retail
sales have increased 16 percent to 18 percent so far in the
first quarter. </p>
<p>Orexigen Therapeutics Inc. (OREX)  increased 19 percent,
the most since Sept. 21, to $4.39. The drugmaker, which is
developing obesity treatments, was raised to buy from neutral at
Bank of America Corp. </p>
<p>Pacific Capital Bancorp (PCBC)  rose the most in the
Russell 2000 Index, surging 57 percent to $45.03. The Santa
Barbara, California-based bank holding company agreed to be

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is tapping a gusher of data to achieve its 2015 growth
targets, Chief Executive Officer Virginia Ginni Rometty said
in her first annual letter to shareholders. </p>
<p>The world''s largest computer-services provider is well on
track to its goal of generating at least $20 a share in
operating earnings by 2015, up from $13.44 last year, Rometty
reiterated in the 2011 annual report published over the weekend. </p>
<p>Rometty became the first female CEO in the company''s 100-
year history in January. She succeeded Sam Palmisano, inheriting
a five-year plan that includes boosting software to half of
IBM''s earnings, with a focus on programs that help businesses
analyze and project trends, as well as on cloud computing and
emerging growth markets. Palmisano remains as chairman. </p>
<p>We are uniquely positioned to deliver the benefits of a
vast new natural resource -- a gusher of data from both man-made
and natural systems that can now be tapped to help businesses
and institutions succeed in an increasingly complex and dynamic
global economy, Rometty wrote. Our strong strategic
positioning, solid balance sheet, recurring revenue, robust
profit streams and unmatched global reach give us confidence
that we will achieve success in the next five years. </p>
<p>IBM rose 0.2 percent to $201 at the close in New York. Last
week, the Armonk, New York-based company''s shares closed above
$200 for the first time, factoring in stock splits. </p>
<h2>Job Cuts </h2>
<p>IBM will continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and
invest in market opportunities and drive productivity,
according to the annual report. The company said costs from job
cuts will increase this year to the level they were in 2010. </p>
<p>The company will continue to rebalance its workforce to
opportunities and skills aligned with its key investments and
hire resources to drive growth initiatives, IBM said. </p>
<p>IBM didn''t provide details of job reductions. In 2010, it
booked $641 million of workforce rebalancing charges. That
figure fell to $440 million in 2011, the annual report shows. </p>
<p>About 1,650 jobs were cut in the U.S. and Canada last
month, according to an employee advocacy group Alliance@IBM,
which has been trying to organize IBM employees. Redundant
employees may apply for other positions within IBM, severance
documents show. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s vaccine Prevnar 13,
used to prevent pneumococcal diseases, was effective in children
ages 5 to 17 in a study that may help increase its use, the
company said. </p>
<p>Pfizer has been seeking to increase sales of Prevnar 13 by
expanding use beyond the approved groups of children 6 months to
5 years and adults older than 50. The treatment was New York-
based Pfizer''s third-best-selling medicine in 2011, with $3.66
billion in revenue. It will be Pfizer''s top product in 2013,
according to an average of two analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>We are excited about the potential to further define the
clinical utility of Prevnar 13 with the aim of seeking to
broaden prevention efforts to additional age groups, said
Emilio Emini, chief scientific officer of vaccine research for
Pfizer. The study examined 598 patients ages 5 to 17 years old. </p>
<p>Pneumoccocal diseases are most dangerous for the very young
and very old, as well as people with heart and lung diseases,
diabetes, or HIV, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta. </p>
<p>Among children older than 5, the most likely to benefit
from the vaccine are those with conditions that put them at more
risk from illnesses, like heart and lung concerns, diabetes, or
HIV, said Robert Frenck, director of clinical medicine at the
Cincinnati Children''s Hospital Medical Center and lead author of
the study. </p>
<p>Along with expanded approvals, Pfizer is seeking to have
Prevnar 13 added to the CDC''s vaccine schedule for people over
50, which would increase use of the treatment. </p>
<p>Pfizer gained less than 1 percent to $21.54 at the close in
New York. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) paid Sam Palmisano $31.8 million in 2011, his last year as
chief executive officer before he was succeeded by Virginia Ginni Rometty in January. </p>
<p>Palmisano''s pay is little changed from the $31.7 million he
earned in 2010, according to a regulatory filing today. Annual
compensation includes salary, bonus, stock awards and options.
Rometty earned $8.34 million last year, when she was head of
sales and marketing, up from $6.4 million in 2010. </p>
<p>Palmisano, 60, boosted earnings during his tenure by
focusing on software and services and selling off assets
including the company''s personal-computer business. He was
Armonk, New York-based IBM''s longest-serving CEO who doesn''t

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, will hold a meeting of its
board in India for the first time as it completes a series of
trips to key developing markets. </p>
<p>The 12-member board, which typically holds a meeting every
year outside the U.S., will travel to New Delhi and Mumbai this
month, said Edward Naylor, a spokesman for the New York-based
bank. Directors have previously convened in China, Russia, the
Middle East and Brazil. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, who is also
chairman of the board, has made expansion in fast-growing
markets like Brazil, Russia, India and China -- the so-called
BRIC countries -- a priority. Goldman Sachs is hiring fastest in
China, India and Brazil, Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn,
who is also a board member, said at a presentation to investors
last year. </p>
<p>India native Lakshmi Mittal, the 61-year-old chairman and
CEO of steel company ArcelorMittal (MT), has served on the Goldman
Sachs board since 2008. He is the world''s 18th-richest person,
with a fortune worth $22.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg
Billionaires Index. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs lost money in Asia last year for the first
time since 2008 because of markdowns on the firm''s stock
investments in the region, especially a $517 million pretax loss
on the value of its stake in Industrial  Commercial Bank of
China Ltd., the firm disclosed in a filing earlier this month. </p>
<p>The Times of India reported Goldman Sachs''s plans to hold a
board meeting in the country earlier today, citing Sonjoy Chatterjee, chairman and co-CEO of Goldman Sachs India.
Chatterjee, who joined Goldman Sachs from ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC), was
named to his current role a year ago. </p>

<p>Michael Feroli, chief U.S.
economist at JPMorgan Chase  Co., said he cut his outlook for
growth during the first quarter to 1.5 percent from 2 percent
because of weak spending even as the labor market has improved. </p>
<p>Slower productivity growth is responsible for job gains
amid a drop in U.S. growth from 3 percent in the fourth quarter,
Feroli said today on Bloomberg Television''s  Bloomberg
Surveillance with Tom Keene. We have a fair amount of
spending data right now for the first quarter for consumers and
business investment. It is adding up to a softer number. </p>
<p>Employers in the U.S. took on 227,000 workers in February,
completing the best six months for payroll growth since 2006,
Labor Department figures showed last week. U.S. growth is
expected to slow to 2.1 percent in the first quarter, according
to the average of 81 economists surveyed last month by Bloomberg
News. </p>
<p>The economy may see probably an acceleration in the
second quarter if energy prices can level off, Feroli said.
If 1.5 percent were to persist, it would be something to worry
about. But it could be a hiccup, hopefully in the pattern of
better growth. </p>
<p>Federal Reserve policy makers, who meet tomorrow, are
unlikely to start a third asset purchase program, known as
quantitative easing, in part because core inflation, excluding
food and energy prices, is near 2 percent, Feroli said. </p>
<p>I do not think we are going to get QE tomorrow, Feroli
said. Something people are not talking about enough is that
core inflation has stabilized pretty close to the Fed''s target.
That is not arguing for more accommodation. </p>
<p>Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said Feb. 29 that the labor
market remains far from normal and repeated that the main
interest rate is likely to stay exceptionally low at least
through the end of 2014. </p>
<p>Trade will weigh on first quarter growth more than we had
anticipated, JPMorgan''s Daniel Silver said in a note. </p>

<p>OAO Mobile Telesystems (MBT), Russia''s
biggest mobile operator, said it more than doubled fourth-
quarter profit from a year earlier even as revenue fell by
cutting financing expenses and streamline sales. </p>
<p>Net income climbed to $393 million from $156 million a year
earlier, Mobile Telesystems said today in a statement. That beat
the $390 million average estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Revenue fell 0.4 percent to $2.98 billion, according to the
statement. Adjusted operating income before depreciation and
amortization climbed 10 percent to $1.28 billion, while the
Oibda margin expanded to 42.8 percent from 38.7 percent. </p>
<p>The Moscow-based operator expects annual revenue growth of

expenditures are planned at 20 percent to 22 percent of revenue
this year, and may amount to 15 percent to 18 percent in
2013-15, according to the statement. </p>

<p>William Bryan Jennings, the Morgan
Stanley (MS) U.S. bond-underwriting chief accused of stabbing a New
York cab driver of Middle Eastern descent over a fare, pleaded
not guilty to assault and hate-crime charges. </p>
<p>Jennings''s lawyer, Eugene J. Riccio, entered the plea on
his client''s behalf March 9 before Connecticut Superior Court
Judge Robert L. Genuario in Stamford. Jennings wore a blue suit,
white shirt and patterned tie to the proceeding, which lasted
less than a minute. He and Riccio left the courthouse without
speaking to reporters and drove away in a pickup truck. His next
court date is April 12. </p>
<p>Jennings, 45, is accused of attacking the driver, Mohamed
Ammar, on Dec. 22 with a 2 1/2-inch blade and using racial slurs
after a 40-mile ride from New York to the banker''s Darien,
Connecticut, home. The hate-crime count brings the same five-
year maximum prison sentence as the assault charge. </p>
<p>Jennings, who had attended a bank holiday party at a
boutique hotel in Manhattan before hailing the cab, refused to
pay the $204 fare upon arriving in his driveway, the driver
said. Jennings said he did not feel like paying because he
was already home, Ammar, 44, told police. The banker offered to
pay $50, he said. Jennings told police Ammar demanded $294 and
he offered to pay $160. </p>
<p>Ammar, a native of Egypt, said that after the banker
refused to pay, he backed out of the driveway of the $3.4
million home to seek a police officer. Ammar said he had tried
to call 911 but was hampered by poor mobile reception in the
wealthy Fairfield County suburb. </p>
<p>The banker called him an expletive and said, I''m going to
kill you. You should go back to your country, according to the
police report. A fight ensued as they drove through Darien, and
Jennings allegedly cut Ammar, police said. </p>
<p>Jennings said the driver cut his hand trying to grab the
knife from him, which he said he wielded because he feared he
was being abducted, possibly back to the city. Ammar denied he
tried to take Jennings back to New York. </p>
<p>Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley, said March 2 that Jennings has been put on leave. </p>
<p>The case is State of Connecticut v. Jennings 12-0176761,

<p>Anonymous'' Hacker Won''t Face Prosecution for Gun, Marijuana </p>
<p>Hector Xavier Monsegur, the hacker cooperating with a
government probe, won''t face prosecution for several alleged
offenses, including attempted drug-dealing and computer crimes
dating to when he was a teenager, according to his agreement
with the U.S. </p>
<p>The plea agreement, made public March 9, says Monsegur, 28,
won''t face federal charges for hacking the website of an online
casino, trying to sell four pounds of marijuana in 2003 and one
pound in 2010, receiving stolen property, and gun possession. </p>
<p>The U.S. also said Monsegur won''t be prosecuted for using
an employer''s credit card to make $15,000 in unauthorized
charges. The government said Monsegur''s hacking activities date
back to 1999. Some of the alleged criminal acts are too old to
be charged or are outside federal jurisdiction, according to the
agreement. </p>
<p>Monsegur, a former member of the Anonymous, Internet Feds
and LulzSec hacker groups, began secretly cooperating with U.S.
investigators after his arrest on June 7, according to a court
transcript. After his arrest, Monsegur began working around
the clock to inform on his colleagues, prosecutors told a
judge. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said in the agreement that Monsegur faces
possible retaliation from the targets of his cooperation and may
require federal witness protection. </p>
<p>Monsegur, who pleaded guilty Aug. 15, began cooperating
with U.S. authorities, including Federal Bureau of Investigation
agents, after his arrest, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Pastore
told U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska at a court hearing in
August, an unsealed transcript shows. </p>
<p>Monsegur was charged with computer crimes by U.S.
prosecutors in five districts in four states, court records

<h2>Dynegy Transfer of Coal Assets Was Fraudulent, Examiner Says </h2>
<p>Dynegy Inc. (DYN)''s transfer of coal-fired power plants from a
unit it later put into bankruptcy was fraudulent and harmed
creditors, a court-ordered investigation found. </p>
<p>Throughout the planning and execution of the prepetition
restructuring, the Dynegy Inc. board favored paths that
benefited Dynegy Inc. and its stockholders to the detriment of
Dynegy Holdings and its creditors, examiner Susheel Kirpalani
said in report filed March 9 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Poughkeepsie, New York. </p>
<p>Dynegy, based in Houston, put units including Dynegy
Holdings LLC into bankruptcy in November with a restructuring
agreement backed by a group of bondholders including Franklin
Advisors Inc. and Avenue Capital Group, according to court
documents. Kirpalani, a lawyer at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart 
Sullivan LLP (496224L), was appointed in January to investigate a
reorganization that took place before the bankruptcy. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy filing came after bondholders sued the
company over the reorganization, saying it moved assets out of
their reach to benefit shareholders of the Dynegy parent,
including billionaire Carl Icahn. </p>
<p>Dynegy had opposed naming an examiner, saying it was an
attempt to gain negotiating leverage over the company. </p>
<p>The boards of both Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings take the
examiner''s findings seriously and intend to review the full
report, once it is made available, to determine its impact,

<h2>BofA Accuses MBIA of Harassment in Fight Over CEO Deposition </h2>
<p>Bank of America Corp. asked a judge to block Chief
Executive Officer Brian Moynihan''s deposition in MBIA Inc. (MBI)''s
lawsuit against the bank, accusing the bond insurer of
harassment. </p>
<p>MBIA''s attempt to depose Moynihan is intended to impose
unnecessary burdens on Bank of America and the CEO, the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender argued in seeking a
protective order to block the deposition. </p>
<p>We have evidence this effort to depose Brian Moynihan is
for harassment purposes, Jonathan Rosenberg, a lawyer for the
bank, said March 9 at a hearing in Manhattan. It is clearly
disruptive to Bank of America''s business. </p>
<p>MBIA sued Bank of America''s Countrywide Financial unit in
2008 over mortgage loans. MBIA agreed to guarantee payments to
investors that bought securities backed by pools of the lender''s
loans, which MBIA claims didn''t live up to their promised
quality. </p>
<p>MBIA, based in Armonk, New York, said in court papers that
Bank of America''s request for a protective order is
frivolous and called Moynihan an appropriate witness with
knowledge relevant to the company''s claims. </p>
<p>New York State Judge Eileen Bransten didn''t rule on the
dispute at the hearing. </p>
<p>The case is MBIA Insurance Corp. v. Countrywide Home Loans
Inc., 602825-2008, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>
<p>MBIA''s Brown Conducted Improper'' Stock Trading, Lawyer Says </p>
<p>MBIA Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jay Brown conducted
improper stock trades, a lawyer for banks suing the insurer
alleged in a Manhattan federal court hearing. </p>
<p>Brown started buying MBIA stock in November and December
2008 after learning New York''s insurance regulator had changed
its view about a restructuring of the company, Robert Giuffra, a
lawyer for the banks, said at the hearing March 9. </p>
<p>When the restructuring was announced, the stock popped,
Giuffra said, adding: That trading was improper. Marc
Kasowitz, a lawyer for MBIA, called Giuffra''s claim
irresponsible. </p>
<p>After the hearing, Giuffra, a partner at Sullivan 
Cromwell LLP, declined to elaborate on his accusation. Both
sides were in court over a dispute regarding the exchange of
evidence in lawsuits filed over the 2009 restructuring. </p>

<h2>New Suits </h2>
<h2>Cantor Fitzgerald Sued by Pension Fund Over BGC Debt Deal </h2>
<p>Cantor Fitzgerald LP was sued by a pension fund investor in
its BGC Partners unit over debt and stock offerings that it
claims enriched Cantor''s Chief Executive Officer Howard Lutnick
at the expense of shareholders. </p>
<p>International Painters and Allied Trades Industry Pension
Fund said that the company made a $150 million debt transaction
at an unfair interest rate that diluted the shareholders''
stock, according to a complaint filed March 9 in New York State
Supreme Court. </p>
<p>BGCP (BGCP), then known as eSpeed Inc., was spun off as a public
company by Cantor in 1999. After a merger in 2008, the company
became BGC partners. The $150 million debt deal was made at the
time of the merger at a 5.19 percent interest rate. That debt
was later replaced by notes at an 8.79 percent rate that could
be converted into stock, thus diluting the shares, according to
the complaint. </p>
<p>Cantor owns 56 percent of BGC Partners'' Class A stock and
100 percent of its Class B shares, according to the suit. BGCP
is an electronic brokerage company based in New York. </p>
<p>The complaint also names Cantor directors Stephen Curwood,
John Dalton, Barry Sloane and Albert Weis as defendants. </p>
<p>Sandra Lee, a spokeswoman for New York-based Cantor, didn''t
reply to messages seeking comment on the suit. </p>
<p>The case is International Painters and Allied Trades
Industry Pension Fund v. Cantor Fitzgerald LP, 650736-2012,
Supreme Court of the State of New York. </p>
<h2>Buffett''s NetJets Countersued by U.S. for Unpaid Taxes </h2>
<p>NetJets Inc., the private-plane company owned by Warren
Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B), was countersued by the U.S.
over $366 million in taxes and penalties. </p>
<p>NetJets in November sued the U.S., saying the federal
government had wrongly imposed taxes, interest and penalties
totaling more than $642.7 million. </p>
<p>Claiming the federal Internal Revenue Service wrongfully
assessed a so-called ticket tax -- an excise tax on payments
made in exchange for air transportation -- to private aircraft
owners maintaining their own planes, the Columbus, Ohio-based
company demanded refunds and abatements. </p>
<p>The federal government, in a revised answer and countersuit
filed March 9 in federal court in Columbus, rejected NetJets''
claims and alleged that four of the company''s units owe unpaid
taxes and penalties. </p>
<p>NetJets Aviation Inc. owes more than $302.1 million, and
another unit, NetJets International, is liable for $52.9
million, the U.S. said. Executive Jet Management Inc. owes $10
million while NetJets Large Aircraft owes $1.19 million, the
U.S. claimed. </p>
<p>NetJets had no immediate comment on the countersuit. </p>
<p>The case is NetJets Large Aircraft Inc. v. U.S., 11-
cv-01023, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Ohio
(Columbus). </p>

<h2>Trials/Appeals </h2>
<h2>Ex-GE Manager Claims Insanity in Death of Employee''s Husband </h2>
<p>Hemy Neuman, a GE Energy manager, put on a fake beard,
drove a rented minivan to a suburban Atlanta day care center and
shot an ex-JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) banker dropping off his son,
defense lawyers said. </p>
<p>Neuman''s lawyers have told jurors in Georgia state court in
Decatur that their client was temporarily insane and unable to
stop himself from killing Russell Sneiderman, 36, the husband of
a female subordinate at GE. Prosecutors in the trial, which has
drawn intense local attention, contend Neuman was aware he was
committing murder in front of the Dunwoody Prep preschool. </p>
<p>According to testimony last week by Adriana Flores, a
forensic psychologist, Neuman was sexually obsessed with
Sneiderman''s wife, Andrea, 35. He believed he was acting on
orders from an angel with the voice of singer Olivia Newton John
and a demon who sounded like Barry White, Flores said. </p>
<p>Neuman, 49, is charged with premeditated murder and
possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.
DeKalb County District Attorney Bob James has said he will seek
a life sentence without parole. Neuman''s lawyers finished
presenting witnesses March 8. </p>
<p>A psychiatrist testifying March 9 for the prosecution,
Pamela Crawford, told the jury that some of Neuman''s symptoms,
such as a memory lapse, were consistent with lying. </p>
<p>Neuman hasn''t testified during the trial. He sat as another
defense forensic psychiatrist, Tracey Marks, described the
affair that Neuman believed he had with Sneiderman. Marks said
the belief was a sign of mania. </p>
<p>Andrea Sneiderman testified earlier that she didn''t have an
affair with Neuman. She didn''t return calls seeking comment on
the trial this week. Seth Kirschenbaum, her lawyer, didn''t
return a call seeking comment March 8 on the case. </p>
<p>The case is State v. Neuman, 11CR1364-5, Georgia Superior
Court, DeKalb County (Decatur). </p>

<h2>Verdicts/Settlements </h2>
<h2>Wal-Mart Wins South African Lawsuit Contesting Massmart Deal </h2>
<p>A South African appeal court endorsed Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT)''s purchase of a controlling stake in Massmart Holdings
Ltd. (MSM), a deal the government challenged on the grounds it may
cause jobs cuts and hurt local manufacturers. </p>
<p>Judge Dennis Davis, president of the Competition Appeal
Court, handed down the decision at a hearing in Cape Town March
9. </p>
<p>The evidence indicated that consumers will indeed benefit
from lower prices and that these lower prices may, in turn,
generate greater job creation than the job losses that may
result, Davis said. There was insufficient evidence to
conclude that the detrimental effects of the merger would
outweigh the clear benefits to consumers. </p>
<p>Three government ministries and a retail workers'' union
contested a May 31 decision by South Africa''s Competition
Tribunal that authorized Wal-Mart to buy a 51 percent stake in
Johannesburg-based Massmart, South Africa''s biggest food and
general-goods wholesaler. Approval was subject to the companies
promising to refrain from firing employees for two years and
setting up a 100 million-rand ($13.3 million) fund to assist
local suppliers and manufacturers. </p>
<p>The government welcomed the court''s approach, saying its
concerns had been recognized and could be addressed by the
study. There was scope for different conditions to be imposed on
the takeover, it said. </p>
<p>While Wal-Mart and Massmart respectfully disagree with
the court on a link between the job cuts and the transaction,
the process to rehire the workers has started, Massmart
spokesman Brian Leroni said at the court. </p>
<p>Wal-Mart and Massmart welcome the ruling, he said.
All three arms of the competition authority have now endorsed
the merger. The process has been rigorous. We welcome the idea
of a study as a good way to help us understand how to deploy
these funds. </p>

Workers Union v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Massmart Holdings
Ltd., 111/CAC/Jul11. </p>

<h2>Sernam Must Repay 642 Million Euros in French Aid, EU Says </h2>
<p>Sernam SA, a French rail and road transport operator, must
repay 642 million euros ($849 million) in illegal aid given by
the French state to the former unit of state-owned railway
operator Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Francais, or SNCF. </p>
<p>Sernam was ordered to pay back 41 million euros in 2004 and
didn''t, prompting European Union regulators to open an
investigation in 2008 that also covered the company''s spinoff in
2005, for which the French state provided 503 million euros to
help in the restructuring, the European Commission said. </p>
<p>The French authorities failed in their obligation to
recover the 41 million euros in illegal aid, the European
Commission said March 9 in a statement. Sernam must reimburse
that amount as well as all other aid which Sernam benefited
from, or a total of over 642 million euros plus interest. </p>
<p>Spokeswomen for the French Finance Ministry and Sernam
declined to comment immediately on the decision. </p>

<h2>Kinder Morgan Buyout Was Most Popular Docket on Bloomberg </h2>
<p>A lawsuit over Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMP)''s proposed $21.1 billion
buyout of rival pipeline operator El Paso Corp. (EP),  was the most-
read docket on the Bloomberg Law system last week. </p>
<p>A lawyer for El Paso investors argued the deal should be
barred because it was tainted by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s
conflicting interests in the deal. Goldman Sachs, which holds a
19 percent stake in Houston-based Kinder Morgan, served as an
adviser to El Paso on the acquisition offer. </p>
<p>Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine rejected that
argument Feb. 29. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells
Fargo  Co. joined U.S. banks raising dividends and authorizing
share repurchases after passing the Federal Reserve''s test of
how lenders would fare in an economic decline. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, will increase its
quarterly dividend 20 percent to 30 cents a share, the New York-
based company said today in a statement. The bank also
authorized a $15 billion stock-repurchase program, with $12
billion approved for 2012. Wells Fargo  Co., the most valuable
U.S. lender, increased its quarterly dividend by 83 percent to
22 cents a share, according to a statement. </p>
<p>The Fed is requiring the nation''s largest banks to show
they have credible plans for maintaining capital and continuing
lending in an economic downturn. The central bank said 15 of the
19 largest U.S. banks could maintain adequate capital levels
even in a recession scenario in which they continue to pay
dividends and buy back stock. </p>
<p>The fact that 15 passed a robust test shows the relative
financial health of the system, said Michael Holland, chairman
and founder of New York-based Holland  Co., which oversees more
than $4 billion including JPMorgan shares. There has been so
much cash built up it almost screams to have some of it shared
with investors. </p>
<p>The four firms that fell short by at least one measure
under the Fed''s stressed scenario were Citigroup Inc. (C), MetLife
Inc. (MET), Ally Financial Inc., and SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) Citigroup and
Ally plan to resubmit their capital plans this year, according
to statements from the lenders. </p>
<h2>Share Repurchases </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s $15 billion in share repurchases would be
enough to buy back about 346 million shares at today''s closing
price. That represents about 9 percent of shares outstanding.
JPMorgan rose 7 percent, the most since November, to $43.39 in
New York. The bank was the biggest gainer on the 24-company KBW
Bank Index (BKX), which rose 4.6 percent. </p>
<p>We expect to generate significant capital and deploy that
capital to the benefit of our shareholders, JPMorgan Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in the statement. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo (WFC), based in San Francisco, won approval to
increase its share repurchases this year and to redeem certain
trust-preferred securities, according to its statement. The bank
didn''t say how many shares it would repurchase. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo rose 5.8 percent today, while Citigroup gained
6.3 percent. </p>
<p>After almost three years of economic expansion, U.S. banks
have raised profits, rebuilt capital, and increased liquidity
after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008
threatened the financial system. </p>
<h2>Stress Scenario </h2>
<p>The Fed said an unemployment rate of 13 percent, a 50
percent drop in stock prices and a 21 percent decline in house
prices under the stress scenario would produce aggregate losses
of $534 billion over nine quarters. </p>
<p>Even with that blow, the 19 banks would see their Tier 1
common capital ratio -- a measure of bank strength against loss
-- fall to 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013 in the
hypothetical scenario, above the 5 percent minimum the Fed
required. The ratio was 10.1 percent in the third quarter of
last year. </p>
<p>It is night and day, Jason Goldberg, senior analyst at
Barclays Capital Inc. in New York, said before the announcement.
In 2009, about half the banks failed the stress test. The
industry''s capital position is higher today, and better quality.
There is a lot less leverage. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, said regulators didn''t object to its plan to repurchase
common stock and potentially raise the dividend. The bank''s
statement didn''t give further details. </p>
<h2>Smith Barney </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) said regulators didn''t object to its capital
plan, including the potential purchase of an additional piece of
the Smith Barney retail brokerage joint venture with Citigroup.
Morgan Stanley has the option to buy a 14 percent stake in May,
increasing its ownership to 65 percent, and can buy the business
outright over the next two years. </p>
<p>Regional banks announced plans to boost payouts. U.S.
Bancorp, Minnesota''s largest bank, increased its quarterly
dividend 56 percent to 19.5 cents a share and may buy back as
much as 100 million shares, it said in a statement. BBT Corp. (BBT),
based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, raised its quarterly
dividend 25 percent to 20 cents a share, according to a
statement today. </p>
<p>KeyCorp (KEY), the Cleveland-based lender, announced a $344
million share buyback and said it may raise its quarterly
dividend to 5 cents from 3 cents. PNC Financial Services Group
Inc. (PNC), based in Pittsburgh, said regulators had no objection to a
plan to raise its dividend. The board may consider an increase
at a meeting next month, PNC said. </p>
<h2>American Express </h2>
<p>American Express Co. (AXP), the biggest credit-card issuer by
customer spending, plans to boost its quarterly dividend 11
percent to 20 cents a share, and may repurchase as much as $5
billion of its stock within the next year, according to a
filing. The lender said it may buy back $4 billion of shares
this year and $1 billion in the first quarter of 2013. </p>
<p>Regions Financial Corp. (RF), the Birmingham, Alabama-based
lender, plans to sell $900 million of its common stock to help
repay $3.5 billion of federal bailout funds. Regions said the
action was included in its capital plan submitted as part of the
stress tests, according to a statement. </p>
<p>The Fed also subjected the six largest banks to a potential
global financial market shock. JPMorgan led the banks with an
estimated $27.7 billion in projected losses from mark-to-market
changes, credit valuation adjustments and counterparty default
losses, according to the Fed'' scenario. The six banks had a
projected $116 billion in trading and counterparty losses,
larger than the 19 banks subjected to Fed''s stress tests had in
any lending area. </p>

biggest U.S. banks under the Federal Reserve''s stress scenario. </p>
<p>JPMorgan had an estimated $27.7 billion in projected losses
from mark-to-market changes, credit valuation adjustments and
counterparty default losses, according to the Fed results
released yesterday. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) had an estimated
$27.1 billion of such losses in the testing. </p>
<p>The Fed is requiring the nation''s largest lenders to show
they have credible plans for maintaining capital and continuing
lending in an economic downturn. The six largest U.S. banks had
a projected $116 billion in trading and counterparty losses,
larger than the 19 banks subjected to Fed''s stress tests had in
any lending area. </p>
<p>The relative size of losses across firms depends not on
nominal portfolio size, but rather on the specific risk
characteristics of each BHC''s trading positions, inclusive of
hedges, the Fed said in the report. BHC stands for bank
holding company. </p>
<p>The Fed''s global financial market shock tested losses from
declines in positions held, counterparty defaults and charges
related to the deterioration of creditworthiness of trading
partners through the end of 2013. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. had a projected $21.1 billion of
trading and counterparty losses, Citigroup Inc. (C) had $20.9
billion, Morgan Stanley (MS) had $12.8 billion and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)
had $6.9 billion. </p>
<h2>Fed''s Assumptions </h2>
<p>JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley
and Wells Fargo all maintained Tier 1 common ratios above the 5
percent required minimum under the Fed''s stress scenario.
Citigroup fell below the 5 percent threshold and said it will
resubmit its capital plan to regulators. </p>
<p>The losses were projected based on trading positions held
by the firms on a single day, generally Nov. 17, 2011, the Fed
said. Losses could have differed perhaps significantly from
choosing a different date. </p>
<p>The shock assumed increases in credit spreads on European
nations and financial institutions, with prices below any
observed levels, the Fed said. Losses tied to the widening of
those spreads largely related to counterparty risk, while direct
mark-to-market charges were relatively small, according to
the report. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) said the Federal
Reserve didn''t object to the firm''s capital plan, including its
potential purchase from Citigroup Inc. of an additional piece of
the banks'' retail brokerage joint venture. </p>
<p>The Fed also didn''t object to the payment of current common
and preferred dividends, New York-based Morgan Stanley said in a
statement today. The firm didn''t say whether it was raising
dividends or buying back stock. </p>
<p>The Fed is requiring the nation''s largest lenders to show
they have credible plans for maintaining capital and continuing
lending in an economic downturn. Morgan Stanley''s Tier 1 common
ratio would drop to a minimum of 5.4 percent in the Fed''s stress
scenario, above the required 5 percent threshold. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has the option to buy a 14 percent stake in
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in May, increasing its ownership to
65 percent, and can buy the business outright over the next two
years. In 2009, the firm bought a controlling stake in the joint
venture, which has more than 17,000 advisers and $1.65 trillion
in client assets. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley would post a net loss of $22.5 through the
end of 2013 under the Fed''s stress scenario, according to the
results released today. That''s the fourth-highest loss among the
19 banks subjected to the review. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs released a statement today after the Fed

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
pay $7 million to resolve regulatory claims it failed to
properly supervise commodities trading accounts, the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission said. </p>
<p>The regulator accused the New York-based firm''s Goldman
Sachs Execution  Clearing LP unit of failing to supervise
subaccounts managed from 2007 to 2009 by a broker-dealer that
had engaged in questionable conduct, the CFTC said in a
statement today. Goldman Sachs agreed to disgorge $1.5 million
in fees and commissions it had collected from the broker and pay
a $5.5 million civil penalty, the agency said. </p>
<p>When registrants become aware of questionable activity,
they must not simply rely on assurances from interested parties
and their representatives, but instead must diligently
investigate, said David Meister, the CFTC''s enforcement chief,
in a statement. As this case indicates, the Commission will
hold registrants accountable if they fail in this regard. </p>
<p>In its first-quarter financial disclosures last year,
Goldman Sachs disclosed its cooperation with an ongoing CFTC
investigation into supervision of a client broker-dealer. The
CFTC said Goldman Sachs knew or should have known that the
client''s subaccounts maintained at GSEC were actually accounts
belonging to customers of the broker-dealer client and not the
client''s proprietary accounts, the company said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is proving
that banks aren''t destined to be also-rans in the $12 trillion
mutual fund business. </p>
<p>The company in 2011 became the first bank to crack the list
of 10 largest U.S. stock and bond fund managers, according to
research firm Strategic Insight. Under global funds chief George Gatch, JPMorgan''s lineup posted higher net sales growth as a
percentage of assets than any other firm with at least $50
billion, even as the bank spurned the charge by investors into
index funds and posted middle-of-the-pack fund returns. </p>
<p>Their performance as an asset gatherer has been
phenomenal, Geoff Bobroff, a mutual fund consultant in East
Greenwich, Rhode Island, said in a telephone interview. Their
fund performance isn''t one to gather a lot of attention, but
they''re solid from a business standpoint. </p>
<p>While rival banks sought to sell asset management units
following the financial crisis, JPMorgan escaped relatively
unscathed, allowing it to spend on the unit and lift long-term
fund assets by 160 percent since 2008. The largest U.S. bank by
assets succeeded in part by courting financial advisers to
complement its in-house sales force and by offering hedge-fund-
like products that have become more popular as investors flee
traditional stock funds. </p>
<p>Funds owned by banks, brokerages and insurers have lost
ground over the past decade to pure money managers such as
Vanguard Group Inc. and Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) </p>
<p>The asset management unit, which also includes money funds
and separate accounts for institutions and wealthy investors,
produced 11 percent of JPMorgan''s $21.5 billion in fourth-
quarter revenue and 8.1 percent of its profit. </p>
<h2>Avenue of Growth'' </h2>
<p>It''s still a relatively small piece in terms of its total
contribution to earnings, but it''s an avenue of growth at a time
when growth in traditional banking has been constricted, said
Shannon Stemm, an analyst at Edward D. Jones  Co. in St. Louis. </p>
<p>Net deposits of $17.9 billion in 2011 were the third-
highest dollar amount in the industry, trailing only those of
Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based Vanguard and Pacific Investment
Management Co. in Newport Beach, California, according to data
compiled by Morningstar Inc. As JPMorgan''s long-term fund assets
grew to $139 billion, the firm climbed four spots on the
research company''s list, leapfrogging rivals including 10th-
ranked OppenheimerFunds Inc. </p>
<p>We want to remain in the top five in net flows every year
for the foreseeable future, Gatch said in an interview at his
New York office. If we do that, we''re well-positioned as the
markets normalize. </p>
<p>Vanguard, with $1.31 trillion in stock and bond mutual
funds as of Dec. 31, is the biggest manager, followed by Los
Angeles-based Capital Group Cos.'' American Funds, Boston''s
Fidelity Investments and Pimco. The data exclude money market
funds. </p>
<h2>Ignoring Indexing </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s success has come through a mix of old and new
strategies. </p>
<p>Gatch, 49, who joined the firm in 1986 and took over the
mutual funds business in 2001, has driven growth in part through
an internal sales force of financial advisers who can sell the
firm''s funds as well as those of rivals, a fading approach that
some observers say creates a conflict of interest. He''s also
pouring resources into capturing business from independent
registered investment advisers, or RIAs, the fastest-growing
competitor to traditional brokers. </p>
<p>Gatch has done it almost exclusively with actively run
funds, another anachronism. U.S. investors pumped 2 1/2 times as
much money into index-tracking funds, including exchange-traded
products, in the past five years as they did into those whose
managers pick securities. That leaves JPMorgan winning more
business in a shrinking portion of the funds industry. </p>
<h2>Imaginative'' and Aggressive'' </h2>
<p>At the same time, the bank has been innovative in designing
funds that bring institutional-style investing options to
individual customers. </p>
<p>In 2005, it opened JPMorgan U.S. Large Cap Core Plus (JLPSX), a so-
called 130/30 fund designed to bet on stocks rising and
declining, and JPMorgan Tax Aware Real Return, which combines
inflation and tax protection. The firm''s go-anywhere absolute-
return bond fund, JPMorgan Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (JSOAX),
was started in October 2008 and has $13 billion in assets. The
$2.45 billion Highbridge Dynamic Commodities Strategy, a fund
that can wager on or against commodity-linked securities, began
in January 2010. </p>
<p>On the whole, they''ve had good performance, they''ve been
imaginative in the funds they''ve opened and been very aggressive
in marketing them, Burton Greenwald, a mutual fund consultant
in Philadelphia, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>In the wake of the global financial crisis, rivals
including Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. (C) cut jobs and
sold off units to raise capital, leaving JPMorgan the biggest
bank by assets by the end of last year''s third quarter. </p>
<h2>Marketing Push </h2>
<p>Its relative good health has allowed the firm to commit
more resources to asset management. Spending on sales and
marketing will rise 10 percent this year compared with 2011,
according to Gatch and his institutional counterpart, Michael
O''Brien. They declined to disclose dollar figures. </p>
<p>In addition to its stock and bond mutual funds, JPMorgan
managed $293 billion for institutions as of Dec. 31, up 15
percent in two years. The company also runs money market funds
and institutional cash products holding about $456 billion. </p>
<p>Gatch casts the rise of JPMorgan funds as a turnaround that
began soon after the bank''s 2006 purchase of Bank One Corp. The
deal led to the largest merger of mutual fund companies to that
point, he said. </p>
<p>The two bank fund families were muddling along, Gatch
said. We changed our expectations and objectives. </p>
<h2>Emphasis on Research </h2>
<p>The combined lineup was trimmed almost immediately by 14
percent, to 122 funds. Sales teams were rebuilt and refocused on
backing up products with market analysis and investing guidance. </p>
<p>We were trying to train people in things that weren''t our
expertise, like practice management and estate planning, Gatch
said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is appealing to RIAs by establishing a reputation
for putting research first and the hard-sell second. </p>
<p>In 2008, the bank hired David Kelly as chief market
strategist and started his Dr. Kelly series of online audio
and video reports. Kelly, who has a Ph.D. in economics from
Michigan State University, held an Aug. 8 conference call for
advisers on Standard  Poor''s downgrade of U.S. debt that
attracted 7,900 participants. The firm also stages invitation-
only seminars for financial advisers in which strategists,
portfolio managers and analysts make presentations and answer
questions. </p>
<p>They realized that top RIAs want to be treated like
institutional clients, said Donald Phillips, managing director
of Chicago-based Morningstar. They want information and
commentary. They don''t want sales pitches. </p>
<h2>Independent Advisory Channel </h2>
<p>Deposits through RIAs grew by 30 percent last year, said
Kristen Chambers, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, who declined to
disclose the dollar volume. </p>
<p>The rise of the RIA has accompanied a decline among
brokerages. The amount of money fee-only RIAs in the U.S.
oversee increased by 25 percent to $1.3 trillion in the three
years through 2010, the latest year for which data were
available, according to Cerulli Associates in Boston. </p>
<p>During the same period, client assets at the four largest
broker-dealers, known as wirehouses, fell by 12 percent to $4.78
trillion even as the firms gradually shifted to fee-based client
accounts. The money overseen by bank-owned broker-dealers such
as JPMorgan''s decreased by 12 percent to $464.2 billion. </p>
<h2>Supermarket'' Era Ends </h2>
<p>The grip of big advisory networks on mutual fund sales has
also loosened. As recently as the 1990s, brokers, banks and
insurance companies dominated the top 20 spots among U.S. mutual
fund families, when money funds are included in total assets.
That changed as competition, regulatory scrutiny and the decline
of the financial supermarket model at companies such as
Citigroup Inc. led many distributors to sell their in-house fund
brands, Loren Fox, a senior research analyst at Strategic
Insight in New York, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The split between the advisory and investment management
businesses gathered momentum in the past five years as
brokerages moved toward a fee-based business, which meant more
of their representatives had a legal duty to act in the best
interest of clients, Bobroff said. </p>
<h2>Potential Conflicts </h2>
<p>As a fiduciary, the conflict is substantial, and thus all
the divorces, Bobroff said. </p>
<p>Citigroup, then part-owner of brokerage Morgan Stanley (MA)
Smith Barney, sold its money management business to Legg Mason
Inc. (LM) in 2005. Merrill Lynch unloaded its mutual funds to
BlackRock Inc. (BLK) in 2006, and Morgan Stanley (MS) sold its retail funds
business to Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) in 2010. </p>
<p>JPMorgan not only hasn''t abandoned proprietary fund sales,
it has beefed up its sales force. The number of financial
advisers at the Chase retail banking network; JPMorgan Private
Bank, which caters to ultra-high-net-worth clients; and JPMorgan
Securities, a brokerage unit, has grown by 48 percent in the
past three years to 5,220. </p>
<p>The internal sales channels account for about 20 percent of
net deposits to JPMorgan''s mutual funds, Gatch said. </p>
<p>Among other top 10 families, only Columbia, owned by
Minneapolis-based Ameriprise Financial Inc., has a related unit
of financial advisers offering its funds alongside those run by
others. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. is the only
wirehouse with a funds unit on Morningstar''s list of the 50
largest families. </p>
<h2>Opposite Direction'' </h2>
<p>The whole industry has been moving in just the opposite
direction, Greenwald said. As long as their funds perform
well, they''re OK, but there''s a real or implied conflict of
interest when you sell your own brand of funds. If performance
falls, it could be an issue. </p>
<p>JPMorgan doesn''t enjoy any advantage over competitors
offered at Chase and the private bank, as sales agents have no
extra incentives to sell in-house funds, according to Gatch. </p>
<p>We operate on a level playing field with other investment
management firms, he said. Gatch chalked up the internal sales
to his staff''s insight into the needs of Chase clients and
JPMorgan''s ability to deliver a product as good, if not
dramatically better, than what our competitors offer. </p>
<p>JPMorgan funds have been solid, albeit unspectacular,
Greenwald said. </p>
<h2>Bond Fund Strength </h2>
<p>The stock and bond funds, on average, beat 47 percent of
competitors in 2011, 53 percent over the past three years, 56
percent over five years and 57 percent over 10 years, according
to Morningstar. The data, which isn''t weighted by assets,
exclude funds of funds. </p>
<p>JPMorgan funds aim to produce consistent risk-adjusted
returns, Gatch said. </p>
<p>They''re not going to blow you up, but they''re not going
to place you in the top rankings, Rob Wherry, a Morningstar
analyst, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The returns of the firm''s four biggest funds, all of which
focus on bonds, have generally been stronger. They beat 57
percent of competitors in 2011, 38 percent over three years, 81
percent over five years and 80 percent over 10 years. </p>
<p>Their fixed income is certainly what stands out, Wherry
said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s largest fund is the $24.9 billion JPMorgan Core
Bond Fund (WOBDX), managed by Douglas Swanson. The fund outperformed 84
percent of rivals in the five years ended Dec. 31, with an
average annual return of 7 percent, according to Morningstar. </p>
<h2>Multiple Boutiques'' </h2>
<p>The biggest stock fund is the $7.31 billion Mid-Cap Value
Fund (FLMVX), which bested 85 percent of rivals over five years with an
average annual return of 2 percent. The fund is managed by a
team led by Jonathan Simon. </p>
<p>JPMorgan funds are run by autonomous investment operations
including fixed-income teams in Cincinnati; Columbus, Ohio;
Boston; and London, as well as equity groups in New York, London
and Hong Kong. All manage strategies for both individual and
institutional clients. </p>
<p>The business is built on multiple boutiques sitting on
one industrial-strength platform, O''Brien said. </p>
<p>O''Brien, like Gatch, has worked to beef up sales efforts,
while focusing more on customers outside the U.S. </p>
<p>When O''Brien, 48, took his post in 2010, 65 percent to 70
percent of institutional assets came from U.S. clients. He said
he is seeking to increase international assets to 50 percent by
2015, with sales targets including defined-benefit pension funds
in Europe, global insurance companies and sovereign wealth
funds. </p>
<h2>No Passive Plans </h2>
<p>The company has no interest in building its own passive
investing unit, regardless of the popularity of index funds,
O''Brien said. He didn''t rule out entering the business via
acquisition. </p>
<p>Gatch was less enthusiastic. </p>
<p>Does beta have a place? Sure, Gatch said, referring to
investments designed to match market returns. In some cases
we''ll use ETFs in diverse portfolios that we manage. But we
think we''re going to do a better job for investors if we
maintain our focus exclusively on active management. </p>

expected to yield 130 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the offering who
asked not to be identified because terms are not set. A
benchmark bond is at least $500 million in size. </p>
<p>International Lease Finance Corp. (ILFC), the plane-leasing unit
of American International Group Inc. (AIG), is also selling three- and
seven-year senior notes, according to a person familiar with
that transaction who also asked not to be identified because the
terms are not set. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which the Federal Reserve said yesterday had
passed its stress test for capital adequacy under an extremely
adverse economic scenario, announced a $15 billion equity
buyback as yields at about record lows offer attractive
borrowing rates for companies. Investment-grade bonds yield 3.49
percent, within 10 basis points of the all-time low of 3.4
percent reached on March 2, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S Corporate Master index. </p>
<p>When a credit has wind at its back, it can do whatever it
wants in the market, Timothy Cox, executive director of debt
capital markets at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York, said
about the JPMorgan bond sale in a telephone interview. </p>
<h2>Very Anxious'' </h2>
<p>The New York-based bank is leading more than $9 billion of
debt sales today, following issuance of $60.1 billion last week,
the most in records going back to 1999, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Treasurers have been very anxious to tap the market,
Cox said. Some people think if I don''t get in here now, I may
miss the boat.''  Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. issued $1.5
billion of five-year, 2.55 percent notes yesterday, Bloomberg
data show. Cox, who helped manage the sale, said that investors
placed orders for almost $7 billion of bonds. The new-issue
market still is green for go, he said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan announced a five-cent increase in its quarterly
dividend to 30 cents a share. It authorized $12 billion of stock
buybacks for 2012. The firm was among 15 major banks that passed
the Fed''s stress test. </p>
<p>ILFC''s three-year notes are expected to yield 5.125 percent
and the seven-year debt may pay 6.125 percent, said the person
familiar with the offering. </p>

<p>A departing Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) employee mounted an unprecedented public attack on its
toxic and destructive culture in a New York Times opinion
piece, becoming the first serving insider to openly criticize
the firm. </p>
<p>Greg Smith, identified by the newspaper as an executive
director and head of the bank''s U.S. equity derivatives business
in Europe, will leave the firm after 12 years, blaming Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn
for losing hold over the firm''s culture. Executive directors are
junior to managing directors and partners, the most senior rank. </p>
<p>I attend derivatives sales meetings where not one single
minute is spent asking questions about how we can help
clients, Smith, a Stanford University graduate, wrote in the
New York Times. It''s purely about how we can make the most
possible money off of them. </p>
<p>The attack adds to criticism from politicians and
protesters who blame the company for triggering the financial
crisis and profiting at clients'' expense. Goldman Sachs has
faced congressional hearings probing its role in the financial
crisis and paid $550 million in 2010 to settle a lawsuit
accusing it of misleading investors in a collateralized debt
obligation. </p>
<h2>Heartfelt Piece'' </h2>
<p>This will certainly be damaging for the firm, said John Purcell, founder of London-based executive search firm Purcell 
Co. It''s obviously a very heartfelt piece. Maybe he''s made a
sufficient amount of money in his life that he isn''t
particularly bothered if he isn''t employed in financial services
again and works in a completely different world like teaching. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs fell $4.17, or 3.4 percent, to $120.37 in New
York trading at 1:34 p.m. </p>
<p>A call to Smith''s mobile phone in London wasn''t answered.
Goldman Sachs said it disagreed with his criticism. </p>
<p>In our view, we will only be successful if our clients
are successful, the firm said in a statement. This
fundamental truth lies at the heart of how we conduct
ourselves. </p>
<p>It makes me ill how callously people talk about ripping
their clients off, Smith wrote. Over the last 12 months I
have seen five different managing directors refer to their own
clients as muppets,'''' sometimes over internal e-mail.'''' </p>
<h2>Not Shocking'' </h2>
<p>Blankfein and Cohn addressed the criticism in a memo to
employees today. In a company of our size, it is not shocking
that some people could feel disgruntled,'''' they said in the
memo. A recent survey of employees found that 89 percent
believe the firm provides exceptional service'' to clients and
that a similar percentage of the firm''s 12,000 vice presidents,
the rank held by Smith, felt that way, they said. </p>
<p>Employees are allowed to express concerns anonymously,
according to the memo. We are not aware that the writer of the
opinion piece expressed misgivings through this avenue, however,
if an individual expresses issues, we examine them carefully and
we will be doing so in this case,'''' they said. </p>
<p>Smith blamed the company''s management for promoting
employees who made money for the firm, often by getting
customers to buy products that Goldman Sachs was trying to get
rid of. If clients can''t trust the firm, they will stop doing
business with it, however smart its employees, Smith wrote in
the Times. </p>
<h2>Spirit of Humility'' </h2>
<p>Culture was always a vital part of Goldman Sachs''s
success, he wrote in the New York Times. It revolved around
teamwork, integrity, a spirit of humility, and always doing
right by our clients, he said. It wasn''t just about making
money; this alone will not sustain a firm for so long. It had
something to do with pride and belief in the organization. I am
sad to say that I look around today and see virtually no trace
of the culture that made me love working for this firm. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s score was among the lowest in a recent
study of corporate reputations, according to a Feb. 13 statement
from Harris Interactive Inc. (HPOL), a market research firm. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, surprised investors and the Federal Reserve when the
firm announced two days early that it received regulatory
approval for a 20 percent dividend increase. </p>
<p>JPMorgan surged 7 percent on yesterday''s news, which helped
drive up the shares of competitors and major stock indexes. The
central bank, which tested 19 of the largest U.S. financial
firms to gauge their ability to withstand another severe
economic downturn, decided to release the results at 4:30 p.m.
in Washington, also two days ahead of schedule. </p>
<p>The bank''s disclosure prompted other lenders, including
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group
Inc. (PNC), to accelerate the disclosure of their dividend plans. It
also irritated some staff at the Fed, which had planned to
release the test results ahead of the industry, said one person
familiar with the central bank''s operations who declined to be
identified because the discussions were private. </p>
<p>It certainly lit a fire under the other bank holding
companies, especially the problem institutions which thought
they had more time to cushion the blow, said Karen Shaw Petrou, a co-founder and managing partner at Washington-based
Federal Financial Analytics Inc., a regulatory consulting firm. </p>
<h2>Placing Blame </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s news release, published at 3:04 p.m. in New
York, was the result of less-than-perfect communication between
the company and the Fed and wasn''t related to the regulator''s
accelerated announcement of the stress-test results, a senior
Fed official told reporters on a conference call. The central
bank doesn''t fault JPMorgan or anyone for the move, the official
said. </p>
<p>Barbara Hagenbaugh, a Fed spokeswoman, and JPMorgan''s Joe Evangelisti declined to comment. </p>
<p>The news caught the markets and industry analysts, who were
preparing for a March 15 release date, off guard. Brian Foran, a
senior bank analyst at Nomura Securities, compared the
experience to the wait for his newborn. </p>
<p>As many of you know I recently had a baby, Foran said
in an e-mail to clients. It was remarkably similar to having a
stress test -- you work towards a due date but the reality is it
can come at any moment. And once it does, your sleep schedule is
immediately impaired. </p>
<h2>Started to Leak </h2>
<p>Fed officials told bank executives earlier yesterday that
they were concerned that some of the results had started to leak
to the public and decided to release the results after U.S.
markets had closed, according to two people who were briefed on
the calls. The release was moved up amid concern that some
information about the test may have been released inadvertently,
said a senior Fed official, who didn''t elaborate. </p>
<p>Other banks subject to the test were waiting until after
the Fed''s results were out to announce their capital plans, said
one of the people and a senior Fed official. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, boosted its dividend to 30 cents a share, from 25 cents,
and authorized a $15 billion share repurchase plan after passing
the stress test, the New York-based company said. </p>
<p>Some investors said it looked like an act of defiance by
Dimon. </p>
<p>Jamie Dimon basically thumbed his nose at the Fed, said
Charlie Smith, who oversees $1.2 billion as chief investment
officer of Fort Pitt Capital Group Inc. in Pittsburgh. That''s
what he does, and he''s got the balance sheet to do it. He''s got
enough of the cards to say, I''m going to do what I want even if
it''s going to force the Fed to come out with its announcement
early.'' </p>
<h2>Bernanke Confirmation </h2>
<p>Dimon, who turned 56 yesterday, publicly confronted Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke last year over the central bank''s move
to increase capital requirements on lenders, asking whether
overzealous regulation had gone too far and was curbing economic
growth. </p>
<p>I have a great fear someone''s going to try to write a
book in 20 years, and the book is going to talk about all the
things that we did in the middle of the crisis to actually slow
down recovery, Dimon told the Fed chairman during a June
banking conference in Atlanta. </p>
<p>The company''s Tier 1 capital ratios fell to a low of 5.4
percent under the Fed''s most adverse scenario, above the 5
percent threshold required to pass the test, the Fed said
yesterday. The central bank projected that JPMorgan''s home
loans, credit cards and other debt could decline by $55.8
billion while trading and derivatives operations would lose
$27.7 billion. </p>
<h2>Unemployment Rate </h2>
<p>The worst-case scenario includes a U.S. unemployment rate
as high as 13 percent and a 20 percent drop in home prices,
according to the Fed. </p>
<p>The central bank required the nation''s largest lenders to
show they have credible plans for maintaining capital and
continuing lending in an economic downturn. JPMorgan said the
Fed told the company it completed its review and did not
object to the bank''s capital plans. </p>
<p>The Fed is basically releasing examination data showing
who are the good guys and who are the bad guys, and that''s going
to drive money away from the weaker names, said Paul Miller, a
former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and
analyst at FBR Capital Markets. They are picking winners and
losers. I didn''t think the Fed would ever do that. </p>
<h2>Dimon''s Stake </h2>
<p>The $15 billion in stock buybacks would be enough for the
firm to repurchase about 346 million shares at yesterday''s
closing price. That represents about 9 percent of shares
outstanding. Dimon''s personal stake in JPMorgan gained almost
$15 million. </p>
<p>JPMorgan climbed $2.85 to $43.39 yesterday, leading the KBW
Bank Index of 24 U.S. lenders to a 4.6 percent gain, the most
since November. The lender''s announcement also helped to pad
gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which climbed 1.7
percent to 13,177.68, the highest in more than four years. </p>
<p>JPMorgan and the KBW Bank Index were little changed as of
11:45 a.m. today. </p>
<p>The new JPMorgan payout is in line with the $1.15 to $1.25
annual dividend per share estimated by Charles Peabody, an
analyst at Portales Partners, in a March 1 report. The share
repurchase, which includes $12 billion for 2012 and $3 billion
for the first quarter of next year, also is in line with his
prediction of $7 billion to $9 billion if employee incentive
stock is excluded. That will cost the bank about $5.5 billion
over the 12-month buyback program, Peabody said in an interview. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) is being investigated
by Brazil''s oil regulator for not meeting the agency''s request
for safeguards to avoid new leaks after a November spill at the
Frade field off the coast of Brazil. </p>
<p>Chevron faces fines for its handling of the spill after the
probe is completed, an official at the agency, who declined to

interview. </p>
<p>Chevron has requested permission from the regulator, known
as the ANP, to halt production at Frade after a new oil slick of
about 5 liters appeared at the field this week, Rafael
Williamson, a corporate affairs director at Chevron, said at a

<p>Frade was Brazil''s 12th-largest producing field in January
with 65,000 barrels a day in oil and natural gas output,
according to information on the regulator''s website. Chevron
holds a 52 percent stake in Frade and is the operator. Partners
include Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) with 30 percent and Frade Japao
Petroleo Ltda. -- a joint venture of INPEX Corp. (1605), Sojitz Corp. (2768)
and JOGMEC -- with 18.26 percent. </p>
<p>Chevron fell 0.6 percent to $110.03 at the close in New

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will release the
next version of its Xbox console in 2013 at the earliest, as the
company squeezes at least one more year of sales out of its
current model, said two people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>The company may show the successor to its Xbox 360 in June
2013 at the E3 conference and put it on sale that same year,
said the people, who declined to be named because the plans are
confidential. David Dennis, a company spokesman, said earlier
today that Microsoft won''t discuss new Xbox hardware at this
year''s E3, quelling speculation that the device would be
unveiled at the 2012 show. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Xbox 360, bolstered by the Kinect motion-sensor
accessory, had its best year of sales in 2011 -- the console''s
seventh on the market. Announcing the next model too soon risks
hurting orders for the current lineup, and new consoles
typically lose money for their first few years. The Xbox 360 is
profitable, giving the company incentive to keep it on store
shelves for a longer period. </p>
<p>They''re still selling a lot of Xbox 360, and they''re
making money, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush
Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. I don''t think the world needs
them to put a new console out just because we''re bored. </p>

<p>Pfizer (PFE) Inc. Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read received a 44 percent raise in total compensation last
year to $25 million in his new role as head of the world''s
largest drugmaker, according to a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Read, 58, was paid $1.7 million in base salary, a $3.5
million cash bonus, stock and option awards, pension and other
benefits. The cash bonus was $900,000 more than his target for
the year, New York-based Pfizer said in the filing. Read''s total
compensation was $17.4 million in 2010. </p>
<p>Pfizer topped its financial goals for 2011 and Read''s raise
adjusted his salary grade to reflect the change in his
position to CEO, the company said in its filing. </p>
<p>Read is shrinking Pfizer as he shifts the company into a
new phase after its top-selling cholesterol pill Lipitor began
facing generic competition last December. He also is planning to
divest the animal health and nutritionals units and trimming
overlaps from a decade of mega-mergers. The CEO said Pfizer will
focus its research on five clinical areas, ending work on
respiratory, allergy and gene-therapy treatments. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s board said company shareholders were upset by the
$24.7 million final-year pay of former CEO Jeffrey Kindler, who
left the company in December 2010 and was replaced by Read. The
2011 shareholder vote on executive pay passed with 56 percent
compared with 96.8 percent the year before, the drugmaker''s
board members said in their report about executive compensation
included in the filing. </p>
<p>The vote outcome was highly disappointing to Pfizer, its
board of directors and its compensation committee, the board
said. </p>
<p>In response, the board said it had made compensation more
performance-based for top executives. Read would be paid $22.4
million for termination without cause, or $32.6 million in
case of a change in ownership of the company, according to the
filing. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley is preparing to
invest millions of dollars in Mexican energy companies as the
nation opens up the industry to private capital and state-owned
oil producer Petroleos Mexicanos boosts spending to a record. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank''s Mexican private equity venture
tapped Jesus Reyes Heroles, a former chief executive officer of
Pemex, to identify promising energy companies. The venture will
invest between $35 million and $110 million in each, he said in
an interview. </p>
<p>We already have a pipeline of potential projects and
should be able to announce one or two investments in a couple
months, Reyes Heroles said by telephone from Mexico City. </p>
<p>Domestic energy companies that provide services such as
pipeline maintenance and drilling to Pemex and which need cash
to boost growth are possible targets, he said. The state-owned
company has more than quadrupled investments during the past
decade as it seeks to stem seven years of declining output. </p>
<p>Pemex, based in Mexico City, is investing about $269
billion in the ten years through 2019 after output last year
slumped to 2.55 million barrels on average, compared with as
much as 3.38 million barrels a day at its peak in 2004. </p>
<p>Oil reform in 2008 opened exploration and production
projects to private and foreign companies for the first time
since 1938. Last year, Pemex awarded two blocks to Petrofac Ltd. (PFC)
and one to Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) to produce crude from aging fields.
The state-owned producer is now offering six more developments,
including offshore fields, to private developers. </p>
<h2>Well-Kept Secret'' </h2>
<p>The large size of Mexico''s private industry in the energy
sector is a very well kept secret, and it''s poised to keep
growing, Reyes Heroles said. </p>
<p>A second former Pemex CEO, Luis Ramirez Corzo, is also
betting on opportunities for private equity in Mexican energy.
Ramirez was named executive president of Integradora de
Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro, aiming to pursue investments in
oilfield services, according to a Feb. 27 statement. That firm
is affiliated with Temasek (TMSK), Singapore''s state-owned investment
company. </p>
<p>There is a different dynamic now, where some Pemex
contractors can evolve from suppliers to operators, George Baker, a Houston-based energy consultant, said in a telephone
interview. Besides funding, what some Mexican companies need is
expertise to offer skills that Pemex doesn''t have, he said. </p>
<p>Reyes Heroles said other global financial institutions have
expressed interest in pigygybacking'' on Morgan Stanley''s
Mexican energy capital investments. </p>
<h2>Cover Projects'' </h2>
<p>We felt those funds, plus Morgan Stanley (MS)''s, should be
enough to cover our projects for the first two years, he said. </p>
<p>Once we can make a company to grow two to three times its
current size we can eventually consider them for a public
offering, Heroles said. It''s a terrible paradox, that
despite the large size of the energy sector in Mexico there is
not a single energy company listed at the Bolsa. </p>
<p>After the 2008 law changes, Pemex is replacing some service
contracts to prioritize efficiency over price. The company is
opting not to renew the lease of shallow-water drilling rigs in
the Gulf of Mexico when it can find newer equipment for the
projects, Carlos Morales, head of production, said last year. </p>
<p>Some companies providing services to Pemex lack the
financial resources to access state-of-the-art technology, said
Gonzalo Gil, co-chief executive officer of Oro Negro. Given
the inevitability of Pemex''s investment plan, we see a long-term
demand for many services, Gil said. </p>

<p>Yesterday a London employee of Goldman Sachs penned a 1,200-word opinion
piece in the New York Times alleging that top managers in the company
ridicule and takeadvantage of their clients. Greg Smith wrote of the investment
bank wherehe worked for 12 years that he no longer liked the "trajectory of its
culture" and quit his job. The piece sparked a storm of criticism and debate on
Wall Street. "People who care only about makingmoney will not sustain this
firm or the trust of its clients "for verymuch longer," Smith concludes.</p>
<p>The Smith episode lies close to the heart of sustainability, a point echoed
in his likely inadvertent word choice. That''s because much ofsustainability, or
responsibility, or whatever companies choose to call it, essentially boils down
to corporate governance.</p>
<p>Forces external to a company can reveal blind spots in management''s
assessment of risks and opportunities. Pressure oncompanies to divest from
investments in South Africa in the 1980s is oneexample. Companies ill-prepared
for a low-carbon economy might now feelpunished by high oil prices and
increasingly costly regulation.</p>
<p>What does the Smith controversy have to do with social justice and
environmental preservation? Not much. But it has everything to do with blind
spots and mitigating risk to a company''s reputation.Smith''s is an attack on
Goldman Sachs''s corporate governance, a category that includes, but isn''t
limited to, environmental and social issues.Corporate governance and
transparency rightfully takes up more space in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index ranking questionnaire than either of the other topics, to pick just one
measure. Goldman Sachs was admitted into the Index in July.</p>
<p>Jason Kennedy, CEO of the Kennedy Group, a London-based recruitment firm,
told Bloomberg news that Smith may have aired a few comments that aretrue, but
he''s placed himself on a pedestal. The reason he''s been atGoldman Sachs for 12
years is that he liked the name and probably liked themoney. That is true,
simply by virtue of Smith showing up for work. Butthe point here for managers -
- and the driver of some companies intosustainability strategy -- is that Smith
stopped liking the name so muchthat he waived the money and tattled in
public.</p>
<p>"Sustainable" companies attract and retain employees bybeing good companies.
That means being responsive to the needs of clients, shareholders, employees and
the communities they interact with. Bright people are often willing to work for
less money if an employer''s values align with their own. Greg Smith is probably
now one of them.</p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) saw $2.15
billion of its market value wiped out after an employee assailed
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein''s management and the
firm''s treatment of clients, sparking debate across Wall Street. </p>
<p>The shares dropped 3.4 percent in New York trading
yesterday, the third-biggest decline in the 81-company Standard
 Poor''s 500 Financials Index, after London-based Greg Smith
made the accusations in a New York Times op-ed piece. </p>
<p>Smith, who also wrote that he was quitting after 12 years
at the company, blamed Blankfein, 57, and President Gary D. Cohn, 51, for a decline in the firm''s moral fiber. They
responded in a memo to current and former employees, saying that
Smith''s assertions don''t reflect the firm''s values, culture or
how the vast majority of people at Goldman Sachs think about
the firm and the work it does on behalf of our clients. </p>
<p>Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, 84, whose
Volcker rule would limit banks like New York-based Goldman
Sachs from making bets with their own money, called Smith''s
article a radical, strong piece. I''m afraid it''s a
business that leads to a lot of conflicts of interest, Volcker
said at a conference in Washington sponsored by the Atlantic
magazine. </p>

former chairman of American International Group Inc. (AIG), said
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. had a change in culture that made
the securities firm less responsive to clients. </p>
<p>You didn''t have investment bankers running the firm, you
had traders running the firm after Goldman Sachs went public,
Greenberg told Bloomberg Television''s Betty Liu today in an
interview on the In the Loop program. And a trader has a
short-term memory, and a short-term look at things, and that
change really has changed the culture of Goldman Sachs. It is
not the Goldman Sachs that represented companies as an
investment banker. </p>
<p>Greg Smith yesterday blamed Goldman Sachs Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein and President Gary Cohn for a decline
in the firm''s moral fiber in a New York Times op-ed piece in
which Smith announced his resignation from a post in London
selling derivatives. Executives at Goldman Sachs are mistreating
clients even after the firm paid $550 million to settle a fraud
suit with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Smith wrote. </p>
<p>Greenberg said he counted on Goldman Sachs for investment
banking when he ran the New York-based insurer. AIG later took
billions of dollars of losses on collateralized debt obligations
it backed for Goldman Sachs and ran short of cash. The insurer
averted bankruptcy only because of a U.S. bailout that swelled
to $182.3 billion. </p>

<p>Greg Smith, the former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) derivatives salesman whose critique of the Wall
Street firm earned him $150 from the New York Times, has eluded
book agents and publishers who say his story could make him a
lot more. </p>
<p>The sky''s the limit, said Esther Newberg of
International Creative Management in New York who''s been a
literary agent for 35 years. She said two of her colleagues have
reached out to Smith. Agents and publishers are trying to talk
to him. The feedback we get is that he''s hiding for a while. </p>
<p>Smith said in a March 14 opinion piece that a toxic and
destructive environment at Goldman Sachs drove him to quit
after 12 years. He reignited a debate about Wall Street that
played out on televisions and in newspapers around the world.
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable and highest-paying firm in
Wall Street history before the 2008 financial crisis, said it
disagreed with Smith''s depiction and that most employees say the
company provides exceptional client service. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has also been unsuccessful in attempts to
contact Smith, who e-mailed his resignation at the same time his
article was published, a person familiar with the matter said.
The New York Times reported that Smith, a South African and a
Stanford University graduate, flew to New York this week from
London, where he''s worked for about a year. Smith didn''t reply
to a voicemail left on his mobile phone. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-largest U.S. shopping-mall owner, paid Chief Executive
Officer Sandeep Mathrani $8.73 million in 2011, his first year
at the company. </p>
<p>Mathrani''s pay consisted of $1.15 million in salary, a $1.5
million cash bonus, stock options valued at $3.88 million and
$2.2 million in other compensation, the Chicago-based company
said today in a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Mathrani joined General Growth as CEO in January 2011, soon
after the company left bankruptcy protection. He was previously
executive vice president of New York-based Vornado Realty
Trust (VNO)''s retail division. His total compensation at Vornado in
2010 was $7.84 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>General Growth, second to Indianapolis-based Simon Property

items rose in the fourth quarter as tenant demand for space in
top-tier retail centers increased. So-called core FFO, a measure
of a property owner''s ability to generate cash, climbed to
$279.8 million, or 29 cents a share, from $230.1 million, or 23

regular U.S. trading. General Growth rose 1.9 percent to $16.91
at the close in New York. The shares have gained 19 percent in
the past year. </p>

<p>Morgan Keegan, the brokerage being
sold to Raymond James Financial Corp. (RJF), lost its bid to be
dismissed from an $8 billion lawsuit brought by Canadian insurer
Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. </p>
<p>Fairfax, in its 2006 lawsuit, accused investors of
conspiring with analysts and researchers to spread false rumors
and drive down Fairfax''s stock price in a so-called bear raid. </p>
<p>New Jersey Superior Court Judge Stephan C. Hansbury in
Morristown ruled today that there was more to the case than
whether Morgan Keegan''s analyst reports were free speech
protected by the U.S. Constitution''s First Amendment. </p>
<p>There''s more to this case than the statements made in a
couple of reports, the judge said. It seems to me an
innocent truthful statement could be part of the conspiracy,
he said. </p>
<p>The suit once included as defendants the hedge funds SAC
Capital Advisors LP, Third Point LLC and Kynikos Associates LP.
The remaining defendants, including New York hedge fund Exis
Capital Management Inc., have argued the case doesn''t have
enough connection to New Jersey to allow Fairfax''s anti-
racketeering counts, which allow for tripling the $8 billion in
claims. Toronto-based Fairfax brought other claims in the suit. </p>
<h2>September Trial </h2>
<p>Hansbury said he will schedule a trial for September. Bruce
Collins, a lawyer for Morgan Keegan, told the judge he will file
another motion before then to get his client dismissed. Collins
declined to comment on the ruling after the hearing. </p>
<p>Fairfax, which owns stakes in Canadian and U.S. insurers,
said in its complaint that the hedge funds coordinated with
stock analysts so the funds could profit through short sales,
selling borrowing shares in anticipation of making money by
replacing them with cheaper shares after the price dropped. </p>
<p>The company''s $8 billion damage claim is based on
allegations that the hedge funds'' actions depressed Fairfax''s
credit ratings, diminished its ability to make acquisitions and
reduced the amount it could raise in debt and equity offerings,
according to court papers. </p>
<p>On Jan. 17, Memphis, Tennessee-based Morgan Keegan asked
Hansbury to dismiss it from the suit because the negative
Fairfax reports by its analyst, John Gwynn, were protected
speech. Collins argued Gwynn''s reports were protected opinions
and that Gwynn wasn''t saying Fairfax engaged in fraud. </p>
<h2>My Estimates'' </h2>
<p>All he''s saying is, I''ve got my estimates, you''ve got
yours,'' Collins told Hansbury during the hearing. </p>
<p>Fairfax also said the hedge funds coaxed Gwynn into giving
them his negative Fairfax reports before they were published.
Morgan Keegan fired Gwynn in 2008 for disclosing research on
Fairfax to selected clients before publication, the brokerage
said at the time. He has since died. </p>
<p>Fairfax said Gwynn misrepresented the company''s finances in
his reports, including its reserves for claims. </p>
<p>Morgan Keegan was part of this conspiracy, James Stricker, a lawyer for Fairfax, told Hansbury. They fired John
Gwynn for illegal tipping. </p>
<p>Christopher Brett Lawless, a former analyst at Fitch Group
Inc. who was sued by Fairfax, also lost a bid to be dismissed on
First Amendment grounds. </p>
<p>There''s no evidence of an actionable false statement by
Lawless, Anthony Enright, one of his lawyers, told the judge.
Lawless didn''t have one dime to gain or lose from the
performance of Fairfax. He''s not a hedge fund. </p>
<p>Enright didn''t immediately respond to a phone call seeking
comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>The case is Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH) v. SAC Capital
Management LLC, L-2032-06, Superior Court of New Jersey, Morris
County (Morristown). </p>

<p>The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
employee who criticized the company''s culture in a newspaper
column bolsters the case for Wall Street restrictions like the
Volcker rule, congressional Democrats said. </p>
<p>While the March 14 New York Times (NYT) opinion piece by former
executive director Greg Smith drew no requests for hearings or
investigations, lawmakers including Senators Carl Levin of
Michigan and Jeff Merkley said the article showed why the U.S.
needs tighter restrictions on Wall Street practices. The two
Democrats authored the Volcker rule''s ban on proprietary trading
and conflicts of interest in the Dodd-Frank Act. </p>
<p>Congress can''t legislate the culture but I think the
heart of this goes to why we needed the Merkley-Levin
amendment, Merkley, a member of the Senate Banking Committee,
said in an interview. </p>
<p>Lawmakers on Capitol Hill yesterday said the piece, which
has ricocheted through Wall Street firms, has had less of an
impact in Washington, where New York-based Goldman Sachs''
business practices and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C.
Blankfein were the targets of congressional hearings in 2010. </p>
<h2>A Little Research'' </h2>
<p>Doing a little research before you call for hearings is
important to understand the totality of the story, Senator
Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat on the Banking Committee,
said yesterday in an interview on Bloomberg Television. </p>
<p>Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on the
Banking Committee, said Smith''s comments deserve greater
scrutiny. He was skeptical there was much Congress could do. </p>
<p>The biggest factor of change won''t be frankly because of
a statute or an investigation,  Reed said in an interview.
It will be the clients will come in and say we want a better
deal, we want assurances that our best interests are your sole
thing. </p>
<p>Smith''s column questioned the firm''s culture and said the
interests of clients continue to be sidelined in the way the
firm operates and thinks about making money. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has been concerned about reaction to the
article from members of the House and Senate banking panels, as
well as Levin, who led a Senate investigation that produced a
639-page report that blamed the firm''s trading practices for
contributing to the financial crisis, according to a person
familiar with the firm''s thinking. </p>
<h2>Defending the Firm </h2>
<p>The bank''s Washington office has been fielding calls about
the op-ed from congressional staff, administration officials and
other policy makers, the person said. In their conversations,
the in-house lobbyists are relaying a defense of the firm that
was included in a companywide memo from Blankfein and Gary Cohn,
the president and chief operating officer. </p>
<p>David Wells, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. Goldman Sachs shares fell 13 cents to
$122.93 at 4:15 p.m. in New York. </p>
<p>The investigation panel''s report came less than a year
after Goldman Sachs paid $550 million to resolve Securities and
Exchange Commission claims that it failed to disclose that hedge
fund Paulson  Co. was betting against, and influenced the
selection of, collateralized debt obligations the company was
packaging and selling. </p>
<h2>Ethical Depths'' </h2>
<p>Levin told reporters yesterday that Smith''s article was
further confirmation of his subcommittee''s findings of the
ethical depths to which Goldman had fallen. </p>
<p>No further hearings are warranted by the panel he leads,
Levin said, because Goldman Sachs is being scrutinized by a
number of entities and institutions already. </p>
<p>There still is an ongoing review by New York law
enforcement folks, I don''t think the Justice Department has
finished its review, Levin said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said when Levin''s report was released that it
didn''t mislead anyone about its activities and gave truthful and
accurate testimony to the committee. </p>
<p>Blankfein and Cohn addressed Smith''s criticism in a memo to
employees on March 14, noting that in a company of Goldman
Sachs''s size, it is not shocking that some people could feel
disgruntled. </p>
<h2>Employee Survey </h2>
<p>A recent survey of employees found that 89 percent believe
the firm provides exceptional service'' to clients and that a
similar percentage of the firm''s 12,000 vice presidents, the
rank held by Smith, felt that way, according to the memo. </p>
<p>Employees are allowed to express concerns anonymously,
according to the memo. We are not aware that the writer of the
opinion piece expressed misgivings through this avenue, however,
if an individual expresses issues, we examine them carefully and
we will be doing so in this case, Blankfein and Cohn said in
the memo. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said he
told his staff not to circulate Smith''s article. There but for
the grace of God go us, Gorman said at an event in New York
hosted by Fortune magazine. </p>
<p>Representative Barney Frank, the top Democrat on the House
Financial Services Committee, said the column serves as a
rebuttal to bank arguments that restrictions in trading
activities would result in increased costs for market
participants such as pension and mutual funds. </p>
<p>Who Benefits? </p>
<p>What he does is to reinforce the notion that much of the
benefit from what they do goes to them and not to the broader
society, Frank, who helped draft the law that bears his name,
said in a telephone interview. It doesn''t make it criminal,
but it does remove one of the arguments against the new
restrictions. </p>
<p>U.S. banks, asset managers and mutual funds voiced concerns
in February comment letters to regulators over the impact that
rule barring proprietary trading may have on markets due to the
decrease in liquidity it may cause. Similar concerns have been
raised about some of the new rules being drafted to regulate the
derivatives market. </p>
<p>For other lawmakers, in part because of the hearings held
by Levin, the column had less impact than it had on Wall Street. </p>
<p>This is not anything that we didn''t already know,
Representative Brad Miller, a North Carolina Democrat on the
Financial Services panel, said in an telephone interview. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised its
forecast for the dollar against the euro and the yen this year,
citing U.S. fiscal tightening that will weigh on higher-yielding
currencies as the Bank of Japan increases stimulus. </p>
<p>The Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trade partners, will hold at
current levels during the next quarter before weakening,
currency strategists led by John Normand wrote in a note to
clients today. The firm lowered its end-of-year forecast for the
euro versus the dollar to $1.36 from $1.38. </p>
<p>Expiration of tax cuts enacted during President George W.
Bush''s tenure, an increase to payroll taxes and other spending
cuts will drive the U.S. economy into a recession and lead to
further dollar gains as investors seek haven assets, JPMorgan
said. </p>
<p>Fiscal retrenchment of this magnitude would probably
guarantee a U.S. recession and U.S. dollar strength versus most
currencies through deleveraging, Normand wrote. </p>
<p>The dollar has risen 1.2 percent against the euro so far
this month. It fell 0.7 percent to $1.3167 at 4:07 p.m. in New
York. It dropped 0.2 percent to 83.37 yen after rallying 8.4
percent this year. The Dollar Index (DXY) fell 0.4 percent to 79.881. </p>
<p>Against the Japanese currency, the dollar will strengthen
to as high as 86 by mid-June before ending the year at 83. While
projections for further stimulus from the Bank of Japan may
weigh on the yen, the long-term downtrend remains for dollar-yen
depreciation, Normand wrote. </p>
<p>Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa indicated last
week the central bank will keep using monetary policy as a tool
to tackle deflation. The BOJ unexpectedly added 10 trillion yen
($128 billion) to its asset-purchase program on Feb. 14. </p>

<p>The New York Times (NYT), drawing
criticism for running an op-ed by a former Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) executive attacking the bank, said the piece was one of
thousands of unsolicited submissions it receives weekly. </p>
<p>We got it by e-mail, New York Times editorial page
editor Andrew Rosenthal said in a telephone interview. Smith was
paid about $150 for his submission, a typical amount, said a
person with direct knowledge of the situation who declined to be
identified because the information isn''t public. The newspaper
pays varying amounts for its op-eds, except to public figures or
politicians, the person said. </p>
<p>Wall Street, including Morgan Stanley (MS) Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, has faulted the newspaper for publishing
an op-ed piece based on the view of one among more than 30,000
Goldman Sachs employees. All the facts that could be checked
were checked in Smith''s submission, Rosenthal said. </p>
<p>The purpose of the op-ed page is to air an important
position, Rosenthal said. We''re saying, This is
interesting,'' and by the way, interesting,'' very often means
it''ll make you crazy. </p>
<p>In the March 14 op-ed that explained why he was quitting,
Greg Smith called Goldman Sachs''s culture toxic and
destructive. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein rebutted
Smith''s claims in a letter to employees the same day, saying his
assertions didn''t reflect the New York-based bank''s values and
how the vast majority of its employees think about their
firm. </p>
<h2>Piece Merited Publication </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s Gorman said he told staff not to circulate
the op-ed. </p>
<p>I was surprised that anyone would run an op-ed piece
based upon the view of a single employee, Gorman said today at
an event in New York hosted by Fortune magazine. </p>
<p>Smith was identified by the newspaper as an executive
director and head of the bank''s U.S. equity derivatives business
in Europe. While Smith wasn''t among the most senior executives
at Goldman Sachs, his screed against the firm''s culture merited
publication, Rosenthal said. </p>
<p>Rosenthal declined to say when Smith''s letter was received
and how long it took for the editorial staff to verify the
submission. The majority of op-ed pieces are commissioned, or
from writers who have previously written for the section, he
said. </p>
<p>Very few come over the transom queue, Rosenthal said.
Some of them famously have -- this is one of them. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) informed the

<p>We received the letter from Exxon to freeze the oil
contract with Kurdistan, Iraqi Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-
Luaibi told reporters today in Paris. Entry into Kurdistan will
depend on a new oil and gas law and if it''s approved there is
a good chance to solve all the problems with Kurdistan. </p>
<p>Iraq received a letter from Exxon March 5 and the company
may be allowed to join a next bidding round for oil contracts
if we receive another letter on this issue, al-Luaibi said. </p>
<p>Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said by e-mail he declined to

<p>Iraq''s central government has so far refused to recognize
production-sharing agreements between foreign companies and
Kurdistan, home to about 40 percent of Iraq''s 115 billion
barrels of reserves. The central government insists on service
contracts with foreign companies, rather than production-sharing
contracts, and says it needs to pre-approve any agreements
concerning energy resources. </p>
<p>Production from Kurdistan is more than 180,000 barrels a

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Managing
Directors Cynthia A. Cindy Brower and Wendy E. Sacks, 19-
year veterans who split a job in the credit-sales group, are
leaving the firm, people with knowledge of their exits said. </p>
<p>Brower, 46, and Sacks, 40, who met in the New York-based
bank''s training program when they joined on the same day in
1993, had been sharing a sales role for the past three years so
they could each work part-time, said the people, who asked to
remain anonymous because the departures haven''t been announced.
The pair handled sales of loans and distressed debt. </p>
<p>Their decision to leave wasn''t connected to this week''s
resignation by Greg Smith, a London-based employee in equity-
derivative sales who cited the firm''s toxic and destructive
environment in a New York Times op-ed explaining why he was
quitting after 12 years, the people said. The firm, which said
it disagreed with Smith''s assertions, sent a memo to current and
former employees, saying most of its workers believe it provides
exceptional service to customers. </p>
<p>While Goldman typically faced little employee turnover,
departures among partners and managing directors have increased
substantially over the past year, Charles Peabody, an analyst
at Portales Partners LLC in New York who rates the stock
outperform, wrote in a March 14 research note. Top
executives who have been instrumental in building many of GS''s
successful businesses, and made great fortunes in the process,
are stepping away in the face of a changing environment. </p>
<h2>Compensation Drops </h2>
<p>The company lost about 50 partners, the highest level of
employee, in the 12 months through January as revenue and
compensation fell at Goldman Sachs and throughout the industry.
The firm also eliminated 2,400 jobs last year. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, rose
2.2 percent to $123.06 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, recouping most of the loss it suffered the
day before following the publication of Smith''s opinion piece.
The stock is up 36 percent this year, beating the 21 percent
gain in the 81-company Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials Index. </p>
<p>Brower and Sacks worked in the fixed-income division
throughout their careers at Goldman Sachs, and current and
former colleagues said they were successful and highly regarded.
Sacks decided to retire a few weeks ago for personal reasons,
according to two of the people. Brower also decided to leave
after the firm offered her different work schedules, three of
the people said. </p>
<h2>Columbia Recruiting </h2>
<p>Brower spent her first 13 years in high-yield debt sales,
was promoted to managing director at the end of 2003 and was the
sales manager from 2004 to 2006 before taking her most recent
role. She also led recruiting efforts for the fixed-income
division at Columbia Business School and was involved in the
firm''s women''s network. </p>
<p>She worked at Dillon Read  Co. and Kidder Peabody  Co.
before joining Goldman Sachs and had a master''s degree in
finance and marketing from Columbia. She didn''t reply to a
message left on her mobile phone. </p>
<p>Sacks, who was promoted to managing director in 2006,
started her Goldman Sachs career in interest-rate sales and
joined bank-loan sales in 2001. She didn''t reply to an e-mail
seeking comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s bank-loan division suffered high-level
departures last year, including Buckley T. Ratchford, the
partner who was global head of bank-loan trading and distressed
investing; and Blake W. Mather, a partner who ran bank-loan
sales. The company had approximately $1 billion in unrealized
losses related to relationship lending activities last year,
according to an annual filing. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) should be
prohibited from boosting its dividend or repurchasing stock
because Federal Reserve stress tests showed the investment bank
is too leveraged, according to former regulator Sheila Bair. </p>
<p>The leverage ratios of four financial firms dropped below 4
percent under the stressed scenario, according to test results
the Fed released this week. Two of those firms, Citigroup Inc. (C)
and MetLife Inc. (MET), were prohibited from raising dividends or
repurchasing shares. The central bank approved the capital plans
of two others, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>No distribution should have been approved that would
bring the leverage ratio below 4 percent, Bair, the former
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said yesterday
in an interview. With leverage of 25-to-1, during a crisis,
these banks would likely suffer a run. </p>
<p>Bair, before leaving the FDIC in July, fought for the
leverage ratio to be more central in U.S. and international bank
regulations. Even though her ideas were accepted initially at
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the European Union
has since balked at implementing a leverage ratio in addition to
other capital requirements. </p>
<p>The leverage ratio caps bank borrowing based on total
assets on the balance sheet, ignoring the riskiness of different
holdings. When a bank is highly leveraged, a small change in
asset prices is enough to wipe out capital, making it insolvent. </p>
<h2>Minimum Threshold </h2>
<p>The Fed set a leverage ratio of 3 percent, the minimum
required by U.S. law, as the threshold for 15 of the 19 banks
that underwent stress tests. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (MS) and
Citigroup were in the 3 percent group. MetLife, the largest U.S.
life insurer and owner of a banking operation, was in the 4
percent group. All of the firms are based in New York. </p>
<p>Bear Stearns Cos. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) both
had capital ratios that met regulatory requirements, based on
their risk-weighted assets, just before they collapsed in 2008.
Their simple leverage exceeded 33-to-1, or was below 3 percent. </p>
<p>The two investment banks faced a run from their short-term
creditors who refused to renew overnight or weekly loans when
concern about the value of their assets mounted. Investors focus
on the leverage ratio, not-risk-based capital measures, during
market turmoil, Bair said. </p>
<p>This underscores another weakness of the tests: They
didn''t really stress liquidity, said Bair, now a senior
adviser at Pew Charitable Trusts, a Washington-based nonprofit.
The investment banks are particularly vulnerable to liquidity
failures because they don''t have a large, core deposit base. </p>

<p>Bank of America Corp., the second-
biggest U.S. lender by assets, borrowed more cheaply than Morgan
Stanley as the threat of a three-level rating reduction loomed
over the owner of the world''s largest brokerage. </p>
<p>Bank of America''s $1.25 billion of 3.875 percent five-year
notes priced to yield 275 basis points more than similarly
priced Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with Morgan Stanley''s $2 billion of 4.75 percent notes,
also due in 2017, which pay a spread of 360 basis points. </p>
<p>Banks are benefiting from an extended credit rally after
the Federal Reserve said last week that 15 of the 19 biggest
U.S. banks could maintain adequate capital levels in a severe
recession. Investors are demanding higher interest rates from
Morgan Stanley (MS) than its competitors after Moody''s Investors
Service said in a Feb. 15 statement that the bank''s credit
ratings may be cut by as many as three levels. </p>
<p>The ratings review just highlights the question of its
business model, Marc Beulke, an analyst at Minneapolis-based
Thrivent Financial, which oversees $73.1 billion in assets
including Morgan Stanley bonds, said in a telephone interview.
The biggest concern is Morgan Stanley still remains a broker
dealer, </p>
<p>MF Global Holdings Ltd.''s filing for the eighth-largest
U.S. bankruptcy on Oct. 31 reminded investors that there''s a
risk that any broker-dealer could fail, Beulke said. </p>
<p>It isn''t a probability, but there is a possibility, he
said. </p>
<h2>Bank Ratings </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley is rated A2, five levels above speculative-
grade. Bank of America is Baa1, three levels higher than junk.
If Moody''s goes ahead with its plan to downgrade the companies,
both would be Baa2. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America declined
to comment. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley soared to the worst
among major U.S. banks, diverging from Bank of America''s swap
spreads after the ratings review announcement from Moody''s. The
potential downgrade for the brokerage would be the most severe
among the biggest U.S. banks. The difference of 84.9 basis
points between Bank of America and Morgan Stanley''s swaps is the
most in five months. Bank of America''s spreads tightened by 9.1
basis points to 195 basis points today while Morgan Stanley
narrowed 2.7 basis points to 279.9 basis points, according to
CMA. </p>
<p>The contracts typically rise as investor confidence worsens
and fall as it improves. Default swaps pay the buyer face value
if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of
the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>
<h2>Morningstar View </h2>
<p>Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. analyst James Leonard is
recommending Morgan Stanley''s higher- yielding five-year notes,
citing mortgage-related losses due to legal claims for Bank
of America and conservative estimates around its return to
normalized earnings. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley issued $1 billion of 5.5 percent, 10-year
debentures in October and last sold five-year debt in April,
Bloomberg data show. The $2.5 billion of 3.8 percent, five-year
notes in April 2011 priced to yield 180 basis points, or 1.8
percentage point, more than similar-maturity Treasuries. They
traded at 97.8 cents on the dollar to yield 4.401 percent at
3:21 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>Today''s offering is Bank of America''s second sale of five-
year dollar-denominated bonds this month, after selling $600
million of floating-rate notes on March 2. </p>
<p>Bank debt has gained 5.1 percent this year, outpacing the
1.9 percent on all investment-grade debt, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. </p>
<p>They started from wider spreads, and there is a further
way to go, Beulke said of relative yields on bank bonds in the
U.S., which have fallen from 384 basis points at the start of
the year to 254 basis points. There has been less concern
about the truly negative outcome from lack of liquidity, helped
by the long-term refinancing operation in Europe, he said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) named Thom Gruhler,
who oversaw advertising campaigns for telecom and technology
clients at McCann Worldgroup, to run Windows Phone marketing. </p>
<p>Gruhler, 42, was global managing partner of telecom and
technology at the agency, Microsoft, the world''s biggest
software company, said today in a statement on its website.
Before that he ran the Verizon Wireless account, overseeing the
teams that developed the Can you hear me now? campaign. He
becomes the third marketing vice president to try selling
Microsoft''s revamped Windows Phone software. </p>
<p>While the product has gotten positive reviews, it accounts
for a 2 percent share of the market for smartphone operating
systems, according to Gartner Inc., a research company. In
December, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer
removed Andy Lees as head of the phone-software business, naming
Terry Myerson to the post. </p>
<p>Windows Phone is a uniquely compelling product, and Thom
will help us bring that to life for our customers, Myerson
said in the statement. </p>
<p>Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is refining its
marketing plan for targeting the consumers it believes will
respond to the Windows Phone brand, Myerson said in an interview
last month. </p>
<p>Lees said in an interview last year that the phones would
see an increase in marketing dollars, which may be spent to
improve incentives for retailers'' employees to tout Windows
Phones to customers. </p>
<p>The job of marketing vice president was last held by Achim
Berg, who moved to oversee relationships with operators last
year. Windows Phone 7 was introduced in 2010 with marketing led
by Todd Peters, an executive Microsoft recruited from Staples
Inc. to add consumer-marketing experience. </p>

<p>The chief executive officers of
Chevron Corp. (CVX)''s and Transocean Ltd.''s Brazilian units are among
17 executives at the two companies banned from leaving the
country pending an investigation into an offshore oil spill. </p>
<p>Chevron''s George Buck and Transocean''s Michael Legrand were
on the list of managers that federal prosecutors asked Judge
Vlamir Costa Magalhaes to ban from leaving Brazil, according to
a copy of the request sent today by Marcelo Del Negri, a
spokesman for the prosecutor''s office. The judge issued the ban
March 16, referring to the people listed on the request. </p>
<p>The Nov. 7 leak of 3,000 barrels of oil at Chevron''s $3.6
billion Frade field off the coast of Rio de Janeiro occurred at
a time when Brazil is increasing scrutiny of deepwater drilling
following the 2010 Macondo spill in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico,
about 1,630 times bigger. Transocean owned the rig involved in
the spill, which state and federal lawmakers have criticized. </p>
<p>They took this out of proportion, Cleveland Jones, an
oil specialist and geology professor at Rio de Janeiro State
University, said in a telephone interview, referring to Brazil''s
reaction to the leak. It''s far from the coast and it''s a small
volume. </p>
<p>Seepages are common in regions such as the Gulf of Mexico
and the North Sea, Jones said. </p>
<p>Chevron has not been notified of the court order yet,
Claudia Afflalo, a press officer for the company, said in a
telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro. Chevron will defend
itself and its employees, spokesman Kurt Glaubitz said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday. Guy Cantwell, a spokesman for
Transocean, (RIG) declined to comment today. </p>
<h2>Clear Motives </h2>
<p>The executives appear to have foreign citizenship or
financial conditions and clear motives to want to leave the
country, Costa Magalhaes said in the order. Their departure
at this time and under the current circumstances, would pose
great risk to the investigation and the eventual application of
the criminal law, he said. </p>
<p>Last week, Chevron shut what oil production remains at the
field after detecting a new leak, Glaubitz said. He said the
shutdown was temporary and the company will conduct a geologic
study of the area. </p>
<p>Frade was producing about 60,000 barrels a day before last
week''s spill. </p>
<p>Chevron, the second-biggest U.S. oil company by market
value, and the Brazilian Navy identified a thin sheen of oil
at the Frade field on March 16 that extended about a kilometer
(3,280 feet). </p>
<p>Chevron rose 0.5 percent to $110.80 at 3:50 p.m. in New
York. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley recommended its
clients buy bonds linked to consumer prices in Brazil, Mexico
and Chile on a bet that an economic recovery in Latin America
will spur inflation. </p>
<p>Investors should buy two-year inflation-linked bonds and
pay fixed interest-rate swap rates with similar maturities,
analysts led by New York-based Vitali Meschoulam wrote in a
note. The yield difference between the two securities, which
reflects expectations of the average annual consumer price
increases over the next two years, will rise more than 50 basis
points, or 0.5 percentage point, in Mexico and Chile, the
analysts wrote. The so-called break-even rate may increase 33
basis points to 6.2 percent in Brazil, according to the note. </p>
<p>With euro area tail risks being priced out of markets and
geopolitical developments putting pressure on oil prices, we
highlight the potential for markets to again focus on
deteriorating inflation, the analysts wrote. We are likely
to see a bottoming out of inflation near end of the second
quarter before inflation starts rising again. </p>

when it bought Constantia Packaging AG. It sold most of its
shares in AMAG in an initial public offering in Vienna last
year. </p>
<p>BC Chief Executive Officer Michael Junghans said last year

foundation dedicated to promote Austrian entrepreneurship,
was looking for a fourth pillar to compliment its holding in
Lenzing, Semperit and Porr. </p>

<p>Michael Workman, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)''s executive director in fixed income in Moscow, quit
to join Otkritie Financial Corp., a month after the U.S. bank''s
co-heads and chief trader in the Russian capital left. </p>
<p>Otkritie hired Workman to replace George Urumov, who the
Russian brokerage accuses in a lawsuit of helping to defraud it
of $183 million, Alexey Karakhan, an Otkritie spokesman, said
today by phone in Moscow. Urumov denies the allegations. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs last month said Paolo Zannoni, chairman of
Italian investment banking, will take over as chief of Russian
operations from co-heads Chris Barter and Jean Raby -- the third
leadership change for the Wall Street firm in as many years.
Barter is setting up his own investment management firm and Raby
is returning to Paris to work for the bank there. Peter Kizenko,
the former chief trader in Moscow, also left in February, and
started a commercial sauna business in New Jersey. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, a member of
President Dmitry Medvedev''s advisory committee for turning
Moscow into a financial center, has struggled to build a
business in Russia. The bank scaled back operations in Moscow
soon after opening an office in 1994 amid a worldwide
retrenchment and returned in 1998, weeks before Russia defaulted
on domestic debt, prompting it to withdraw almost entirely
before ramping up again in 2006. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s press service in Moscow declined to comment
on Workman''s departure. </p>
<h2>Great Potential'' </h2>
<p>The opportunity to build a new business line was what
attracted me to Otkritie, Workman said by phone in Moscow.
There''s great potential to develop structured products,
Russian Eurobonds and locally traded OFZ Euroclearable bonds. </p>
<p>Urumov strongly denies all the allegations made against
him, Farrer  Co., the firm representing his defense, said in
an e-mailed statement on Feb. 17. Urumov allegedly defrauded
Otkritie of $160 million through offshore transactions involving
Argentine warrants and $23 million in bonuses meant for
subordinates while working as the brokerage''s global head of
fixed income in London, according to court documents and lawyers
on the case. </p>

<p>The Exxon Valdez has been sold for
scrap 23 years after causing the worst tanker spill in U.S.
history, which led to new designs for oil carriers. </p>
<p>Now called the Oriental Nicety, the vessel was sold for
about $16 million, Maryland-based Global Marketing Systems Inc.,
the world''s biggest cash buyer of ships for demolition, said in
a report March 16. Converted into an ore carrier in 2007, it
changed owners and names four times since the 1989 accident,
American Bureau of Shipping records show. </p>
<p>The spill, which dumped 11 million gallons of oil in
Alaska''s Prince William Sound, was the largest in U.S. waters
until the 2010 accident at BP Plc (BP/)''s Macondo oil well in the Gulf
of Mexico. It''s still the country''s largest leak from a tanker,
and it led to the U.S. requirement for ships to have two hulls. </p>
<p>The accident pointed out that the biggest risk involved
in oil transport is the impact an accident can have on the
environment, Thomas Zwick, an analyst at Oslo-based shipping
consultant Lorentzen  Stemoco AS, said in an e-mail today.
Large companies can go under as a consequence of the financial
liabilities bestowed upon them following an accident. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S. oil company, still
faces litigation from the spill. The Irving, Texas-based company
spent three years and $3.86 billion to clean up the spill, which
damaged 700 miles of coastline and killed more than 36,000
birds, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. </p>

<p>Paul G. Allen, a co-founder of
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), pledged an additional $300 million to the brain
center that bears his name to study how vision works. </p>
<p>The Allen Institute for Brain Science, based in Seattle and
founded in 2003, will begin a 10-year project to map the visual
system. That brings Allen''s total contribution to $500 million,
said Allan Jones, the chief executive officer of the institute,
in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The project, starting in mice, will involve several hundred
scientists and will apply knowledge from genomics, anatomy,
computer modeling and physiology. A map of the visual cortex,
the place in the brain that receives and processes the messages
of sight, may help improve understanding of higher brain
function, said Christof Koch, chief scientific officer of the
Allen Institute and R. Clay Reid of Harvard University Medical
School in Boston, in an editorial today in the journal Nature. </p>
<p>Although the institute''s project will focus on visual
stimuli in mice, it will capture fundamental aspects of higher
brain functions: perception, conscious awareness and decision-
making, and how they lead to action, Koch and Reid, who is
joining the Allen Institute, said in the article. </p>
<p>Once understood in mice, scientists may turn to the human
visual system, the researchers said. Human brains have a mass of
about 3 pounds, while mouse brains are .001 pounds. Human brains
have 86 billion neurons, mice have only 70 million. </p>
<h2>Neural Networks </h2>
<p>Researchers will catalog neurons and measure the electrical
activity of the cells as they transmit messages into and out of
the visual cortex. Using techniques of genetic engineering that
make the neurons light up, they will watch circuits activate
whenever the animal makes a decision, enabling them to chart the
anatomy of neural networks. </p>
<p>The Allen Institute has found a unique niche to do these
things at a large scale, Jones said. Usually in academic
settings, individual researchers'' questions drive the science.
This allows for a more-systematic approach, he said. </p>
<p>To support the initiative, the Institute plans to double
its current staff to more than 350 people over the next four
years. Today''s donation will fund the first four years of the
new project. </p>
<p>In April 2011, the Institute created a gene map of the
human brain and made it freely available to assist researchers
studying disorders such as Parkinson''s disease and autism. That
effort followed a 2006 map of the mouse brain. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s
largest software maker, said its Windows Phone operating system
will propel it past Apple Inc. (AAPL) in China''s smartphone market as
its partners release devices costing as little as $158. </p>
<p>Passing Apple is an interim goal as the company''s
longer-term objective is to supplant Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android as
the local market leader, Simon Leung, Microsoft''s chairman and
chief executive officer for the Greater China region, told
reporters in Beijing today. He didn''t give a time frame for
reaching the targets. </p>
<p>China is poised to become the world''s biggest smartphone
market in 2012, making it crucial for manufacturers and sellers
in the battle for sales. Shipments of the devices, used to
download games and movies, will jump 52 percent to 137 million
units in China this year, allowing the country to overtake the
U.S. for the first time, research company IDC said. </p>
<p>We will continue to drive the price down, Leung said.
Our goal is number one. Having a goal to be number two is not
really a goal. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s manufacturing partners will definitely
offer devices in the price range of 1,000 yuan ($158), Leung
said, without specifying which partners or devices would meet
the target. Rather than make its own phones, Microsoft supplies
software to handset manufacturers including Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) (NOKIA), Samsung
Electronics Co., HTC Corp. (2498) and ZTE Corp. (763), Leung said. </p>
<p>A 16-gigabyte iPhone 4S costs 4,988 yuan at Apple''s online
store in China. </p>
<h2>Developing Markets </h2>
<p>Leung, who spoke before a ceremony to unveil the new
Windows Phone 7.5 operating system in China, declined to discuss
specific handsets using the system. </p>
<p>A post on Microsoft''s Windows Phone Blog said that HTC has
started selling the first Windows Phone in the country. The HTC
Eternity is an unlocked handset with a 4.7-inch screen, front-
and rear-facing cameras, and comes with popular Chinese apps,
the blog said, without giving the price for the handset. </p>
<p>Winston Yung, chief financial officer and spokesman for
Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC, didn''t immediately answer calls to
his mobile phone after normal business hours today. </p>
<h2>Widening Reach </h2>
<p>Microsoft plans to bring its Windows Phone software to 23
more countries for a total of 63 and put the operating system on
less expensive smartphones, it said last month. The company aims
to move quickly in developing economies, where Google and Apple
are less dominant, before cheaper Android phones can strengthen
Google''s position. </p>
<p>Windows Phone will account for 7.5 percent of the China
market this year, trailing the 12 percent share of Apple''s IOS
and Android''s 70 percent, said Teck-Zhung Wong, a Beijing-based
analyst at IDC. By next year, Windows share will rise to 15
percent, surpassing Apple''s 13 percent, while still trailing
Android''s 66 percent, he said. </p>
<p>The Windows Phone ramp-up in China won''t really begin
until the second quarter, so the numbers are still low, Wong
said. From next year the ramp-up will be more rapid. </p>
<p>By 2016, Windows Phone is forecast to have a 20 percent
share in China, ahead of Apple''s 16 percent and trailing
Google''s 60 percent, Wong said. </p>
<h2>Fresh Proposition'' </h2>
<p>Windows Phone will gain market share from Apple because it
represents a fresh proposition as an alternative and will
also feature in a wider range of devices, Wong said. </p>
<p>Windows Phone will have a lot of equipment manufacturing
partners and more device choice at more different price
points, Wong said. That alone, as opposed to what Apple is
doing, will give Windows Phone an advantage. </p>
<p>Sandy Shen, a Shanghai-based analyst with Gartner Inc. said
Microsoft will have to fight against the prevalence of iPhone
and Android devices at the high-end of the market. </p>
<p>It will take a while before people appreciate the
offering, Shen said. It''s never too late for a really good
product, but there are still improvements to be made on the
Windows Phone device itself and to establish the ecosystem. </p>
<p>Microsoft is exploring the possibility of opening its own
retail stores in the country, Leung said today. </p>
<p>He also said he met with senior Chinese leaders yesterday
to discuss the nation''s ban on game consoles, including
Microsoft''s Xbox, without making any progress. </p>
<p>The ban is a little bit frustrating, Leung said. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Italy''s
biggest insurer, said operating profit may rise as much as 15
percent this year on growth in its life and non-life operations.
The company missed profit estimates after incurring writedowns. </p>
<p>Operating income will at least match last year''s 3.9
billion euros ($5.2 billion) and may reach 4.5 billion euros in
2012, according to a presentation on the Trieste-based insurer''s
website today after it reported earnings. Generali expects
operating income of as much as 2.8 billion euros in the life
segment and as much as 1.9 billion euros in non-life. </p>
<p>The shares fell as the company''s outlook disappointed some
analysts, even as Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto
said he expects strong profit growth this year. The insurer
is expanding in emerging markets and eastern Europe to boost
earnings following the financial crisis, while cutting costs,
improving efficiency and selling assets to strengthen capital. </p>
<p>Despite the positive outlook for non-life, Generali has
announced quite cautious guidance, Atanasio Pantarrotas, an
analyst at Cheuvreux, wrote in a report today. </p>
<p>Generali declined 32 cents, or 2.4 percent, to 12.85 euros
at 11:20 a.m. in Milan trading. The stock has risen 11 percent
this year, trailing the 21 percent advance in the 28-company
Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index. </p>
<p>We are already seeing signs of recovery in the first
months of 2012, Perissinotto said during a conference call.
Generali expects a reduction of the significant level of non-
recurring components that affected results in 2011. </p>
<h2>Dividend Cut, Writedowns </h2>
<p>Generali cut its dividend by 25 cents to 20 cents a share.
Net income declined to 856 million euros from 1.7 billion euros
a year earlier, missing the 1.1 billion-euro average estimate of
21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Profit was hurt as the insurer wrote down the value of
Greek bonds by 76 percent. It also wrote down its stake in Telco
SpA, the largest investor in Telecom Italia SpA, bringing total
impairments above 1 billion euros last year. The gross exposure
to Greek sovereign debt at the end of the year was 700 million
euros, the insurer said. </p>
<p>Generali''s solvency ratio, a measure of its capacity to
absorb losses, reached 117 percent at the end of December. It
climbed to 132 percent by March 1 because of a rebound in
Italian government bonds, the insurer said. The combined ratio,
a measure of claims and costs as a proportion of premiums,
improved to 96.5 percent from 98.8 percent a year earlier. </p>
<h2>PPF Joint Venture </h2>
<p>Generali may buy the 49 percent stake in its eastern
European venture it doesn''t own from PPF Group NV, using
internal resources, Perissinotto said. Generali would buy
the stake should its partner exercise a put option giving it the
right to sell in 2014, he said. </p>
<p>Generali and Amsterdam-based PPF formed a joint venture in
2007, combining their insurance assets in eastern Europe to
create a company with 9 million customers in 12 countries. PPF''s
put option is valued at 2.5 billion euros to 3 billion euros,
according to 2010 Generali''s annual report. </p>
<p>Perissinotto said Generali is also considering buying the
stake with a partner, as he received several expressions of
interest. </p>

<p>U.S. gasoline demand will probably
decline this year after peaking in 2007 amid changes to
consumption, Morgan Stanley said in a report. </p>
<p>Demand dropped by as much as 190,000 barrels a day in the
first two months of 2012 based on the bank''s calculations,
Hussein Allidina, head of commodities research, said today in
the e-mailed report. Consumption fell to 8.7 million barrels a
day last year from a record 9.3 million barrels in 2007, it said
without citing the source of the data. </p>
<p>This fall is both a result of cyclical and structural
factors and see improving fuel efficiency and changing driving
patterns as likely limiting gasoline demand growth in the
future, Allidina said in the report. </p>
<p>As crude costs increased, gasoline prices rose, leading to
a decline in usage as fewer miles are travelled. Gasoline has
gained 25 percent this year on the New York Mercantile Exchange. </p>
<p>Demand will fall by 80,000 barrels a day from 2012 to 2017,
even as the economy recovers from next year, on improving fuel
efficiency from new vehicles, the bank said. </p>

<p>Raj Sethi, a managing director in
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s commodity-derivatives trading group,
quit after 14 years and may join a hedge fund, according to a
person with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Sethi, 35, who once ran the bank''s U.S. power-trading
business, left earlier this week, said the person who asked not
to be identified because the information is private. Ben Jacobs,
a vice president in the commodities group, also quit last week,
the person said. </p>
<p>Sethi and Jacobs, who traded the firm''s money as part of
their jobs, add to the exodus of proprietary traders who have
left New York-based Goldman Sachs and other firms because of new
U.S. regulations. The Volcker rule, named for former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, seeks to reduce the chance that
banks will make risky investments with their own capital and put
depositors'' money at risk. </p>
<p>Michael Duvally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the departures. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs started shuttering its proprietary-trading
desk in 2010, prompting Pierre-Henri Flamand and Morgan Sze, who
had run the global principal strategies group, to start their
own hedge funds in London and Hong Kong. </p>
<h2>Macro Fund </h2>
<p>In the U.S., Bennett Grau and Mark Mallon are teaming up
with former colleague Marc Mezvinsky to start a global macro
hedge fund this year, a person with knowledge of their plans
said last year. </p>
<p>Sethi joined Goldman Sachs in 1998 in New York and later
moved to Singapore and London, where he traded oil and other
commodities. He returned to New York in 2006 and most recently
traded commodities with a macro focus. Macro is a strategy that
seeks to profit from broad economic trends by trading everything
from currencies to bonds. </p>
<p>Taimur Hassan, who was responsible for Goldman Sachs''s oil
trading across Europe, the Middle East and Asia, quit in
December to start his own hedge fund, Financial News reported
last month, citing company filings and sources familiar with the
matter. </p>

Braun" date="Mar 21, 2012 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-21/jpmorgan-claims-no-1-for-government-debt-after-jefferson-county.html"><headline>JPMorgan Claims No. 1 for Government Debt After Jefferson County</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Philadelphia was running low on
cash in August 2009 as Pennsylvania lawmakers refused to pass a
temporary sales-tax increase for the state''s biggest city. </p>
<p>Unable to sell notes with the legislation in flux, the
fifth-most populous U.S. city turned to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) for
a $275 million loan. The firm was rewarded two years later, when
Philadelphia chose it over 13 other banks to manage a $254
million negotiated bond issue. </p>
<p>JPMorgan brought their balance sheet to support the
city, said Nancy Winkler, Philadelphia''s treasurer. That''s
an important relationship, their ability to bring that. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which emerged from the worst financial crisis
since the 1930s as the most profitable U.S. bank, has parlayed
crisis-era loans to cities and states and a willingness to
outbid other firms in local government bond auctions into
becoming the top underwriter of municipal debt last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the first time
the firm held that rank. </p>
<p>The turnaround was a milestone for JPMorgan''s municipal-
bond department, which has been marred by its involvement in two
of the biggest scandals in the history of U.S. public finance: a
so-called pay-to-play scheme in Jefferson County, Alabama, that
contributed to the biggest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy, and a
federal probe that uncovered bid rigging of municipal-bond
investment products. It also underscores state and local
officials'' willingness to overlook bankers'' past abuses when
they set out to borrow money in debt markets. </p>
<h2>Good Service'' </h2>
<p>I haven''t found an investment bank that hasn''t had some
problem in the last three years, California Treasurer Bill Lockyer said in a telephone interview. We do business with
them all. I think they provide good service. I think they''ve
been highly ethical with us. </p>
<p>In November 2009, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million
settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to
end a case over secret payments to friends of Jefferson County
commissioners in the sale of sewer bonds and interest-rate
swaps. The county filed for bankruptcy protection four months
ago. Last July the firm agreed to pay $211 million in a separate
settlement with state and federal regulators, admitting that
former employees had rigged bids of municipal-investment
contracts. </p>
<p>In 2011, JPMorgan managed $35.7 billion of long-term bond
sales, $200 million more than Bank of America Merrill Lynch, its
closest competitor, according to Bloomberg data. This year
through March 19, JPMorgan also ranked first, with Bank of
America second. </p>
<h2>Deploying Our Capital'' </h2>
<p>Deploying our capital for municipalities and non-profits
all around the country is one of the most powerful ways we, as
an institution, can use our position of strength, said Paul Palmeri, 46, who was selected to head New York-based JPMorgan''s
public-finance department on March 13. </p>
<p>The financial crisis that began in 2007 led to a
consolidation of investment banking, including in the $3.7
trillion U.S. municipal market. Bear Stearns Cos., the broker-
dealer operation of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc (LEH). and Merrill
Lynch  Co. (MER) were absorbed by JPMorgan, Barclays Plc (BARC) and Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) respectively. UBS AG (UBSN) left the public finance
business. </p>
<p>Last year JPMorgan, Bank of America Merrill, Citigroup Inc. (C)
and Morgan Stanley (MS) managed 46 percent of the $283.3 billion in
long-term municipal debt issued in the U.S. </p>
<p>Issuance fell 36 percent from the previous year because the
federal Build America Bonds program expired and cash-strapped
governments curbed new borrowing. </p>
<p>Palmeri took over the bank''s municipal business from Jeff Bosland, who was promoted last week to the head of sales and
marketing for fixed income and equities in the Americas. </p>
<h2>Drummer </h2>
<p>Palmeri, a drummer who played in high school and college
bands and counts Rush''s Neil Peart and rock-fusion percussionist
Shane Gaalaas among his favorites, was formerly head of
municipal sales and trading. </p>
<p>Bosland and Palmeri joined JPMorgan''s municipal department
from other parts of the bank in April 2008. Bosland, who was
JPMorgan''s head of agency trading and underwriting, became co-
head of public finance. Palmeri, who worked in the bank''s
mortgages group, became head of short-term municipal sales and
trading. </p>
<p>Financial damage was all around them. A month before,
JPMorgan had acquired Bear Stearns in a forced sale, after
clients and investors pulled $17 billion in cash from the 85-
year-old firm in two days, fearing losses on subprime bonds. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the SEC was probing JPMorgan''s sales of $5
billion of bonds and derivatives to Jefferson County. And
federal prosecutors were targeting the bank''s former head of
municipal derivative sales and at least four others in a
criminal antitrust investigation into bid rigging involving
products that state and local governments use to invest bond
proceeds. </p>
<h2>Work to Do'' </h2>
<p>It''s very fair to say, when we began in 2008, we had a
lot of work to do, said Palmeri. </p>
<p>One of their first priorities was integrating the JPMorgan
and Bear Stearns banking teams. JPMorgan cut about 70 of its
public finance employees, replacing some of them with Bear
personnel. The acquisition boosted JPMorgan''s profile in state
housing finance and helped it expand its national banking
coverage. Key hires in transportation and public power brought
in more clients. </p>
<p>The bank also started addressing its regulatory and legal
issues. </p>
<p>In September 2008, JPMorgan said it would close its
municipal derivatives desk, stopping the sales of interest-rate
swaps to states and local governments. </p>
<h2>SEC Lawsuit </h2>
<p>A year later, the SEC sued two former JPMorgan bankers,
saying they made more than $8 million in secret payments to
friends of Jefferson County commissioners. The firm inflated the
cost of the swaps to cover the payments, the SEC said. </p>
<p>Larry Langford, the former Jefferson County commissioner in
charge of finance, was found guilty on U.S. criminal charges of
accepting bribes from a local investment banker who had received
payments from JPMorgan. No charges were filed against the firm. </p>
<p>Under chief executive Jamie Dimon, who joined the bank
after the Jefferson County deals were done, JPMorgan largely
avoided investing in subprime housing loans. Dimon has said the
bank didn''t need $25 billion in bailout money offered by the
Federal Reserve. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was the only major U.S. financial institution to
remain profitable throughout the crisis. On March 13, it raised
its dividend and authorized a share-repurchase plan after
passing the Federal Reserve''s tests of how lenders would fare in
an economic decline. </p>
<h2>Continuing to Lend </h2>
<p>The bank continued to lend to state and local governments
throughout the recession as others pulled back, with the support
of senior management. </p>
<p>They walked into the financial crisis with one of the
strongest bank balance sheets. Why not use it? said
Christopher Kit Taylor, former executive director of the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. You probably knew you
were going to get the underwriting on the other side. </p>
<p>In August 2009, after California closed a $24 billion
budget deficit, JPMorgan loaned the state $1.5 billion so it
could pay IOU''s issued during a cash crisis. The loan helped
keep the state funded until September, when it could issue $8.8
billion in short-term debt. </p>
<p>Last month, JPMorgan loaned California $500 million for
four months at 0.2 percent so the most-populous U.S. state could
pay bills after tax collections trailed budgeted amounts.
Barclays, which acquired Lehman''s investment banking and capital
markets operations, also lent the state $500 million, charging a
lower interest-rate than other banks, Lockyer said. </p>
<h2>$1.9 Billion </h2>
<p>JPMorgan and Barclays also co-managed a $1.9 billion
refinancing for the state. Lockyer said that the favorable terms
of the short-term loan was one of the considerations for
hiring the two banks to handle the refinancing. </p>
<p>Lockyer said JPMorgan''s support in hard times is something
officials remember when issuing new bonds. </p>
<p>When there''s a stretch on the side of the bank and a good
deal for the state, we certainly consider that when we''re doing
future business, he said. It''s not automatic but it
certainly gives them brownie points. </p>
<p>In addition to offering direct loans, JPMorgan has
increased its focus on competitive underwriting, showing a
greater willingness to commit the bank''s capital to buy bonds
and then resell them to investors. JPMorgan increased its share
of competitive long-term bond issues last year to 19.5 percent
from 10.3 percent the previous year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Competitive Sale </h2>
<p>In a competitive sale an issuer offers its bonds for sale
and banks bid against each other to purchase the bonds. The bank
assumes the risk it might not be able to sell all the bonds it
bought. </p>
<p>Nationwide, about 20 percent of debt issued by states and
local governments is sold through competitive bids. The rest is
done through negotiated underwriting, in which municipalities
select a bank in advance to price the bonds. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s readiness to take risks in competitive
underwriting was on display in December 2008, when, a week after
Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich was arrested, it was the only
bank to bid on a $1 billion portion of $1.4 billion in short-
term notes. The state had delayed the deal because of
Blagojevich''s indictment for bribery. </p>
<p>JPMorgan also bought $9.1 billion of $9.8 billion of short-
term notes auctioned by Texas last August -- the biggest
competitive auction in municipal-market history. </p>
<h2>Shows Our Commitment'' </h2>
<p>That shows our commitment to use our balance sheet when
we think it''s appropriate to help our clients, Palmeri said. </p>
<p>This December, in a $400 million auction of Massachusetts
bonds on December 20, JPMorgan offered a total interest cost of
2.57 percent, beating Bank of America, the second-lowest bidder,
offering 2.79 percent. The competition helped Massachusetts save
$880,000. </p>
<p>As part of the Massachusetts deal, JPMorgan agreed to buy
$40 million of bonds maturing in 2021, paying $114 per $1,000
security. The same day, $10 million of the bonds were sold to a
customer for $113 per $1,000 bonds, a $100,000 loss, trade
records filed with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
show. </p>
<h2>Incredibly Important'' </h2>
<p>It''s not a high-margin business, but it''s a business
that''s incredibly important to our clients, said James Lansing, JPMorgan''s head of municipal debt capital markets. If
a firm is willing to commit its own capital to underwrite bonds
and it''s confident that it can distribute that paper, that''s a
great fact that other issuers can point to and say, I know I
can award negotiated business to this underwriter because
they''re going to get great execution.''  </p>
<p>That''s what happened in Washington State last year. The
state chose JPMorgan from a pre-qualified pool of banks to
manage $1.1 billion of bonds. The state selected JPMorgan in
part because of the bank''s participation in its competitive bond
sales and also its expertise in structuring transportation
deals, said Chris McGann, a spokesman for Treasurer James
McIntyre. </p>
<p>They''re able to place the bonds and they''re familiar with
the type of investors who like to invest in Washington, McGann
said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has beefed up its distribution to individual
investors through strategic agreements with UBS and Charles
Schwab  Co. The agreements give JPMorgan access to 17,000 of
the two firms'' retail brokers. </p>
<h2>Beyond the Scandals </h2>
<p>That JPMorgan was able get underwriting business in
Philadelphia shows it has moved beyond the scandals. </p>
<p>In 2005, two former JPMorgan bankers pleaded guilty to
arranging a $50,000 payment to a bond lawyer and fundraiser for
former Mayor John Street to get underwriting business. </p>
<p>That prompted officials working for the new mayor, Michael Nutter, to avoid doing underwriting business through JPMorgan
for more than year, Treasurer Nancy Winkler said. </p>
<p>That changed when JPMorgan loaned Philadelphia money to pay
its bills in August 2009. </p>
<p>They got rid of a lot of people, a lot of leadership, as
well as the bankers, she said. The bankers that they have
covering the city are very good. We need to be able to have them
as partners. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $125
million of securities linked to developer Larry Silverstein''s 7
World Trade Center in New York, refinancing debt against the
building. </p>
<p>The commercial-mortgage bonds rated Baa3 by Moody''s
Investors Service and BBB- by Fitch Ratings, the lowest
investment-grade rankings, priced to yield 310 basis points more
than the benchmark swap rate, according to a person familiar
with the offering, who declined to be identified because terms
aren''t public. The refinancing also includes $452.8 million of
senior tax-exempt Liberty bonds that were not offered with
today''s transaction, the person said. </p>
<p>The CMBS deal comprises debt against the 52-story tower in
downtown Manhattan constructed in 2006, according to Moody''s.
The property is 95.2 percent leased to 28 tenants, the rating
company said in a report. The largest tenant is Moody''s,
accounting for 38.7 of the available space, according to Fitch. </p>
<p>The tower was built to replace a building destroyed in the
Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. </p>
<p>The offering is different from more common commercial-
mortgage backed securities deals in that it is less diversified
than those that bundle loans from multiple borrowers on as many
as 100 properties. </p>
<p>Bank forecasts for commercial-mortgage bond sales in 2012
range from Wells Fargo  Co.''s $25 billion to Credit Suisse
Group AG''s projection of as much as $45 billion. About $4
billion has been issued this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>CMBS Sales </h2>
<p>Wall Street banks arranged about $28 billion of commercial-
mortgage backed securities last year, compared with $11.5
billion in 2010. Rising sales are a boon for property owners
with loans coming due. Borrowers have $51 billion of mortgages
packed into bonds maturing this year, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch data. </p>
<p>Relative yields on top-ranked commercial-mortgage bonds
have plunged to 181 basis points more than Treasuries, the
lowest since May, according to the Barclays Capital CMBS Aaa
Super Duper Index. That''s down from a high of 323 basis points
on Oct. 4, at the height of the European sovereign-debt crisis.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>

<p>TiVo Inc. (TIVO) said Microsoft Corp.
agreed to drop patent-infringement litigation that could have

<p>TiVo said in a regulatory filing it didn''t grant patent
rights to Microsoft, and it agreed to drop counterclaims against
the Redmond, Washington-based software maker. </p>
<p>Microsoft filed patent-infringement complaints at the U.S.

<p>An ex-FrontPoint Partners LLC fund
manager, Joseph F. Chip Skowron, who began serving a five-
year sentence for insider trading in January, must pay Morgan
Stanley (MS) $10.2 million, a judge ruled. </p>
<p>The amount consists of $3.8 million in legal fees the bank
spent on Skowron''s case and an internal investigation, plus 20
percent of his salary from 2007 to 2010, or $6.4 million, U.S.
District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan ruled March 21. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley acquired FrontPoint in 2006 and spun off the
unit last year. </p>
<p>Cote denied the New York-based bank''s request for repayment
of the $33 million it paid to settle claims by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The amount represents the
disgorgement of the losses the FrontPoint unit avoided as a
result of Skowron''s insider trading, Cote said in the ruling. </p>
<p>Skowron, who began serving his prison sentence in January
at the Federal Correctional Institution Schuylkill in
Pennsylvania, argued that Morgan Stanley shouldn''t collect any
funds under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. </p>
<p>Skowron, who has a medical degree from Yale School of
Medicine, pleaded guilty to getting illegal tips from a former
adviser for Human Genome Sciences Inc. (HGSI) that trials of the
company''s hepatitis C drug were being halted. </p>
<p>FrontPoint sold its stock before the announcement was made
public, avoiding $30 million in losses, the government said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is pleased with Cote''s decision and plans to
seek the $33 million from Skowron in a separate civil action,
Matt Burkhard, a spokesman for the bank, said yesterday in a
phone interview. </p>
<p>While we are reviewing the court''s decision, and
considering our options, Dr. Skowron has made it clear he will
accept all responsibility for his actions under the law, his
attorney, Josh Epstein, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>However, we do not believe that Morgan Stanley is even
entitled to the amount of restitution it has secured with this
decision. We can assure you that Morgan Stanley''s attempt to
claw back $33 million in ill-gotten gains, as Judge Cote herself
referred to those monies in rejecting Morgan Stanley''s claim, is
meritless. It is startling that Morgan Stanley would ignore the
court''s clear decision to make a grab for money to which it has
no legal right. </p>
<p>The criminal case is U.S. v. Skowron, 1:11-cr-00699, and
the SEC case is SEC v. Benhamou, 10-cv-8266, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Hedge Fund Loses Case Against Sweden''s SEB Over Option Losses </h2>
<p>A hedge fund that saw the value of its assets fall more
than 90 percent in a month at the peak of the global credit
crisis lost a lawsuit against Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEBA)
over the liquidation of a trading account. </p>
<p>Euroption Strategic Fund Ltd. sued Sweden''s fourth-largest
bank in London, claiming it suffered damages and lost profits of
as much as 173 million euros ($229 million) when the lender
closed out its portfolio of derivatives in October 2008 after
the fund didn''t meet margin calls. </p>
<p>Judge Elizabeth Gloster ruled SEB was right to make a
margin call and liquidate positions when extreme market swings
left Euroption facing losses of about 50 million euros, or 70
percent of the value of its assets. The bank''s conduct as
clearing broker could not be characterized as either negligent
or irrational, Gloster said in a judgment released this week. </p>
<p>The collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) in September
2008 sent stocks tumbling, producing a period of unprecedented
volatility, Gloster said. Euroption''s strategy was to sell
out-of-the-money equity-index options that paid a premium if
markets remained stable. When shares fell and customers
exercised the options, the fund was left exposed. </p>
<p>The fund, based in the British Virgin Islands, had assets
of about 70 million euros before the credit crisis and is now
worth about 6 million euros. Euroption claimed in the suit that
SEB and its then head of futures clearing, Steve Martin, didn''t
understand options trading and that closing out the positions
was slow, disorganized and often misdirected. </p>
<p>Euroption is considering an appeal, according to its lawyer
Sean Upson. </p>

<h2>Ex-Bear Stearns Employees to Get $10 Million in Settlement </h2>
<p>Thousands of former Bear Stearns Cos. (BSC) employees will share
a $10 million settlement of lawsuits claiming they lost money on
the bank''s stock in their retirement accounts. </p>
<p>Two ex-Bear Stearns employees asked March 20 a federal
court judge in Manhattan to approve the settlement on behalf of
an estimated 8,400 former colleagues. </p>
<p>The settlement will resolve class-action suits filed
beginning in 2008 against Bear Stearns and other defendants by
former employees of the bank. The employees, participants and
beneficiaries of Bear Stearns''s employee stock ownership plan
who held shares of the bank''s common stock, claimed risky
investments in subprime mortgages caused them to lose money. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. bought Bear Stearns in March 2008 when
the firm was on the brink of failing. </p>
<p>The parties engaged in mediation in October 2009 and
pursued negotiations in telephone conferences through the end of
last year, the investors said in court papers seeking approval
for the agreement. They said the settlement may equal 10 percent
to 28 percent of the losses to the stock ownership plan. </p>
<p>The case is In re Bear Stearns Cos. Securities, Derivative
and ERISA Litigation, 09-MDL-1963, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Wal-Mart to Pay $2 Million for Overcharges, California Says </h2>
<p>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) will pay $2.1 million for overcharging
consumers in violation of a 2008 agreement to stop scanning
errors that resulted in customers paying more for products than
their shelf price. </p>
<p>California Attorney General Kamala Harris yesterday filed a
modified judgment in San Diego Superior Court that resolves Wal-
Mart''s failure to comply with the 2008 agreement, Harris said in
an e-mailed statement. The judgment was also filed with San
Diego District Attorney Bonnie M. Dumanis and San Diego City
Attorney Jan I. Goldsmith, according to the statement. </p>
<p>As a result of the 2008 agreement, consumers who were
overcharged at cash registers received $3 off the lowest
advertised price of the item, and if the price was less than $3,
Wal-Mart was required to give the item free of charge, according
to the statement. Yesterday''s judgment means the program,
originally intended to end in November, will be extended to
November 2013, Harris said. </p>
<p>Wal-Mart will also describe the policy in large signs in
English and Spanish at each of about 3,000 check-out stands at
180 stores in California, according to the statement. </p>
<p>We always strive for 100 percent pricing accuracy and
will continue to make improvements to ensure we meet this
goal, Steve Restivo, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-
based Wal-Mart, said in an e-mailed statement. California
families can trust Wal-Mart to deliver on our mission to help
them save money and live better. </p>

<h2>New Suits </h2>
<h2>Midas Sued by Shareholder Over $173 Million TBC Acquisition </h2>
<p>Midas Inc. (MDS) was sued by a shareholder claiming the takeover
price of about $173 million offered by tire supplier TBC Corp. (TBCC)
is inadequate. </p>
<p>The deal undervalues the company given its improving sales
trends and its strategy to co-brand Midas and SpeeDee shops,
shareholder Glenn Freedman said in the complaint filed yesterday
in Delaware Chancery Court. Freedman is seeking to represent all
Midas shareholders in his bid for a court order barring the
transaction. </p>
<p>The proposed transaction is wrongful, unfair and harmful
to Midas public shareholders, Freedman said in the complaint. </p>
<p>Midas, which has more than 2,250 franchised, licensed and
company owned namesake shops in 14 countries, announced March 13
that it agreed to a cash offer of $11.50 a share. The
transaction also includes the assumption of $137 million in debt
and pension liabilities. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which served as Midas''s financial
adviser, was unable to provide independent, disinterested
financial advice to the company because of its affiliation
with TBC parent Sumitomo Corp. (8053), Freedman said in his complaint. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has disclosed that it owns 1 percent or more of
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) securities and has
performed and received compensation from that company for both
investment banking and non-investment banking services, Freedman
said in the complaint. JPMorgan wasn''t named as a defendant in
the case. </p>
<p>Bob Troyer, a spokesman for Midas, didn''t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment on the complaint. Jennifer
Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, also didn''t return a phone
call and e-mail seeking comment on the claims. </p>

<h2>Lawsuits/Pretrial </h2>
<h2>ADM, Corn Refiners Seek Dismissal From Sugar Producers'' Lawsuit </h2>
<p>Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) and four other corn refiners
asked a judge to dismiss them from a lawsuit by sugar producers
over allegedly false advertising that high-fructose corn syrup
is natural. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the corn refiners said at a hearing yesterday
before U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall in Los Angeles
that the companies can''t be made liable for the statements of a
trade group of which they are members, the Corn Refiners
Association. </p>
<p>A group of sugar growers and refiners last year sued the
corn refiners and their trade association, claiming that an
advertising campaign that promotes high-fructose corn syrup as
natural and nutritionally the same as table sugar is
false and misleading. </p>
<p>The sugar producers, in an amended complaint filed in
November, said the corn refiners initiated the advertising
campaign in 2008 in response to the growing vilification of
high-fructose corn syrup, which is used as a sweetener in soft
drinks and has been linked to an increase in obesity in the
U.S., and a resulting drop in sales. </p>
<p>The corn refiners have sought approval from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration to substitute corn sugar for high-
fructose corn syrup on ingredient labels, according to the
complaint. </p>

<h2>Tenet Healthcare Suit Over Community Health Buyout Dismissed </h2>
<p>A federal judge dismissed Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC)''s lawsuit
against Community Health (CYH) Systems Inc. seeking to recover costs
incurred rebuffing a takeover bid. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Barbara M.G. Lynn in Dallas ruled
yesterday that Congress didn''t intend for target companies to
recover damages such as those Tenet sought. The case was
dismissed with prejudice, meaning Tenet can''t refile. </p>
<p>Community Health, the second-largest U.S. hospital company,
dropped its $7.3 billion bid in May after the board of Dallas-
based Tenet rejected the all-cash takeover offer as grossly
inadequate. A month earlier, Tenet sued Community Health,
accusing it of defrauding Medicare, the federal health insurance
program. Community Health called the suit baseless. </p>
<p>Tenet later modified its lawsuit to seek damages for
unspecified but significant costs it said it incurred in
analyzing Community Health''s offer. Tenet argued that Community
Health gave it cause to hire consultants and begin an
investigation because Community Health made misleading
statements about synergies that a combination would produce. </p>
<p>Lawyers for Franklin, Tennessee-based Community Health
argued that there was no legal basis for Tenet to recover costs
and damages. They said that companies in takeover battles pay
their own expenses. </p>
<p>We''re disappointed in the ruling, but it''s important to
remember it wasn''t a ruling on the substance of our claims
against Community Health, Rob Walters, a lawyer for Tenet,
said. It was a ruling on the technical issue of whether Tenet
could have standing to recover the costs it incurred. </p>
<p>Peter Duffy Doyle, a lawyer for Community Health, referred
a request for comment to Tomi Galin, a company spokeswoman, who
didn''t immediately return a phone call. </p>
<p>The case is Tenet Healthcare Corp. v. Community Health
Systems Inc., 3:11-00732, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of Texas (Dallas). </p>
<h2>NAB Wins $6.5 Million Security Payment in Australia Lawsuit </h2>
<p>National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) shareholders must pay the bank
A$6.2 million ($6.5 million) as security for its legal costs in
a class action lawsuit, a judge ruled in a decision the
stockholders'' lawyer said may deter investors from seeking legal
redress. </p>
<p>The shareholders sued in the Supreme Court of Victoria in
Melbourne in November 2010 seeking to recoup A$450 million they
claim was lost as the bank''s stock declined because of its
exposure to U.S. subprime debt in 2008. The security payment may
be the biggest in Australian history, according to an e-mailed
statement yesterday from the bank. </p>
<p>National Australia Bank said it expects to spend more than
A$20 million on legal costs until trial and had asked the judge
to order the shareholders to pay A$11 million. The plaintiffs
challenged it, calling the sum extraordinary in size and
unprecedented in Australian legal history, according to the
ruling by Justice Jennifer Davies, who cut the requested amount
by almost half. </p>
<p>It sets a precedent in Victoria and reduces access to
justice, Jacob Varghese of Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, who
represents the shareholders, said in a telephone interview
yesterday. The final amount is still very high, he said. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs would usually be unable to put up that much
money in security, he said. In this case the lawsuit is being
funded by International Litigation Funding Partners Pte, who
will pay the amount, Varghese said. </p>
<p>The trial is scheduled to begin in December, according to
the bank. </p>
<p>National Australia Bank failed to disclose at the beginning
of 2008 that it had serious exposure and serious risk of losses,
from its subprime mortgage exposure, Andrew Watson, Maurice
Blackburn principal, said when the lawsuit was filed. </p>

Australia Bank Ltd. SCL2010-6249. Supreme Court of Victoria

<h2>Ex-Lehman Director Jack Pleads Not Guilty to Forgery Charge </h2>
<p>Former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. managing director
Bradley H. Jack pleaded not guilty to a second drug-prescription
forgery charge in Connecticut state court. </p>
<p>Jack, 53, said nothing during his arraignment yesterday in
Norwalk Superior Court, where Judge Bruce Hudock said he entered
a plea of not guilty. Jack, who is free on bail, is due back in
court April 24. </p>
<p>The former banker was arrested this month and charged with
second-degree forgery for a November incident in which he
allegedly altered the date on a prescription for Vyvanse, which
is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, at a
CVS Caremark Corp. pharmacy in Westport, Connecticut. </p>
<p>Jack, of Westport, was also arrested in June after he
allegedly tried to pass forged prescriptions for Ritalin and the
painkiller Oxycontin, according to Fairfield police. Jack had
received treatment for cancer, had had a valid prescription in
the past and had no prior criminal record, his attorney, Robert
Golger, said in court in August. </p>
<p>After his June arrest, Jack was allowed to enter so-called
accelerated rehabilitation, or AR, a program available to people
charged with less-serious crimes that might result in prison
time. Golger said after yesterday''s proceeding that he didn''t
know how the latest arrest would affect the earlier case. </p>
<p>In the latest incident, Jack admitted to police that he
altered the prescription, according to the arrest affidavit. He
told police his psychiatrist is blind and his assistant, who
fills out the prescriptions, put the wrong effective date on the
Vyvanse prescription. In October, the doctor switched Jack from
Ritalin to 50-milligram pills of Vyvanse. </p>
<p>Jack joined New York-based Lehman in 1984 and ran
investment banking from 1996 to 2002, when he became co-chief
operating officer with Joseph Gregory. In 2004, he was named to
the office of the chairman with the responsibility of overseeing
all of the firm''s investment-banking relationships. </p>
<p>He decided to retire from Lehman to pursue work in the
nonprofit sector and spend time with his family, Richard Fuld,
the bank''s chief executive officer at the time, said in June
2005. The company went bankrupt in September 2008. </p>
<p>The case is Connecticut v. Jack, S20N-CR12-0131552-S,
Connecticut Superior Court (Norwalk). The earlier case is
Connecticut v. Jack, F02B-CR11-0258280-S, Connecticut Superior
Court (Bridgeport). </p>

<h2>New York Law School Wins Dismissal of Suit by Ex-Students </h2>
<p>New York Law School won dismissal of a lawsuit filed by
former students who accused the school of inflating statistics
on graduates'' jobs and pay. </p>
<p>New York State Supreme Court Judge Melvin L. Schweitzer Jr.
dismissed the suit in a ruling yesterday, saying that the
school''s marketing materials weren''t misleading and that the
students had ample information from other sources about job
prospects. </p>
<p>The former students sued the 1,500-student school in
August, accusing it of knowingly inflating employment and salary
statistics to recruit and retain students. A similar complaint
was filed against Thomas M. Cooley Law School in Lansing,
Michigan, the same day. </p>
<p>Schweitzer also said the plaintiffs'' demand of damages that
would equal the difference between what they paid for law school
and how much their degree is worth is not a remedy under the law
since the great recession of 2008 and its aftermath have
wreaked havoc on the legal job market. </p>
<p>As law graduates who made their decisions to go to law
school before the full effects of the maelstrom hit, they now
have turned their disappointment and angst on their law school
for not adequately anticipating the possibility of the
supervening storm and presenting the most complete job-related
data that could possibly have been compiled, Schweitzer wrote. </p>
<p>The former students plan to appeal, said David Anziska, an
attorney representing the plaintiffs. The judge''s two main
points, that consumers shouldn''t have relied on the school''s
employment reports and that damages are too speculative, are
fundamentally questions of fact, not law, he said in an e-
mail. </p>
<p>New York Law School, founded in 1891, is one of the oldest
independent law schools in the U.S. with about 1,500 students,
according to its website. Michael Volpe, an attorney who
represented the school in the case, said he is confident and
comfortable the decision will be upheld on appeal. </p>
<p>The case is Gomez-Jimenez v. New York Law School,
652226/2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Exxon Says Significant Progress'' Made to End Alaska Gas Dispute </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) has made significant progress toward
resolving an Alaska natural-gas dispute, and more work remains
to reach a settlement, David Eglinton, a company spokesman, said
in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Exxon, BP Plc (BP/) and other oil companies are embroiled in a
six-year-old lawsuit over their leases to the Point Thomson oil
and gas field on Alaska''s North Slope, estimated to hold 300
million barrels of oil and 8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. </p>
<p>The state revoked the leases, which date back to 1965, in
2006 for failure to submit an acceptable development plan. The
companies sued and won a court ruling last year reversing that
decision. </p>
<p>Alaska Governor Sean Parnell said March 20 that the parties
had been meeting over the last three months and the companies
had been given a deadline of the end of this month. </p>
<p>The state is cautiously optimistic that the Point Thomson
dispute will be resolved by the governor''s deadline, Elizabeth
Bluemink, a spokeswoman for the Alaska Department of Natural
Resources, said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>She declined to comment about what would be included in the
settlement. Parnell said earlier this month that his goal was
production out of Point Thomson. The oil companies,
primarily Exxon, have invested more than $1 billion in the field
over the last three years, he said. </p>
<p>Dawn Patience, a BP spokeswoman, said in an e-mail
yesterday that company teams are actively working to resolve
the Point Thomson issue. </p>
<p>We''re still in a joint discussion phase regarding an
effort that would evaluate a North Slope liquefied natural gas
pipeline, Natalie Lowman, a ConocoPhillips (COP) spokeswoman, said
in an phone interview. </p>
<p>The lower-court case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. State of
Alaska, 3AN-06-13751, Alaska Superior Court, Anchorage. The
appeal is State of Alaska v. Exxon Mobil, S-13730, Alaska
Supreme Court. </p>

<h2>Trials/Appeals </h2>
<h2>Allen Stanford Cites Media Tweets'' as Basis for New Trial </h2>
<p>R. Allen Stanford is entitled to a new trial because
publicity prior to the six-week proceeding and Twitter posts by
reporters in the courtroom likely tainted the jury, his lawyers
told a U.S. judge. </p>
<p>The Texas financier, who was accused of leading a $7
billion international investment fraud, was found guilty of 13
criminal counts by a federal court jury in Houston on March 6.
Facing as long as 20 years in prison for each of four wire fraud
and five mail fraud charges, Stanford is scheduled to be
sentenced on June 14. </p>
<p>His lawyers, in a 71-page filing with U.S. District Judge
David Hittner, who presided over the case, said the pretrial and
midtrial publicity probably prevented the jury from being
impartial. </p>
<p>This court failed to sequester the jury and permitted the
news media to occupy the courtroom during trial and permitted
the media to tweet'' throughout the trial, they said in a
filing March 20, referring to Twitter Inc.''s platform for
disseminating 140-character messages via the Internet. </p>
<p>Stanford, 61, led Houston-based Stanford Financial Group
and securities firm Stanford Group Co., as well as the Antigua-
based Stanford International Bank Ltd., which issued
certificates of deposit sold by the brokerage. </p>
<p>At trial, prosecutors argued that Stanford misled investors
about how he and his organization were investing the CD
depositors'' money. Defense lawyers countered that the
organization maintained sufficient assets to honor its
commitments until it was closed after being sued by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2009. </p>
<p>Laura Sweeney, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice
Department, declined to comment, citing a gag order by the
judge. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V) said China''s recent
decision to let Citigroup Inc. issue credit cards may be the
start of a broader market opening that will allow the world''s
largest payments processor to expand in the country. </p>
<p>Visa will keep investing in its business of processing
foreign-denominated payments in the world''s second-largest
economy, Elizabeth Buse, group president responsible for most
business outside the Americas, said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television today. China UnionPay Data Co. has a
monopoly on handling yuan payments. </p>
<p>Global payment volumes at Visa surpassed $1 trillion last
year, with 30 percent from Asia, Buse said. Volume growth in
China was more than 50 percent, she said. Citigroup last month
became the first foreign bank allowed to issue credit cards in
the world''s most populous nation. </p>
<p>We hope that the license that has been granted to Citi is
just the beginning of a broader opening of that market, said
Buse. The only thing that might immediately lead to a market
opening is a U.S. complaint about the monopoly at the World
Trade Organization, she said. </p>
<p>Acting on the U.S.''s criticism, the WTO is investigating
China''s requirement that yuan-denominated payments be executed
through China UnionPay Data. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)''s Watson computer, which beat champions of the quiz show
Jeopardy! last year and is starting to be sold to insurers
and banks, is to provide help to doctors and patients on
diagnosis and treatment for cancer. </p>
<p>Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and IBM
have agreed to collaborate on the development of a Watson-based
service that will assist the hospital group''s doctors with the
diagnosis of cancer and suggest treatment options by mining the
most current and comprehensive information available, the two
parties said in a joint statement today. </p>
<p>Combining Watson with Sloan-Kettering''s clinical knowledge,
as well as with the latest cancer research, will make the
service a decision support tool, Armonk, New York-based IBM
and Memorial Sloan-Kettering said. </p>
<p>IBM says Watson''s skills -- interpreting queries in natural
language, consulting vast volumes of unstructured information
quickly, and answering questions with a defined level of
confidence -- can be applied to many industries. It has already
sold the technology to WellPoint Inc. (WLP), the U.S. insurer, and
Citigroup Inc. (C), and expects to generate billions in new revenue
by 2015 from putting Watson to work. </p>
<p>Physicians require a lot more information to make the
proper decision as we learn more about the biology of cancer,
Martin Kohn, IBM''s chief medical scientist, said in an
interview. Using Watson we have access to much more
information than we could possibly accomplish by reading on our
own, or even 100 people reading. </p>
<h2>Grand Challenge'' </h2>
<p>Watson is being taught oncology and being programmed with
the types of questions it will be posed in a similar way to when
it was trained for Jeopardy! Applying Watson to the field of
cancer diagnosis and treatment, given its importance on both a
human and economic level, is exactly the type of grand challenge
IBM Watson can help address, Kohn said in the statement. </p>
<p>Sloan-Kettering and IBM are already developing the first
applications using Watson related to lung, breast and prostate
cancers, and aim to begin piloting the solutions to some
oncologists in late 2012, with wider distribution planned for
late 2013. </p>
<p>The combination of transformational technologies found in
Watson with our cancer analytics and decision-making process has
the potential to revolutionize the accessibility of information
for the treatment of cancer in communities across the country
and around the world, Sloan-Kettering Chief Executive Officer
Craig B. Thompson said in the statement. We also expect
tremendous new research opportunities to emerge from this
collaboration. </p>
<h2>Artificial Intelligence </h2>
<p>In February 2011, about 15 million viewers watched Watson
beat former Jeopardy! champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter
-- a highly publicized victory in artificial intelligence that
IBM always aimed to apply to the business world. </p>
<p>The supercomputer, including its work in the health-care
and finance industries, will contribute a portion of IBM''s
target of $16 billion of analytics revenue in 2015, Manoj Saxena, the man responsible for finding Watson business, said in
a February interview. That portion will have a B next to it,
Saxena said. </p>
<p>Watson may generate $2.65 billion in revenue in 2015,
adding 52 cents of earnings per share, Ed Maguire, an analyst at
CLSA in New York, estimated in a November research note. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is being sued
by a trader who says he accepted a contract from the investment
bank because a typographical error made him believe he would be
paid 10 times what was actually offered. </p>
<p>Kai Herbert, a Switzerland-based currency trader, is suing
JPMorgan for about 580,000 pounds ($920,000), his lawyers said
at a trial in London this week. The original contract said
Herbert''s annual pay would be 24 million rand ($3.1 million).
JPMorgan blamed the mistake on a typographical error and said
the figure should have been 2.4 million rand, according to court
documents. </p>
<p>That must have been the moment your heart sank, Judge
Henry Globe said at the trial this week, referring to when
Herbert discovered the mistake. Herbert resigned from UBS AG (UBSN) in
June 2010 following the offer from JPMorgan to relocate to
Johannesburg. Herbert didn''t report for work after discovering
the discrepancy and JPMorgan rescinded the employment offer in
December 2010. </p>
<p>He has been unemployed since, other than eight months at
Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) where he was fired in a round of layoffs
in November. Banks globally have cut about 196,000 jobs since
the start of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>How can you possibly suggest that they would pay you so
much money for an executive director level job? Charles
Ciumei, a lawyer for JPMorgan, asked during Herbert''s cross-
examination. The bank said Herbert could have mitigated his lost
earnings by taking the position at the New York-based bank. </p>
<h2>Other Cases </h2>
<p>Banker salaries are the focus of several cases in London
courts. Commerzbank AG (CBK) is being sued by former bankers at
Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd. whose bonuses were cut by 90 percent
after being acquired by Commerzbank in 2009. </p>
<p>If it is too good to be true, then it probably is, but if
the trader signed the contract in good faith it is probably
binding, Adrian Crawford, an employment lawyer at Kingsley
Napley LLP in London who isn''t involved in the case, said in a
phone interview. It is all about the subjective view of the
trader and JPMorgan will have to prove he knew there was a
mistake in the contract but signed it anyway. </p>
<p>Kate Haywood, a spokeswoman at JPMorgan declined to
comment. Herbert''s lawyer, Dale Langley, declined to comment as
did JPMorgan lawyer Stefan Martin. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) cut its forecast for
euro-denominated covered bond sales this year by as much as 47
percent after the European Central Bank''s program of cheap loans
eased pressure on banks to raise cash from the secured debt. </p>
<p>Sales of the loan-backed securities may slump to as low as
100 billion euros ($132 billion) in 2012 from a November
estimate of 190 billion euros, analysts Leef Dierks and Jason Somerville in London wrote in an investor note today. French
banks, the biggest sellers of the notes this year, may cut
issuance by 33 percent to 30 billion euros. </p>
<p>The ECB provided euro-area banks with more than $1 trillion
of three-year loans in two so-called longer-term refinancing
operations aimed at averting a credit crunch. The program
bolstered investor confidence in the region''s banks and helped
spur a rally in credit markets. </p>
<p>Given the impact the ECB''s two 36-month LTROs have had on
capital markets, we have revised our forecast, the analysts
wrote. </p>
<p>Net supply of covered bonds, the difference between new
issues and securities that are redeemed, may shrink to about 13
billion euros from the previous estimate of 93.3 billion euros,
Morgan Stanley said. </p>

<p>After several drinks at a Greek
restaurant on Manhattan''s Third Avenue in the summer of 2006,
two computer programmers at Bernard Madoff''s investment firm
asked their supervisor whether the boss''s business was a scam,
Bloomberg News'' David Glovin and Bob Van Voris report. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Frank DiPascali laughed off the
question, telling George Perez and Jerome O''Hara that Madoff was
honest. DiPascali would later tell the FBI he wondered why they
took so long to ask. </p>
<p>His chronicle of the dinner, and the lengths to which
Madoff went to convince employees that his massive fraud was a
legitimate business, were revealed for the first time in FBI
reports made public last week. Attached to court filings by ex-
Madoff employees facing fraud charges, they contain interviews
with DiPascali -- Madoff''s chief aide -- who in 2009 pleaded
guilty to his role in the biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. </p>
<p>Once, when Perez and O''Hara confronted Madoff and asked why
there was no sign of stock trades, Madoff exploded, DiPascali
told the FBI. </p>
<p>You are not going to tell me how to run my business,
Madoff insisted during a meeting in the office of the firm''s
operations chief, Daniel Bonventre, according to DiPascali.
Trades occur overseas. </p>
<p>Madoff, 73, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and is serving
a 150-year term for cheating investors out of $20 billion in
principal. Five employees -- Perez, O''Hara, Bonventre, Annette
Bongiorno and Joann Crupi -- are accused of aiding Madoff in his
fraud. Defense attorneys said they''ll use DiPascali''s comments
to establish their clients were unaware of Madoff''s scheme. </p>
<p>Bonventre and Bongiorno began working for Madoff in 1968,
with Bongiorno rising to the level of supervisor and account
manager. Crupi, an employee since 1983, tracked daily bank
account activity, prosecutors said. Perez and O''Hara started at
the firm in the early 1990s. </p>
<p>The five were arrested in 2009 and 2010. In addition to
DiPascali, who began working for Madoff in 1975, former
employees David Kugel, Enrica Cotellessa-Pitz and Eric Lipkin
have pleaded guilty and are aiding prosecutors. </p>

<h2>Verdicts/Settlements </h2>
<h2>JPMorgan Loses $373 Million Arbitration to American Century </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was ordered by arbitrators to pay $373
million to American Century Investments over claims that
executives led by Jes Staley enriched the bank at the expense of
the fund-management firm. </p>
<p>The award, issued privately in August, focused on
JPMorgan''s promise to promote American Century products when the
bank acquired the firm''s retirement-plan services unit, or RPS,
in 2003. </p>
<p>Because Staley, then JPMorgan''s asset-management chief,
mistakenly thought there was a limit on the bank''s liability if
it didn''t meet obligations, executives failed to make good on
the deal, arbitrators found. Employees were instead rewarded for
pushing JPMorgan''s own products, according to the ruling. </p>
<p>In short, JPM and RPS stacked the cards against ACI,
the arbitrators wrote in the ruling. </p>
<p>The arbitrators awarded American Century $373 million plus
9 percent annual interest until paid in full. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, set aside funds
to cover the award during last year''s third quarter. Parties in
the case had agreed to resolve it privately through arbitration
and the ruling had been sealed. </p>
<p>Staley, 56, was promoted to lead JPMorgan''s investment bank
in 2009. </p>
<p>The case was brought to the American Arbitration
Association in 2009 and tried before a two-person panel in
February and March of last year. In their ruling, the panelists
said they reviewed about 600 exhibits and heard testimony from
almost 50 witnesses, including Staley. </p>
<p>Almost no one including the top executives of JPM and RPS
down the chain of command paid any attention to what the revenue
agreement said unless it applied to the bank''s own earnings,
the arbitrators wrote. </p>
<p>We disagree strongly with the arbitrator''s decision and
award, Kristen Chambers, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, said yesterday. Among other things, it misinterprets
the contract, ignores facts favorable to us such as the
performance of certain American Century funds during the period
in dispute, and ignores expert opinions that were favorable to
us. </p>
<p>Chris Doyle, a spokesman for Kansas City, Missouri-based
American Century, said the firm is very pleased with the
decision. </p>
<p>The case is American Century Investment Management Inc. v.
J.P. Morgan Invest Holdings LLC, 58 148 Y 00220 09, American
Arbitration Association (Kansas City). </p>
<h2>Milan Settles Derivatives With UBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Depfa
Bank Plc agreed to unwind interest-rate swaps with the city of
Milan''s government in a 455 million-euro ($600 million)
transaction. </p>
<p>Under the settlement, the banks, which are on trial for
fraud, closed the swaps yesterday at a positive mark-to-
market for the city, according to an e-mailed statement from the
Italian municipality. </p>
<p>The settlement isn''t for damages and doesn''t indicate any
acceptance of responsibility by the banks, according to the
statement. Milan agreed to drop claims for damages in the U.K.
and Italy, where the banks face criminal charges. Milan agreed
to forgo civil claims in return for a discount'' on the cost of
closing the swaps, it said. The criminal trial will continue.
Officials for the four banks declined to comment further. </p>
<p>The lenders charged 101 million euros in so-called hidden
fees for arranging the derivatives that adjusted payments on the
city''s 1.7 billion-euro bond offering in 2005 and from
subsequent restructurings, according to city prosecutor Alfredo
Robledo. The fees are fraudulent given that they weren''t
disclosed, he said as he secured charges against the banks in
March 2010. </p>
<p>It''s hard to tell the net position of the settlement
without the actual contracts, which typically remain private,
said Michael Dempster, founder of the University of Cambridge''s
Centre for Financial Research. </p>
<p>The funds from the settlement will be held by the four
banks as a guarantee on other derivative contracts that the city
and the banks will maintain, according to the statement. Two-
thirds of the settlement has been invested in Italian government
bonds, according to the city. </p>
<h2>Stanford''s Twitter Complaint Fails to Win Fraud Retrial </h2>
<p>R. Allen Stanford, found guilty of running a $7 billion
Ponzi scheme, lost a retrial bid in which his lawyers argued
that Twitter comments by courtroom news reporters may have
influenced the jury that convicted him. </p>
<p>The defendant''s motion for a new trial is denied, U.S.
District Judge David Hittner in Houston ruled yesterday without
elaboration in a single-sentence decision. </p>
<p>Stanford, 61, was found guilty on 13 of 14 criminal counts
after a six-week trial in which prosecutors convinced jurors
that he misled investors about what was being done with proceeds
of the certificates of deposit they bought from Stanford
International Bank Ltd. in Antigua. </p>
<p>Stanford is scheduled to be sentenced June 14. The four
wire-fraud charges and five mail-fraud charges he was convicted
of each carry a maximum punishment of 20 years in prison. </p>
<p>Defense lawyers, in a March 20 filing, said journalists''
real-time coverage of the trial on Twitter improperly influenced
the jurors, who had been warned to avoid other forms of media
coverage. </p>
<p>Laura Sweeney, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment on yesterday''s ruling. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). </p>

<h2>New Suits </h2>
<h2>Oracle Investor Sues Over $200 Million Whistle-Blower Accord </h2>
<p>Oracle Corp. (ORCL) directors, including Chief Executive Officer
Larry Ellison, were sued by an investor for failing to mitigate
damages when the company agreed to a $200 million whistle-blower
settlement with the U.S. government. </p>
<p>Directors violated their fiduciary duties by forcing the
government into extensive litigation even though they knew the
allegations were grounded in fact, shareholder Jordan R.
Weinrib said in a complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery
Court (1400L) in Wilmington. </p>
<p>Rather than attempt to settle all claims at that time by
the institution of appropriate corporate therapeutics and the
paying of what would have been a small fine, the board insisted
on digging in and litigating the matter extensively, Weinrib
said in the complaint. </p>
<p>The settlement, announced in October, resolved a lawsuit
claiming Oracle induced the General Services Administration to
buy $1.08 billion in software from 1998 to 2006 by falsely
promising the same discounts offered to favored commercial
customers. The payout was the largest ever obtained by the GSA
under the False Claims Act, which lets citizens sue on behalf of
the government and share in any recovery. </p>
<p>Former Oracle employee Paul Frascella filed the case in
2007. The Justice Department pursued the case after joining the
whistle-blower lawsuit. </p>
<p>Weinrib is seeking unspecified damages on behalf of the
company. Deborah Hellinger, an Oracle spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the lawsuit. </p>

Court (Wilmington). </p>

<h2>Siemens Sued Over Cancellation of Alarm Funding IPO </h2>
<p>Siemens First Capital Commercial Finance LLC was sued in
New York state court for breach of contract over the
cancellation of an initial public offering for a security-alarm
service business. </p>
<p>The suit, filed March 21 in New York state Supreme Court in
Manhattan, accuses Siemens First Capital of intentionally
destroying three related companies that were planning an
initial public offering. </p>
<p>Siemens told Whitecap (US) Fund I LP, the majority owner of
Alarm Funding LLC, the parent of the three companies, in March
2011 that the companies had defaulted on an $85 million loan
because the public offering hadn''t been completed by March 1,
according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The companies had never missed a payment on the loan and
had repaid $47 million, the complaint shows. Whitecap and two
related entities filed the suit, which seeks damages of more
than $20 million, on behalf of the companies. </p>
<p>Siemens was not content with what it was entitled to
under the contract, i.e. repayment in full over time,
according to the lawsuit. Instead, Siemens wished to extract
as much money as possible from the alarm funding companies as
quickly as it could. </p>
<p>The case is Whitecap (US) Fund I LP v. Siemens First
Capital Commercial Finance LLC, 650888/2012, New York state
Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Lawsuits/Pretrial </h2>
<h2>CVS Ordered to Stop Controlled Drug Sales at Two Pharmacies </h2>
<p>CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) must stop filling prescriptions for
controlled substances at two of its pharmacies in Sanford,
Florida, while an appeals court weighs a U.S. order barring the
sales. </p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington yesterday rejected
a request by CVS to put the order by the Drug Enforcement
Administration on hold. A lower court judge on March 13 upheld
the DEA suspension, which resulted from an investigation into
oxycodone sales by the pharmacies. </p>
<p>Appellant has not satisfied the stringent requirements
for a stay pending appeal, the three-judge panel ruled. </p>
<p>A different three-judge panel on March 16 turned down a
similar bid by Cardinal Health Inc. (CAH), the second-largest U.S.
drug distributor by revenue, to forestall the suspension of its
Lakeland, Florida, facility from distributing controlled
substances. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said the DEA produced
enough information to show that pharmacists at the CVS stores
filled prescriptions for the painkiller oxycodone that they knew
or should have known would lead to the drug being diverted for
illegal uses. </p>
<p>Carolyn Castel, a CVS spokeswoman, didn''t immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>The cases are Cardinal Health v. U.S. Department of
Justice, 12-05061, and Holiday CVS LLC v. Holder, 12-05072, U.S.

<h2>ATT Accused of Improperly Billing U.S. Program for Deaf </h2>
<p>A unit of ATT Inc. (T) is accused of improperly billing the
U.S. for millions of dollars in reimbursements of text-based
communications under a federal program for the hearing-impaired. </p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department intervened March 22 in a
whistle-blower lawsuit in federal court in Pittsburgh that
alleged the phone company violated the False Claims Act. ATT
failed to ensure that users of the Federal Communications
Commission program were eligible, the U.S. alleges. </p>
<p>Federal funding for Telecommunications Relay Services is
intended to help the hearing- and speech-impaired in the United
States, Stuart Delery, acting assistant attorney general for
the Justice Department''s civil division, said yesterday in a
statement. We will pursue those who seek to gain by knowingly
allowing others to abuse this program. </p>
<p>According to the complaint, ATT allowed thousands of calls
to be made on the system by users in Nigeria and other countries
seeking to defraud U.S. merchants. </p>
<p>Marty Richter, a spokesman for Dallas-based ATT, said in a
statement that the company followed the FCC''s rules for
providing Internet Protocol Relay services and for seeking
reimbursement for those services. </p>
<p>As the FCC is aware, it is always possible for an
individual to misuse IP Relay services, just as someone can
misuse the postal system or an e-mail account, but FCC rules
require that we complete all calls by customers who identify
themselves as disabled, Richter said. </p>

<h2>Ernst  Young Suit Over Lehman Fees Sent to N.Y. State Court </h2>
<p>A lawsuit accusing Ernst  Young LLP of facilitating a
major accounting fraud by helping Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ) deceive the public about its financial condition was sent
back to New York state court. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan yesterday
said the lawsuit, filed in state supreme court in December 2010
by then-New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and later moved
to federal court, should be tried in state court. Cuomo''s
successor, Eric Schneiderman, has continued to pursue the case. </p>
<p>Kaplan said he reviewed the matter even after the state
dropped its objection to having the case tried in federal court
and now concludes that the removal was improper because the
case does not come within federal jurisdiction. The claims in
the complaint are predominantly based on state and not federal
law, he said. </p>
<p>We are disappointed by the court''s ruling, and we are
reviewing it, Charlie Perkins, an Ernst  Young spokesman,
said in an e-mail. We will continue to vigorously defend
ourselves in this matter. </p>

<h2>Trials/Appeals </h2>
<h2>Morgan Stanley Pay Suit Dismissal Upheld by Appeals Court </h2>
<p>The dismissal of a Morgan Stanley (MS) shareholder lawsuit
brought in 2010 over $45 billion paid to the firm''s employees in
three years was upheld by a New York appeals court. </p>
<p>Shareholders including the Security Police and Fire
Professionals of America Retirement Fund sued Morgan Stanley,
former chairman John Mack and other executives in February 2010,
accusing the company of making improper compensation and bonus
payments. </p>
<p>New York State Supreme Court Justice Shirley Werner
Kornreich threw out the suit in December 2010, citing a
requirement that shareholders first make a demand on a board
before suing on behalf of a company or show that such a move
would be futile. </p>
<p>An appeals court in Manhattan upheld the dismissal
yesterday, saying the complaint lacks specific allegations
needed to determine whether work done by company employees was
of such limited value to the corporation that no reasonable
person in the directors'' position'''' would have approved their
pay. </p>
<p>The complaint does not adequately plead waste, Justice
Peter Tom, of the state Appellate Division First Department,
wrote. It lacks the specific allegations of unconscionable
transactions and details regarding who was paid and for what
reasons they were paid.'' </p>

<h2>Madoff Trustee Appeals $59 Billion Ruling in UniCredit Suit </h2>
<p>The liquidator of Bernard Madoff''s firm appealed a court
ruling that tossed most of his $59 billion in claims against
UniCredit SpA (UCG), Sonja Kohn and other defendants, following
earlier appeals seeking to recover about $30 billion in damages
from banks. </p>
<p>Madoff trustee Irving Picard''s notice of appeal and
document record were transmitted yesterday to U.S. District
Court in Manhattan by a U.S. appeals court, according to
filings. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff on Feb. 21 dismissed
Picard''s claims under the racketeering statute, which allows for
triple damages, saying he hadn''t proved his allegations. </p>
<p>Picard now has $90 billion in claims before the appeals
court, out of about $100 billion he had demanded in more than
1,000 suits to gather money for customers with Madoff Ponzi
scheme losses. Rakoff and another district judge, Colleen
McMahon, dismissed the $90 billion in claims in Picard''s suits
against banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co., HSBC Holdings Plc,
UBS AG (UBSN) and UniCredit. </p>
<p>In his written opinion on the UniCredit racketeering case,
Rakoff said Picard made a casual assertion that the
defendants fed, perpetuated and profited from Madoff''s Ponzi
scheme, and failed to show a direct relationship between the
alleged criminal acts and resulting injuries to the con man''s
customers. </p>
<p>Rakoff also dismissed common-law claims including unjust
enrichment and conversion. He directed that the remaining claims
be returned to bankruptcy court. </p>
<p>Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year sentence in a federal
prison in North Carolina for running a Ponzi scheme that
defrauded investors of an estimated $20 billion in principal.
Picard and his law firm, Baker  Hostetler LLP, have charged
about $273 million for their work on the Madoff estate so far. </p>

<h2>Baum Foreclosure Firm Settles With New York for $4 Million </h2>
<p>Steven J. Baum PC, the largest foreclosure law firm in New
York until it shut down last year, reached a $4 million
settlement with the state over abuses in its legal work. </p>
<p>Part of the money paid by the firm, Pillar Processing LLC,
Steven Baum himself and managing partner Brian Kumiega will be
used to help homeowners facing foreclosure or victims of
predatory lending, New York State Attorney General Eric
Schneiderman said yesterday in a statement. Baum formed Pillar
in 2007 to process foreclosure documents. </p>
<p>The Baum firm cut corners in order to maximize the number
of its foreclosure filings and its profits, Schneiderman said
in the statement. Baum and Kumiega have also agreed not to
represent lenders or servicers in new foreclosure cases for two
years, Schneiderman said. </p>
<p>The firm said in a statement that it didn''t admit
wrongdoing as part of the settlement. </p>
<p>In October, the firm, based in Amherst, New York, just
north of Buffalo, reached a $2 million agreement related to its
foreclosure practices with Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara. After that settlement was announced, Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, the mortgage-finance companies under U.S.
conservatorship, dropped Baum from their lists of law firms
eligible to handle foreclosures. The firm then said it would
close. </p>
<p>After an exhaustive 10-month investigation, the attorney
general''s office did not identify a single instance where a
foreclosure proceeding was brought by the Baum firm where the
homeowner wasn''t actually in default, Elkan Abramowitz, a
lawyer for the settling parties, said in a phone interview. </p>

<h2>Court News </h2>
<h2>Christie Nominee for Supreme Court Turned Down by Senate Panel </h2>
<p>One of Chris Christie''s nominees to the New Jersey (STONJ1) Supreme
Court became the first in modern times to be rejected by state
lawmakers following a Democrat-controlled confirmation hearing
the Republican governor called a partisan circus. </p>
<p>Phillip Kwon''s nomination to one of two court vacancies was
rebuffed in a 7-6 vote, largely along party lines, after
Democrats questioned a $160,000 settlement of U.S. government
allegations that family members sought to avoid financial
reporting requirements tied to their business. </p>
<p>Democrats, who control the Legislature, have vowed to fight
harder against the governor, who they say has bullied them to
get his way. Midway through his first term, the two sides are at
odds over tax-cut plans. A court on March 8 overruled Christie''s
abolition of a housing agency, and 27 groups filed a legal
appeal yesterday of his policy to waive environmental
regulations in some cases. </p>
<p>To see what Phil went through today is frankly not only a
disappointment for me personally but also a disappointment for
the state, the process and the judicial system, Christie said
following the vote. They didn''t act like officeholders or
statesmen. They acted like politicians, and that''s what the
people hate. </p>
<p>Christie told reporters he didn''t have a backup for Kwon,
who would have been the court''s first Asian-American justice.
The governor said he didn''t anticipate changing his criteria for
judicial candidates. </p>
<p>Kwon''s rejection was the first time a nominee for the high
court was turned down by the Senate Judiciary Committee since
the modern Constitution of 1947, according to Winnie Comfort, a
spokeswoman for the New Jersey courts. </p>
<p>Most of the hearing centered on the Justice Department
settlement with Kwon''s mother and wife, who own a liquor store
in Mount Vernon, New York. </p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors filed complaints related to two bank
accounts in June 2011 and seized $290,236, asserting the
business illegally structured 222 cash deposits to avoid
breaching a $10,000 threshold that triggers currency transaction
filing requirements. </p>
<p>The business, KCP Wines  Liquor Corp., settled with the
U.S. Attorney''s Office in Brooklyn, New York, forfeiting
$159,630 without admitting wrongdoing. </p>
<p>In the hearing, Kwon said he advised his mother that
structuring the deposits might raise red flags with the
banks involved. He said his subsequent involvement was confined
to helping her obtain a lawyer. </p>
<p>My mother was not evading taxes, Kwon said. She made
a mistake. </p>
<p>Democrats on the committee said Kwon should have advised
his mother of the reporting requirements and told her to make
larger deposits. Christie has defended his choice of Kwon,
saying in January that the lawsuit didn''t involve him in the

<p>A liquefied natural gas tanker
hired by Morgan Stanley, the bank that ships the most
commodities, is hauling a cargo about 14,500 miles from the U.S.
to Japan, where the fuel fetches almost seven times more. </p>
<p>The Arctic Spirit, owned by Teekay LNG Partners LP (TGP) and on a
long-term charter to Morgan Stanley, left Sabine Pass, Texas, on
Feb. 23, ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
ship, sailing to Sodegaura in Tokyo Bay, can carry about 37,000
metric tons, or 16 percent of Japan''s daily imports. The trade
would earn about $16.2 million after transportation costs,
estimates Arctic Securities ASA, an Oslo-based investment bank. </p>
<p>Japan''s gas-fired power plants are boosting output to
compensate for nuclear reactors shuttered since last year''s
earthquake, driving Asia-bound cargoes to a record. The U.S. has
surplus natural gas extracted from shale rocks deep underground,
and while it lacks a facility to liquefy that fuel for shipping,
cargoes delivered to the country under longstanding contracts
can be re-exported when overseas prices are higher. </p>
<p>There''s a huge arbitrage, Arctic analyst Erik Nikolai Stavseth said by phone yesterday. When someone is willing to
pay that much to move gas from A to B, it tells you demand is
very strong. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) has chartered the Arctic Spirit since April
2011, said Mark Kremin, vice president of Teekay Gas Services,
adding that further details are private. Ship operators
sometimes re-charter vessels, meaning another trader may own the
cargo. Hugh Fraser, a Morgan Stanley spokesman in London,
declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Re-Export Cargo </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley booked at least 149 vessels to haul
commodities ranging from oil to coal last year, exceeding the
combined charters of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays
Capital, data from shipbroker Clarkson Plc (CKN) show. Morgan Stanley
hired a tanker last month to ship 60,000 tons of jet fuel to
Alaska from South Korea, according to shipbroker reports. </p>
<p>One million British thermal units of LNG costs $17 in Japan
and $2.62 on the U.S. Gulf Coast, according to February data
from New York-based shipbroker Poten  Partners Inc. Large,
modern LNG carriers will earn a record $147,000 a day on average
this year, according to the median estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Record Diversions </h2>
<p>A record 18 million tons of LNG were diverted to Asia from
the Atlantic region in 2011, a fourfold surge in five years,
Steve Hill, president of LNG trading at BG Group Plc (BG/), said at a
conference in New Delhi today. Current monthly diversions are
also at a record, he said. LNG is natural gas that''s been cooled
to a liquid state for shipping. </p>
<p>Japanese LNG imports rose 22.5 percent from a year earlier
to 7.67 million tons in February, the finance ministry said
yesterday. The world''s largest buyer of the fuel imported a
record 8.44 million tons in January, trade ministry data show.
The country''s nuclear plants were operating at 6.1 percent of
capacity last month, the lowest level since the Federation of
Electric Power Companies of Japan started compiling monthly data
in April 1977. </p>
<p>Natural gas futures traded in New York fell 24 percent this
year to $2.279 per million Btu, near the 10-year closing low of
$2.269 reached March 12. U.S. production rose 6.5 percent last
year to a record 28.58 trillion cubic feet, outpacing
consumption that advanced 2.5 percent to 24.37 trillion cubic
feet, according to the Department of Energy. The U.S. shipped 18
billion cubic feet of LNG to Japan last year, data show. </p>

<p>We''re pleased to be at the forefront in acquiring loan
portfolios from NAMA and we look forward to generating value for

<p>Morgan Stanley, based in New York, acquired the loans for
about 65 million pounds ($103 million), or a 70 percent
discount, Property Week reported in November. The trade magazine
said that West Properties, the company run by Donal Mulryan,
will continue to manage the real estate for Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>The Saturn portfolio consists of about 220 million pounds
of loans to West Properties. The debt was acquired by NAMA,
which was established to purge Ireland''s banks of 74.2 billion
euros ($98.3 billion) of troubled commercial real-estate loans. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley spokesman Hugh Fraser declined to comment
and Mulryan wasn''t immediately available. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. credit
traders Matthew Knopman and Philip Ha are leaving for hedge
funds after the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets cut jobs and
pay last year. </p>
<p>Knopman will start at Anchorage Capital Group LLC on May 1,
according to three people familiar with the move, who declined
to be identified because it hasn''t been announced. Ha will join
MKP Capital Management LLC in New York, another person said.
Knopman and Ha are among at least four credit traders who have
left the New York-based bank for hedge funds since November. Rob Jackson joined Cyrus Capital Partners LP in February, two people
said, and Tim Reilly departed last month, one person said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs cut compensation 21 percent last year as
revenue slid 26 percent, led by a 34 percent drop in revenue
from trading fixed-income, currencies and commodities, the
company reported in January. About 50 Goldman Sachs (GS) partners,
the most senior rank, left the company in the 12 months through
January. </p>
<p>Bonuses for fixed-income traders across Wall Street were
cut by an average of 35 percent to 45 percent, according to Alan Johnson, president and founder of compensation consulting

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) doesn''t have
to pay a trader 580,000 pounds ($921,000) after a missing
decimal point in an employment contract led him to believe his
salary would be 10 times what was offered, a London court ruled. </p>
<p>Kai Herbert, a Switzerland-based currency trader, sued
JPMorgan for lost earnings claiming he signed a contract to
relocate to Johannesburg for a salary of 24 million rand ($3.1
million). JPMorgan said there was a typographical error and the
figure should have been 2.4 million rand. </p>
<p>Herbert took the commercial risk of accepting the offer,
knowing full well that the figure was an error, Judge Henry
Globe said in today''s judgment. </p>
<p>The trader resigned from UBS AG (UBSN) in June 2010 following the
offer from New York-based JPMorgan to relocate to South Africa.
Herbert didn''t report for work after discovering the discrepancy
and JPMorgan rescinded the employment offer in December 2010. </p>
<p>Herbert has been unemployed since, other than eight months
at Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), where he was fired in a round of job
cuts in November. Banks globally have cut about 196,000 jobs
since the start of 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Eyes Wide Open'' </h2>
<p>Herbert, with his eyes wide open, took a chance and it
has not worked out for him, Charles Ciumei, a lawyer for
JPMorgan, said in court. </p>
<p>Herbert originally sought more than 2 million pounds, Globe
said. That figure subsequently fell to just over 1 million
pounds and finally to 580,000 pounds. </p>
<p>There has been gross exaggeration in relation to the
claim, Globe said and ordered that Herbert pay costs of 85,000
pounds within 28 days. Herbert wasn''t present for the verdict. </p>
<p>Kate Haywood, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to
comment. Dale Langley, Herbert''s lawyer, wasn''t immediately
available to comment. </p>

<p>Jon S. Corzine, MF Global Holding
Ltd.''s former chief executive officer, may face potential legal
liability if investigators show he knew customer money might be
used when he ordered $200 million transferred to a U.K. account
as his brokerage neared collapse, Bloomberg News'' Linda Sandler
and Phil Mattingly report that former prosecutors said. </p>
<p>The ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. co-chairman gave direct
instructions to move money from a U.S. account to meet an
overdraft with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) just days before MF Global''s
bankruptcy, according to a memo by congressional investigators.
Such accounts may have contained assets belonging to both
customers and MF Global. </p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice and federal regulators are
investigating the firm''s Oct. 31 collapse. Corzine, a Democrat
from New Jersey who served in the U.S. Senate and as governor,
told Congress last year he never directed customer funds be used
improperly. Though showing he deliberately used customer money
would be the key to a criminal case, former prosecutors said
Corzine, who hasn''t been charged with any wrongdoing, could be
deemed liable in civil cases for misuse of customer money simply
for ordering the hole in JPMorgan''s account plugged, if it turns
out customer funds were used. </p>
<p>It''s not whether he specified, John Moscow, a former
chief prosecutor in the office of Manhattan District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau, said yesterday in an interview. The
economics of the situation were he was out of money. The bottom
line is, he was taking a risk with somebody else''s money. </p>
<p>In a casino, said Moscow, now with Baker Hostetler LLP in
New York, if I put your money on the table, I''ve committed
larceny as soon as I expose it to risk. </p>
<p>Andrew Levander, a lawyer for Corzine, didn''t return a call
or e-mail after normal business hours seeking comment on the
probe. A congressional hearing on the issue is set for this
week. </p>
<p>MF Global and its brokerage sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in New York after a $6.3 billion bet on the bonds of
some of Europe''s most indebted nations prompted regulator
concerns and a credit-rating downgrade. Corzine, 65, quit MF
Global Nov. 4. The bankruptcy trustee overseeing the liquidation
of the company''s brokerage subsidiary has estimated a $1.6
billion shortfall between customer claims and assets available. </p>
<p>Edith O''Brien, a treasurer for New York-based MF Global,
said in an e-mail quoted in the Congressional memo that the $200
million transfer was Per JC''s direct instructions, according
to a copy of the memo obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>The e-mail, dated Oct. 28, was sent three days before the
company collapsed, according to the document. The account may
have contained both client and company funds, the memo states. </p>

<h2>Lawsuits/Pre-Trial </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s Fabulous Fab'' in Rwanda While Awaiting Trial </p>
<p>Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive
director who called himself fabulous Fab, has done volunteer
work in Rwanda and started a U.S. doctorate program while
awaiting trial in a government fraud suit his bank settled for
$550 million. </p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a 2010
complaint that Goldman Sachs and Tourre, 33, who is on unpaid
leave, defrauded investors in a collateralized debt obligation
known as Abacus 2007-AC1. </p>
<p>The regulator identified Tourre as a resident of Kigali,
Rwanda, in court papers filed March 21 in Manhattan federal
court. Tourre had been in the African nation''s capital working
for a non-governmental organization before beginning his studies
at the University of Chicago, according to a person familiar
with his travels who declined to be identified because the
matter isn''t public. </p>
<p>Tourre is a U.S. resident studying for a Ph.D. in
economics at the University of Chicago, his lawyer, Pamela
Rogers Chepiga, said in a statement March 21. Steve Koppes, a
university spokesman, said Tourre has been enrolled in the
program since September. </p>
<p>The SEC alleged the Goldman Sachs executive director didn''t
disclose that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
securities underlying the Abacus CDO with the intention of
betting against them. </p>
<p>New York-based Goldman Sachs agreed in July 2010 to pay
$550 million, the largest penalty ever assessed by the agency
against a Wall Street firm, to settle allegations against it. </p>
<p>Tourre remains a defendant in the case. U.S. District Judge
Barbara Jones in Manhattan last year narrowed some of the claims
against him while allowing the case to go forward. </p>
<p>The reference to Kigali came in papers filed by the SEC
seeking to question Jorg Zimmerman, a former employee of IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB) in Germany. The SEC claimed Tourre
spoke with Zimmerman to encourage his bank to invest in the
securities. Tourre has denied any wrongdoing. </p>

Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Wells Fargo Should Be Forced to Comply With Subpoenas, SEC Says </h2>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. failed to hand over documents demanded in
U.S. subpoenas and should be forced to cooperate with a probe
into its sale of almost $60 billion in residential mortgage-
backed securities, regulators said. </p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal
judge to compel the bank, the largest U.S. home lender, to
deliver documents it agreed to produce under subpoenas dating
from September, the agency said March 23 in a statement. The SEC
said it''s looking into possible fraud by the San Francisco-based
company and hasn''t concluded that anyone broke the law. </p>
<p>Almost four years after mounting mortgage defaults prompted
unprecedented government bailouts of the financial system,
regulators are still examining how banks packaged and sold home
loans to investors. The SEC is looking for evidence that firms
failed to disclose underlying credit weaknesses in mortgage
pools and delinquencies, and has also told Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. that they may face civil claims. </p>
<p>The agency''s request, if granted, would give Wells Fargo 14
days to hand over 1,365 e-mails and attachments it has withheld
from the SEC, according to a court filing. The bank said in a
statement that enforcement action is unwarranted and that it
will defend itself in court. </p>
<p>The watchdog is examining whether Wells Fargo
misrepresented or omitted facts in offerings from September 2006
to early 2008, according to the statement. While the bank
reviewed a sampling of loans and excluded those that failed to
meet its standards, Wells Fargo may not have taken steps to
address flaws in the remainder of the pool, the agency said. </p>
<p>Investigators are seeking information on the bank''s
underwriting guidelines and on due diligence, according to the
statement. The agency filed its request in federal court in San
Francisco. Marc Fagel, the head of the SEC''s office in that
city, declined to comment on the request. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo believes the subpoena enforcement action is
inappropriate and unwarranted and will vigorously defend itself
in court, Mary Eshet, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in an e-
mailed statement. The bank has cooperated with the agency and
believed it had an understanding on the requested documents,
which was violated by the March 23 filing, she said. </p>

Fargo  Co., 12-80087, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco). </p>

<h2>CBOE, McGraw Hill Ask Court to Enforce ISE Option Trade Ban </h2>
<p>CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) and McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP) asked an Illinois
court to enforce a 2010 order barring International Securities
Exchange LLC from providing a forum for trading of SP 500-based
options. </p>
<p>Judge William O. Maki in Chicago barred ISE from featuring
the listings in July 2010, ruling that the CBOE-owned Chicago
Board Options Exchange holds an exclusive license to offer
options based on the SP 500. The index is a licensed product of
McGraw-Hill''s Standard  Poor''s Financial Services LLC. </p>
<p>ISE on March 13 announced plans to list options for the Max
SPY index, which it called a new proprietary index that
represents 10 times the value of the exchange-traded fund
based on the SP 500. </p>
<p>ISE''s options actually are structured to be options on
the SP 500, McGraw-Hill and CBOE said in a statement March 23
announcing the court filing. CBOE and SP brought this action
in order prevent this violation of both CBOE''s license rights in
SP 500 index options and SP''s proprietary rights. </p>
<p>In their court papers, CBOE and McGraw-Hill said they want
the court to issue an order barring ISE from violating the
previous injunction or declare that it would violate that
injunction for ISE to list or provide an exchange market for the
trading of the options or cause the Options Clearing Corporation
to settle them. </p>
<p>Molly McGregor, a spokeswoman for New York-based ISE, said
the company doesn''t comment on pending litigation. </p>
<p>The injunction request was assigned to Cook County Judge
Franklin Valderrama. Lawyers for the CBOE and McGraw-Hill on
April 5 will ask for the matter to be transferred back to Maki,
according to court papers they provided to Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>The case is Chicago Board Options Exchange Inc. v.
International Securities Exchange LLC, 06CH24798, Cook County,
Illinois, Circuit Court, Chancery Division (Chicago). </p>
<h2>Depfa, Pisa Swaps Feud Needs Trial in Italy and U.K., Judge Says </h2>
<p>A London judge ruled that a dispute between Depfa Bank PLC, (DEP)
Dexia SA and the Italian province of Pisa over a swaps deal
needs separate trials in Italy and the U.K. </p>
<p>While the banks had asked the judge to refer the case to a
European Court for a final ruling on jurisdiction, Judge Nigel
Teare refused the request, saying proceedings in the two
countries were different. </p>
<p>The case is one of several being fought over derivatives
used to hedge interest rates sold to European regional
governments by investment banks that turned out to be far more
costly than predicted. </p>
<p>Dexia and Depfa filed a lawsuit in London in 2009 seeking a
ruling that the swaps are valid. Pisa wants an Italian court to
approve its decision to annul them, according to Teare''s
judgment. </p>
<p>The proceedings are different and the administrative
matters must be heard in Italy, Pisa lawyer Germana Lo Iacono-
Smith said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Benoit Gausseron at Dexia in Paris didn''t immediately
respond to a phone call requesting comment. A call to the press
room of Hypo Real Estate Holding AG, Depfa''s parent company,
wasn''t answered. </p>
<h2>Ex-NBA Player Tate George Indicted in $2 Million Ponzi Scam </h2>
<p>Tate George, a former player for the National Basketball
Association''s New Jersey Nets and Milwaukee Bucks, was indicted
on charges of running a $2 million Ponzi scheme that targeted
ex-professional athletes. </p>
<p>George, 43, raised more than $2 million for his company,
the George Group, after telling investors his real-estate
development portfolio was worth $500 million, according to a
four-count wire-fraud indictment in federal court in Newark, New
Jersey. </p>
<p>George, a Newark resident, told prospective investors that
their money would fund the George Group''s development of real
estate projects in New Jersey and Connecticut, prosecutors
charged. </p>
<p>Instead of using investments to fund real estate
development projects as promised, George used the money from new
investors to pay existing investors in Ponzi scheme fashion,
U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement. </p>
<p>George faces as many as 20 years in prison on each count.
His attorney, Thomas Ashley, didn''t immediately return a call
seeking comment on the indictment. </p>
<p>George was arrested last September on a Federal Bureau of
Investigation complaint charging him with one count of wire
fraud. He was released on $250,000 bail. </p>
<p>After his arrest, Ashley said: He maintains his innocence
and will plead not guilty. All these charges are clearly
defensible. </p>

<h2>New Suits </h2>
<h2>Deloitte  Touche Sued in New York Over WG Trading Fraud </h2>
<p>Deloitte  Touche LLP, one of the so-called Big Four
accounting firms, was sued by a pension fund over WG Trading
Co., the company allegedly used in a Ponzi scheme by former
managers Paul Greenwood and Steven Walsh. </p>
<p>The Iowa Public Employees'' Retirement System suffered
millions of dollars in losses as a result of the scheme,
according to the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in
New York March 22. </p>
<p>Deloitte  Touche served as the auditor of a company
controlled by the operators of the scheme and aided and
abetted it by issuing unqualified and/or clean'' audit
reports that the pension fund relied on while purchasing
securities that were issued as part of the scheme, according to
the complaint. </p>
<p>Deloitte acted in willful blindness of the scheme, and
its auditing practices were so deficient that the audits
amounted to no audit at all, or an egregious refusal to see the
obvious, or investigate the doubtful, and the professional
judgments which it made were such that no reasonable auditor
would have made the same decisions if confronted with the same
facts, lawyers for the pension fund said in the complaint. </p>
<p>The claims are ill conceived and without merit,
Jonathan Gandal, a spokesman for Deloitte LLP, said in an e-
mail. Deloitte  Touche, based in New York, is a subsidiary of
Deloitte LLP, the U.S. arm of U.K.-based Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu Ltd., according to its website. </p>
<p>Deloitte  Touche LLP did not audit the financial
statements of the Westridge entities at which the fraud
allegedly occurred, Gandal said. Rather, Deloitte audited
the financial statements of a separate entity, WG Trading
Company Limited Partnership, through 2007, and there is no
information which calls into question either the correctness of
those financial statements or Deloitte''s full compliance with
professional standards. </p>
<p>Any wrongdoing is solely attributable to the principals
of the Westridge entities, one of whom has already pleaded
guilty to related charges, Gandal said. </p>
<p>Greenwood and Walsh were indicted in July 2009 on charges
that they conspired to defraud investors of $554 million. The
U.S. said the scheme stretched from 1996 until the men were
arrested in February 2009. Greenwood pleaded guilty to six
charges, including conspiracy and securities fraud. Walsh has
pleaded not guilty. </p>
<p>The case is Iowa Public Employees'' Retirement System v.
Deloitte  Touche LLP, 12-cv-2136, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Shell Sued in U.K. Over Massive'' Oil Spills in Nigeria in 2008 </p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), Europe''s largest oil company, was

and forests were spoiled by two massive spills in the Niger
River delta in 2008. </p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in London March 23 after talks
between Shell and residents of the coastal Bodo community failed
to produce a deal, the group''s law firm Leigh Day  Co. said in
a statement. While Shell admits liability for the leaks, it
claims local people spilled most of the oil. </p>
<p>We had thought that the invitation to sit around the
table meant that Shell was taking the impact of the two oil
spills seriously, the lawyer for the Nigerians, Martyn Day,
said in the statement. We are now left with the only option of
taking the claims through the U.K. courts to obtain justice. </p>
<p>The lawsuit, which says 500,000 barrels of oil leaked,
comes two months after Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said
he would seek compensation from Shell, based in The Hague, for
another incident in which nearly 40,000 barrels spilled at the
Bonga field in the country''s worst offshore spill in more than a
decade. </p>
<p>Before and after the two leaks, there were a number of
other spills as the result of illegal theft of oil and sabotage
that resulted in significantly higher amounts of oil being
spilled, Jonathan French, a Shell spokesman in London, said
March 23 in a phone interview. Local people have the misguided
belief that more oil spilled equals more compensation. </p>

<h2>Wells Fargo Sues Medical Development Over $30 Million Loan </h2>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
sued prison-service provider Medical Development International
Ltd. in Delaware Chancery Court seeking to recover $30 million
in loans. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo contends Medical Development of Ponte Vedra,
Florida, has been in default of the loans for quite some
time, and asks a judge to appoint a receiver. </p>
<p>The company and affiliates have also engaged in a series
of self-dealing transactions including, among other things, so-

biographical screenplay and payments for a Tesla Roadster,
lawyers for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said in court papers
filed March 23 in Wilmington. </p>
<p>Medical Development, with $55.3 million in assets and $74.9
million in liabilities as of Dec. 31, is headed by Chief
Executive Officer Richard Willich and provides medical
contracting, management and administration for federal prisons,
according to the complaint. </p>

<h2>Trials/Appeals </h2>
<h2>JPMorgan Sued by Currency Trader Over $3 Million Decimal Point </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. is being sued by a trader who says he
accepted a contract from the investment bank because a
typographical error made him believe he would be paid 10 times
what was actually offered. </p>
<p>Kai Herbert, a Switzerland-based currency trader, is suing
JPMorgan for about 580,000 pounds ($920,000), his lawyers said
at a trial in London this week. The original contract said
Herbert''s annual pay would be 24 million rand ($3.1 million).
JPMorgan blamed the mistake on a typographical error and said
the figure should have been 2.4 million rand, according to court
documents. </p>
<p>That must have been the moment your heart sank, Judge
Henry Globe said at the trial this week, referring to when
Herbert discovered the mistake. Herbert resigned from UBS AG (UBSN) in
June 2010 following the offer from JPMorgan to relocate to
Johannesburg. Herbert didn''t report for work after discovering
the discrepancy and JPMorgan rescinded the employment offer in
December 2010. </p>
<p>He has been unemployed since, other than eight months at
Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) where he was fired in a round of layoffs
in November. Banks globally have cut about 196,000 jobs since
the start of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>How can you possibly suggest that they would pay you so
much money for an executive director level job? Charles
Ciumei, a lawyer for JPMorgan, asked during Herbert''s cross-
examination. The bank said Herbert could have mitigated his lost
earnings by taking the position at the New York-based bank. </p>
<p>Kate Haywood, a spokeswoman at JPMorgan declined to
comment. Herbert''s lawyer, Dale Langley, declined to comment as
did JPMorgan lawyer Stefan Martin. </p>

<p>SP''s Model Was Garbage In, Garbage Out,'' Australia Lawyer Says </p>
<p>Standard  Poor''s ignored warnings that notes sold to
Australian towns didn''t deserve a AAA rating and used faulty
data to support its decision, a lawyer said. </p>
<p>It was a simple case of GiGo - garbage in, garbage out,
said Noel Hudley, lawyer for a dozen Australian towns seeking to
recoup investments that were wiped out when the notes'' value
collapsed during the 2008 global financial crisis. </p>
<p>The towns claim they lost A$15 million ($15.6 million) of
A$16 million invested in the Community Income Constant
Proportion Debt Obligation Notes. They were unwound less than
two years after the towns bought them as credit spreads
increased and their cash value was exhausted, and the towns
accused SP of giving the notes the highest rating on pressure
from a bank. </p>
<p>An SP committee determining the rating on the notes had 31
results from tests run by analysts, with 68 percent of those
findings not supporting a AAA rating, Hudley said March 23, on
the first day of closing statements before Justice Jayne Jagot
in Federal Court in Sydney. </p>
<p>The ratings company didn''t follow procedures that are a
standard in the industry in developing the rating, Hudley said,
citing evidence given by experts during the trial. </p>
<p>You are the wuss for bending over in front of bankers and
taking it, Sebastian Venus, who had prepared an internal model
for the notes at SP, wrote to Derek Ding, an analyst
responsible for rating the note, according to e-mail transcripts
presented in court documents. You rate something AAA, when
it''s really A-? </p>
<p>The plaintiffs cited selectively from the hundreds of
documents that were submitted, SP said. </p>
<p>Those e-mail exchanges also evidence the fact that SP
did not simply rubber stamp ABN''s opinion, the company said.
Conflicting views are to be expected in the context of any
serious process of analysis and consideration. </p>
<p>The closing statements from the towns, LGFS, ABN Amro Bank
and SP are scheduled to take at least until March 30. </p>

<h2>Verdicts/Settlements </h2>
<p>Lockheed Martin to Pay $15.9 Million for Mischarging U.S. </p>
<p>Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT), the biggest U.S. defense contractor,
will pay $15.9 million to settle allegations it mischarged the
federal government for tools used on military aircraft. </p>
<p>The settlement arose from a pricing fraud by a Lockheed
subcontractor that began 14 years ago, according to the Justice
Department. Lockheed Martin passed the excessive costs on to the
government in violation of the False Claims Act, the U.S. said
in a statement. </p>
<p>It is troubling that a large defense contractor with
long-established contractual ties with the United States failed
to undertake appropriate measures to ensure the integrity and
validity of the costs it submitted to the United States,
Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the
Justice Department''s civil division, said in the March 23
statement. </p>
<p>The settlement resolves two whistle-blower cases filed in
federal court in Dallas. The whistle-blowers will receive $2
million of the proceeds, according to the Justice Department. </p>
<p>Joe Stout, a spokesman for Bethesda, Maryland-based
Lockheed Martin, said the company cooperated with the
government''s investigation into its tool supplier that led to
the conviction of the subcontractor''s president. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, rose to its highest price in more than four years
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts said the company may go
beyond the divestiture plans it has already announced. </p>
<p>Pfizer climbed 1.5 percent to $22.50 at the close in New
York, the highest value since $22.55 in February 2008. The
shares have increased 8.3 percent since July 6, the day before
Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said the New York-based
company was exploring strategic alternatives for its animal
health and nutrition businesses. </p>
<p>Read, at a recent meeting with Goldman analysts, indicated
he may be willing to further split up the company after selling
or spinning off those two units, Jami Rubin, a Goldman analyst,
wrote in a note to investors. </p>
<p>We see these moves as first steps in a potential full-
scale breakup, akin to the split now taking place at Abbott
Laboratories (ABT), Rubin wrote. </p>
<p>Abbott, based in Abbott Park, Illinois, said Oct. 19 it
plans to divide into two publicly traded companies, with one
focused on drug development and the other on products including
medical devices, infant formula and generics. </p>
<p>Rubin said a further breakup would be dependent on Pfizer''s
success in getting new, brand-name drugs approved by U.S.
regulators. If the pipeline is successful and drives
meaningful top-line growth, management will want to separate the
businesses so investors can better value the pharma business,
Rubin said in her note. She said that a breakup could happen by
2015. </p>
<h2>Value Creation'' </h2>
<p>Ultimately, our decisions will be driven by value
creation for the businesses and delivering the greatest after-
tax value for our shareholders over time, Ray Kerins, a Pfizer
spokesman, wrote in an e-mailed response to questions about the
Goldman report. </p>
<p>Read previously said he intends to create more detailed
financial reports for the generic and brand-name products, to
help investors better understand the two units. </p>
<p>Of Pfizer''s $67.4 billion in 2011 revenue, $18.5 billion
fell under established products or emerging markets. The
animal health and infant nutrition units that Pfizer is
currently divesting had $6.32 billion in sales last year. </p>
<p>The Goldman report said Abbott''s share jump will likely
pressure other CEOs to consider similar strategies if the sum of
the parts is greater than the whole, Rubin said in the note.
Our recent meeting with PFE''s CEO Ian Read suggests he is open
to all options to unlock shareholder value, including
considering going further in divesting non-core assets. </p>

<p>Ex-Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. traders
led by Pierre-Henri Flamand and Morgan Sze raised more than $4.5
billion for their own hedge funds, helped by the experience of
having worked at what once was Wall Street''s most profitable
securities firm. </p>
<p>So far, none of them has made money for clients. </p>
<p>The two are among at least six traders who have left
Goldman Sachs''s biggest proprietary-trading group in the past
two years, which the New York-based bank shuttered in response
to new U.S. regulations. All, including Daniele Benatoff and
Ariel Roskis, trailed this year''s stock market rally after
losing money in 2011, investors said. Elif Aktug, who quit the
bank in 2011, plans to start managing money for outside clients
at her Agora Fund Ltd. in May. </p>
<p>In spite of their pedigree, many ex-Goldman prop traders
have found it much harder than they originally thought to make
money, said Matias Ringel, the New York-based head of research
at EFG Asset Management, which invests in hedge funds. </p>
<p>Poor timing led to the slow start for the Goldman Sachs
diaspora as the European sovereign-debt crisis and a fragile
economic recovery in the U.S. dominated global markets. Yet
their failure to generate profits from investments also
highlights the differences between trading at a bank, with its
extensive research, technology and compliance operations, and
running a hedge fund where clients pay top fees and are less
tolerant of risk. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley Alternative
Investment Partners, a division of the New York bank''s asset-
management business, is seeking as much as $750 million for a
fund that will purchase existing private-equity stakes, said a
person with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Global Secondary Opportunities Fund II LP
will buy secondary stakes in special situation funds, as well as
small- and mid-cap buyout funds, according to the person, who
asked not to be identified because the information isn''t public.
Special situation funds seek to profit from investments in
companies undergoing corporate events such as asset sales,
spinoffs and shareholder lawsuits. </p>
<p>So-called secondary buyers, including firms such as Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Coller Capital Ltd., are looking to take
advantage of an unprecedented amount of private-equity assets
being offered from sellers including banks and pension plans.
Credit Suisse, based in Zurich, said last month that it raised
$2.9 billion for its fifth secondary fund, and London-based
Coller is seeking to collect $5 billion for a pool that will
purchase existing stakes. </p>
<p>Matt Burkhard, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment on the fundraising. </p>
<p>The new fund, which has a target of $600 million and a
limit of $750 million, will allocate about a quarter of its
capital to emerging markets, the person said. That compares with
about 20 percent for the previous pool, which raised $584.5
million in 2010, the person said. The allocation will be
balanced between Asian, Latin American and Eastern European
countries. </p>
<h2>Asia Assets </h2>
<p>Emerging markets funds make up an increasing share of
available secondary stakes, with Asia assets slowly becoming a
more noticeable portion of the market, according to a March
presentation by Cogent Partners, a New York-based advisory firm.
Capital raising for Asia Funds peaked at $65.1 billion in 2008,
according to researcher Preqin Ltd. Last year, such funds
accounted for 2 percent of secondary-market supply, Cogent said. </p>
<p>Over the past decade, Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment
Partners'' secondary funds have generated a 25 percent net
internal rate of return, the person said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) got a judge to
order a group of unidentified hackers to stop running networks
of infected computers known as botnets that allegedly hijack
online bank accounts. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. in Brooklyn, New
York, today issued a preliminary injunction against 39 John Does
who use hacker aliases such as Monstr and Gribodemon to
create a network of botnets running malicious software known as
Zeus. </p>
<p>A botnet is a network of infected computers programmed to
send data automatically from their hard drives to a server
controlled by hackers. Hackers infect computers with software
that can steal online banking logins and passwords, which they
can use to transfer money to their own accounts. </p>
<p>That''s the primary purpose of this scheme, said Gabriel
M. Ramsey, a lawyer for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft,
which claims the Zeus botnets controlled by the John Doe hackers
have taken more than $100 million. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s biggest software maker, sued the
unnamed hackers on March 19. The case was made public March 27,
the day after Microsoft said it had seized computer servers in
Pennsylvania and Illinois, while escorted by U.S. Marshals, to
preserve evidence. </p>
<h2>Record Keystrokes </h2>
<p>The Zeus software allows a hacker to monitor a victim''s
online activity and record keystrokes, according to a March 26
statement from Microsoft. The company said it has detected more
than 13 million suspected infections of Zeus software worldwide
since 2007, and 3 million in the U.S. </p>
<p>Microsoft and its partners took down two Internet
Protocol addresses behind the Zeus command and control
structure, and Microsoft is currently monitoring 800 domains
secured in the operation, which are helping identify thousands
of computers infected by Zeus, the company said in the
statement. </p>
<p>Ramsey said Microsoft and other plaintiffs are speaking to
law enforcement about the matter. He declined to comment on the
case after the hearing. </p>
<p>A botnet is a collection of computers running software
that allows communication among those computers and that allows
centralized or decentralized communication with other computers
providing control instructions, according to Microsoft''s
complaint. </p>
<h2>Same Codes </h2>
<p>Botnets running Zeus software share the same code and
infrastructure, according to the complaint. The names of the
botnets'' creators are unknown, according to the complaint. No
defendants'' representatives appeared at today''s hearing. </p>
<p>Microsoft said the raids this month marked the second time
it has conducted physical seizures in a botnet operation. Some
Zeus botnet computers are in the Eastern District of New York,
the U.S. jurisdiction that includes the Brooklyn federal court,
according to the complaint. </p>
<p>The company also said it believed the lawsuit is the first
to use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
against a botnet operation. The federal RICO law was passed to
fight organized crime. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs joining Microsoft in the case are Reston,
Virginia-based FS-ISAC Inc., which represents banks and other
financial-services companies in combating cyber threats, and
Herndon, Virginia-based National Automated Clearing House
Association, which manages the ACH Network, the backbone for
the electronic movement of money and data, according to the
complaint. </p>
<p>The case is Microsoft Corp. v. John Does 1-39, 12-cv-01335,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) should
stop promoting itself as putting customers first because the
slogan ignores conflicts inherent in trading, said Arthur Levitt, the former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman
and a senior adviser to the firm. </p>
<p>We probably ought to stop saying that because nobody
really puts customers first, Levitt, 81, said in an interview
with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television today. Business is
a tension between sellers and buyers. </p>
<p>Our clients'' interests always come first, has been the
No. 1 business policy at New York-based Goldman Sachs since the
late 1970s, when then co-Chairman John C. Whitehead drafted a
set of 14 business principles to guide the firm. Levitt''s
suggestion comes 14 months after a committee on which he served
issued a business standards report that reaffirmed Goldman
Sachs''s commitment to putting clients'' interests first. </p>
<p>Goldman shouldn''t play to that, Levitt said in the
interview today. Goldman should play to their competence,
which is considerable. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
criticized by former derivatives salesman Greg Smith in a March
14 opinion piece in the New York Times for failing to live up to
its principle of putting clients first. Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn responded that
Smith''s assertions do not reflect our values, our culture and
how the vast majority of people at Goldman Sachs think about the
firm and the work it does on behalf of clients. </p>

<p>His striped cravat tucked inside a
heavily decorated uniform, India''s army chief last week sent
tremors through one of the few government ministries to have
escaped 17 months of scandal and intrigue. </p>
<p>A day after the general said he''d been offered a bribe to
approve a contract, Defense Minister A.K. Antony told parliament
he''d known of the claim since 2010 yet hadn''t ordered an inquiry.
The flap deepened a perception of mismanagement pervading Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh''s cabinet that began with auditors in
2010 vilifying the handling of sales of mobile-phone licenses. </p>
<p>Antony, whose personal probity helped him win charge of a
department where graft scuttled an earlier government, joined
cabinet colleagues engaged in fighting fires rather than making
policy. With two years left before a national election is due,
the vacuum of leadership has helped fuel a surge in support for
regional parties now crippling efforts by the federal government
to shrink a fiscal deficit and embrace foreign investment. </p>
<p>The government is just limping from crisis to crisis,
said Satish Misra, a political analyst at Observer Research
Foundation, a policy-research group based in New Delhi. Just
as it tries to get some traction, another problem drags it
down. </p>
