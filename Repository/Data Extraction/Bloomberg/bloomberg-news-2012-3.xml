&lt;p&gt;U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk
said the nation&#8217;s policy for issuing visas is hurting the
economy by limiting tourism and blocking overseas buyers of
American products from coming to the U.S. for training. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will engage on the visa issue, which is frankly
crippling us right now,&#8221; Kirk said today in Washington. &#8220;We
hear from business after business, &#8216;We go, we make these sales,
and my customers can&#8217;t get a visa to come here to learn how to
use the product.&#8217; We are past-due to have a common-sense
immigration policy, and we need to have visa reform as part of
that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the nation
needs to ease restrictions on immigrants who plan to open U.S.
businesses, and create a separate visa for potential
entrepreneurs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts at overhauling immigration laws are stymied in
Congress, including a proposal to let temporary foreign workers
enter the U.S. and help illegal immigrants advance toward
citizenship. The debate has overshadowed the need to change the
U.S. visa program, according to the Chamber, the largest
business group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current laws make it difficult for people to enter the U.S.
and start a business, according to a Jan. 25 report from the
Chamber and the Immigration Policy Center of the American
Immigration Council, a Washington-based nonprofit. Expansion of
the visa program would also aid companies&#8217; access to foreign-
born graduates of U.S. universities, helping economic growth,
the authors of the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speeding Visas &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama on Jan. 19 gave the departments of
Homeland Security and State 60 days to write a plan for speeding
visa applications from China and Brazil. Obama&#8217;s order
recommends cutting the process to three weeks from four months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa-processing capacity in China and Brazil must increase
40 percent in the next year, according to the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our tourism numbers are up, but one of the things
constraining it is the difficulty some people are having in
getting visas,&#8221; Kirk said in remarks at a meeting today of the
National Association of Counties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speeding the visa progress may create 1.3 million jobs and
add $850 billion to the economy by 2020, the National Retail
Federation said in a Jan. 19 report, citing the U.S. Travel
Association. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, said it settled an eight-year legal battle with
a Singapore company over a patent on technology to deter piracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed, said David Cuddy, a
Microsoft spokesman. The companies reached a &#8220;final and
mutually agreeable resolution&#8221; to a dispute begun in September
2003. A trial was under way before a federal jury in Providence,
Rhode Island, to determine how much Microsoft should pay Uniloc
USA Inc. and Uniloc Singapore Private Ltd. for infringing the
patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different jury in 2009 had said Microsoft infringed the
Uniloc patent and awarded $388 million in damages. An appeals
court upheld the verdict and threw out the dollar figure, saying
it was &#8220;fundamentally tainted&#8221; by the numbers used at trial to
calculate how much Microsoft should pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case concerned a Microsoft product known as
Clearinghouse that activates Microsoft programs including
Windows XP, Office XP, Office 2003 and Windows Server 2003. The
trial that began last week was to determine how much Microsoft
should pay to use the invention through Nov. 11, 2011, according
to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent covers a software registration system to deter
illegal copying. The user enters information, such as a serial
number, to determine whether the program is an authorized
version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniloc has filed suit over the same patent against software
companies in federal court in Tyler, Texas, including Symantec
Corp. (SYMC) and Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) Some of those, including Adobe,
have reached settlement agreements. Uniloc Singapore owns the
patent and Uniloc USA is the exclusive licensee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court case is Uniloc USA Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.,
03cv440, U.S. District Court, District of Rhode Island
(Providence). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline in Los
Angeles and San Francisco strengthened for the first time in six
days on speculation that repairs at Chevron Corp. (CVX) and BP Plc (BP/)
refineries may tighten supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron flared sulfur dioxide at the Richmond (CTRCCRUD) oil refinery
last week after a hydrogen plant went down and a flare-gas
compressor malfunctioned, according to notices filed with Contra
Costa county regulators. BP plans to shut a coker, a crude unit
and an alkylation unit at the Carson (BPCRCRUD) plant for a maintenance
turnaround this month, two people familiar with the work said
Jan. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in Los Angeles (MOGLDB85) rose 10.75 cents to a premium of 24.5
cents a gallon against gasoline futures traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 4:03 p.m. East Coast time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel previously fell for six
days as Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)&#8217;s Wilmington (VAWICRUD) plant started units
following work and BP&#8217;s Carson refinery recovered from an upset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco (MOGSD85P) Carbob gained 10.25 cents to a premium of
21.5 cents against futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips (COP) plans to close the Santa Maria (CPSMCRUD) refinery in
California this month for a four-week maintenance turnaround,
according to a notice to San Luis Obispo County regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conoco Maintenance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conoco is scheduled to shut the 44,000-barrel-a-day plant
west of Bakersfield, California, for &#8220;specialized inspections
and maintenance work,&#8221; the Houston-based company said in a
March 1 notice to the San Luis Obispo Air Pollution Control
District and the local community. It was unclear when the plant
would be taken out of service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Santa Maria plant processes mainly heavy, high-sulfur
crude oil into semi-refined products that are then delivered
across a 200-mile (320-kilometer) pipeline to Conoco&#8217;s 128,000-
barrel-a-day Rodeo (CPACCRUD) refinery in Northern California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can confirm there is planned maintenance underway at
our San Francisco refinery,&#8221; Rich Johnson, a Conoco spokesman
in Houston, said in an e-mail March 2. &#8220;Details regarding the
specific units involved and the duration of the work are
considered proprietary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend diesel, or CARB diesel, in Los Angeles (DIEILCAD)
gained 3 cents to a 20.25-cent premium against Nymex heating oil
futures, the highest level since Nov. 7. The same fuel in San
Francisco (DIEISCAD) rose 2.25 cents to a premium of 19.5 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jet fuel in Los Angeles strengthened for the fourth day,
gaining 1 cent to a premium of 15 cents against Nymex heating
oil futures, the highest level since May 23. Inventories (CALXREFP) of the
aviation fuel fell dropped 7.9 percent to 3.5 million barrels in
the week ended Feb. 24, an 11-week low, according to the state
Energy Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Portland Gasoline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland (MOGHD87P), Oregon,
strengthened 7.44 cents to a discount of 5.56 cents a gallon
against gasoline futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conoco will shut the 107,500-barrel-a-day Ferndale refinery
in Washington state for a turnaround beginning March 15, two
people familiar with the work said March 2. The company was
initially scheduled to begin work at the beginning of the month
and delayed it following a fire at BP Plc&#8217;s Cherry Point plant
nearby, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turnaround is expected to last 37 days, one person
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) closed above $200 for the first time, driven higher as
technology companies seize leadership in the U.S. stock market
as the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rally enters its fourth year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 0.9 percent today, crossing a level never before
seen when stock splits are factored in. The Armonk, New York-
based company has advanced 9.1 percent in 2012, and 140 percent
since the bull market for U.S. equities began on March 9, 2009.
Computer-related stocks in the SP 500 have climbed 15 percent
since the end of December, the most among 10 industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider posted a
third straight annual gain in 2011 as the SP 500 (SPX) stalled after
surging 39 percent in 2009 and 2010. The shares have increased
3.8 percent since Feb. 21, when their price-earnings ratio
dropped to the lowest level since June versus the valuation for
SP 500 technology companies, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty succeeded Sam Palmisano this
year, becoming the first female chief executive officer in the
company&#8217;s 100-year history. She inherits a five-year plan that
includes boosting software to half of IBM&#8217;s earnings, with a
focus on programs that help businesses analyze and project
trends, as well as on cloud computing and emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, IBM reported revenue of $107 billion for 2011
and earnings of $13.06 a share, and forecast 2012 earnings that
exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has the biggest weight in the 30-company Dow Jones
Industrial Average, accounting for 12 percent of its value. The
Dow slipped 14.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,962.81 today,
while the SP 500 lost 0.4 percent to 1,364.33. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s advance came as Apple Inc. (AAPL) sank below a milestone
reached last week. The stock dropped 2.2 percent to $533.16
today, sending Apple&#8217;s market capitalization below $500 billion.
The maker of iPhones and iPad tablet computers became only the
sixth U.S. company to climb above that threshold, according to
data compiled by SP. The others are Microsoft Corp., General
Electric Co., Cisco Systems Inc., Intel Corp. and Exxon Mobil
Corp., in chronological order. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators, reviewing an
advocacy group&#8217;s complaint that a chemical used in colas causes
tumors in animals, said there&#8217;s no immediate risk to consumers
from the substance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person would have to drink more than a thousand cans of
soda in a day to match the doses administered in studies that
showed links to cancer in rodents, Douglas Karas, a U.S. Food
and Drug Administration spokesman, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer-
health group in Washington, said in a statement today that high
levels of the chemical 4-methylimidazole were found in drinks
made by Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and PepsiCo. Inc. (PEP) The chemical is part of
coloring used in colas and the subject of a study the group
released today. An industry group disputed the findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is nothing more than scare tactics,&#8221; the American
Beverage Association said in a statement today, calling the
claims &#8220;outrageous.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA has no reason to believe consumers are in danger,
the FDA&#8217;s Karas wrote in an e-mail. The agency is reviewing the
group&#8217;s petition, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer group said it commissioned laboratory studies
of products including Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Diet Coke, Diet
Pepsi, Snapple Group Inc.&#8217;s Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper, and
Whole Foods 365 Cola from Washington-area stores. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI), the

fill its open chief financial officer position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennis Durkin, 41, replaces Thomas Tippl, who was promoted
to Activision&#8217;s chief operating officer in March 2010 and had
been handling his previous role in finance for the interim until
a replacement was named, the Santa Monica, California-based
company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Microsoft, Durkin served as corporate vice president and
chief operating and financial officer of Microsoft&#8217;s Interactive
Entertainment Business, which includes the Xbox game-console
business. He had been at Microsoft since 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tippl will continue to oversee Activision&#8217;s publishing
business and Blizzard Entertainment&#8217;s operational activities,
the company said. His areas of responsibility include strategic
planning, global sales and supply chain, and oversight of the
legal and human resources departments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activision advanced 0.3 percent to $11.71 at the close in
New York. The shares have lost 5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, sued a unit of Johnson  Johnson, contending it
infringes a U.S. patent for pain-relieving heat-patch
technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, is seeking unspecified damages
after a jury trial and a halt to sales of Fort Washington,
Pennsylvania-based McNeil-PPC&#8217;s Precise-brand patch, according
to a complaint filed in federal court in Delaware today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;McNeil was aware of the patent&#8221; because its number &#8220;is
clearly marked on the packaging of Thermacare, Pfizer&#8217;s
competing heat-wrap product,&#8221; Pfizer lawyers allege. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, with $67.4 billion in sales last year, also makes
Lipitor for cholesterol control. Last month, Pfizer and Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) were sued in an antitrust case in New York
alleging the drugmakers engaged in an anti-competitive scheme to
delay generic Lipitor into the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seema Kumar, a Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) spokeswoman, couldn&#8217;t

&lt;p&gt;OMV Petrom SA (SNP) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
will probably start natural gas production from the first deep-
water well in the Black Sea as early as 2015, Romanian President
Traian Basescu said today, after visiting the drilling rig,
according to Mediafax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies, which said on Feb. 22 they may have
encountered a gas accumulation of as much as 84 billion cubic
meters in the Black Sea, will explore new wells &#8220;with similar

&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP\) may face as much as
$17.6 billion in civil pollution fines and possibly billions of
dollars more in criminal penalties as its settlement with
businesses and individuals harmed by the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil
spill shifts the focus to government claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP said March 2 it would pay an estimated $7.8 billion to
resolve private plaintiffs&#8217; claims for economic loss, property
damage and injuries. The settlement, to be paid from a
$20 billion trust for spill victims set up in 2010, doesn&#8217;t
resolve federal and state government environmental damage
claims. BP has set aside $37 billion to cover spill costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers and government officials have
worked together to gather evidence about who is at fault for the
spill, U.S. Justice Department attorneys are likely to take the
lead in the case, said Edward Sherman, a Tulane University Law
School professor in New Orleans who teaches classes on complex
litigation and mass-tort law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll now see the federal government pick up the ball in
this case and run with it,&#8221; Sherman said in a phone interview.
&#8220;They have plenty of lawyers capable of effectively presenting
the case against BP and the other defendants.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans had been
set to hear evidence in a trial starting today to decide fault
for the spill. BP was sued along with Vernier, Switzerland-based
Transocean Ltd. (RIG), owner and operator of the doomed Deepwater
Horizon rig, and Houston-based Halliburton Co. (HAL), provider of
cementing services at the Macondo oil well, about 45 miles (72
kilometers) off the Louisiana coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbier delayed the trial after a settlement was announced
of consolidated cases against London-based BP that are overseen
by a group of lawyers known as the Plaintiffs Steering
Committee, or PSC. He said in a March 2 order that he will
schedule a status conference to discuss the consequences of the
accord and set a new trial date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said he delayed the trial because the settlement
&#8220;would likely result in a realignment of the parties in this
litigation and require substantial changes&#8221; to the trial plan
he adopted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP officials said their estimates showed the PSC spill
settlement would cost the company at least $7.8 billion. They
said the figure didn&#8217;t amount to a cap of how much the company
would pay to resolve claims over the disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bank of America Sued by Fund Over Mortgage-Backed Securities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. was sued by Asset Management Fund
over claims it gave faulty information about the loans backing
$239.5 million worth of residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit accuses the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank
and other defendants of making &#8220;material misrepresentations and
omissions&#8221; about underwriting standards used to issue mortgage
loans that were pooled together into the securities, which were
sold to Chicago-based Asset Management Fund, according to court
documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Each of the defendants knew, or at a minimum was
negligent in knowing, that its representations and omissions
were false and/or misleading at the time they were made,&#8221;
lawyers for Asset Management Fund said in the court documents,
which were filed in New York State Supreme Court March 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset Management Fund, which does business as AMF Funds,
sued JPMorgan Chase  Co. in the same court over similar claims
last month. The firm, which is managed by Shay Assets Management
Inc., had about $590 million in assets under management in 2011,
according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, said in
an e-mail that the company had no comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Asset Management Fund v. Bank of America
Corp. (BAC), 650614/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Principal Life Sues JPMorgan Over Mortgage-Backed Securities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. was sued by a Principal Financial
Group Inc. (PFG) unit, which accused the bank of making false
statements in connection with the sale of $114.9 million in
residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal Life Insurance Co., a unit of the Des Moines,
Iowa-based seller of insurance and retirement products, accused
New York-based JPMorgan Chase of making &#8220;misrepresentations and
omissions&#8221; about the mortgage loans that were pooled together
into the securities, according to documents filed in New York
state Supreme Court March 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a telephone message left at her
office seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Principal Life Insurance Co. v. JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM), 650615/2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley Executive Charged in Hate Crime Stabbing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s William Bryan Jennings, the bank&#8217;s bond-
underwriting chief in the U.S., was charged with a hate crime
for stabbing a New York City cab driver of Middle Eastern
descent over a fare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driver said Jennings assaulted him Dec. 22 with a &#8220;pen
knife&#8221; and used racial slurs after a 40-mile cab ride from New
York City to his $3.4 million home in Connecticut&#8217;s Fairfield
County, Darien Police Detective Mark Cappelli said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennings and the driver argued over the fare from New York,
where his lawyer said the executive had attended a charity
event. After arriving at his driveway, Jennings refused to pay
$204, the driver told police. A fight ensued and Jennings cut
the driver, police said. The banker, who turned himself in two
weeks later, was charged with second-degree assault, theft of
services and intimidation by bias or bigotry. He faces as many
as 5 years in prison on the assault charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He has been placed on leave,&#8221; Pen Pendleton, a spokesman
for the New York-based bank, said March 2. Jennings was released
on $9,500 bond and is set for a court appearance on March 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banker has worked at Morgan Stanley (MS) his entire
securities-industry career, starting in 1993, according to the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now co-head of North American fixed-income capital markets,
he worked his way up from associate; vice president, and then
principal, for debt capital markets; to executive director for
investment banking and then managing director for fixed income
capital markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennings, a graduate of Williams College who also received
a master&#8217;s in business from Northwestern University, contacted
police after learning he was being sought in relation to the
incident, Darien Police Lt. Ronald Bussell said. He was arrested
and charged Feb. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eugene Riccio, Jennings&#8217; defense attorney, said the driver
made an &#8220;exorbitant demand&#8221; closer to $300 and that he
attempted to abduct his client after driving him from a charity
event in Manhattan. He declined to specify the event or where
his client had hailed the cab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My client was the victim of a crime that night -- not the
perpetrator of one,&#8221; Riccio said, denying that his client made
any racial slurs. &#8220;He was abducted against his will from his
own driveway. Fortunately he was able to escape.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Busts 29 Over $325 Million in Counterfeit Chinese Goods &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities charged 29 people with smuggling $325
million in counterfeit consumer goods from China, including
phony Nike sneakers and Coach handbags, through a New Jersey
port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bust was one of the largest counterfeiting probes in
U.S. history, and it involved smuggling cigarettes, handbags and
sneakers through the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal as
U.S. agents secretly watched and listened, U.S. Attorney Paul
Fishman said. Agents infiltrated two overlapping criminal rings
and lured them to use a front company run by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities arrested 23 people in New York, New Jersey,
Texas and the Philippines. Six are at large. Most are Chinese
and lived in New York. Prosecutors said they used phony
paperwork to import goods in corrugated shipping containers,
used distributors and wholesalers, and laundered illicit
proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrest complaints quote dozens of secretly recorded
conversations, including one between Hai Yan Jiang, 32, of
Richardson, and Lin Wu, 43, of Maspeth, New York. They discussed
importing counterfeit cosmetics, and Wu asked if the products
would be safe, according to their arrest complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yan said the cosmetics were &#8220;counterfeit, but of good
quality,&#8221; adding: &#8220;All I care about is to make money, other
things do not matter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases include U.S. v. Patrick Siu, 12-cr-7061 and U.S.
v. Ning Guo, 12-cr-7060, U.S. District Court, District of New
Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Credit Suisse Must Face $2 Billion National Century Notes Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) must defend fraud claims by
institutional investors who bought $2 billion in notes issued by
the bankrupt health-care financer, National Century Financial
Enterprises Inc., a judge ruled March 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The noteholders claim Credit Suisse, the placement agent,
knew or should have known of the $2.9 billion fraud that led to
National Century&#8217;s collapse in 2002. Ten executives of the
Dublin, Ohio-based company were convicted of crimes, including
former Chief Executive Officer Lance Poulsen, who is serving 30
years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse argued that it didn&#8217;t know of the fraud,
which National Century hid, and that it didn&#8217;t mislead
noteholders, according to the March 2 ruling by U.S. District
Judge James Graham in Columbus, Ohio. Graham granted other parts
of the bank&#8217;s motion to dismiss the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims against the Zurich-based bank for negligent
misrepresentation and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary
duty were dismissed by the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Credit Suisse will continue its defense of this decade-
old case, and remains confident that a jury will find based on
all the evidence that it should not be held responsible for
assisting or committing any wrongdoing,&#8221; Steven Vames, a Credit
Suisse spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re National Century Financial Enterprises
Inc. Investment Litigation, 03-md-01565, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Ohio (Columbus). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Urges Dismissal of Greenberg&#8217;s $25 Billion AIG Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government said Maurice &#8220;Hank&#8221; Greenberg, the
former American International Group Inc. (AIG) chief executive
officer, should not be allowed in a court case to &#8220;rewrite&#8221;
the insurer&#8217;s rescue agreement and make American taxpayers pay
$25 billion more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department, in a filing March 1 in the
U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, said a lawsuit filed
by Greenberg&#8217;s Starr International Co. seeking damages in that
sum for the 2008 AIG takeover should be dismissed. The
government said Starr lacks the authority to sue and has no
claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Starr demands that the court second guess AIG and rewrite
the rescue agreement by making American taxpayers pay an
additional $25 billion, based upon a market valuation of AIG
after the rescue,&#8221; the U.S. said in its filing. &#8220;Although
Starr may disagree with the terms to which AIG agreed, any
burdens resulting from that agreement should be borne by AIG and
its shareholders, not the public.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr International sued the government Nov. 21, calling
the public assumption of 80 percent of stock in the insurer in
2008 an unconstitutional &#8220;taking&#8221; of property that requires
$25 billion in compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alison Preece, a spokeswoman for the law firm representing
Starr, declined to comment on the government&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal claims case is Starr International Co. v. U.S.,
1:11-cv-00779, U.S. Court of Federal Claims (Washington). The
Federal Reserve case is Starr International Co. v. Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, 1:11-cv-08422, U.S. District Court,

&lt;h2&gt;Aluminium Bahrain Seeks to Keep Alcoa Bribery Suit Alive &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bahrain&#8217;s state-owned aluminum producer asked a court to
let it proceed with racketeering claims that it overpaid for raw
materials because of bribes directed by Alcoa Inc. (AA), the largest
U.S. aluminum producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminium Bahrain BSC (ALBH), known as Alba, claims that New York-
based Alcoa bribed senior officials in Bahrain and caused Alba
to pay almost $500 million more than it should have for alumina,
the principal raw material in aluminum. Alcoa has asked a judge
to dismiss the case, arguing that the alleged conduct took place
outside the U.S. and shouldn&#8217;t be litigated in federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alba countered that Alcoa and other defendants used
offshore shell companies to &#8220;perpetrate and conceal a massive,
home-cooked bribery scheme conceived, orchestrated, and directed
in and from the United States,&#8221; according to its filing March 1
in federal court in Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lori Lecker, an Alcoa spokeswoman, said in an e-mail that
&#8220;Alba&#8217;s allegations remain unsupported by law or by fact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Aluminium Bahrain BSC v. Alcoa Inc., 08-
cv-00299, U.S. District Court, Western District of Pennsylvania
(Pittsburgh). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Delphi&#8217;s Buyout by Tokio Should Be Blocked, Judge Is Told &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delphi Financial Group Inc. (DFG)&#8217;s $2.7 billion buyout by rival
insurer Tokio Marine Holdings Inc. (8766) should be blocked because it
doesn&#8217;t provide enough for investors while unfairly enriching
the company&#8217;s top executive, a lawyer argued to a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Rosenkranz, Delphi&#8217;s chief executive officer,
negotiated a side deal that would wrongly compensate him as part
of the sale to Tokio Marine, Stuart Grant, a lawyer for pension-
fund investors that sued, told a judge March 2 in Wilmington,
Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the non-binding deal, Tokio Marine would maintain
contracts with two firms Rosenkranz owns that do business with
Delphi, or buy them, the investors&#8217; lawyers claim. The side
agreement is different from an executive&#8217;s asking for salary and
benefits from a buyer, Grant told Delaware Chancery Court Judge
Sam Glasscock in a hearing on the funds&#8217; request for a temporary
order blocking the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s something else to say, &#8216;I have been stealing from
the company for years and I need you to help me keep
stealing,&#8217;&#8221; Grant said after Glasscock asked him why the side
agreement was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delphi&#8217;s lawyers contend that Rosenkranz only discussed a
sale of the firms with Tokio Marine officials and didn&#8217;t reach
any formal deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pension funds want Glasscock to temporarily halt the
sale while a trial on the disputes goes forward. Glasscock ended
the March 2 hearing without issuing a decision. He said he would
try to release his ruling this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Delphi Financial Group Shareholder
Litigation, 7144, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gupta Animosity With Rajaratnam Key to Defense, Lawyer Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;key defense theme&#8221; in the case of Rajat Gupta, the
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director accused of insider
trading, will be his poor relationship with Raj Rajaratnam, the
Galleon Group LLC cofounder convicted of profiting from his
tips, one of Gupta&#8217;s lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter to U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff March 1,
lawyer David Frankel said an unnamed &#8220;key government witness&#8221;
discussed the &#8220;animosity between the two men&#8221; in a July 2010
interview with investigators from the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Federal Bureau of Investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disclosure came in a letter seeking exculpatory
material in the SEC notes from 44 interviews jointly conducted
by the agency and the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office in their
investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a hearing in January before Rakoff, who will preside
over Gupta&#8217;s trial in May, prosecutors said Claes Dahlback, a
Goldman Sachs director who is a former chief executive officer
of Sweden&#8217;s Investor AB (INVEA), spoke to Gupta after Rajaratnam&#8217;s
October 2009 arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dahlback asked Gupta if Gupta knew Rajaratnam,&#8221; Rakoff
said, quoting a memo summarizing Dahlback&#8217;s June interview with
the government. &#8220;Gupta responded that &#8216;Rajaratnam was a bad
man.&#8217; Gupta further stated Gupta lost money with Rajaratnam,&#8221;
Rakoff said, summarizing the witness report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara
in Manhattan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Blankfein Was Prepped by U.S., Gupta&#8217;s Lawyer Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Rajat Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. director accused of passing inside tips, said prosecutors
in the case conducted preparation sessions with Goldman Sachs
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein before his Feb. 24
deposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who testified as a prosecution witness at the
insider-trading trial of Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj
Rajaratnam, was questioned as part of a parallel insider-trading
lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
against Gupta, who was charged in October with passing nonpublic
information to Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Does Goldman Sachs have any interest in the outcome of
this litigation?&#8221; Gary Naftalis, Gupta&#8217;s lawyer asked Blankfein
at the end of the deposition that began at 10:22 a.m. and
concluded at 7:14 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No,&#8221; Blankfein replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpts from the Blankfein transcript were attached to the
defense lawyers&#8217; letters to U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who
is presiding over both cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who might be a prosecution witness against
Gupta, said during the day-long deposition that he had
participated in two sessions in which Assistant U.S. Attorney
Reed Brodsky, who is prosecuting Gupta, asked &#8220;three-quarters&#8221;
of the questions. The sessions were held at Goldman Sachs,
Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation agents were also present at
the preparatory sessions, as well as SEC representatives,
Naftalis said in a March 1 letter to Rakoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excerpts also show that SEC lawyers objected numerous
times to questions Naftalis asked about the government&#8217;s
preparation of Blankfein, citing a legal privilege barring Gupta
from discovering information about its legal strategy and the
thought processes of its lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naftalis has asked Rakoff to allow Gupta&#8217;s defense team to
resume questioning Blankfein about these preparations and
require the SEC to provide Gupta with the documents shown to
Blankfein during the sessions. While Naftalis didn&#8217;t allege
anything improper occurred during the preparation sessions, he
said he&#8217;s seeking the documents used to help prepare Blankfein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s attempt to withhold from disclosure the
documents shown to Mr. Blankfein by Mr. Brodsky to refresh his
recollection fails,&#8221; Naftalis said in the letter to Rakoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There can be no dispute that Blankfein is a key witness
with respect to the allegations against Mr. Gupta,&#8221; Naftalis
said. &#8220;It is therefore in the &#8216;interests of justice&#8217; to permit
Mr. Gupta to cross-examine these documents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who denies wrongdoing, was charged in October with
leaking information about Goldman Sachs and Procter  Gamble Co.
to Rajaratnam, who was convicted last year and is serving an 11-
year prison sentence. Gupta was also a director at PG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Vulcan-Martin Marietta Merger-Trial Judge Reserves Decision &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulcan Materials Co. (VMC)&#8217;s planned hostile takeover by rock-
crushing rival Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (MLM) could be blocked
by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who reserved decision on the
case after a four-day trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Leo Strine Jr. asked lawyers March 2 for post-trial
briefings before the end of the month in Wilmington, Delaware,
and said he&#8217;d hold final arguments the week of March 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the ultimate remedy is to &#8220;block it,&#8221; the question is,
&#8220;for how long?&#8221; Strine said of Martin Marietta&#8217;s $4.7 billion
stock-swap bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In guiding lawyers&#8217; future arguments, Strine said, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think there was ideal scrutiny on either side&#8221; of the
potential combination, subject of initial friendly talks two
years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;primary reason&#8221; for the breakdown in earlier talks
was that the parties &#8220;couldn&#8217;t decide who was going to run
it,&#8221; the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a tough case,&#8221; Strine said. &#8220;Martin
Marietta has put itself in an awkward position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the companies is &#8220;compelling&#8221; and would create
&#8220;enormous shareholder value,&#8221; Martin Marietta&#8217;s Chairman,
Stephen P. Zelnak, told the judge March 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Marietta sued Birmingham, Alabama-based Vulcan on
Dec. 12, the same day it made the unsolicited bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Marietta has asked Strine to declare that the offer
wasn&#8217;t prohibited by a May 2010 confidentiality agreement.
Vulcan claims Martin Marietta violated the agreement with its
public offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Martin Marietta Materials v. Vulcan Materials,

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ING Wins Challenge Forcing EU to Reconsider Bailout Terms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ING Groep NV (INGA) won a court ruling forcing European Union
regulators to re-examine the conditions they imposed on the
Dutch lender&#8217;s government rescue in the wake of the 2008
financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU&#8217;s General Court said the European Commission wrongly
considered a revision of repayment terms as 2 billion euros
($2.65 billion) of additional aid to ING on top of 10 billion
euros it received in 2008. The court struck down part of the
EU&#8217;s decision, which will force regulators to re-open their
assessment of part of the Dutch government&#8217;s bailout to the
bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ING was ordered by the commission to sell units to shrink
its balance sheet by 45 percent by the end of 2013 and avoid
undercutting rivals on prices for some banking products for
three years or until it repaid the aid. The lender returned 5
billion euros of aid in 2009 after agreeing with the Netherlands
on revised repayment terms. The EU regulator determined that
change amounted to extra aid of about 2 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is quite good news for ING,&#8221; said Cor Kluis, an
analyst at Rabobank International in Utrecht. &#8220;Hopefully it
won&#8217;t take too much time for the EC to adjust the terms. We also
hope the EC won&#8217;t appeal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ING and the Dutch government challenged the terms of the
EU&#8217;s approval, which the bank says punished it too harshly for
state help in 2008 and 2009. ING said the regulator
miscalculated the amount of aid and imposed excessive
restructuring demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ING welcomes the judgment to partially annul the EC
decision,&#8221; the Amsterdam-based bank said in a statement. &#8220;ING
will carefully assess the full judgment and its consequences.
Announcements on any potential further actions will only be made
if and when appropriate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission will publish a revised decision on the aid
terms, Antoine Colombani, spokesman for Joaquin Almunia, the
EU&#8217;s antitrust commissioner, said in an e-mail. The regulator
will &#8220;carefully assess&#8221; the ruling before deciding whether to
appeal, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch Finance Ministry in The Hague is &#8220;satisfied&#8221; by
the ruling and will study it to &#8220;further assess the
consequences,&#8221; spokesman Ben Feiertag, said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch central bank joined the case on ING&#8217;s behalf.
National bank supervisors should formally be heard by the
commission to avoid it imposing terms that hurt financial
stability, it said. Klaas Knot, who heads the central bank, has
also argued for a dispute settlement procedure when competition
and national financial regulators clash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see today&#8217;s ruling as a signal to the commission that
it would be wise to involve national supervisors in its
decisions,&#8221; said Kees Verhagen, a spokesman for the Dutch
central bank in Amsterdam. &#8220;The court ruled the decision was
based on incomplete information and that was partly caused by
the fact that they ignored information submitted by the national
supervisor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are T-33/10, ING Groep v. Commission and T-29/10,
Netherlands v. Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Law Firm Representing Deutsche Bank in Kirch Litigation Quits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of three law firms that represented Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
and its former Chief Executive Officer Rolf Breuer in the
decade-long dispute with Leo Kirch&#8217;s media group resigned from
the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sernetz Schaefer Rechtsanwaelte told the Munich appeals
court hearing two related cases on Feb. 27 that they no longer
work for the lender or Breuer, Manfred Wolf, a lawyer at the
Munich-based firm said in an interview March 2. He declined to
say why his firm decided to withdraw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, Germany&#8217;s biggest lender, rejected  March 1
a proposal to settle the litigation tied to comments by Breuer
in 2002 about the Kirch group&#8217;s creditworthiness. The bank said
it made the decision after a &#8220;thorough review,&#8221; which included
considering internal and external legal advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank and Kirch&#8217;s heirs discussed a settlement of
the claims that Breuer&#8217;s comments caused the collapse of the
media group. The amount talked about was 800 million euros ($1
billion), a person with knowledge of the negotiations said last
month. The Frankfurt-based bank was said to have previously
rejected a 775 million-euro settlement proposed by a Munich
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detlev Rahmsdorf, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two other German law firms that represent Deutsche Bank
and Breuer in the matter are Hengeler Mueller and Gleiss Lutz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Munich appeal court scheduled March 2 new hearings in
one Kirch damage suit for April 18 and May 2. In the second case
pending at that court, no hearings have been scheduled,
according to court spokesman Wilhem Schneider. &lt;/p&gt;

a grossly negligent due diligence analysis of Sino-Forest&#8217;s
business operations that did not analyze the substantial risks
of holding a near-billion-dollar investment in a forestry
company based in China,&#8221; Culverhouse said in his complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sino-Forest&#8217;s shares dropped more than 80 percent in June
when Carson Block&#8217;s Muddy Waters LLC said the Hong Kong-based
company overstated its timber holdings. Sino-Forest denied the
allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson  Co., based in New York, told clients in a June
letter that it lost C$462 million since the end of May on its
Sino-Forest investment. The hedge fund had held 31 million
shares of Sino-Forest in May, or 12.5 percent of outstanding
stock, and had sold its entire stake as of June 17, according to
the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lawsuit filed by Hugh Culverhouse against Paulson 
Co. is without merit,&#8221; the company said in a statement. &#8220;As in
all our investments, Paulson has access to the same information
that everyone else in the securities markets does. Like other
public market investors, we must rely on audits and underwriter
due diligence for comfort that financial statements and
disclosures are accurate and reflect the true state of affairs
at companies with publicly traded securities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Culverhouse v. Paulson  Co., 12-cf-20695, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Florida (Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Stewart, who JPMorgan (JPM) Chase 
Co. picked last year to oversee a unit of traders being moved
out of its investment bank, has left to start a hedge fund,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stewart, 38, and a team of at least four other JPMorgan
traders have founded Whard Stewart Asset Management Ltd., said
the people, who declined to be identified because the bank
hasn&#8217;t announced his departure. JPMorgan picked the London-based
Stewart in February 2011 to oversee a team of about 50 traders
it was transferring to an asset-management division to comply
with new U.S. rules that restrict banks from betting on markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stewart joins a growing group of traders who have left
firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Citigroup Corp. and
Morgan Stanley (MS) as banks reduce risk in the face of greater
regulation after the financial crisis of 2008. The U.S. in 2010
approved the so-called Volcker rule, which was named after
former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, to curtail banks
from using their own capital to make wagers on stocks and bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase spokesman declined to comment. Stewart
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, planned to
comply with the Volcker rule by raising capital from outside
investors for Stewart and other traders in the asset-management
unit. The Volcker provision hasn&#8217;t yet taken effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stewart had been co-head of New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s
global emerging markets business. Whard Stewart will focus on
investing in emerging markets, said the people. JPMorgan
employees who have joined Stewart at his new hedge fund include
Alexis Hombrecher, Darrell Tonge, Robert Gilraine and Matthew Haydon, according to a Jan. 17 filing with the U.K.&#8217;s Companies
House. JPMorgan has no plans to invest in Whard Stewart, one of
the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dodd-Frank Act &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported Stewart&#8217;s plans earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprietary traders who remain at JPMorgan include Deepak Gulati, who leads stock investing, and Fahad Roumani, who heads
investments in credit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders have been leaving banks to start or join hedge
funds since U.S. lawmakers approved the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010.
The law, which includes the Volcker provision, increased
oversight of Wall Street in response to the worst economic slump
since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sutesh Sharma, who led a proprietary-trading desk at New
York-based Citigroup, is starting a hedge fund in London called
Portman Square Capital LLP. Pierre-Henri Flamand stepped down in
2010 as head of a unit at New York-based Goldman Sachs that
traded equities to form Edoma Partners LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers started more than 1,100 hedge funds in 2011,
the second-highest annual total, according to Singapore-based
data provider Eurekahedge Pte. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KDB Financial Group Inc. (KDBGRPZ) hired seven
brokerages, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Samsung
Securities Co., as preferred bidders to arrange its initial
public share sale as the government privatizes the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDB, South Korea&#8217;s largest state-run banking group, will
hold talks with Goldman Sachs and Samsung Securities to become
lead arrangers, the Seoul-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. KDB plans to hold the IPO by October, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korean President Lee Myung Bak&#8217;s 2007 campaign
pledges to privatize and deregulate financial firms were
hampered last year in a second failed attempt to sell Woori
Finance Holdings Co. (053000) due to lack of investor interest. Demand
for KDB shares will hinge on pricing amid uncertainties in the
global economy, according to KTB Asset Management Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even after gains in shares this year, many local banks
are still trading below their book values,&#8221; said Im Jeong Jae,
a Seoul-based fund manager at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $28 billion. &#8220;For a state
lender like KDB, the government will own the bulk of the bank
even after the IPO and is set to hold sway on its key policies,
which should be a discount factor compared with other banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average price to book ratio of South Korea&#8217;s big four
publicly traded financial holding groups -- KB Financial Group
Inc., Woori Finance, Shinhan Financial Group Co. and Hana
Financial Group Inc. -- is 0.78, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The KRX Banks Sector Index (KRXBANK), comprised of 10 South
Korean banks, has jumped 12 percent this year, following a 31
percent drop in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preferred Bidders List &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), UBS AG (UBSN), Tong Yang Securities Inc., Korea
Investment  Securities Co. and Hyundai Securities Co. (003450), were
also named as preferred bidders to help arrange the share sale,
according to today&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said last year the nation
plans to sell part of its stake in KDB in 2012. The government
is required to offload an unspecified number of shares in the
company by May 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDB may sell more than 10 percent of the company through
the offering if market conditions are favorable, Chairman Kang Man Soo said on Feb. 22. The 10 percent is a minimum sale
requirement under South Korea&#8217;s IPO rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If KDB sells a 10 percent stake at book value, that could
make the offering worth about 2 trillion won ($1.79 billion).
That would be the biggest IPO in Korea since Samsung Life
Insurance Co. (032830) raised 4.89 trillion won in 2010, according to an
estimate by Kyobo Securities Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDB had 176 trillion won of assets as of September
including 23 trillion won of equity, according to company data
posted on its website. Profit rose 50 percent 1.06 trillion won
in the nine-month period ended September from a year earlier as
credit costs fell, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) have become top players in global commodity derivatives
trading, catching up with long-time leaders Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley. (MS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two banks tied Goldman Sachs and surpassed Morgan
Stanley in the share of clients who use them for over-the-
counter energy derivative trades, a Greenwich Associates survey
of corporate treasury officials shows. In metals derivatives,
JPMorgan dominated with a 60 percent market penetration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan and Barclays, if you think about the longer-term
trend, have gotten to the point where they&#8217;re now on a level
footing with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs,&#8221; Andrew Awad, a
Greenwich Associates consultant who helped write a report on the
findings, said yesterday in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s global commodities business, led by Blythe Masters in New York, and the Barclays&#8217;s unit run by Roger Jones
in London, have been expanding through acquisitions and hiring.
In 2010, JPMorgan bought assets from RBS Sempra, a joint venture
of Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Sempra Energy, and Barclays
hired seven salespeople from BP Plc to boost its presence in
physical oil and natural gas markets in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In energy derivatives, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan
each had 41 percent market penetration, and Morgan Stanley had
37 percent, according to the survey. Among executives who use
derivatives to hedge metals prices, 35 percent chose Barclays,
22 percent used Morgan Stanley and 21 percent did business with
Goldman Sachs. Some companies use multiple investment banks for
commodities derivatives trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deepest Relationships &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2009 Greenwich Associates survey of corporate executives,
which didn&#8217;t provide a breakdown by type of commodity, found
that 48 percent used Goldman Sachs and 43 percent did business
with Morgan Stanley, compared with 34 percent for JPMorgan and
31 percent for Barclays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank, continues to
have the deepest relationships with commodity investors, the
survey found. Sixty-three percent of commodity investors said
they do business with the firm, followed by 55 percent for
Barclays and 51 percent for JPMorgan. Morgan Stanley, whose
commodities business is led by Colin Bryce in London and Simon Greenshields in Purchase, New York, had 39 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks don&#8217;t disclose commodities-trading revenue,
instead combining the business with fixed-income and currency
trading in a single line in company reports. Some firms&#8217;
quarterly filings break out gains and losses from principal
transactions and market-making by product type, which exclude
interest income and interest expense. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S.
bank by assets, earned $2.82 billion from commodities in 2011
and Goldman Sachs made $1.59 billion, those disclosures showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commodity Investors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isabelle Ealet, who ran Goldman Sachs&#8217;s commodities
business since 2007, was promoted at the end of 2011 to become
one of three co-heads of global sales and trading. Commodities
trading at Goldman Sachs is led by Gregory A. Agran in New York
and Magid N. Shenouda in London, while the global commodity
sales effort is supervised by London-based L. Peter O&#8217;Hagan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was ranked first in the U.S. for both market share
and service quality by corporate treasury officials who use
energy derivatives, according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although European energy companies said they do more
business with London-based Barclays than its rivals, they
selected Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, both based in New
York, as the top banks for service quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the survey results, as did Mary Claire Delaney at
Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan&#8217;s Jennifer Zuccarelli and Seth Martin
at Barclays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quality of Service &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian energy companies were most impressed with the quality
of service from Standard Chartered Plc (STAN), a London-based bank that
does most of its business in Asia, even as Morgan Stanley,
Goldman Sachs and New York-based JPMorgan had the biggest market
penetration, according to the survey. The number of corporate
clients in Asia who said they trade energy derivatives with
Standard Chartered doubled from 2010 to 2011, Awad said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty amazing for them, actually,&#8221; Awad said of
Standard Chartered&#8217;s performance. &#8220;They had massive, massive
gains in Asia both in terms of footprint and in terms of the
feedback we get for them on a quality basis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenwich Associates conducted the survey between September
and November and released it yesterday. The Stamford,
Connecticut-based firm said it interviewed 268 treasury
officials at companies that hedge exposure to energy derivatives
using over-the-counter derivatives and 97 that hedge metals
exposure. It also interviewed 71 commodities investors that use
over-the-counter derivatives, including pension funds, hedge
funds and banks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) had the
biggest secondary-market share among primary dealers in
Hungarian government debt last year, the Debt Management Agency
said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) held the biggest share of
the primary market in bonds and ING Groep NV (INGA)&#8217;s unit took the
most in treasury bill sales, the agency, known as AKK, said in
an e-mailed statement today. Citigroup Inc. (C) was the primary
dealer that increased its market share the most dynamically, the
agency said, without giving a breakdown of market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary dealers have the exclusive right to take part in
government debt auctions. The agency sold 6.477 trillion forint
($29 billion) in debt last year, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hungary, the most indebted eastern European member of the
European Union, plans to finance itself &#8220;completely&#8221; from the
market this year, the AKK said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He bows, he sways, he&#8217;s No. 9 on the
Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and last night he danced with
students of the School of American Ballet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Koch, 71, showed off his moves at the school&#8217;s annual
benefit, which transformed the promenade of the David H. Koch
Theater (named following his $100 million donation) into a
Russian Winter Ball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beef Stroganoff, sweet and tangy shredded beets and shots
of vodka were on the menu by Glorious Food. The music was all-
American: on DJ Coleman Feltes&#8217;s playlist were Michael Jackson&#8217;s
&#8220;Beat It,&#8221; Journey&#8217;s &#8220;Don&#8217;t Stop Believing&#8221; and Deee-Lite&#8217;s
&#8220;Groove Is in the Heart,&#8221; in that order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koch&#8217;s wife, Julia, had the idea for the theme, a nod to
the school&#8217;s founder, George Balanchine. She wore a dress with
fur trim; her husband wore a coordinating tuxedo featuring a
maroon velvet jacket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander Navab of KKR  Co. (KKR), Chelsea Clinton, a new NBC
News correspondent, Joseph DiMenna of Zweig-DiMenna Associates
and about 400 others supped at long tables covered in red
brocade, decorated with tall crystal candelabras and bouquets of
red and pink roses, all selected by Ron Wendt Design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event raised almost $1 million for the school, where 70
percent of the advanced students receive scholarships, said
executive director Marjorie Van Dercook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russian Hooligans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nightclub-style dancing came after 28 advanced students
performed a high-energy number depicting Russian hooligans, set
to original music by Debauche, a &#8220;Russian Mafia Band,&#8221; as it
bills itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school&#8217;s artistic director, New York City Ballet Master
in Chief Peter Martins, recruited former NYCB principal and Tony
nominee Melinda Roy to choreograph the performance with
assistance from Chad Luke Schiro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show got Koch right out of his gold seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You were great,&#8221; he exclaimed to student Claire von Enck
as the music swelled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were quieter earlier in the evening at the New York
Public Library&#8217;s President&#8217;s Council Spring Dinner, where Third
Point founder Daniel Loeb asked Walter Isaacson if he was
working on an update of his biography of Steve Jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaacson told Loeb he&#8217;d consider an update, but is already
absorbed by a new book project about digital innovators,
starting with Ada Byron Lovelace, poet Lord Byron&#8217;s daughter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Algorithm &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovelace wrote an algorithm that could be applied to make
patterns on fabrics, Isaacson, the event&#8217;s featured speaker,
said. He learned about Lovelace when his daughter Betsy, now a
senior at Harvard, wrote a high-school paper on her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he&#8217;s pitching the book today to his editor Alice
Mayhew at Simon  Schuster (CBS), and in two weeks, is going to
Bodleian, Oxford University&#8217;s main research library, to read
Lovelace&#8217;s letters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another guest asked Isaacson what he thought of Apple&#8217;s
future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting the imminent release of the iPad 3, Isaacson said he
thought the team Jobs had put in place would run Apple well for
the next four or five years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s is frozen out of
the commercial-mortgage bond market by the biggest underwriters
after derailing a $1.5 billion sale by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
and Citigroup Inc. last July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, those banks along with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley have bypassed SP&#8217;s credit
ratings as they issued $11.3 billion of debt linked to
skyscrapers, shopping malls and hotels, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. They&#8217;re turning to Kroll Bond Ratings
Inc. and Morningstar Inc. (MORN) after SP, the world&#8217;s largest credit-
rating company, forced bankers to pull an offering they&#8217;d
already committed to sell, roiling the $600 billion market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;SP no doubt suffered an extraordinary loss of
credibility in this area that will take time and some
restructuring to repair,&#8221; said Chris Sullivan, who oversees
$1.9 billion as chief investment officer at United Nations
Federal Credit Union. &#8220;It utterly surprised people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks and investors are demonstrating the
possibility of competition in the ratings business, even as
regulators struggle to break SP, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and
Fitch Ratings&#8217; stranglehold on other bond markets. Four years
after the three firms were blamed by regulators for fueling the
financial bubble by inflating their grades for toxic mortgage
securities, they provide 97 percent of all credit ratings, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said in a September report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Ultimate Success&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Sweeney, a spokesman for SP, said the New York-based
company&#8217;s CMBS analysts weren&#8217;t available to discuss the
situation. &#8220;We believe our ultimate success will be based on
the value investors derive from the ratings and research,&#8221; he
said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranking structured products such as CMBS and collateralized
debt obligations is one of the most lucrative areas for rating
firms. They generally charge between $1 million and $2 million
to grade a CMBS deal, which are bundled loans tied to commercial
properties sliced into securities of varying risk, according to
a September paper by Andrew Cohen, a researcher at the Federal
Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of an SP rating isn&#8217;t hurting issuers. Deutsche
Bank priced the safest portion of a CMBS deal last week ranked
AAA by Fitch and Moody&#8217;s to yield 110 basis points, or 1.1
percentage points, more than the benchmark swap rate, the
tightest spread since May. Banks are forecasting as much as $45
billion of sales this year, up from $28 billion in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one-third of investors polled in a Deutsche Bank
survey said they preferred deals without an SP ranking, the
Frankfurt-based lender said in a Feb. 27 report. About 15
percent said they look forward to those rated by the new
entrants. More than half said the rating companies didn&#8217;t play a
role in their investment decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pulled Ratings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP (MHP)&#8217;s decision to pull its ratings on the $1.5 billion
offering in July interrupted the market&#8217;s recovery after
issuance seized up in 2008. A record $232.5 billion was sold in
2007 before losses on home-loan securities froze credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP withdrew rankings on the deal on July 27 and
temporarily stopped rating new commercial-mortgage bonds, saying
it had to review a potential conflict in its model. The
following month, it said it would resume grading deals and that
the conflict had turned out not to be significant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks were forced to cancel the transaction five days
after it was placed with investors. Goldman Sachs reimbursed
buyers for losses they incurred when the deal was withdrawn,
people familiar with the transaction said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley analyst Richard Parkus called the event
&#8220;unprecedented,&#8221; and said that it &#8220;severely eroded&#8221; investor
and issuer confidence in SP&#8217;s ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Charlie Brown&#8217;s Football &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You look to rating companies for predictability and a
degree of certainty,&#8221; said Patrick Sargent, a partner at law
firm Andrews Kurth LLP in Dallas. &#8220;It was like Lucy pulling the
ball away from Charlie Brown.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn&#8217;t the first time SP riled investors and banks in
the CMBS market. It downgraded dozens of top-ranked bonds in
2009, excluding them from the Federal Reserve&#8217;s $1 trillion Term
Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility designed to cleanse bank
balance sheets and jumpstart lending. They backtracked on some
of the securities a week after reducing them to BBB-, the lowest
investment-grade ranking, saying there had been an adjustment on
the assumptions on the timing of losses on the mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Inconsistent Approach&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors still hold a grudge, according to Darrell Wheeler, a commercial-mortgage debt strategist at Amherst
Securities Group LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given their inconsistent approach to ratings and an
unreceptive investor audience, it is difficult to see the upside
for an issuer including SP in a deal,&#8221; Wheeler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after SP antagonized CMBS bankers, it downgraded
the U.S., setting off a stock-market swoon and drawing criticism
from President Barack Obama. Treasury yields then fell to record
lows. The company later sent, then retracted, an erroneous
message suggesting France had been downgraded. The backlash may
have prompted parent company McGraw-Hill Cos.&#8217;s decision to
replace the unit&#8217;s top executive, according to Peter Appert, an
analyst at Piper Jaffray  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve had a series of miscues,&#8221; Appert, who&#8217;s based in
San Francisco, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Under their new
leadership, they&#8217;re taking some significant and proactive steps
to address these issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGraw-Hill fell 0.5 percent to $46.15 at 9:44 a.m. in New
York. It&#8217;s up about 3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New President &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP announced it had hired Douglas Peterson, a former
Citigroup executive, as president, in August, and in December,
he replaced David Jacob, head of structured finance, and
reassigned Mark Adelson, chief credit officer, to a research
role with less responsibility. The two had been involved in the
decision to withdraw the CMBS ratings, according to three people
familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified because
the deliberations were private. Barbara Duka, who was in charge
of CMBS ratings at the time of the July deal, was removed from
her position this year, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street has issued 10 so-called CMBS conduit deals
since the review, none of which have been ranked by SP. The
firm&#8217;s market share plummeted to 26 percent of last year&#8217;s deals
from 43 percent in 2010, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert,
a newsletter. Morningstar picked up some of the business, rating
30 percent of deals, while Kroll evaluated 14 percent. Goldman
Sachs and Citigroup resuscitated the pulled deal in September
with ratings from Moody&#8217;s, Fitch and Morningstar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t think we would get on as many transactions as
we did last year,&#8221; Eric Thompson, Kroll&#8217;s head of CMBS in New
York, said in a telephone interview in February. &#8220;We view it as
an indicator of folks in the marketplace looking for a fresh
voice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or
Socar, will pay for Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Swiss unit with $200
million out of the $500 million raised in Eurobonds last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socar will use the assets of Esso Schweiz to help pay off
debt, Vice President for Economic Affairs Suleyman Qasimov said
by e-mail today. He gave no further details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the $500 million received from the Eurobond sale, $133
million will be used to buy a 10 percent share in Turkey&#8217;s
Petkim Petrokimya Holding AS (PETKM), private Azeri news agency Trend
said yesterday, citing an unnamed Socar official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining $166 million will be used to repay some of
Socar&#8217;s foreign debts, including $133 million to BNP Paribas and
$33 million to Yapi Kredi Bank, the official said, according to
Trend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Mets owners have to
give up as much as $83 million in illegal profits from Bernard
Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme and face a trial over another $303 million
of their own money to determine if they acted in bad faith, a
judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff refused yesterday to dismiss
the suit as baseball team owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz had
asked. Rakoff ruled that Madoff trustee Irving Picard can claim
as much as $83.3 million without a trial. Picard seeks another
$303 million, and must prove to a jury that the Mets owners and
other defendants were &#8220;willfully blind&#8221; to the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court remains skeptical that the trustee can
ultimately rebut the defendants&#8217; showing of good faith, let
along impute bad faith to all the defendants,&#8221; Rakoff said in
his ruling in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. &#8220;The principal
issue remaining for trial is whether the defendants acted in
good faith when they invested in Madoff securities in the two
years prior to bankruptcy or whether, by contrast, they
willfully blinded themselves to Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial is set to start March 19 in Manhattan court. The
fraud cost investors an estimated $20 billion in principal,
Picard has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his suit, Picard tried to show the Mets owners blinded
themselves to Madoff&#8217;s fraud because it benefited their
businesses, ranging from the team to real estate. Wilpon and
Katz countered by saying they trusted their money manager. Both
sides presented conclusions disguised as facts, Rakoff said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury will be asked to decide whether Picard can take
back principal the defendants withdrew from Madoff&#8217;s firm over
two years or transferred to others, and what the status of their
claims against the Madoff estate should be, Rakoff said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff last year threw out most of Picard&#8217;s $1 billion
lawsuit against the owners, saying Picard could pursue only $386
million at trial. Yesterday he said Picard he would rule later
on how much of the $83.3 million Picard can claim without trial.
The sum represents fictitious profit got from the Ponzi scheme
in the two years before the con man&#8217;s 2008 arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Newman, a Mets spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately respond
to an e-mail asking if the team owners would appeal Rakoff&#8217;s
eventual decision on the profit. Amanda Remus, a Picard
spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Katz, 11-cv-03605, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Madoff-Related Lawsuit Should Be Dismissed, BNY Mellon Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. asked a court to dismiss a
lawsuit filed on behalf of three funds that accused the company
of negligence relating to Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lawsuit filed in New York State Supreme Court in
December, the so-called Rye funds accused the bank and its BNY
Alternative Investment Services unit, which served as fund
administrator, of acting with &#8220;gross negligence&#8221; and helping
funnel billions of dollars into Madoff&#8217;s scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon provided &#8220;purely administrative services&#8221; for
the funds, such as mailing account statements, processing
customer subscriptions and calculating each fund&#8217;s net asset
value, the bank said in court documents filed March 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BNY Mellon had no role whatsoever in selecting the Rye
Funds&#8217; investments, monitoring those investments, recommending
new or different investments or determining whether investments
were suitable (or, indeed, fraudulent,)&#8221; the New York-based
bank said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Plaintiffs&#8217; State and Securities Law Settlement
Class Counsel on Behalf of the State Law Subclass and the
Securities Subclass in &#8220;In re Tremont Securities Law, State Law
and Insurance Litigation&#8221; v. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK),
653415/2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lawyer Who Spotted Broker Fraud Rewarded With 5-Year SEC Ordeal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Theodore Urban, general counsel at Ferris, Baker Watts
Inc., spotted and questioned a broker&#8217;s suspicious trading
patterns in 2007, he triggered a five-year probe by U.S.
regulators who said he failed as a supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began its
investigation, Urban, who had worked at the SEC and U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission before joining the broker-
dealer, said he had urged senior executives to fire the broker.
Even though an administrative law judge exonerated him, his
ordeal didn&#8217;t end until Jan. 26, when the full commission
dismissed the matter without an opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dropping the case, the commissioners didn&#8217;t explain when
a compliance officer or in-house counsel at a broker-dealer or
investment adviser becomes a supervisor liable for an employee&#8217;s
actions. Without knowing where their responsibilities lie,
compliance officers and in-house lawyers may be reluctant to
report wrongdoing when they find it, Bloomberg News&#8217; Ellen Rosen
reports. SEC Commissioner Daniel Gallagher addressed what he
called this &#8220;dangerous dilemma&#8221; last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Robust engagement on the part of legal and compliance
personnel raises the specter that such personnel could be deemed
to be &#8216;supervisors&#8217; subject to liability for violations of law
by the employees they are held to be supervising,&#8221; he said in a
speech in Washington on Feb. 24. The SEC, he said in a phone
interview Feb. 29, needs to offer guidance so that those
overseeing compliance &#8220;won&#8217;t be afraid to be zealous because
they&#8217;ll be tagged as a supervisor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administrative proceeding was In the Matter of Urban,

&lt;h2&gt;Assured Guaranty MBS Suit Against UBS Moved to U.S. Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assured Guaranty Ltd.&#8217;s (AGO) lawsuit against a UBS (UBS) AG unit
accusing the company of failing to meet obligations related to
the pooling of residential mortgage-backed securities was moved
to federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan on Feb. 2, was moved to U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York, according to documents filed
ydesteray in state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp., a New York-based unit of
the Hamilton, Bermuda-based insurer, accused Wilmington,
Delaware-based UBS Real Estate Securities Inc. of failing to
abide by obligations under pooling and servicing agreements
related to residential mortgage-backed securities sold in three
offerings in 2006 and 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS said Assured Guaranty is a &#8220;sophisticated market
participant&#8221; and understood the risks it was taking when it
agreed to insure about $1.5 billion in securities backed by
&#8220;high-risk mortgages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. v. UBS Real
Estate Securities Inc., 650327/2012, New York state Supreme
Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Activision Wins Ruling on 1 of 2 Ex-Executives&#8217; Fraud Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI), the No. 1 U.S. publisher of video
games, won dismissal of one of two fraud claims in its
litigation against the former heads of its Infinity Ward studio,
whom the company fired in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle in Los Angeles
agreed yesterday with Activision that a fraudulent-inducement
claim made by Jason West and Vincent Zampella, creators of the
blockbuster game &#8220;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,&#8221; shouldn&#8217;t
go forward. He let stand a claim for promissory fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West and Zampella said that they were considering leaving
Activision when their contracts expired in October 2008. They
alleged that Activision made false promises to string them along
and create &#8220;Modern Warfare 2,&#8221; which became the bestselling
game of 2010, before firing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very pleased,&#8221; Robert Schwartz, a lawyer for West
and Zampella, said after the hearing. &#8220;The judge ruled there is
admissible evidence, including from a senior executive, that
Activision never intended to honor the contract.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former executives added the fraud claims to a 2010
breach-of-contract and wrongful-termination suit in which they
alleged that Activision, based in Santa Monica, California,
fired them to avoid paying millions of dollars in royalties for
the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activision maintains they were fired because they were in
talks with rival Electronic Arts Inc. to set up a new
development studio while they still had two years left on their
contracts with Activision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All in all it was a very good day for Activision,&#8221; Steve
Marenberg, a lawyer for the company, said after the hearing.
&#8220;When the judge reached the substance of our claims, he ruled
for us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining fraud claim by West and Zampella survived
only because &#8220;peculiarities of the California summary judgment
procedure,&#8221; Marenberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trial is scheduled for May 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is West v. Activision, SC107041, California
Superior Court (Los Angeles County). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Files Formal Request With New Zealand to Extradite Dotcom &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has formally asked New Zealand to
extradite Megaupload.com founder Kim Dotcom, who was indicted in
Virginia on charges of involvement in the country&#8217;s biggest
copyright infringement conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extradition papers for Dotcom; Finn Batato, the chief
marketing officer at Megaupload; Mathias Ortmann, co-founder and
director of the file-sharing website; and Bram van der Kolk, who
oversaw programming at the website, were received at the North
Shore District Court near Auckland on March 2, said Magila
Annandale, a New Zealand Ministry of Justice spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom ran a &#8220;Mega Conspiracy,&#8221; U.S. prosecutors said in
a Feb. 17 revised indictment filed in a court in Alexandria,
Virginia, accusing him of generating more than $175 million in
criminal proceeds from the exchange of pirated film, music, book
and software files. He faces as long as 20 years in prison for
each of the racketeering and money-laundering charges in the
indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. extradition papers weren&#8217;t immediately available
from the North Shore District Court. A judge has to approve
requests from people not involved in the case for access to
files after receiving a written application and obtaining views
of all parties in the matter, Annandale said in an e-mail
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom, 38, was also charged in the U.S. with five counts
of criminal copyright infringement and five counts of wire
fraud. The defendant, who legally changed his family name from
Schmitz, has denied any criminal misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was released from jail on Feb. 22 over objections from
the U.S., after Judge N.R. Dawson ruled he wasn&#8217;t a flight risk.
Dotcom is restricted to his rented $18 million mansion and
subject to electronic monitoring, according to the bail
conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extradition hearing has been scheduled for Aug. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Okada Manila Tour Is Defining Moment as Wynn Goes &#8216;Nuclear&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Wynn stepped off his private jet at Manila airport
in June 2010 to be greeted by the Philippines gaming regulator.
On the tarmac too, in black wraparound sunglasses and trademark
1950s-style slicked-back hair, was Japanese slot-machine
billionaire Kazuo Okada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okada, 69, wanted the chief executive officer of Wynn
Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) to join his $2 billion casino and hotel project on
Manila Bay. Wynn, companion Andrea Hissom and Wynn Resorts Chief
Operating Officer Marc Schorr toured a hotel, shopping mall and
casino showcasing Manila&#8217;s investment potential, and sat through
a presentation on the new project in an air-conditioned marquee,
photographs of the trip show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That visit proved pivotal for Okada&#8217;s ambition to create an
Asian casino empire -- only not as he&#8217;d hoped, according to an
interview last week detailing how his 12-year alliance with Wynn
went sour. Philippines regulator Efraim Genuino was indicted in
an ongoing graft case. By the fall, Wynn was focusing on Okada&#8217;s
Philippines activities, court documents show, removing him as
vice chairman last year and forcibly buying his $2.77 billion
stake last month at a 30 percent discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During three hours at his 36th-floor office in Hong Kong&#8217;s
Tsim Sha Tsui district, Okada laid out his version of the split
with Wynn, whose business he helped revive with funding in 2000,
Bloomberg News&#8217; Vinicy Chan and Kana Nishizawa report. It&#8217;s a
story at odds with the 47-page report Wynn commissioned from
Louis J. Freeh, a former director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation, which catalogs more than $110,000 in hotel rooms,
meals and gifts for gaming officials and their associates that
Wynn&#8217;s lawyers said may have breached U.S. anti-graft laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They gave the board the report without letting me review
it,&#8221; said Okada, founder of Tokyo-based Universal Entertainment
Corp. (6425) &#8220;Even criminals would be asked to sign off on the
findings to ensure there are no mistakes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boardroom scrap at Las Vegas-based Wynn Resorts shows
the dilemma U.S. companies face when seeking growth in Asia,
where a broader acceptance of gift giving and hospitality
conflicts with the tightening anti-bribery regime at home. Wynn
Resorts alleges Okada misused its assets, name and know-how to
promote himself, even though Wynn had decided to stay out of the
Philippines, and that his actions put the company&#8217;s gambling
licenses at risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeh briefed Wynn Resorts&#8217; director on his findings Feb.
18, and on the same day they judged Okada to be an &#8220;unsuitable
person,&#8221; invoking a clause in the articles of incorporation to
redeem the 20 percent stake that made him the company&#8217;s biggest
shareholder. Okada said he&#8217;s gathering evidence to show the
report was riddled with errors and exaggerated standard industry
practice as a pretext to eliminate a man Wynn, 70, had come to
regard as a threat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UBS, JPMorgan Print-Room Data Used in U.K. Insider-Trading Ring &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven people made more than 1 million pounds ($1.5 million)
profit by trading on information taken from the print rooms for
UBS AG (UBSN) and JP Morgan Chase  Co. (JPM), a lawyer for the Financial
Services Authority said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside information obtained by brothers Ersin Mustafa and
Ali Mustafa who worked at the firms&#8217; print rooms was used by
five others to place trades through Mitesh Shah, who was a
broker at Finspreads, now called City Index Ltd., said Michael
Bowes, a lawyer for the prosecution. The men bet on six
companies, including Biffa Group Ltd. and Premier Oil Plc.,
between May 2006 and 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They were what could be described as day-traders,&#8221; Bowes
told a London court. They used multiple accounts &#8220;as a way of
seeking to distract from attention.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA filed charges in the case, known as Saturn, in 2010
after a 21-month investigation, which employed around 25 lawyers
and investigators probing 130 trading accounts. The regulator
has led a crackdown on market abuse, fining David Einhorn and
Greenlight Capital Inc. 7.2 million pounds in January for
trading on inside information in Punch Taverns Plc (PUB) in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants in the Saturn case were either family
members or friends, and were able to coordinate their actions,
Bowes said. Executives at the banks weren&#8217;t involved in the
ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &#8220;no allegation whatsoever that anyone&#8221; at
JPMorgan or UBS did anything wrong, Bowes said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stanford Fraud Trial Jury Ordered to Resume Deliberations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury in R. Allen Stanford&#8217;s fraud trial was ordered by
the judge to return to deliberations after the panel sent a note
saying it couldn&#8217;t reach a unanimous verdict in its fourth day
of reviewing the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight men and four women on the jury told U.S. District
Judge David Hittner in Houston yesterday they were &#8220;unable to
reach a verdict on each of the 14 counts,&#8221; the judge said,
reading their note to attorneys for both sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hittner instructed jurors to &#8220;continue your deliberations
in this case,&#8221; telling them the trial has been costly in terms
of both time and money, that the lawyers were unlikely going to
be able to put on a better trial and that another jury was
unlikely to be more conscientious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, is accused of leading a $7 billion
international fraud scheme involving the sale of certificates of
deposit issued by his Antigua-based bank. He faces as long as 20
years in prison if found guilty of the most severe charges, mail
fraud and wire fraud. The financier maintains he is not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jury selection in the case began Jan. 23 and the panel
heard five weeks of evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government presented testimony from investors who
bought the allegedly fraudulent CDs as well as from the
executives who helped sell them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense presented former Stanford employees who said
they saw no evidence of fraud at the company. Some offered
testimony in support of the defense&#8217;s contention that Stanford
was an absentee visionary who left the details of running his
operation to Davis. Stanford didn&#8217;t testify during the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Corporate Human Rights Case Expanded by U.S. Supreme Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court ordered a second round of arguments
in a case that might shield multinational companies, including
Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), from accusations they played a role in
human-rights abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday expanded their review of a lawsuit
that claims Shell units were complicit in torture and execution
in Nigeria in the 1990s. The court said it will now consider
whether the two-century-old Alien Tort Statute can be invoked
for alleged wrongdoing that occurs beyond the U.S. borders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multinational companies have faced dozens of suits accusing
them of playing a role in human rights violations, environmental
misconduct and labor abuses. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Coca-Cola Co. (KO),
Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Unocal Corp (UCL)., Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Ford Motor Co. (F) have
all been sued under either the Alien Tort Statute or a related
law, known as the Torture Victim Protection Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they heard arguments in the Shell case last week, the
justices focused on whether the Alien Tort Statute allowed suits
against corporations. Several justices, including Samuel Alito,
suggested during the argument that they were more interested in
considering whether the law could be applied overseas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s briefing schedule means the new argument will
take place during the nine-month term that starts in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Kiobel v. Shell Petroleum, 10-1491, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Challenges Judge Ruling on Cigarette Graphic Warnings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government appealed a federal judge&#8217;s ruling
throwing out requirements for graphic warning labels regarding
the health risks of cigarettes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration filed a notice of appeal
yesterday in U.S. District Court in Washington seeking to
overturn Judge Richard Leon&#8217;s Feb. 29 decision that the
government&#8217;s rule violates the tobacco companies&#8217; rights to free
speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington is scheduled to
hear arguments next month on the government&#8217;s challenge to a
ruling Leon issued in November that canceled a Sept. 22 deadline
for tobacco companies to begin displaying images such as
diseased lungs and a cadaver with chest staples on an autopsy
table on the top half of the front and back of all cigarette
packages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the three-judge panel will consider
yesterday&#8217;s appeal on April 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorillard Inc. (LO), Reynolds American Inc. (RAI)&#8217;s R.J. Reynolds
unit, Commonwealth Brands Inc., Liggett Group LLC and Santa Fe
Natural Tobacco Co. sued the FDA in August, claiming its
mandates for cigarette packages, cartons and advertising violate
the First Amendment. The companies said in court papers that it
would cost them a total of about $20 million to meet the 2012
deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphics were supposed to cover the top half of the
front and back of cigarette packages and 20 percent of print
advertisements. The FDA estimated the visual warnings would help
lower the smoking rate by about 0.212 percentage points, Leon
wrote in his opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, 11-cv-1482, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Carbon Traders Stole Millions in Tax Fraud, Prosecutor Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven carbon-credit traders used a &#8220;carefully organized
plan&#8221; to commit tax fraud worth about 40 million pounds ($63.4
million), prosecutors said at the start of a London trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group are accused of using a series of companies
registered under the European Union carbon-credits trading
program to fraudulently claim Value Added Tax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 25 people were arrested in Germany and the U.K
during a 2010 crackdown on tax fraud in the $121 billion-a-year
European carbon-trading industry. About 1,000 companies are
registered in the EU, U.K. prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The scale of it was quite extraordinary,&#8221; said Michael
Parroy, a prosecution lawyer. &#8220;They helped themselves to 38
million pounds worth of VAT in the space of three-and-a-half
months&#8221; in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traders imported emissions credits tax free from
Europe, passed them through a series of intermediary companies
and sold them to buyers including BP Plc (BP/), Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Morgan Stanley (MS), Parroy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said 29-year-old Sandeep Singh Dosanjh, from
Gravesend, made the most from the fraud and used the proceeds to
buy luxury cars and property in London&#8217;s exclusive Notting Hill
neighborhood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also accused are Dhanvinder Basra, Navdeep Singh Gill,
Sandeep Harry, Pritpal Singh, Ranjot Chahal and Kernjit Dhillon,
who are connected by family or friendship to Dosanjh, Parroy
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the traders will present their defense later in
the trial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AmEx Transfers Didn&#8217;t Aid Hezbollah in Attacks, Court Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express Bank Ltd. isn&#8217;t liable for Hezbollah
rockets attacks on Israel in 2006 because of financial
transactions, an appeals court ruled, affirming a lower court&#8217;s
dismissal of a suit brought by families of U.S., Israeli and
Canadian victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal appeals court in New York, yesterday affirmed a
2010 U.S. District Judge George Daniels&#8217;s dismissal of a
negligence claim against American Express. The plaintiffs
&#8220;failed plausibly to allege that AmEx&#8217;s conduct was the
proximate cause of the plaintiffs&#8217; injuries,&#8221; the appeals court
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victims and family members alleged that New York-based
American Express and Lebanese Canadian Bank helped the terrorist
group attack targets in northern Israel in July and August 2006
by handling wire transfers of millions of U.S. dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court said it may later review claims of
personal jurisdiction against Lebanese Canadian Bank, a Beirut-
based lender that merged with Societe Generale Lebanon last
year. Daniels dismissed the claims saying he didn&#8217;t have
jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, relatives of American, Israeli and Canadian
citizens in Israel, alleged that Lebanese Canadian bank, which
had no branches, offices or employees in the U.S., &#8220;knowingly
maintained&#8221; bank accounts of alleged Hezbollah affiliates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court said it will seek a determination from
the New York Court of Appeals, the state&#8217;s highest court, on
whether the plaintiffs&#8217; claims for negligence and breach of duty
can be applied to a foreign bank&#8217;s maintenance of correspondence
under New York law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circuit is awaiting a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a
case in which Royal Dutch Shell Plc argues it can&#8217;t be sued by
Nigerians seeking damages from torture and murders committed by
their government in the early 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case, Kiobel v.
Shell Petroleum on Feb. 28. A decision may be issued this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Should the Supreme Court reverse our decision in Kiobel,
and the Court of Appeals indicate that we have personal
jurisdiction over the Lebanese Canadian Bank in this case, the
Alien Tort statute claims will likely require further
proceedings in the district court,&#8221; the panel of appeals judges
ruled yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, 10-1306, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (New York). The U.S.
Supreme Court case is Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.,
10-1491, U.S. Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook Claimant to Be Represented by Milberg Law Firm &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Ceglia, who claims a 2003 contract with Facebook Inc. (FB)
co-founder Mark Zuckerberg gave him half the company, hired
Milberg LLP (1401L) to represent him in his federal lawsuit against the
world&#8217;s biggest social network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move, made public in filings yesterday in federal court
in Buffalo, New York, follows the hiring and departure of
several firms from Ceglia&#8217;s legal team since he sued in June
2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milberg, a 71-lawyer firm based in New York, is known for
representing investors and consumers in class actions, or group
lawsuits. Formerly Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes  Lerach LLP,
Milberg was the biggest firm representing shareholders in
securities fraud suits against companies before it split in two
in 2004 amid a U.S. investigation that sent four former partners
to prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milberg recovered $137.5 million in shareholder suit
settlements in 2010, the most recent year for which data is
available, according to Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.,
which tracks the settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their participation speaks to the strength of Paul&#8217;s
case, now that defendants will not be able to dismiss it on
their empty claims of fraud,&#8221; Dean Boland, a Lakewood, Ohio,
lawyer who represents Ceglia, said in a text message yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, accuses Ceglia
of fabricating the contract and has called his suit a fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orin Snyder, a Facebook lawyer, didn&#8217;t immediately return a
phone message seeking comment on the hiring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ceglia v. Zuckerberg, 1:10-cv-00569, U.S.
District Court, Western District of New York (Buffalo). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Former U.S. Prosecutor Barkow Joins Jenner  Block Law Firm &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony S. Barkow, a former federal prosecutor and an
executive director at the New York University School of Law,
joined the Chicago-based law firm Jenner  Block LLP (1180L). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barkow, 42, is the founder of NYU&#8217;s Center on the
Administration of Criminal Law, a nonprofit advisory group on
good governmental practices in the criminal justice system,
according to its website. He was an assistant U.S. attorney in
Manhattan and Washington, prosecuting securities and commodities
fraud, terrorism and organized crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The white-collar area is extremely active, and it will
only see an increase,&#8221; Barkow said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;The firm is filled with supremely talented lawyers, and I&#8217;m
eager to be a part of it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will join the firm&#8217;s New York office as a partner in its
white-collar defense and investigations practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a federal prosecutor, Barkow assisted in the 2006
conviction of lawyer Lynne F. Stewart for providing material
support to the terrorist group of Ahmed Omar Abdel Rahman, and
helped to prosecute insider trading and securities and
accounting fraud. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virginia Long, the third woman appointed to the New Jersey
Supreme Court, has retired after reaching the age limit of 70,
the Star-Ledger of Newark, New Jersey, reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long, a liberal Democrat appointed to the state&#8217;s highest
court in 1999 by Republican Governor Christine Todd Whitman,
wrote more than 3,000 opinions, and was a consistent opponent of
the death penalty, the Star-Ledger reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, sued a unit of Johnson  Johnson, contending it
infringes its U.S. patent 5,918,590, which covers pain-relieving
heat-patch technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, is seeking unspecified damages
after a jury trial and a halt to sales of Fort Washington,
Pennsylvania-based McNeil-PPC&#8217;s Precise-brand patch, according
to a complaint filed in federal court in Delaware yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;McNeil was aware of the patent&#8221; because its number &#8220;is
clearly marked on the packaging of Thermacare, Pfizer&#8217;s
competing heat-wrap product,&#8221; Pfizer lawyers allege. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, with $67.4 billion in sales last year, also makes
Lipitor for cholesterol control. Last month, Pfizer and Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) were sued in an antitrust case in New York
alleging the drugmakers engaged in an anti-competitive scheme to
delay generic Lipitor into the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seema Kumar, a Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) spokeswoman, couldn&#8217;t
immediately comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer v. McNeil-PPC, U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WIPO Says PCT Patent Filings Up, With ZTE Corp. in the Lead &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International patent filings under a treaty administered by
a United Nations agency increased 10.7 percent over the previous
year, the World Intellectual Property Organization said in a
statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A record 181,900 applications were filed in 2011, WIPO
said. China, Japan and the U.S. accounted for 82 percent of the
increase in filings. Applications are filed under the Patent
Cooperation Treaty, which facilitates the process of seeking
patent protection in multiple countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZTE Corp. (000063), a Chinese maker of video-conferencing systems,
was the leading filer, followed, in order, by Panasonic Corp. (6752),
Huawei Technologies Co., Sharp Corp. (6753) and Robert Bosch GmbH (RBOS).
Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) was the leading U.S.-based applicant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of California and Massachusetts Institute of
Technology were among the top 100 filers, according to WIPO
data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital communications technology accounted for 7.1 percent
of the published applications, followed by electronic machinery,
medical technology and computer technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many countries were the source of hundreds or
thousands of applications, others filed very few or even no
applications, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, North Korea,
Jordan and Myanmar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Australia Said to Face WTO Complaint Over Ban on Tobacco Logos &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia may face a complaint at the World Trade
Organization over its decision to ban trademarks and logos on
tobacco products, according to two people with direct knowledge
of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, which says the plain-packaging law violates
global intellectual-property rules, will probably be lodged with
the Geneva-based trade arbiter this month, as soon as this week,
said one person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia is the first country to require identical
cigarette packaging. As of Dec. 1, 2012, cigarettes there will
have to be sold in dark brown packets, with no company logos or
images and the same font for all brands. Imperial Tobacco Group
Plc (IMP), British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) and Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) are
among companies that have challenged the law, which Australia is
extending to include cigars and loose-leaf tobacco products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law violates &#8220;several provisions&#8221; of agreements
protecting intellectual-property rights, Ukraine said at a Feb.
28 WTO meeting on the matter &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries including Chile, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican
Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Indonesia, Jordan, Mexico,
Nicaragua, Nigeria, Turkey, Zambia and Zimbabwe also say the
Australian ban breaks trade rules. They have challenged
Australia&#8217;s scientific evidence and said the law will
unnecessarily restrict commerce because the country&#8217;s public-
health goal can be met by other means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The missions of Ukraine, Zimbabwe, Mexico, Indonesia and
Nigeria in Geneva didn&#8217;t return calls or declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia said at the Feb. 28 WTO meeting that it had
&#8220;comprehensively responded to all the claims made by the
Dominican Republic and others.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule is &#8220;not anti-trade, it&#8217;s anti-cancer,&#8221;
Australian Trade Minister Craig Emerson said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday in Canberra. &#8220;It&#8217;s in the public-health
interests of the Australian people and the Gillard government
will never give up on Australia&#8217;s sovereign right to look after
the health of its people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization&#8217;s Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control, the first international treaty aimed at cutting
tobacco use, includes provisions on non-pricing measures to
lower demand, including regulations on packaging and labeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the treaty doesn&#8217;t specifically address the use of
trademarked brands or logos, it requires signatories to ensure
that packaging and labeling don&#8217;t promote a tobacco product by
&#8220;any means that are false, misleading, deceptive or likely to
create an erroneous impression about its characteristics, health
effects, hazards or emissions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said on Nov. 23 that
major tobacco companies were harassing governments including
Australia, Norway and Uruguay in a bid to overturn cigarette
package-labeling rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union is also considering plain packaging for
tobacco products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU to Decide on Future of Google Antitrust Probe Next Month &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union regulators must decide next month on the
future of their antitrust probe into Google Inc. (GOOG), the region&#8217;s
competition commissioner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joaquin Almunia said investigators still must define their
objections and clarify concerns over the world&#8217;s largest search
engine. Last year he said that the probe focused on whether the
company is a gate keeper to the Internet that can influence
users&#8217; behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Next month I will have to decide how to continue this
investigation,&#8221; Almunia said in an interview with Bloomberg HT
television. &#8220;First we have to define our objections. We need to
clarify&#8221; the concerns &#8220;after a year-and-a-half of complex
investigation. And we will communicate these to Google and we&#8217;ll
see what happens.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, is under
growing pressure from global antitrust agencies probing whether
the company is thwarting competition in the market for Web
searches. While Microsoft Corp. and partner Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) have
about a quarter of the U.S. Web-search market, Google has almost
95 percent of the traffic in Europe, Microsoft said in a blog
post last year, citing data from regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is investigating claims Google discriminated against
other services in its search results and stopped some websites
from accepting rival ads. Microsoft and shopping-comparison site
Foundem are among companies that asked for a review of Google&#8217;s
actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators should report to Almunia at the end of March
or the beginning of April on the status of the &#8220;very difficult
and complex investigation,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels, said the
company continues &#8220;to work closely and cooperatively with the
European commission to explain how our business works.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Files Formal Request With New Zealand to Extradite Dotcom &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has formally asked New Zealand to
extradite Megaupload.com founder Kim Dotcom, who was indicted in
Virginia on charges of involvement in the country&#8217;s biggest
copyright infringement conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extradition papers for Dotcom; Finn Batato, the chief
marketing officer at Megaupload; Mathias Ortmann, co-founder and
director of the file-sharing website; and Bram van der Kolk, who
oversaw programming at the website, were received at the North
Shore District Court near Auckland on March 2, said Magila
Annandale, a New Zealand Ministry of Justice spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom ran a &#8220;Mega Conspiracy,&#8221; U.S. prosecutors said in
a Feb. 17 revised indictment filed in a court in Alexandria,
Virginia, accusing him of generating more than $175 million in
criminal proceeds from the exchange of pirated film, music, book
and software files. He faces as long as 20 years in prison for
each of the racketeering and money-laundering charges in the
indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. extradition papers weren&#8217;t immediately available
from the North Shore District Court. A judge has to approve
requests from people not involved in the case for access to
files after receiving a written application and obtaining views
of all parties in the matter, Annandale said in an e-mail
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom, 38, was also charged in the U.S. with five counts
of criminal copyright infringement and five counts of wire
fraud. The defendant, who legally changed his family name from
Schmitz, has denied any criminal misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was released from jail on Feb. 22 over objections from
the U.S., after Judge N.R. Dawson ruled he wasn&#8217;t a flight risk.
Dotcom is restricted to his rented $18 million mansion and
subject to electronic monitoring, according to the bail
conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extradition hearing has been scheduled for Aug. 20. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;China Proposes Certifying Professionals as Lawyers, Xinhua Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s State Council is seeking public feedback on a
proposed law that will allow some professionals to apply to
become lawyers, Xinhua News Agency said, citing the Cabinet&#8217;s
Legislative Affairs Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionals with bachelor&#8217;s degrees and at least 15
years&#8217; experience in international trade, intellectual property
rights, finance, environmental protection, high technology,
journalism or medical accidents will be eligible under the
proposed law, the official news service reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, Chinese government regulations defined lawyers as
&#8220;state legal workers,&#8221; and were regarded as civil servants
working in legal advisory officers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took another 15 years for understanding of the legal
profession to evolve to the point at which a 1996 Chinese law
defined them as &#8220;professionals providing legal service to
society,&#8221; according to a 2003 doctoral dissertation by
Professor Ethan Michelson, a social scientist at the University
of Indiana. By the end of 2002, Beijing had no more state-owned
law offices, Michelson said in his dissertation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an essay published in 2010 by the Brookings Institution,
Michelson noted that the legal profession has grown
dramatically, from only a few thousand in 1979 to almost 150,000
by 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a survey he conducted in 2009, whose results are
published in the essay, Michelson said of the more than 2,600
who responded, 9 percent reported incomes above $73,000, with
five reporting annual incomes in excess of $1.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the lawyers who responded to his survey had only
junior-college degrees, although most had at least an
undergraduate degree. Their incomes were relative to the amount
of education they received. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecticut Treasurer Denise L. Nappier called on Walt Disney Co. (DIS) investors to oppose the
election of directors on the Nominating and Governance Committee
for ending a policy of having an independent chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is quite disturbing that Disney has chosen to embrace
a regressive policy that could impair the board&#8217;s role to
oversee executive management on behalf of shareholders,&#8221;
Nappier said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut becomes another opponent to the board&#8217;s
decision to make Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger Disney&#8217;s
chairman as well. The state, with retirement funds holding
642,000 Disney shares valued at about $27 million, joins
Institutional Shareholder Services in opposing the four members
of Disney&#8217;s nominating and governance panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS, which consults on governance issues, recommended
voting against members of the committee over the way they
decided to make the change, without consulting investors in
advance. The group also criticized CEO pay at the Burbank,
California-based company, owner of ESPN and ABC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to combine the positions was part of a
transition plan that was carefully thought out by the board,
outgoing Chairman John Pepper said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board &#8220;strongly disagrees with Ms. Nappier&#8217;s
position,&#8221; Pepper said. &#8220;Nine out of the ten directors will be
independent, including an independent lead director with duties
and responsibilities that exceed in scope those recommended by
governance advisors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 100 biggest companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index, 68 percent have a joint chairman and CEO, according to
Pepper. In a filing last week, the company cited long-term stock
gains that outperformed peers since Iger took over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.6 percent to $41.75 at the close in New York.
The stock has gained 11 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affiliates of a consumer group sued
eight drugmakers including Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and
GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), accusing the companies of illegally
offering coupons to reduce copayments for brand name drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affiliates of Boston-based Community Catalyst contend that
cutting co-pays for the drugs destroys the incentive to use
cheaper generic drugs, in a suit filed today in federal court in
Newark, New Jersey, against Merck  Co. (MRK) Identical cases were
filed in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A recent study estimated that these kickbacks will
increase health benefit providers&#8217; prescription drug costs by
$32 billion over the next 10 years,&#8221; plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer Lisa J. Rodriguez of Haddonfield, New Jersey, said in one complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also sued were Amgen Inc. (AMGN), AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), Bristol-Meyers
Squibb Co. (BMY) and Novartis AG. (NOV) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the larger cost-sharing burden being placed on
patients, Pfizer supports the use of company-sponsored programs
which help patients with out-of-pocket expenses for the
medicines prescribed by their physician,&#8221; Christopher Loder, a
Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. The company
will fight the claim, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits were filed by the AFSCME District Council 37
Health  Security Plan Trust, the Sergeants Benevolent
Association Health and Welfare Fund, the New England Carpenters
Health and Welfare Fund and the Plumbers and Pipefitters Local
572 Health and Welfare Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Health Plans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community group said in a statement the health plans,
struggling with rising costs, provide drug benefits for civilian
and uniformed municipals workers, retirees and their dependents
throughout the city of New York, plumbers from Florida to Ohio,
and carpenters throughout New England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our lawyers still have not received the brief; we won&#8217;t
comment before we&#8217;ve had an opportunity to review the brief,&#8221;
said Mary Klem, an Amgen spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Lindgreen, an AstraZeneca spokeswoman; Ron Rogers, a
spokesman for Merck; Sabrina Oei, a Novartis spokeswoman; Adelle Infante of Abbott; Laura Hortas of Bristol-Meyers; and officials
of Glaxo didn&#8217;t immediately respond to voice and e-mail messages
seeking comment on the lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the drugs named in the lawsuits are Pfizer&#8217;s
Celebrex and Lipitor, Novartis&#8217;s Diovan, Amgen&#8217;s Enbrel, Merck&#8217;s
Nasonex and Vytorin, and AstraZeneca&#8217;s Crestor and Nexium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Newark case is Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 572

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), FedEx
Corp. (FDX) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) are among 20 stocks that may be
most hurt should oil supplies dwindle, said Jonathan Golub,
chief U.S. market strategist at UBS AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auto, transportation, materials, banking and diversified
financial companies would be most affected by a supply
disruption, Golub wrote in a note today. He cited a March 4
report from UBS oil analyst Julius Walker, who outlined
scenarios related to Iran, and said Brent crude might rise to
between $130 and $270 a barrel, though he expects any increase
to be short-lived. Brent for April settlement rose 1.6 percent
to $123.90 a barrel at 12:13 p.m. New York time today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent climbed 22 percent from Oct. 4 through yesterday as
West Texas Intermediate rose 38 percent, amid improved economic
data and central-bank quantitative-easing and low-rate policies,
Golub said in the note. Concern U.S. and European sanctions
against Iran will lead to military conflict in the Persian Gulf,
home to more than half the world&#8217;s oil reserves, has also
boosted prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These stocks should lag in the event of a supply shock,&#8221;
New York-based Golub said in the note where he named the 20
stocks including Goldman and FedEx. &#8220;Energy and defensive
sectors should outperform on a relative basis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golub said that at current levels, energy prices support
continued profit growth and are consistent with his year-end
price estimate for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index of 1,475, and
his prediction for earnings per share of the gauge&#8217;s components
of $103. The SP 500 rose 0.6 percent to 1,351.52 today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low interest rates proved mightier
than concern about Europe&#8217;s precarious economics in 2011. The
opportunity to refinance debt at low rates drove $2.9&#160;trillion
in corporate bond sales, the second-highest total on record,
after 2009&#8217;s $3.2 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate and sovereign-bond deals around the world
generated a total of $13.6 billion in fees for bankers, down
from $14.9 billion in 2010, according to data compiled for
Bloomberg Markets&#8217; ranking of the best-paid investment banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan led the list, taking or sharing the top spot for
the fourth straight year as it earned $1.05&#160;billion, down from
$1.26 billion in 2010. Barclays Capital jumped to No.&#160;2 from No.
4 in 2010, after earning $906 million in fees, up from $870
million in 2010, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its April
issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of early March, bond markets were off to a promising
start in 2012, with financial company debt leading the way,
according to Arthur Tetyevsky, a credit strategist at Jefferies
Group Inc. (JEF) in New York. He expects U.S. investment-grade
corporate bonds to return from 4 to 5 percent more than
Treasuries in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are encouraged by the strong demand for credit,&#8221;
Tetyevsky says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees fell in 2011 because investors pulled back from the
market in the third quarter as Europe&#8217;s financial troubles
deepened. A strong start to the year, spurred by the expectation
that rates would rise, helped stoke demand for high-yield bonds
and spurred corporations to act before borrowing costs
increased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High-Yield Swoon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We had a very active first half when the high-yield index
tightened to an all-time low of 6.75&#160;percentage points in May,
which drove issuance in that market,&#8221; says Andy O&#8217;Brien, global
co-head of debt capital markets at JPMorgan (JPM), referring to the
JPMorgan index that measures the average spread of high-yield
bonds against Treasuries. As concern about Europe increased, the
spread widened to 10 percentage points in October, before ending
the year at 8 percentage points, O&#8217;Brien says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond issuance slowed dramatically in the second half,
pushing down fees for the year. For the top five banks in the
ranking, fees for high-yield debt issuance, which earns higher
commission rates for firms, dropped 26.3 percent last year
compared with 2010. Investment-grade fees for the five fell 9.5
percent, while commissions from western Europe dropped
21.7&#160;percent, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wheels Come Off &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The third quarter really took everyone&#8217;s wheels off,&#8221;
says Richard Zogheb, co-head of capital markets origination for
the Americas at Citigroup (C), No. 3 in the bond fee ranking. &#8220;It
became very scary that it was possible that the European crisis
could spread beyond Greece, Ireland and Portugal and encompass
Italy and&#160;Spain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European crisis led to an increase in the issuance of
bonds denominated in U.S. dollars by banks and companies outside
the country -- debt known as Yankee bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;More than 40 percent of U.S. dollar-denominated deals
came from Yankee issuers last year, and we were a clear
beneficiary of that trend,&#8221; says Jim Glascott, head of global
debt capital markets at Barclays Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a rise in issuance of so-called dollar-
covered bonds -- mortgage-backed debt securities of which the
issuing bank keeps a portion on its balance sheet, reducing
risk. About $40 billion in issuance of U.S. dollar covered bonds
helped Barclays (BARC) Capital boost fee income last year. The market
saw no volume in the securities in 2009 and $28 billion in 2010,
Glascott said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s a market that didn&#8217;t exist before, and now we&#8217;re
the No. 1 bookrunner, so that&#8217;s been helpful,&#8221; he says.
Issuance of the bonds was led by European and Canadian banks,
with Australian banks entering the market at the end of last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verizon&#8217;s Big Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the corporate sector, the largest dollar-denominated
bond deal of the year was Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)&#8217;s March
sale of $6.25 billion of notes to repay part of the cost of its
$1.74 billion acquisition of Terremark Worldwide Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt worldwide from&#160;the most-creditworthy companies to the
neediest returned 5.99 percent from the end of November through
yesterday, compared with a 4.86 percent gain in all of 2011,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Broad
Market Corporate  High Yield Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The need for yield continues to exist,&#8221; says Jim Casey,
co-head with O&#8217;Brien of debt capital markets at JPMorgan.
&#8220;Investors can&#8217;t satisfy their need for yield away from credit
markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For investment bankers, 2011 started
with a shout and ended with a whimper -- causing fees to shoot
up in the first half, then fizzle at year&#8217;s end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on, Dallas-based ATT Inc. (T) and Frankfurt-based
Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) announced bold plans to acquire competitors
across the Atlantic. Initial public offerings surged in the
first half to levels not seen since before the near collapse of
the U.S. financial system in 2008. Pipeline operator Kinder
Morgan Inc. (KMI) went public with a $3.3 billion IPO in February that
raised $1 billion more than projected, Bloomberg Markets
magazine reports in its April issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor appetite for IPOs was even hotter by May: Shares
of social-networking website LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) surged 109 percent
to $94.25 in their first day of trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Activity continued to build to a crescendo even after the
tragedy in Japan,&#8221; says Paul J. Taubman, investment banking
chief at Morgan Stanley (MS), speaking of the 9.0 megathrust
earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high point of the year came in mid-July, when London-
based Apax Partners LLP launched the biggest leveraged buyout
since late 2008 with a $5.7 billion bid for medical-device maker
Kinetic Concepts Inc. (KCI), in which Morgan Stanley advised Apax and
designed the financing package. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) and a Motorola Mobility
Holdings Inc. (MMI) unit were ordered by the U.S. judge presiding over
an Apple Inc. patent lawsuit to turn over information about the
development of Google&#8217;s Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Motorola Mobility unit and Google must also hand over
to Apple information about Google&#8217;s pending $12.5 billion
acquisition of the mobile-phone maker, U.S. Circuit Judge
Richard A. Posner in Chicago ruled March 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posner&#8217;s decision came in a patent lawsuit filed in 2010 by
Cupertino, California-based Apple against Motorola Mobility,
which has countersued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Android/Motorola acquisition discovery is highly
relevant to Apple&#8217;s claims and defenses,&#8221; Apple&#8217;s attorneys&#8217;
said in a March 2 filing requesting the judge&#8217;s order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, maker of the iPhone, has been waging a global fight
with the former Motorola Inc. unit that sells phones using
Google&#8217;s Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posner, a federal appeals court judge who is presiding over
the trial court-level case, has scheduled back-to-back trials
before separate juries starting June 11. The first will address
six Apple patents, and the second will cover three Motorola

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Motorola shall be expected to obtain full and immediate
compliance by Google with Apple&#8217;s liability discovery demands,&#8221;
the judge said in a February order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility opposed Apple&#8217;s request, arguing that
Google, the operator of the world&#8217;s most-visited Internet search
portal, isn&#8217;t a party to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Google&#8217;s employees and documents are not within the
&#8216;possession, custody, or control&#8217; of Motorola, and Motorola
cannot force Google to produce documents or witnesses over
Google&#8217;s objections,&#8221; lawyers for the mobile phone maker said
in a March 5 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility was spun off from Motorola Inc. -- now
Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI) Jennifer Erickson, a spokeswoman for the
Libertyville, Illinois-based company, declined to comment on the
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niki Fenwick, a spokeswoman at Google, said in an e-mail
that the company wouldn&#8217;t comment beyond what was submitted in
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan to pay $4.5 Million to Settle LML Infringement Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. agreed to pay $4.5 million to take a
license to a disputed patent, ending an infringement case filed
by LML Payment Systems Inc. (LMLP) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, was one of more than 30
financial institutions named in the 2008 suit in Marshall,
Texas, and the final remaining defendant, according to LML. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case has brought in more than $45 million in
settlements, LML said in a statement. The disputed patent --
RE40,0220 -- covers a check-writing point-of-sale system, and
was issued in April 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second suit was filed against another group of banks in
the same court in June 2009 and closed in October.  Vancouver-
based LML, a provider of financial payments, claimed the
defendants in that case infringed the same patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2009 case is LML Patent Corp. v. National Bank of
Daingerfield, Texas, 2:09-00180-DF, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Texas (Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2008 case is LML Patent Corp. v. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
2:08-cv-00448, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas
(Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Viterra Properly Denied &#8216;Xceed&#8217; Registration, Court Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viterra Inc. (VT), a Canadian agricultural supply company, was
properly denied the right to register &#8220;Xceed&#8221; as a trademark,
a federal appeals court ruled yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected the
application filed by Regina, Saskatchewan-based Viterra, saying
&#8220;Xceed&#8221; was too similar to a mark owned by X-Seed Inc. of
Clear Lake, Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X-Seed&#8217;s mark was registered for use with &#8220;agricultural
seeds,&#8221; the same category for which Viterra sought to register
&#8220;Xceed.&#8221; The court said the patent office correctly determined
that the two names were so similar in pronunciation that any
minor differences &#8220;may go undetected by consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Viterra, 11-01354, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swedish Princess Estelle&#8217;s Name Becomes Popular Trademark Choice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The birth of the first royal baby in 30 years has prompted
a rush to the Swedish Patent and Registration Board, the Local,
an English-language Swedish newspaper, reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Princess Estelle&#8217;s birth Feb. 24, companies filed
applications to register the name as a trademark in collection
with makeup, clothing, cutlery, textiles, housewares and
beverages, according to the Local. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One company that sells home furnishings and tableware
online filed applications to register 16 names associated with
female members of the Royal Family as trademarks, according to
the Local. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vuitton Parody IP Poster Doesn&#8217;t Infringe, Penn Law School Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LMVH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)&#8217;s Louis Vuitton unit
objected to a poster used at the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s
law school to promote an upcoming seminar on fashion law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Feb. 29 letter, Michael Pantalony, who heads the
luxury-goods company&#8217;s civil trademark-enforcement efforts, said
he thought the Penn Intellectual Property Group  &#8220;would
understand the basics of intellectual property law and know
better than to infringe and dilute the famous trademarks of
fashion brands, including the LV trademarks, for a symposium on
fashion law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What caused the company&#8217;s ire was a design at the top of
the poster that it claimed infringed Vuitton&#8217;s &#8220;toile
monogram&#8221; pattern. Pantalony said the use of the design was &#8220;a
serious willful infringement&#8221; that diluted its trademarks and
&#8220;may mislead others into thinking this type of unlawful
activity is somehow &#8216;legal.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a March 2 letter, Robert F. Firestone of Penn&#8217;s Office
of General Counsel said the school disagreed that its poster
infringed. U.S. trademark law &#8220;expressly protects a
noncommercial use of a mark and a parody from any claim for
dilution,&#8221; he wrote. There was no violation of trademark law
because there was no likelihood that Vuitton sponsored or was
associated with the seminar, Firestone said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the artwork parody wasn&#8217;t intended to identify
goods and services, he said. Instead, it was &#8220;designed to evoke
some of the very issues to be discussed at the conference.&#8221;
Firestone said he would advise the school group that it could
continue to use the posters and invitations containing the
artwork &#8220;without violating any of Louis Vuitton&#8217;s legitimate
trademark rights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firestone closed the letter with an invitation to Pantalony
to attend the March 20 event. In-house counsel from other
fashion companies are scheduled to speak on panels at the
symposium &#8220;and I am sure the students would welcome your
attendance as well,&#8221; Firestone wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BT, TalkTalk Lose U.K. Appeal Over Government Anti-Piracy Law &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BT Group Plc (BT\A), Britain&#8217;s largest fixed-line phone company,
and TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc (TALK) lost a U.K. appeal to overturn
parts of a digital-piracy law intended to curb illegal file
sharing of music, film and books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeal in London yesterday upheld an April
2011 ruling that the U.K. Digital Economy Act doesn&#8217;t violate
European Union law, as the companies claimed, or place unfair
enforcement costs on Internet service providers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The judge&#8217;s conclusion was soundly based on detailed
evidence,&#8221; a panel of three judges said of the lower court&#8217;s
ruling in favor of the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts are increasingly protecting copyright owners against
websites engaged in mass piracy. In February, Sony Corp.&#8217;s
British unit and eight other record labels won a trial to help
them force British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) and other ISPs to
block access to the Swedish file-sharing site Pirate Bay. A
similar ruling was issued last year against a website known as
Newzbin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now that the court has made its decision, we will look at
the judgment carefully to understand its implications and
consider our next steps,&#8221; Dan Thomas, a BT spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law was created to prevent unlawful downloading of
copyright material by requiring ISPs to block some repeat
offenders. BT and TalkTalk, which sought the so-called judicial
review in 2010 when the law was passed, said enforcing the law
would cost &#8220;tens of millions of pounds in new systems and
processes&#8221; to monitor Internet users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government was supported in the case by the British
Recorded Music Industry and other organizations that support
copyright owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In last year&#8217;s ruling, the companies won the removal of an
obligation to pay 25 percent of regulator Ofcom&#8217;s expenses and
the cost of establishing an appeals body for the regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Botched Spider Web Takes Starring Role in &#8216;Spider-Man&#8217; Battle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Julie Taymor traces her March 2011 dismissal from
&#8220;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&#8221; to a giant, disobedient spider
web briefly parked high above the seats inside Broadway&#8217;s
Foxwoods Theatre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $1 million prop for the $75 million musical was
intended &#8220;to descend from the ceiling of the theater in a
thrilling flight/fly sequence&#8221; at the end of the show, she said
in a filing March 2 in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the &#8220;coup de theatre&#8221; was improperly designed by
a team led by set designer George Tsypin, she said in court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malfunctioning web interfered with the rigging
necessary to fly the cast through the auditorium and was removed
the day it was installed, Taymor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsypin later told the producers that cuts to the second act
suggested by Taymor&#8217;s co-writer, Glen Berger, were &#8220;our only
chance to save the show,&#8221; according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said in her filing that a streamlined story &#8220;appears
to have been conceived as a way to avoid the technical
challenges Tsypin and his team were having with staging the
finale&#8221; that she envisioned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taymor claimed in a Nov. 8 lawsuit that producers violated
her intellectual-property rights by making changes without her
permission and didn&#8217;t pay royalties due her as a co-book writer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their January countersuit, the producers accused her of
refusing to make changes and storming out of meetings when
alterations were even hinted at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Miramontez, a spokesman for the production and lead
producers Michael Cohl and Jeremiah Harris, said March 5 that
Cohl wasn&#8217;t available. Harris declined to comment. Chris
Kanarick, a spokesman for Taymor, said she wasn&#8217;t available. A
representative for Tsypin, who has designed operas worldwide,
referred inquiries to Miramontez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The director&#8217;s filing accused producers of making her a
scapegoat to appease anxious investors, and portrayed her
onetime collaborators, including Bono and the Edge of U2, as
duplicitous and inept. She said she repeatedly urged Cohl to
address the spider web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taymor blamed the web failure for why early previews had an
anticlimactic ending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Julie Taymor v. 8 Legged Productions LLC, 1:11-
cv-08002-RJH, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oshkosh Unit Wins Monetary Sanctions Against Ex-Employee &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oshkosh Corp. (OSK)&#8217;s JLG Industries unit was awarded a monetary
fine against an ex-employee who failed to disclose which
computer files he copied shortly before leaving the
construction-equipment company, the law firm representing JLG
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JLG sued the ex-employee in Illinois state court within 24
hours of his resignation in September, claiming he would
disclose the company&#8217;s proprietary information to a competitor
with whom he was taking a new job. The court issued a temporary
order barring disclosure of the information and destruction of
any evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing testimony on JLG&#8217;s behalf from computer
forensic experts, Judge Thomas C. Mueller of the Circuit Court
of Kane County, Illinois, ruled that the ex-employee had copied
the files and violated a court order requiring him to disclose
them or their location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mueller said the ex-employee would be subject to a daily
fine as long as he failed to require with the court&#8217;s orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JLG, based in McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania, is represented
by Chicago&#8217;s Schiff Hardin LLP (1261L). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Amron Awarded Sanctions in Diving-Equipment Trade Secrets Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amron International Diving Supply Inc., a maker of diving
and hyperbarics equipment, was awarded $73,000 in sanctions
against a former employee it accused of destroying evidence in a
trade-secrets case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Marilyn L. Huff said the defendant was
fined because he failed to comply with an earlier order that he
produce computers and storage devices Amron claimed contained
its proprietary information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying suit was filed in federal court in San Diego
in August. In its complaint, Amron claimed that former employee
Saad Sadik and the company he founded -- Hydrolinx Diving
Communication Inc. of Carlsbad, California, took proprietary
information after Sadik&#8217;s termination in April 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forensic analysis indicated that Sadik had copied more than
100,000 of Amron&#8217;s files and purged critical files from Amron&#8217;s
computer systems, according to court papers. Amron said Sadik
copied many files he wasn&#8217;t authorized to access, including
information about vendors and customers, customer quote
information, and non-public technical manuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amron, based in Vista, California, said that some of the
files Sadik deleted from its computer system made it impossible
to support functional changes to its product line &#8220;without
having to recreate years of engineering effort.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sanctions awarded against Sadik were related to Amron&#8217;s
attorney fees and the costs of forensic computer analysis,
according to the court order. The judge denied Sadik&#8217;s motion to
represent his company in litigation, noting that he isn&#8217;t a
lawyer and Hydrolinx is a corporation, which the law requires to
appear through counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huff granted Amron&#8217;s motion to find Sadik and Hydrolinx in
contempt for violating court orders and refused the defendants&#8217;
request to extend other deadlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadik didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for
comment on the judge&#8217;s rulings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Amron International Diving Supply Inc., v.
Hydrolinx Diving Communication Inc., 3:11-cv-01890-CAB-JMA, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of California (San Diego). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects settlement total in headline.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) will pay a total of $390,000 to settle allegations that the
companies executed fictitious trades on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock agreed to pay $250,000 to resolve claims that an
employee designed a strategy that put him on both the buy and
sell sides of trades in 10-year U.S. Treasury futures spreads on
two dates in 2010, the CFTC said in an order released today. In
the second trade, on May 25, 2010, the BlackRock employee
initiated a buy order for 11,642 10-year spreads a minute after
placing a sell order of the same size with a futures broker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to pay $140,000 over claims that an
employee placed a customer&#8217;s order to sell 11,642 10-year
spreads on May 25, 2010, the CFTC said in a separate order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan employee &#8220;knew or should have known that the
customer was attempting to engage in a prearranged trade where
the customer was on both sides,&#8221; the CFTC said in the order.
The trades violated commodities trading regulations designed to
ensure that market prices are competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BlackRock cooperated fully with the CFTC and is pleased
to put this matter behind us,&#8221; said Brian Beades, a spokesman
for the world&#8217;s biggest asset manager. Justin Perras, a
spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both BlackRock and JPMorgan are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE)
executive was sued by U.S. regulators for buying his company&#8217;s
shares based on confidential information about an acquisition of
bottling operations in Norway and Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Harrold, who was a vice president in London for the
Atlanta-based bottling company, bought the stock through his
wife&#8217;s brokerage account one day before the February 2010
acquisition was announced, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said in a lawsuit filed at U.S. District Court for
the Central District of California today. Harrold made $86,850
in illegal profits on the trades, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Harrold deliberately flouted the federal securities laws
and specific company restrictions in his purchases and trades of
Coca-Cola Enterprises stock,&#8221; Rosalind Tyson, head of the SEC&#8217;s
regional office in Los Angeles, said in a statement. &#8220;His
employer entrusted him with critical nonpublic information, and
Harrold shattered that trust.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises bought the Scandinavian bottling
operations in February 2010 from Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s
biggest soft-drink maker. The deal was announced as part of a
larger transaction, valued at $12.3 billion, in which Coca-Cola
Co. agreed to buy the North American operations of Coca-Cola
Enterprises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrold, 53, according to the SEC, was informed in early
January 2010 that his firm was considering the acquisition and
signed a non-disclosure agreement that he would keep the
potential transaction confidential, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said it is seeking disgorgement of illicit profits,
unspecified financial penalties and to bar Harrold from serving
as an officer or director of a public company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phone call to Jean Nelson, Harrold&#8217;s attorney at Scheper
Kim  Harris LLP in Los Angeles, wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some shale formations in Europe and
China are impervious to drilling techniques that opened vast
reserves of natural gas and oil from Texas to Pennsylvania, said
Rex Tillerson, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New methods and tools will need to be invented to tap many
of the shale fields that energy companies and governments expect
eventually to yield a bonanza of fuel, Tillerson said during a
meeting with analysts in New York today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the largest U.S. gas producer after its 2010
acquisition of shale driller XTO Energy (XTO), failed in its first two
efforts to crack gas-rich shale fields in Poland. Gas discovered
in a pair of wells finished during the final three months of
last year didn&#8217;t flow, even after the company used high-pressure
jets of water and sand to create fissures in the rocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of the shales don&#8217;t respond as well to hydraulic
fracturing,&#8221; Tillerson said during a meeting with reporters
after his presentation to analysts. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to take
research and time in the lab to understand that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some parts of U.S. shale formations also have proven
impervious to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, he said. The
company is studying whether using different fluids, proppants or
pumping techniques will be successful, Tillerson said. Proppants
are tiny granules of sand or ceramic used to hold open fissures
that allow oil and gas to flow through rock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Bank of
America Corp. documents that were deemed confidential in a
lawsuit filed against them by Overstock.com Inc. (OSTK) must be made
public, a state court judge in San Francisco ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case involves a 2007 lawsuit by Overstock, an online
retailer, claiming that the banks manipulated its stock from
2005 to 2007, causing its shares to fall. State Court Judge John
Munter dismissed the case on Jan. 10, ruling that the conduct
took place outside of California. Overstock appealed, and also
asked Munter to make public those documents he put under seal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munter granted Overstock&#8217;s request to make public a large
chunk of documents, ruling Goldman Sachs and Bank of America&#8217;s
Merrill Lynch  Co. &#8220;failed to demonstrate an overriding
interest that overcomes the right of public access to the
records.&#8221; He said the transactions are at least four years old,
and much of the material was discussed at a Jan. 5 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The subject matter of this action is of substantial
public interest,&#8221; Munter ruled. &#8220;This case concerns publicly
traded securities and the operation of the national securities
markets, and those are of great public interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financial Data &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munter also ruled that other documents dealing with a
&#8220;staggering amount of financial data,&#8221; should remain under
court seal. Those exhibits to court filings are &#8220;laced with
identifying information about hundreds of thousands of financial
transactions of third parties&#8221; not connected to the litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Halldin, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America, said in an e-mailed statement that the
bank is reviewing the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our primary goal has been to ensure that the
confidentiality of sensitive client information be protected,&#8221;
Halldin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake City-based Overstock claims that large portions
of its stock was the subject of naked shorting, where investors
sell shares they don&#8217;t own in anticipation of making a profit by
paying for the stock after its price has fallen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clearing operations at Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch,
the brokerage acquired by Bank of America in 2009, intentionally
failed to locate and deliver borrowed shares for clients,
allowing the firms to earn fees and interest on phantom
securities transactions, lawyers for Overstock said in court
filings. Overstock sought millions of dollars in damages against
Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market &#8216;Flaws&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overstock Chief Executive Officer Patrick Byrne was
&#8220;thrilled&#8221; with the judge&#8217;s ruling, he said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I could not imagine that a post-2008 public would be
denied access to this evidence, which displays in living color
the flaws in our capital markets and in the regulatory structure
that governs them,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now the public will have a window through which to view
this evidence and judge for itself the fraudulent and
systematically risky behavior at issue in this case,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four media organizations, including Bloomberg LP, the New
York Times, Wenner Media and The Economist, intervened in the
case and joined Overstock&#8217;s motion for the unsealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Overstock.com v. Morgan Stanley, CGC-07-460147,
Superior Court of California, San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) sold $2.75 billion of
bonds, including short-term notes that pay less interest than an
interbank lending benchmark, taking advantage of corporate
borrowing costs that are near the lowest on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest soft-drink maker issued $1 billion each
of two- and three-year notes today, as well as $750 million of
six-year notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
two-year notes pay a floating rate that&#8217;s five basis points less
than the three-month London interbank offered rate, the first
time a U.S. company paid less than the measure in over a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#8217;s three-year notes have a 0.75 percent coupon,
while the six-year notes pay 1.65 percent a year, Bloomberg data
show. Libor was set at 0.474 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, is taking advantage of
increasing investor demand for highly rated debt to reduce its
borrowing costs. The average yield on investment-grade bonds was
3.45 percent yesterday, near the record low of 3.4 percent
reached on March 2, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soft-drink producer is following competitor PepsiCo
Inc. to the bond market. Last month, Purchase, New York-based
PepsiCo paid the least interest it ever had on a three-part bond
sale, issuing $750 million of 0.75 percent notes due in March
2015, $1.25 billion of 2.75 percent securities maturing in March
2022 and $750 million of 4 percent, 30-year bonds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 1, Procter  Gamble Co. issued $1 billion of
floating rate notes that pay 8 basis points less than Libor,
which is the rate banks say they charge to lend to each other.
It was the first to pay less than Libor since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hemy Neuman, a GE Energy manager,
put on a fake beard, drove a rented minivan to a suburban
Atlanta day care center and shot an ex-JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
banker dropping off his son, defense lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuman&#8217;s lawyers have told jurors in Georgia state court in
Decatur that their client was temporarily insane and unable to
stop himself from killing Russell Sneiderman, 36, the husband of
a female subordinate at GE. Prosecutors in the trial, which has
drawn intense local attention, contend Neuman was aware he was
committing murder in front of the Dunwoody Prep preschool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to testimony this week by Adriana Flores, a
forensic psychologist, Neuman was sexually obsessed with
Sneiderman&#8217;s wife, Andrea, 35. He believed he was acting on
orders from an angel with the voice of singer Olivia Newton John
and a demon who sounded like Barry White, Flores said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuman, 49, is charged with premeditated murder and
possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.
DeKalb County District Attorney Bob James has said he will seek
a life sentence without parole. Neuman&#8217;s lawyers finished
presenting witnesses yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A psychiatrist testifying today for the prosecution, Pamela
Crawford, told the jury that some of Neuman&#8217;s symptoms, such as
a memory lapse, were &#8220;consistent with lying.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, he couldn&#8217;t remember whether he had sexual
intercourse with Andrea Sneiderman or fabricated it, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trip Described &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a video-recorded interview played in court, Neuman told
Crawford about a trip the couple took to South Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He remembered their &#8220;having fun&#8221; hunting for a bottle of
wine at 9 p.m., he said. If the psychiatrist had asked during
the trip whether the couple had sex, he &#8220;would have said yes,&#8221;
Crawford told the jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the interviews, he wasn&#8217;t so sure but said they had
been &#8220;intimate,&#8221; Crawford testified. Aside from that, he
showed a &#8220;tremendous memory,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said Neuman never thought to discuss the angel and
demon, who he said started visiting him when he was a child in
an Israeli boarding school, until he spoke to his defense
attorney for this case, Bob Rubin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was detailed -- it was methodical,&#8221; Crawford said of
the killing. Planning and committing the crime &#8220;would not be
consistent with someone being acutely manic,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Based on my findings and the statute, the defendant would
be criminally responsible for murder,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Affair Suspected &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a Sept. 16, 2011, search warrant, police had
cause to believe Neuman was having an extramarital affair with
Andrea Sneiderman, which may have provided the motive for the
November 2010 killing, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an affidavit submitted to secure another warrant,
detectives said they would seek anything showing Neuman and
Andrea Sneiderman might have collaborated in the crime. She
hasn&#8217;t been charged with any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuman told police detectives in a recorded interview shown
in court that, before the killing, he supervised 5,000 workers
at the General Electric Co. (GE) unit&#8217;s quality systems division in
Atlanta. Andrea Sneiderman worked in software systems support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecution may be the highest profile case in the
Atlanta area since 1982 when Wayne Williams, suspected of 29
child murders, was convicted of killing two adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has become a local attraction. A handful of members of
the Red Hat Society, an international women&#8217;s group with 40,000
chapters dedicated to fun and fulfillment, according to its
website, stopped at the trial last week on their way to tour the
state Capitol in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Murder, Sex, Insanity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have murder, you have sex, you have insanity,&#8221; said
Roy Peter Clark, a media analyst at the Poynter Institute in St.
Petersburg, Florida. &#8220;You have a day care center, you have a
disguise, you have the intersection of normal upper middle class
life with some of the most destructive elements of society.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those factors have made &#8220;otherwise responsible citizens
sit up and take notice,&#8221; he said of the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flores, the defense witness, testified that Neuman told her
that angels and demons guided his actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He did not have the capacity to know right from wrong&#8221;
when he shot Sneiderman, said Flores. She said she diagnosed him
as bipolar and psychotic and found him delusional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuman hasn&#8217;t testified during the trial. He sat as another
defense forensic psychiatrist, Tracey Marks, described the
affair that Neuman believed he had with Sneiderman. Marks said
the belief was a sign of mania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evidence of Planning &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have called witnesses in an effort to prove the
defendant planned the murder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan DaSilva, who sold Neuman the gun allegedly used in the
shooting, testified the defendant told him, &#8220;Don&#8217;t ever have a
mistress.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witnesses to the shooting included a chiropractor, Craig
Kuhlmeir and his wife, Aliyah Stotter. After the disguised
assailant shot Sneiderman, he returned to the van and sped off,
they testified. In court, they identified Neuman as the shooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shooter&#8217;s haste and use of a disguise indicated that
Neuman knew he was committing a crime, prosecutors argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police in Dunwoody arrested Neuman after determining he had
rented a silver Kia Sedona matching the one seen at the location
of the crime, the day before the killing, according to court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Sneiderman testified earlier that she didn&#8217;t have an
affair with Neuman. She didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment on
the trial this week. Seth Kirschenbaum, her lawyer, didn&#8217;t
return a call seeking comment yesterday on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the police interview played in court, Neuman recalled
attending the burial of Russell Sneiderman, including casting a
handful of dirt on the grave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;E-Mail Exchanges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marks, the defense psychiatrist, said Andrea Sneiderman in
e-mails pulled Neuman in emotionally and then pushed him away.
She would complain about her husband&#8217;s being an absentee father
to their two children and encourage Neuman to discuss her
problems, Marks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sneiderman said in the e-mails that she regretted some
things they did during out-of-town trips, Marks said. In her
testimony at the trial, she said that referred to holding hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such exchanges led the emotionally fragile Neuman to become
delusional and believe he was the father of Sneiderman&#8217;s
children and that he should protect them, Marks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of the shooting, Neuman knew right from wrong
&#8220;globally,&#8221; while being delusional in thinking that killing
Russell Sneiderman was the best way to protect the children,
according to Marks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neuman Called Sick &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Neuman is sick,&#8221; Doug Peters, his defense lawyer,
said in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howard Masto and Kenneth Darling, spokesmen for GE Energy,
didn&#8217;t respond to voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on
the case yesterday after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burden is on the defense to prove insanity, said
Charles Patrick Ewing, a law school professor at the State
University of New York at Buffalo. Fewer than 1 percent of
criminal cases involve a temporary insanity defense, and no more
than one-third of such defenses prevail, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal definition of insanity also differs from the
medical definition of mentally ill. A schizophrenic wouldn&#8217;t be
found legally insane if he was aware that what he was doing was
wrong, said Ewing, the author of &#8220;Insanity: Murder, Madness,
and the Law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any advance planning or fleeing a crime scene undermines
an insanity defense,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I tell my students you have to be crazy to plead
insanity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you win, you face being locked up for
life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State v. Neuman, 11CR1364-5, Georgia Superior
Court, DeKalb County (Decatur) &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri" date="Mar 09, 2012  4:14 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-09/disney-board-nominees-opposed-by-proxy-adviser-glass-lewis.html"><headline>Disney Board Nominees Opposed by Glass Lewis Over Executive Compensation</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Proxy adviser Glass Lewis  Co. is
opposing five nominees to the board of Walt Disney Co. (DIS), citing
deficient links between performance and executive pay, and one
director&#8217;s ties to a failed lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of the nominees served on the TV, theme-park and film
company&#8217;s compensation committee, Glass Lewis said in a report.
The fifth nominee served on the board of a bank that was seized
by regulators in 2008, resulting in losses for the investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm joins proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder
Services Inc. and Connecticut Treasurer Denise L. Nappier in
opposing Disney directors up for a vote at the March 13 annual
meeting in Kansas City, Missouri. Glass Lewis opposes half the
nominees. A third proxy adviser, Egan-Jones Proxy Services,
supports the company&#8217;s nominees and other issues on the ballot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the opposition relates to Disney&#8217;s decision last
year to give Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger the additional
title of chairman at the annual meeting. The company hasn&#8217;t had
one executive in both positions since then-chief executive
Michael Eisner gave up the chairman title in 2004 under pressure
from shareholder groups that said an independent chairman would
lead to better shareholder stewardship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 0.5 percent to
$42.24 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 13 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis prefers companies split the jobs of chairman
and chief executive or have a lead director who isn&#8217;t an
executive of the company, the firm said in the Feb. 23 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Disney said it will appoint an independent lead
director, the company doesn&#8217;t appear to have done so and Glass
Lewis said it is monitoring the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planned Transition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to combine the positions was part of a
transition plan that was carefully thought out by the board,
retiring Chairman John Pepper said in a statement March 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nine out of the ten directors will be independent,
including an independent lead director with duties and
responsibilities that exceed in scope those recommended by
governance advisers,&#8221; Pepper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 100 biggest Standard  Poor&#8217;s companies, 68 percent
have a joint chairman and CEO, Pepper said. In a filing last
week, the company cited better long-term stock performance than
peers such as News Corp. (NWSA), Time Warner Inc. (TWX), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), CBS
Corp. (CBS) and Viacom Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Board View &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Board rightfully considered Mr. Iger&#8217;s performance
over the course of his tenure when viewed in relation to the
industry peers against which both he and his compensation
package are most fairly measured,&#8221; Disney said in the filing.
&#8220;On that measure Mr. Iger&#8217;s compensation is fully warranted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In backing the nominees, Egan Jones said in its March 6
report the audit, compensation and governance-nominating
committees were composed of independent, outside directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Glass Lewis, Disney overall paid more than its
peers, while performing moderately worse. The adviser based its
analysis on 29 similarly sized companies, including four in
consumer products and six in movies and entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis also cited the role of Orin Smith on the audit
and governance committee of Washington Mutual when that lender
was seized by regulators in September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, said state and federal governments will play an
important role in the safe and efficient development of North
American (PAL) crude and natural-gas resources that are transforming
the continent&#8217;s energy supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of petroleum sources in the U.S. and Canada
from shale-gas formations, tight-oil reservoirs, oil sands and
deep-water projects will help shape projects globally, Chief
Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said today at CERAWeek, a
Houston conference held by IHS Cambridge Energy Research
Associates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our industry has not and cannot achieve these results
alone, however,&#8221; Tillerson said. &#8220;Government has an
indispensable role in this quest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policies related to access, taxes and regulations can have
&#8220;profound implications&#8221; on the industry&#8217;s ability to develop
new resources and &#8220;share the enormous economic benefits they
promise,&#8221; Tillerson said. New technologies such as hydraulic
fracturing have allowed the industry to tap previously
unavailable resources, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry is working to develop Canadian oil sands,
Tillerson said. In 2010, unconventional resources contributed
more than $76 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas demand is expected to rise by 60 percent by 2040,
Tillerson said, and gas will satisfy more than 25 percent of
global energy needs, Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy&#8217;s Role &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers with various political backgrounds are
recognizing that energy is essential to growth, Tillerson said,
citing President Barack Obama&#8217;s call to develop every available
source of U.S. energy. Some American and Canadian citizens have
questions about new unconventional development, Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has advocated disclosure of fluids used in fracturing
in the U.S., working with other companies and state regulatory
agencies as they set up the FracFocus website, Tillerson said.
That allows companies to voluntarily submit fluid data on
drilling, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will be calling on our government and industry
partners to implement in Europe the same level of openness and
accountability that FracFocus has delivered in the United
States,&#8221; Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson said the recent decision that went against
TransCanada Corp. (TRP)&#8217;s Keystone XL pipeline was &#8220;a product of
political calculations in Washington.&#8221; That project would have
benefited both the U.S. and Canada by linking oil-sands output
with refining operations, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multiple Agencies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulation once gave U.S. businesses rules on how to get
things done, Tillerson said, while now the process involves
multiple and duplicative agencies that can be an obstacle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It has become the tool of opponents of development and
special interest groups,&#8221; Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian approach to regulation is &#8220;very rigorous,&#8221;
while being defined and enabling issues to be worked through
during a process, Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government can help speed up technological innovations by
supporting research, he said. It should let markets operate
openly, not picking energy winners and losers through subsidies,
mandates and punitive taxes, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Government is most effective when it acts as a research
catalyst, not as a venture capitalist,&#8221; Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford, the onetime
Caribbean banking tycoon found guilty of helming a $7 billion
investment fraud, was brought down by his own arrogance and
greed, jurors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billie Wade, 69, a retired hairdresser who described
herself during jury selection in Houston federal court as &#8220;the
dumbest person in this room,&#8221; said Stanford&#8217;s attitude made the
biggest impression on her, more than any evidence or testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;His arrogance, every day,&#8221; she said yesterday after the
jury decided that Stanford, 61, must forfeit $330 million in
assets in 29 bank accounts seized by the government. The same
jury of eight men and four women returned guilty verdicts March
6 on 13 of 14 criminal counts against Stanford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford was found guilty of lying to investors about the
nature and oversight of certificates of deposit issued by
Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd. and sold in the
U.S. by his Houston-based securities firm, Stanford Group Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a six-week trial, the jury convicted him on four
counts of wire fraud and five counts of mail fraud, each of
which carries a top sentence of 20 years in prison. He was also
convicted of conspiracy and obstructing a U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission probe. He was found not guilty of one wire
fraud count. U.S. District Judge David Hittner set June 14 for
sentencing. Stanford remains in custody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The jury returned unanimous verdicts and we think they
speak for themselves,&#8221; John Wojciak, the jury foreman, said
yesterday after the forfeiture trial. Jurors examined 10 to 12
boxes of evidence, said Wojciak, an environmental engineer. He
refused to answer questions from reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury yesterday granted total forfeiture on 29 bank
accounts in London, Zurich, Geneva and elsewhere that
prosecutors said are worth $330 million. The money will go to
Stanford&#8217;s victims, the U.S. Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We won&#8217;t say it&#8217;s what we expected,&#8221; Ali Fazel, one of
Stanford&#8217;s attorneys, said after the forfeiture verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, who didn&#8217;t testify, maintains his innocence.
Defense lawyers argued that his organization had had enough
assets to honor its commitments until the SEC sued in February
2009 and won a court order freezing his holdings and appointing
a receiver to liquidate them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Scardino, Stanford&#8217;s other attorney, said he and
Fazel will ask the court to have lawyers review their work to
see if they made any mistakes or &#8220;missed any issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fazel said there are many grounds for appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank Ltd., 09-cv-298, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chef Batali Agrees to $5.25 Million Server Tip Suit Accord &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mario Batali, the celebrity TV chef and New York restaurant
owner, is often seen with actress Gwyneth Paltrow, taste-testing
the culinary delights of Spain in their public television series
&#8220;On the Road Again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batali took a detour, through his lawyers, to New York
federal court in Manhattan, where he was sued and accused of
cheating workers of part of their tips, as well as failing to
pay overtime and the minimum wage. He and his associate Joseph
Bastianich agreed to pay $5.25 million to settle the class-
action lawsuit, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servers at restaurants including Babbo and Del Posto sued
in 2010 alleging their employers violated the Fair Labor
Standards Act -- in part by pocketing gratuities equal to as
much as 5 percent of nightly wine sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Batali, Mr. Bastianich, and their restaurants
unlawfully confiscated a portion of their workers&#8217; hard-earned
tips in order to supplement their own profits,&#8221; employees said
in their complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement agreement, filed March 5, is subject to
approval by a federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord in the class-action suit may cover as many as
1,100 employees including servers, waiters and bartenders who
work or worked at Babbo, Del Posto, Bar Jamon, Casa Mono, Esca,
Lupa, Otto and Tarry Lodge, dating back to 2004, according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of all
parties, Rachel M. Bien, one of the employees&#8217; lawyers, said
yesterday by e-mail. A. Michael Weber, who represented Batali,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Capsolas v. Pasta Resources Inc., 10-cv-5595,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Man Who Ran Britain&#8217;s Biggest Ponzi Scheme Jailed for 14 Years &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man who admitted running the largest Ponzi scheme in
British history, defrauding investors of more than 115 million
pounds ($182 million), was sentenced to 14 years and six months
in prison, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kautilya Nandan Pruthi pleaded guilty to defrauding about
800 investors during a three-year period until November 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His associates, John Anderson and Kenneth Peacock, were
found guilty yesterday for their part in the fraud and each
jailed for 18 months, the Press Association reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trio defrauded investors by offering monthly returns of
as much as 13 percent. The scheme was marketed as a fund
investing in high-interest loans to distressed trading companies
involved in importing and exporting goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pruthi spent the proceeds on London property, a Jaguar XKR,
three Bentleys, two Ferraris, a Lamborghini, two Mercedes, a
Rolls-Royce, a Volkswagen and a motorcycle, according to the
City of London Police, which investigated the case after it was
referred to them by the Financial Services Authority in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pruthi, Peacock and Anderson were ordered to pay the FSA
115 million pounds in 2010 for unlawfully accepting deposits
while operating as Business Consulting International. The
regulator said it would return any money it receives to
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecution service had no information on the men&#8217;s
lawyers to contact for comment on the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Capital One Financial Sued Over Mortgage-Backed Securities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) was sued by Landesbank Baden-
Wuerttemberg, Germany&#8217;s biggest state-owned lender, over alleged
fraud involving $168 million worth of residential mortgage-
backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities were purchased by Stuttgart-based LBBW and
are being held by the bank or were sold at a loss, according to
documents filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The offering materials issued by defendants for the
offerings contained material misrepresentations and omissions
regarding the legal validity of assignments of the mortgage
loans to trusts formed to hold the pooled loans,&#8221; LBBW said in
the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie Rakes, a spokeswoman for McLean, Virginia-based
Capital One, declined to comment on the lawsuit because she
hadn&#8217;t seen it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Landesbank Baden-Wurttemberg v. Capital One
Financial Corp., 650713/2012, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Encore Capital Units Sued by West Virginia Over Practices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Virginia sued two units of debt buyer Encore Capital
Group Inc. (ECPG), claiming the firms used false affidavits in lawsuits
and took part in fraudulent debt-collection practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Attorney General Darrell McGraw said in a statement
he sued Midland Funding LLC and sister company Midland Credit
Management, both part of San Diego-based Encore Capital. The
suit, filed yesterday in state court in Charleston, alleges that
the two firms robo-signed affidavits when obtaining default
judgments against West Virginia consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many consumers are frightened or unaware of their rights
when they are sued and fail to respond to these groundless
lawsuits, leaving them subject to judgments on debts that cannot
be proved,&#8221; McGraw said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Encore is confident in the integrity and accuracy of its
collections processes and in the validity of the data supporting
the underlying debts it owns,&#8221; the company said in a statement.
&#8220;The Midland defendants feel strongly that the allegations in
the West Virginia suit inaccurately portray both Midland&#8217;s
practices and the applicable legal standards.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state wants the court to force the companies to repay
money they got from West Virginia consumers and $5,000 to the
state for every violation of its consumer-protection law. It
also wants to halt the companies from making collections in the
state until the case is resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of West Virginia v. Midland Funding LLC,
12C-4-33, Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia
(Charleston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Anonymous&#8217; Hacker Sabu Worked Around the Clock to Aid U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hector Xavier Monsegur, a hacker and member of Anonymous,
Internet Feds and LulzSec, began working &#8220;around the clock&#8221; to
aid the U.S. immediately after he was arrested in June,
prosecutors told a judge in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsegur, who pleaded guilty Aug. 15, began cooperating
with U.S. authorities, including Federal Bureau of Investigation
agents, after he was arrested June 7, Assistant U.S. Attorney
James Pastore told U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska at an Aug.
5 court hearing, an unsealed transcript shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsegur, who used the nickname Sabu and is described as an
&#8220;influential member&#8221; of all three groups, pleaded guilty Aug.
15 to staging cyber attacks against the websites of the
governments of Algeria, Yemen and Zimbabwe, according to a
criminal information unsealed March 6. He also admitted
conducting a hack attack upon Tribune Co. (TRB) and News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s Fox
television, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since literally the day he was arrested, the defendant
has been cooperating with the government proactively,&#8221; Pastore
told Preska at the hearing, a transcript made available
yesterday shows. &#8220;The defendant has literally worked around the
clock with federal agents. He has been staying up sometimes all
night engaging in conversations with co-conspirators that are
helping the government to build cases against those co-
conspirators.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara&#8217;s office revealed
Monsegur&#8217;s role as a cooperator this week as it announced the
arrest of five other men linked to Anonymous and off-shoot
groups in the underground hacking movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Monsegur, 11-cr-666, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Overstock File to Be Unsealed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Bank of America Corp.
documents that were deemed confidential in a lawsuit filed
against them by Overstock.com Inc. (OSTK) must be made public, a state
court judge in San Francisco ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case involves a 2007 lawsuit by Overstock, an online
retailer, claiming that the banks manipulated its stock from
2005 to 2007, causing its shares to fall. State Court Judge John
Munter dismissed the case on Jan. 10, ruling that the conduct
took place outside of California. Overstock appealed and asked
Munter to make public those documents he put under seal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munter granted Overstock&#8217;s request to make public a large
chunk of documents, ruling Goldman Sachs and Bank of America&#8217;s
Merrill Lynch  Co. &#8220;failed to demonstrate an overriding
interest that overcomes the right of public access to the
records.&#8221; He said the transactions are at least four years old,
and much of the material was discussed at a Jan. 5 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Halldin, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America, said in an e-mailed statement that the
bank is reviewing the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our primary goal has been to ensure that the
confidentiality of sensitive client information be protected,&#8221;
Halldin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overstock Chief Executive Officer Patrick Byrne was
&#8220;thrilled&#8221; with the judge&#8217;s ruling, he said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I could not imagine that a post-2008 public would be
denied access to this evidence, which displays in living color
the flaws in our capital markets and in the regulatory structure
that governs them,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Overstock.com v. Morgan Stanley, CGC-07-460147,
Superior Court of California, San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mercedes Dealer Among Potential Jacoby  Meyers Investors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three directors of a small New York bank, including one who
also sells new and used Mercedes-Benzes, want to be the first
nonlawyer investors in Jacoby  Meyers, the discount law firm
with storefront offices across the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacoby  Meyers, saying it needs capital to expand into
communities with working-class and immigrant families, asked
federal judges in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to throw
out state laws barring nonlawyers from owning interests in law
firms. A judge in New York yesterday dismissed the suit there.
One in Trenton, New Jersey, let that case proceed March 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a court filing in January, Jacoby  Meyers identified
its potential investors as Anthony Costa, Philip Guarnieri and
Michael Ostrow. The three are directors of ES Bancshares Inc. (ESBS),
the holding company for Empire State Bank, according to
regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacoby  Meyers is seeking to sue on behalf of other law
firms in the three states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costa and Guarnieri didn&#8217;t reply to phone messages left at
the bank. Ostrow, president of Mercedes-Benz of Wappingers
Falls, New York, declined to comment on his potential
investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all three states, Jacoby  Myers is seeking to
invalidate laws barring nonlawyers from sharing fees or joining
partnerships and corporations that practice law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York yesterday
granted a request to dismiss the suit by New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ruled on technical grounds, saying several provisions of
state law bar nonlawyer investments and it made no sense to rule
on just the one Jacoby  Meyers attacked. Kaplan said the issue
might best be decided by legislatures and professional
associations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Peter Sheridan in Trenton denied the
state&#8217;s dismissal bid and asked the state Supreme Court to
decide if the investment is permissible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York case is Jacoby  Meyers v. Presiding Justices,
11-cv-3387, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The New Jersey case is Jacoby  Meyers v. Justices
of the Supreme Court, 11-cv-2866, U.S. District Court, District
of New Jersey (Trenton). The Connecticut case is Jacoby  Meyers
v. Judges of the Connecticut Superior Court, 11-cv-817, U.S.
District Court, District of Connecticut (New Haven). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wynn Ordered to Produce Two Pages in Okada Dispute Over Gift &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) was ordered by a judge to produce two
more pages of documents for Kazuo Okada, the casino operator&#8217;s
director whose 20 percent stake in the company Wynn forcibly
redeemed alleging he was &#8220;unsuitable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevada State Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez at a hearing
yesterday in Las Vegas refused to order Wynn to produce
additional papers from before the company went public or
documents regarding an amended stockholder agreement that
resulted from Chief Executive Officer Steve Wynn&#8217;s divorce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okada sought a court order that, as a director, he is
entitled to inspect Wynn&#8217;s books and records regarding its HK$1
billion ($129 million) pledge last year to the University of
Macau. At a Feb. 9 hearing, Gonzalez said she would order Wynn
to produce the documents if at a further hearing she found that
Okada&#8217;s request was &#8220;reasonable&#8221; and that Wynn had refused to
provide them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To ask Wynn officials to go through warehouses for every
record from 2000 to 2002 was unreasonable,&#8221; Kirk Lenhard, a
lawyer for Wynn, said at yesterday&#8217;s hearing. Wynn said in a
court filing that it has already provided Okada with more than
900 pages of the requested documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okada, a billionaire, held the largest single stake in Wynn
through his Tokyo-based Universal Entertainment Corp. (6425) He brought
the case in January, claiming the company hadn&#8217;t provided
information he requested about the University of Macau pledge,
or about the use of $120 million he invested in 2002 and the
amended stockholders agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock redemption and Wynn&#8217;s announcement March 7 that
it will seek to remove Okada as a director escalated a clash
between Steve Wynn, the company&#8217;s founder, and Okada, who helped
bankroll Wynn Resorts starting 12 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wynn&#8217;s lawyers said in a court filing March 7 that the
company has produced all non-privileged documents that could
&#8220;reasonably relate&#8221; to Okada&#8217;s responsibilities as a director.
Were the judge to issue an order for Wynn to produce more
documents, the lawyers asked that she delay the order for 60
days because Okada may no longer be a director then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wynn called March 7 for a special shareholders meeting to
vote on ejecting Okada as a director following a Feb. 18
decision by the board that Okada and certain affiliates are
&#8220;unsuitable persons,&#8221; according to a company statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shareholder vote is set to take place in late April or
early May, Wynn said in the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Okada v. Wynn Resorts, A-12-654522, Clark
County, Nevada, District Court (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martha Stewart Living Says Macy&#8217;s (M) Accord Allows Penney Deal [bn:WBTKR=MSLO:US]  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSO) Inc. [] said its agreement to
sell merchandise in J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) stores is allowed under a
2006 contract with Macy&#8217;s Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Macy&#8217;s accord places no restrictions on Martha Stewart
Living&#8217;s ability to design and sell a broad range of exempt
products and &#8220;clearly permits&#8221; the J.C. Penney deal, Martha
Stewart Living said in documents filed March 7 in New York State
Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While MSLO-designed goods are sold in approximately 600
Macy&#8217;s stores, they also are sold in over 6,000 other retail
outlets,&#8221; Martha Stewart Living said in the papers. &#8220;Macy&#8217;s
simply has no exclusive right to MSLO&#8217;s creativity or design
concepts, now or in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy&#8217;s, based in Cincinnati, sued in January to stop New
York-based Martha Stewart Living from executing the agreement
announced in December with J.C. Penney. Macy&#8217;s said it has the
exclusive right to sell Martha Stewart-branded products in
certain categories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Macy&#8217;s Inc. v. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc., 650197/2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Potential Lawsuits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Said to Prepare Apple Lawsuit Over E-Book Price-Fixing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department told Apple Inc. (AAPL) and five
publishers that it&#8217;s preparing to sue them for allegedly fixing
the prices of electronic books, according to a person familiar
with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the companies are in talks with the Justice
Department to reach a settlement to avoid a court battle,
according to the person, who wasn&#8217;t authorized to speak about
the discussions publicly and declined to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publishers involved in the case are Lagardere SCA (MMB)&#8217;s
Hachette Book Group, News Corp.&#8217;s HarperCollins Publishers,
Macmillan, a unit of Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH,
CBS Corp. (CBS)&#8217;s Simon  Schuster and Pearson Plc (PSON)&#8217;s Penguin Group
(USA), the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is looking into how Cupertino,
California-based Apple changed the way publishers charged for e-
books in early 2010 when it was getting ready to introduce its
first iPad, the person said. European antitrust regulators also
have said they&#8217;re probing whether Apple&#8217;s pricing deals with
publishers restrict competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharis Pozen, the acting chief of the antitrust division of
the Justice Department, told Congress in December the division
was probing the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the
e-book industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, Kristin
Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, Adam Rothberg, a spokesman for
Simon  Schuster, Sophie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for Lagarde&#8217;s
Hachette Book Group, Erica Glass, a spokeswomen for Pearson&#8217;s
Penguin Group USA and Erin Crum, a spokeswoman for
HarperCollins, all declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continental Airlines Inc. asked an appeals court near Paris
to overturn its manslaughter conviction for the deaths of 113
people in the crash of Air France&#8217;s Concorde supersonic jet
almost 12 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now part of United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL), the world&#8217;s
largest airline, Continental and a maintenance engineer dispute
their December 2010 convictions and plan to show the court new
evidence the deaths weren&#8217;t their fault during the hearings, due
to run through May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Neither the company nor its employees were responsible
for the Concorde accident,&#8221; Continental said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;To blame the crash on a small strip of metal from
another aircraft is absurd.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Concorde crashed soon after take-off on July 25, 2000,
when a fireball was ignited after the jet ran over a metal strip
that fell from a prior Continental flight, investigators said.
The probe found the strip tore one of the plane&#8217;s tires and sent
debris into its fuel tanks. Continental has disputed that
scenario, telling the court the fire began before the jet hit
the strip. The airline said it will present new evidence to the
Versailles appeals court to support its claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court was mistaken&#8221; in holding Continental liable,
the carrier&#8217;s lawyer, Olivier Metzner, said before yesterday&#8217;s
hearing began. &#8220;The plane was already on fire when it hit this
metal strip -- the accident was unavoidable,&#8221; he said, calling
the Concorde a plane of &#8220;extreme fragility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors also appealed the 2010 verdict by the lower
court, meaning four men who were cleared must again face
manslaughter charges. One of them, a former official at France&#8217;s
civil aviation authority named Claude Frantzen, filed a
constitutional challenge arguing they can&#8217;t appeal a verdict
that followed the trial prosecutor&#8217;s recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court must consider the matter &#8220;immediately,&#8221; said
his lawyer, Daniel Soulez-Lariviere, defending the
constitutional question as &#8220;a serious one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judges said they will rule on the challenge at the next
hearing, scheduled for March 13. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hong Kong Has Shortfall in Number of Judges, Morning Post Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong faces a shortage of judges and magistrates, and
almost a quarter of posts in these positions have been vacant
since last June, the South China Morning Post reported, citing
Judiciary Administrator Emma Lau as saying in a Legislative
Council panel March 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-five of the city&#8217;s 189 vacancies for judges and
magistrates remain unfilled, the newspaper reported. The average
waiting time for civil cases rose to 117 days in 2011 from 89
days in 2010, the Post said, citing the judiciary&#8217;s annual
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmaker Audrey Eu said the shortage &#8220;deals a blow to the
very foundation&#8221; of the rule of law and quality of the
judiciary, the Morning Post said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dr. Seuss&#8217; The Lorax,&#8221; based on
the popular children&#8217;s book, was the top film in the U.S. and
Canada for a second weekend, generating $38.8 million in ticket
sales and outdrawing Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s &#8220;John Carter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;John Carter,&#8221; produced at an estimated cost of $250
million, according to IMDB.com, came in second with $30.2
million, researcher Hollywood.com Box Office said today in a
statement. Two other films opened this past weekend: the horror
film &#8220;Silent House&#8221; and Eddie Murphy&#8217;s &#8220;A Thousand Words.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend pitted Universal Pictures&#8217; &#8220;Lorax,&#8221; a film
with the biggest opening weekend this year, against the first
major disappointment of 2011. &#8220;John Carter,&#8221; Oscar-winning
animation director Andrew Stanton&#8217;s first live-action movie, was
expected to open with sales of $38.9 million, the estimate of
Box Office Mojo. The film had a 51 percent negative rating from
Rottentomatoes.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The film didn&#8217;t seem attractive to anybody outside of
hardcore science-fiction fans, and it&#8217;s not based on any
material that&#8217;s very relevant right now,&#8221; Gitesh Pandya, editor
of Boxofficeguru.com, said in a phone interview from New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Lorax,&#8221; by contrast, is drawing audiences because
&#8220;it&#8217;s colorful, it&#8217;s funny, it&#8217;s got some interesting star
power doing the voices, and there&#8217;s nothing else for kids out
there right now,&#8221; Pandya said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;John Carter&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &#8220;The Lorax,&#8221; written by the children&#8217;s author Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, a 12-year-old boy
battles to win the affection of a girl and restore nature in his
overly industrialized world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process, he learns the story of the Lorax, an
acerbic creature who tried to save trees from encroaching
developers. The computer-animated film from Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s
Universal Pictures unit features the voices of Danny DeVito,
Taylor Swift and Zac Efron. The film has taken in $121.7 million
since it opened on March 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;John Carter&#8221; tells the story of an American Civil War
veteran who suddenly finds himself on Mars. Empowered with great
strength because of the planet&#8217;s lighter gravity, he joins in a
conflict among its inhabitants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Project X,&#8221; the R-rated teen comedy from Time Warner
Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s Warner Bros., had $11.1 million in receipts in its second
week, placing third. The film, which follows three high school
seniors as they plan a birthday party that explodes into a drug-
fueled bash, has taken in $39.7 million since opening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Silent House&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Act of Valor,&#8221; the action picture starring real U.S.
Navy SEALs, dropped to fourth from third with $7.0 million. The
Relativity Media LLC film has generated $56.1 million in revenue
since it opened on Feb. 24. In the film, the commandos are out
to rescue a missing CIA agent played by Roselyn Sanchez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Silent House&#8221; had sales of $6.7 million to finish in
fifth place. The film features Elizabeth Olsen as a young woman
who is terrorized by an ominous presence in her family&#8217;s
secluded lake house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie was said to be shot in one continuous take over
88 minutes, unfolding in real time, according to the picture&#8217;s
website. It is distributed by Open Road Films, the joint venture
of Regal Entertainment Group (RGC) and AMC Entertainment Inc., the
largest U.S. cinema chains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murphy&#8217;s &#8220;A Thousand Words&#8221; collected $3.2 million in
sales to finish in 10th place. The comedian plays a slippery
literary agent who falls under a curse that limits the number of
words he has left to speak. The film, from Viacom Inc.&#8217;s
Paramount Pictures, also features Allison Janney and Clark Duke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coming Attraction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coming weekend, &#8220;21 Jump Street,&#8221; starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, makes its debut. The pair go undercover
as cops at a local high school to investigate a drug ring in
this comedy, inspired by the TV series of the same name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What they&#8217;re hoping to do is get older adults who
remember the TV show from the &#8217;80s, as well as younger adults
who will go in for the star power and the humor,&#8221; said Pandya.
&#8220;Chances are it will open at No. 1 and knock &#8216;The Lorax&#8217;&#8221; out
of the spot, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekend revenue for the top 12 films rose 0.4 percent to
$118 million from a year earlier, Hollywood.com said. For the
year, box-office sales have risen 18 percent to $2.01 billion
and attendance is up 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amounts below are based on actual ticket sales for
March 9 to March 11. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, named Justin Gmelich global
head of credit trading as part of management changes in the wake
of high-level departures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey L. Verschleiser will become global head of mortgage
trading, according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg
News. Gmelich and Verschleiser fill roles that were held by
Donald R. Mullen until his departure earlier this year. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, confirmed the
memo&#8217;s contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Russo, Michael Daffey, and R. Martin Chavez were named
co-chief operating officers of the equities division, according
to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promotions follow the departure earlier this year of
David B. Heller, who was the securities division chief with the
most experience in equities trading. Enrico Gaglioti was named
global head of equities sales, and John Willian will be global
head of securities services, futures, and clearing, according to
the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashok Varadhan, who was recently named to the firm&#8217;s
management committee, will become global head of macro trading,
encompassing currencies, interest-rate products and fixed-
income, currencies and commodities for emerging markets,
according to the memo. Kostas Pantazopoulos, who oversees global
interest-rate products trading, will take on oversight of macro
trading in Asia outside Japan, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sundaram, Burgin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ram Sundaram, global head of principal funding and
investment, also will manage fixed-income, currencies and
commodities trading in Latin America. Nick Burgin was named
global head of foreign exchange trading for group of 10 nations,
according to the memo. Those promotions follow the departure in
January of Edward K. Eisler, who had been a co-head of the
securities division with Heller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Cornacchia will become head of sales for fixed-
income, currencies and commodities in the Americas, according to
the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo was signed by Isabelle Ealet, Pablo J. Salame and
Harvey M. Schwartz, the three co-heads of the securities
division that accounts for most of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones reported on the changes earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in U.S. trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  fell 4.1 percent, the
most since March 5, to $15.76. The coal producer said production
was halted at its Kingston No. 2 coal mine in Fayette County,
West Virginia, after a miner suffered fatal injuries in a March
10 accident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthera Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ANTH)  slumped 45 percent,
the most in the Russell 2000 Index, to $3.56. The Hayward,
California-based company said it stopped a late-stage trial
evaluating its experimental treatment for heart disease because
it didn&#8217;t work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbo Ceramics Inc. (CRR)  rallied 4.3 percent to
$102.23, the highest price since Feb. 2. The maker of ceramic
granules was raised to equal-weight from underweight at Morgan
Stanley, which said demand concerns are overblown. The Equal-
weight rating means Morgan Stanley expects the stock&#8217;s risk-
adjusted total return in the next 12 to 18 months to be in line
with the average for industry companies covered by the analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynegy Inc. (DYN)  fell 35 percent to 50 cents, extending
a record low. The third-largest independent U.S. power
producer&#8217;s bankruptcy should be taken over by a court-approved
trustee who will better protect creditors, the U.S. Trustee
monitoring the case for the federal government said in court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equifax Inc. (EFX)  had the biggest gain in the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, climbing 3.4 percent to $44.09. The provider
of consumer-credit information was increased to buy from neutral
at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc., which said the company is
poised to deliver &#8220;sustainable above-average&#8221; growth in sales
and earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuelcell Energy Inc. (FCEL)  rose 7.3 percent, the most
since Feb. 22, to $1.61. The maker of fuel-cell power plants
jumped after Posco, the world&#8217;s third-largest steelmaker, agreed
to increase its stake in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG)  added 2.6 percent to $48.19,
the highest price since December 2007. The biggest U.S.
motorcycle maker had its share-price estimate boosted to $50
from $46 by Citigroup Inc., which said the company&#8217;s retail
sales have increased 16 percent to 18 percent so far in the
first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orexigen Therapeutics Inc. (OREX)  increased 19 percent,
the most since Sept. 21, to $4.39. The drugmaker, which is
developing obesity treatments, was raised to buy from neutral at
Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Capital Bancorp (PCBC)  rose the most in the
Russell 2000 Index, surging 57 percent to $45.03. The Santa
Barbara, California-based bank holding company agreed to be
bought by UnionBanCal Corp. (UB) (UB US), a San Francisco-based bank
with $89.7 billion in assets, for $1.5 billion, or $46 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velti Plc (VELT) (VELT US) increased 27 percent, the most since
January 2011, to $12.49. The mobile phone marketing company
reported fourth-quarter revenue of $87.1 million, beating the
average analyst estimate of $81.7 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoll Medical Corp. (ZOLL)  rallied 24 percent to $92.94,
the highest intraday price since it went public in July 1992.
The Chelmsford, Massachusetts-based maker of devices to help
revive patients agreed to be acquired by Asahi Kasei Corp. (3407) (3407
JP), a Japanese maker of synthetic fibers and industrial
chemicals, for $93 a share, or $2.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is tapping a &#8220;gusher of data&#8221; to achieve its 2015 growth
targets, Chief Executive Officer Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty said
in her first annual letter to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider is &#8220;well on
track&#8221; to its goal of generating at least $20 a share in
operating earnings by 2015, up from $13.44 last year, Rometty
reiterated in the 2011 annual report published over the weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty became the first female CEO in the company&#8217;s 100-
year history in January. She succeeded Sam Palmisano, inheriting
a five-year plan that includes boosting software to half of
IBM&#8217;s earnings, with a focus on programs that help businesses
analyze and project trends, as well as on cloud computing and
emerging growth markets. Palmisano remains as chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are uniquely positioned to deliver the benefits of a
vast new natural resource -- a gusher of data from both man-made
and natural systems that can now be tapped to help businesses
and institutions succeed in an increasingly complex and dynamic
global economy,&#8221; Rometty wrote. &#8220;Our strong strategic
positioning, solid balance sheet, recurring revenue, robust
profit streams and unmatched global reach give us confidence
that we will achieve success in the next five years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 0.2 percent to $201 at the close in New York. Last
week, the Armonk, New York-based company&#8217;s shares closed above
$200 for the first time, factoring in stock splits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Job Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM will continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and
&#8220;invest in market opportunities and drive productivity,&#8221;
according to the annual report. The company said costs from job
cuts will increase this year to the level they were in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company will continue to rebalance its workforce to
opportunities and skills aligned with its key investments and
hire resources to drive growth initiatives,&#8221; IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM didn&#8217;t provide details of job reductions. In 2010, it
booked $641 million of &#8220;workforce rebalancing charges.&#8221; That
figure fell to $440 million in 2011, the annual report shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 1,650 jobs were cut in the U.S. and Canada last
month, according to an employee advocacy group Alliance@IBM,
which has been trying to organize IBM employees. Redundant

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s vaccine Prevnar 13,
used to prevent pneumococcal diseases, was effective in children
ages 5 to 17 in a study that may help increase its use, the
company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been seeking to increase sales of Prevnar 13 by
expanding use beyond the approved groups of children 6 months to
5 years and adults older than 50. The treatment was New York-
based Pfizer&#8217;s third-best-selling medicine in 2011, with $3.66
billion in revenue. It will be Pfizer&#8217;s top product in 2013,
according to an average of two analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are excited about the potential to further define the
clinical utility of Prevnar 13 with the aim of seeking to
broaden prevention efforts to additional age groups,&#8221; said
Emilio Emini, chief scientific officer of vaccine research for
Pfizer. The study examined 598 patients ages 5 to 17 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pneumoccocal diseases are most dangerous for the very young
and very old, as well as people with heart and lung diseases,
diabetes, or HIV, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among children older than 5, the most likely to benefit
from the vaccine are those with conditions that put them at more
risk from illnesses, like heart and lung concerns, diabetes, or
HIV, said Robert Frenck, director of clinical medicine at the
Cincinnati Children&#8217;s Hospital Medical Center and lead author of
the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with expanded approvals, Pfizer is seeking to have
Prevnar 13 added to the CDC&#8217;s vaccine schedule for people over
50, which would increase use of the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer gained less than 1 percent to $21.54 at the close in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) paid Sam Palmisano $31.8 million in 2011, his last year as
chief executive officer before he was succeeded by Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano&#8217;s pay is little changed from the $31.7 million he
earned in 2010, according to a regulatory filing today. Annual
compensation includes salary, bonus, stock awards and options.
Rometty earned $8.34 million last year, when she was head of
sales and marketing, up from $6.4 million in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano, 60, boosted earnings during his tenure by
focusing on software and services and selling off assets
including the company&#8217;s personal-computer business. He was
Armonk, New York-based IBM&#8217;s longest-serving CEO who doesn&#8217;t
share the surname of the company&#8217;s founder, Thomas J. Watson.
Palmisano remains IBM&#8217;s chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty, 54, became the first female CEO in the company&#8217;s
100-year history when she succeededPalmisano, inheriting a
five-year plan that includes boosting software to half of IBM&#8217;s
earnings, with a focus on programs that help businesses analyze
and project trends, as well as on cloud computing and emerging
growth markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider is &#8220;well on
track&#8221; to its goal of generating at least $20 a share in
operating earnings by 2015, up from $13.44 last year, Rometty
reiterated in the 2011 annual report published over the weekend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim O&#8217;Neill, chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management (GSIT), lent his support to Brazilian policy
makers&#8217; efforts to weaken the real, saying it needs to decline
20 percent to keep Latin America&#8217;s biggest economy competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Brazil&#8217;s biggest cyclical challenge is to get rid of the
strength of the real,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill, 54, said in an interview in
London today. O&#8217;Neill, who created the BRIC acronym in 2001 to
describe the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and
China, said the currency needs to lose a fifth of its value to
be &#8220;sustainable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real strengthened 8.7 percent in the first two months
of the year against the U.S. dollar, the most among the 16 most-
traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Since the start of this
month, when Brazil boosted efforts to contain the rally, it was
the worst performer in the world, falling 5.2 percent, including
today&#8217;s 1.1 percent drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stronger currency hurts exporters by making goods more
expensive in dollar terms. Brazil today introduced its latest
measure to stem capital flows into the country, extending a 6
percent tax on foreign loans and bonds issued abroad to include
lending with a duration of as much as five years. The tax, which
originally applied to foreign borrowing of up to two years, had
already been extended on March 1 to include a duration of three
years or less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Monetary Tsunami&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Dilma Rousseff last week pledged to take all
necessary measures to shield the economy from a &#8220;monetary
tsunami&#8221; caused by what she said were efforts by Europe and the
U.S. to &#8220;artificially devalue&#8221; their currencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors and exporters have poured $15.5 billion into
Brazil since the beginning of the year, contributing to gains in
the currency, compared with an outflow of $3 billion in the
fourth quarter of 2011, according to the central bank&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central Bank President Alexandre Tombini&#8217;s March 7 decision
to cut the country&#8217;s benchmark Selic interest rate by 75 basis
points, or 0.75 percentage point, to 9.75 percent was &#8220;good,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neill said. At 4.28 percent, Brazil&#8217;s inflation-adjusted rate
is the highest in the Group of 20 nations after Russia,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real fell to 1.8093 per U.S. dollar at 4:10 p.m. in Sao
Paulo, from 1.7912 on March 9. The currency reached a 12-year
high of 1.5290 per dollar in July 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjusted for inflation, the exchange rate has more than
doubled against its trading partners since 2001, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate Index (JBXRBRL). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Imports &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency&#8217;s strength erodes the competitiveness of
Brazil&#8217;s manufacturers and spurs demand for cheaper imports. Car
imports surged 30 percent last year, accounting for 23.6 percent
of vehicles licensed compared with 18.8 percent in 2010.
Industrial production fell 3.4 percent in January from a year
ago, the most since September 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stem the currency&#8217;s rally, Brazilian policy makers in
the past two years have raised taxes on foreign investors in the
local fixed-income market, boosted costs for domestic companies
to borrow abroad, lowered the benchmark interest rate and
imposed a tax on trading currency derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, will hold a meeting of its
board in India for the first time as it completes a series of
trips to key developing markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12-member board, which typically holds a meeting every
year outside the U.S., will travel to New Delhi and Mumbai this
month, said Edward Naylor, a spokesman for the New York-based
bank. Directors have previously convened in China, Russia, the
Middle East and Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, who is also
chairman of the board, has made expansion in fast-growing
markets like Brazil, Russia, India and China -- the so-called
BRIC countries -- a priority. Goldman Sachs is hiring fastest in
China, India and Brazil, Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn,
who is also a board member, said at a presentation to investors
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India native Lakshmi Mittal, the 61-year-old chairman and
CEO of steel company ArcelorMittal (MT), has served on the Goldman
Sachs board since 2008. He is the world&#8217;s 18th-richest person,
with a fortune worth $22.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg
Billionaires Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lost money in Asia last year for the first
time since 2008 because of markdowns on the firm&#8217;s stock
investments in the region, especially a $517 million pretax loss
on the value of its stake in Industrial  Commercial Bank of
China Ltd., the firm disclosed in a filing earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times of India reported Goldman Sachs&#8217;s plans to hold a
board meeting in the country earlier today, citing Sonjoy Chatterjee, chairman and co-CEO of Goldman Sachs India.
Chatterjee, who joined Goldman Sachs from ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC), was
named to his current role a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Feroli, chief U.S.
economist at JPMorgan Chase  Co., said he cut his outlook for
growth during the first quarter to 1.5 percent from 2 percent
because of weak spending even as the labor market has improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Slower productivity growth&#8221; is responsible for job gains
amid a drop in U.S. growth from 3 percent in the fourth quarter,
Feroli said today on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220; Bloomberg
Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene. &#8220;We have a fair amount of
spending data right now for the first quarter for consumers and
business investment. It is adding up to a softer number.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers in the U.S. took on 227,000 workers in February,
completing the best six months for payroll growth since 2006,
Labor Department figures showed last week. U.S. growth is
expected to slow to 2.1 percent in the first quarter, according
to the average of 81 economists surveyed last month by Bloomberg
News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy may see &#8220;probably an acceleration in the
second quarter if energy prices can level off,&#8221; Feroli said.
&#8220;If 1.5 percent were to persist, it would be something to worry
about. But it could be a hiccup, hopefully in the pattern of
better growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve policy makers, who meet tomorrow, are
unlikely to start a third asset purchase program, known as
quantitative easing, in part because core inflation, excluding
food and energy prices, is near 2 percent, Feroli said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I do not think we are going to get QE tomorrow,&#8221; Feroli
said. &#8220;Something people are not talking about enough is that
core inflation has stabilized pretty close to the Fed&#8217;s target.
That is not arguing for more accommodation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said Feb. 29 that the labor
market remains &#8220;far from normal&#8221; and repeated that the main
interest rate is likely to stay exceptionally low at least
through the end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade will weigh on first quarter growth &#8220;more than we had
anticipated,&#8221; JPMorgan&#8217;s Daniel Silver said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The art collection of the late
Gunter Sachs, the German multimillionaire who was once married
to Brigitte Bardot, will be sold at a May auction in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 300 items, ranging from Pop Art works to Art Deco
furniture, will be offered on May 22-23 and are expected to
raise more than 20 million pounds ($31 million), New York-based
Sotheby&#8217;s said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale will include the Andy Warhol silkscreen paintings
&#8220;Flowers,&#8221; dating from 1964-65, and his 1974 portrait of
Bardot, based on a photo by Richard Avedon. Both are estimated
at 3 million pounds to 4 million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs committed suicide at his chalet in Gstaad,
Switzerland, at the age of 78, in May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bardot became the second of Sach&#8217;s three wives in 1966. The
German auto heir and ex-bobsleigh champion courted the actress
by flying over her Cote d&#8217;Azur home, La Madrague,
in a helicopter and bombing it with red roses. The couple
divorced three years later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warhol&#8217;s painting of Bardot, commissioned by Sachs, was
based on a 1959 Avedon picture of the French actress. One of the
35 original silver prints of the image is included in the sale,
priced at 40,000 pounds to 60,000 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Andy&#8217;s Wig &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs became a friend of Warhol after the two met in St.
Tropez in the early 1960s. Sachs organized an exhibition for the
artist at his own gallery in Hamburg in 1972. As none of the
works sold on the opening night, Sachs bought half the show to
save his friend&#8217;s embarrassment, said Sotheby&#8217;s. (BID) Warhol&#8217;s 1986
pink &#8220;Fright Wig,&#8221; one of the artist&#8217;s last self-portraits, is
valued at 2 million pounds to 3 million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells
Fargo  Co. joined U.S. banks raising dividends and authorizing
share repurchases after passing the Federal Reserve&#8217;s test of
how lenders would fare in an economic decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, will increase its
quarterly dividend 20 percent to 30 cents a share, the New York-
based company said today in a statement. The bank also
authorized a $15 billion stock-repurchase program, with $12
billion approved for 2012. Wells Fargo  Co., the most valuable
U.S. lender, increased its quarterly dividend by 83 percent to
22 cents a share, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is requiring the nation&#8217;s largest banks to show
they have credible plans for maintaining capital and continuing
lending in an economic downturn. The central bank said 15 of the
19 largest U.S. banks could maintain adequate capital levels
even in a recession scenario in which they continue to pay
dividends and buy back stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that 15 passed a robust test shows the relative
financial health of the system,&#8221; said Michael Holland, chairman
and founder of New York-based Holland  Co., which oversees more
than $4 billion including JPMorgan shares. &#8220;There has been so
much cash built up it almost screams to have some of it shared
with investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four firms that fell short by at least one measure
under the Fed&#8217;s stressed scenario were Citigroup Inc. (C), MetLife
Inc. (MET), Ally Financial Inc., and SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) Citigroup and
Ally plan to resubmit their capital plans this year, according
to statements from the lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Share Repurchases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s $15 billion in share repurchases would be
enough to buy back about 346 million shares at today&#8217;s closing
price. That represents about 9 percent of shares outstanding.
JPMorgan rose 7 percent, the most since November, to $43.39 in
New York. The bank was the biggest gainer on the 24-company KBW
Bank Index (BKX), which rose 4.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect to generate significant capital and deploy that
capital to the benefit of our shareholders,&#8221; JPMorgan Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo (WFC), based in San Francisco, won approval to
increase its share repurchases this year and to redeem certain
trust-preferred securities, according to its statement. The bank
didn&#8217;t say how many shares it would repurchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo rose 5.8 percent today, while Citigroup gained
6.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After almost three years of economic expansion, U.S. banks
have raised profits, rebuilt capital, and increased liquidity
after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008
threatened the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stress Scenario &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed said an unemployment rate of 13 percent, a 50
percent drop in stock prices and a 21 percent decline in house
prices under the stress scenario would produce aggregate losses
of $534 billion over nine quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with that blow, the 19 banks would see their Tier 1
common capital ratio -- a measure of bank strength against loss
-- fall to 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013 in the
hypothetical scenario, above the 5 percent minimum the Fed
required. The ratio was 10.1 percent in the third quarter of
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is night and day,&#8221; Jason Goldberg, senior analyst at
Barclays Capital Inc. in New York, said before the announcement.
&#8220;In 2009, about half the banks failed the stress test. The
industry&#8217;s capital position is higher today, and better quality.
There is a lot less leverage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, said regulators didn&#8217;t object to its plan to repurchase
common stock and potentially raise the dividend. The bank&#8217;s
statement didn&#8217;t give further details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smith Barney &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) said regulators didn&#8217;t object to its capital
plan, including the potential purchase of an additional piece of
the Smith Barney retail brokerage joint venture with Citigroup.
Morgan Stanley has the option to buy a 14 percent stake in May,
increasing its ownership to 65 percent, and can buy the business
outright over the next two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional banks announced plans to boost payouts. U.S.
Bancorp, Minnesota&#8217;s largest bank, increased its quarterly
dividend 56 percent to 19.5 cents a share and may buy back as
much as 100 million shares, it said in a statement. BBT Corp. (BBT),
based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, raised its quarterly
dividend 25 percent to 20 cents a share, according to a
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KeyCorp (KEY), the Cleveland-based lender, announced a $344
million share buyback and said it may raise its quarterly
dividend to 5 cents from 3 cents. PNC Financial Services Group
Inc. (PNC), based in Pittsburgh, said regulators had no objection to a
plan to raise its dividend. The board may consider an increase
at a meeting next month, PNC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;American Express &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express Co. (AXP), the biggest credit-card issuer by
customer spending, plans to boost its quarterly dividend 11
percent to 20 cents a share, and may repurchase as much as $5
billion of its stock within the next year, according to a
filing. The lender said it may buy back $4 billion of shares
this year and $1 billion in the first quarter of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regions Financial Corp. (RF), the Birmingham, Alabama-based
lender, plans to sell $900 million of its common stock to help
repay $3.5 billion of federal bailout funds. Regions said the
action was included in its capital plan submitted as part of the
stress tests, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed also subjected the six largest banks to a potential
global financial market shock. JPMorgan led the banks with an
estimated $27.7 billion in projected losses from mark-to-market
changes, credit valuation adjustments and counterparty default
losses, according to the Fed&#8217; scenario. The six banks had a
projected $116 billion in trading and counterparty losses,
larger than the 19 banks subjected to Fed&#8217;s stress tests had in
any lending area. &lt;/p&gt;

larger than the 19 banks subjected to Fed&#8217;s stress tests had in
any lending area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The relative size of losses across firms depends not on
nominal portfolio size, but rather on the specific risk
characteristics of each BHC&#8217;s trading positions, inclusive of
hedges,&#8221; the Fed said in the report. BHC stands for bank
holding company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed&#8217;s global financial market shock tested losses from
declines in positions held, counterparty defaults and charges
related to the deterioration of creditworthiness of trading
partners through the end of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. had a projected $21.1 billion of
trading and counterparty losses, Citigroup Inc. (C) had $20.9
billion, Morgan Stanley (MS) had $12.8 billion and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)
had $6.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed&#8217;s Assumptions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley
and Wells Fargo all maintained Tier 1 common ratios above the 5
percent required minimum under the Fed&#8217;s stress scenario.
Citigroup fell below the 5 percent threshold and said it will
resubmit its capital plan to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The losses were projected based on trading positions held
by the firms on a single day, generally Nov. 17, 2011, the Fed
said. Losses could have differed &#8220;perhaps significantly&#8221; from
choosing a different date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shock assumed increases in credit spreads on European
nations and financial institutions, with prices below any
observed levels, the Fed said. Losses tied to the widening of
those spreads largely related to counterparty risk, while direct
mark-to-market charges were &#8220;relatively small,&#8221; according to
the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said the Federal Reserve
didn&#8217;t object to its plan to repurchase common stock and
potentially raise the dividend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs released a statement today after the Fed
published a report showing that the New York-based company would
maintain minimum capital ratios even in a severe economic
downturn. The Fed&#8217;s stress tests measured how the capital
position, revenue and profit of the 19 biggest banks would be
affected by a recession.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
earlier today that it was raising its dividend and planning to
buy back more shares, leading the 24-company KBW Bank Index to
its biggest gain since November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MetLife Inc. (MET), the largest U.S. life
insurer, would fall short of a U.S. capital standard in a severe
economic downturn, the Federal Reserve said. The stock declined
in extended trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total risk-based capital ratio at the New York-based
insurer would be 6 percent, compared with the minimum acceptable
level of 8 percent, the Fed said today as part of a review of
how companies would withstand a &#8220;stress scenario.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetLife is one of four companies to fail the Fed&#8217;s
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which was applied to
19 of the largest U.S. financial firms. The insurer, which is
overseen by the Fed because of its banking operations, was
prevented by the regulator last year from increasing its annual
dividend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are deeply disappointed,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Steven Kandarian said in a statement today. &#8220;We do not believe
that the bank-centric methodologies used under the CCAR are
appropriate for insurance companies, which operate under a
different business model than banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer had requested approval for $2 billion in share
repurchases and an increase of its dividend to $1.10 a share
from 74 cents, according to the statement. Kandarian is winding
down banking operations and said he expects the company to have
as much as $7 billion of excess capital by the end of this year.
He said he remains &#8220;fully committed&#8221; to returning funds to
shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer slipped 3 percent to $38.28 at 4:57 p.m. in
extended trading in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, raised its dividend and authorized a share-repurchase
plan as banks respond to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s tests of how
lenders would fare in an economic decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s quarterly dividend will rise 20 percent to 30
cents a share, payable on April 30, the New York-based company
said today in a statement. It authorized a $15 billion stock-
repurchase program, with $12 billion approved for 2012. U.S.
Bancorp, Minnesota&#8217;s largest bank, also boosted its payout and
announced a buyback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect to generate significant capital and deploy that
capital to the benefit of our shareholders,&#8221; JPMorgan Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is requiring the nation&#8217;s largest lenders to show
they have credible plans for maintaining capital and continuing
lending in an economic downturn. JPMorgan said the Fed told the
company it completed its review and &#8220;did not object&#8221; to the
bank&#8217;s capital plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan rose 7 percent, the most since November, to $43.39
at 4:10 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank didn&#8217;t disclose how it performed on the stress
test. Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment beyond the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) shareholders, after
weighing protests by two proxy advisers and a state treasurer,
elected all 10 nominees to the board, including Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders representing at least 73 percent of the votes
present backed the nominees, the Burbank, California-based theme
park, film and television company said at today&#8217;s annual meeting
in Kansas City, Missouri, citing preliminary data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stock&#8217;s at $43, we&#8217;re happy,&#8221; Roy Patrick Disney
said in an interview at the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voting signaled management at Disney, the world&#8217;s
largest entertainment company, continues to enjoy the support of
investors, with a few exceptions. Disney said on March 1 that
the stock has at least doubled what comparable companies have
returned since October 2005, when Iger took over as CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockholders approved the company&#8217;s executive pay plan in
an advisory vote, with 57 percent of the shares present backing
the proposal. Last year&#8217;s vote drew 77 percent approval, proxy
adviser Glass Lewis  Co. said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Connecticut
Treasurer Denise L. Nappier opposed four members of the
governance and nominating committee. Glass Lewis opposed
compensation panel members, citing deficient link between
performance and executive pay, and a fifth nominee, Orin Smith,
who served on the audit committee of a seized lender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) led bank
stocks to their best gain since November after the company, the
largest U.S. lender by assets, raised its dividend and said it
would buy back more shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan advanced 6.9 percent to $43.34 as of 3:33 p.m. in
New York. Citigroup Inc. (C) added 6.7 percent, while Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC), Bank of America Corp. (BAC), KeyCorp and Zions Bancorporation
each rose more than 5 percent. The 24-company KBW Bank Index (BKX)
surged as much as 4.7 percent for its best gain since November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors were awaiting public release of Federal Reserve
stress tests later this week when New York-based JPMorgan
boosted its quarterly dividend 20 percent and authorized a $15

percent of the stock outstanding at yesterday&#8217;s closing price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said the Fed told the company it completed its

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
pay $7 million to resolve regulatory claims it failed to
properly supervise commodities trading accounts, the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator accused the New York-based firm&#8217;s Goldman
Sachs Execution  Clearing LP unit of failing to supervise
subaccounts managed from 2007 to 2009 by a broker-dealer that
had engaged in &#8220;questionable conduct,&#8221; the CFTC said in a
statement today. Goldman Sachs agreed to disgorge $1.5 million
in fees and commissions it had collected from the broker and pay
a $5.5 million civil penalty, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When registrants become aware of questionable activity,
they must not simply rely on assurances from interested parties
and their representatives, but instead must diligently
investigate,&#8221; said David Meister, the CFTC&#8217;s enforcement chief,
in a statement. &#8220;As this case indicates, the Commission will
hold registrants accountable if they fail in this regard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its first-quarter financial disclosures last year,
Goldman Sachs disclosed its cooperation with an ongoing CFTC
investigation into supervision of a client broker-dealer. The
CFTC said Goldman Sachs &#8220;knew or should have known that the
client&#8217;s subaccounts maintained at GSEC were actually accounts
belonging to customers of the broker-dealer client and not the
client&#8217;s proprietary accounts,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment on the settlement. The company resolved the
claims without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the CFTC said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lender also authorized a new $15 billion stock buyback
program, of which up to $12 billion is approved for this year
and up to an additional $3 billion is approved through the end
of the first quarter of 2013. JPMorgan said the Federal Reserve

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, temporarily halted raising a $750 million
fund to buy distressed real estate assets, said a person
familiar with the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund, operated through a division called Junius Real
Estate Partners, made an initial investment, in Salamander
Resort  Spa, a 168-room hotel in Middleburg, Virginia, that&#8217;s
scheduled to open in 2013, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the fundraising is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor appetite for real estate funds has declined amid
slow economic growth, with $48.7 billion raised last year, about
one-third the amount gathered in 2008, according to London-based
Preqin Ltd., which researches private investment funds. At the
same time, more fund managers are competing for capital to
pursue investments following a decline in property values. There
are 406 funds trying to raise more than $169 billion, Preqin
said in a March 2 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristen Chambers, a spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan Asset
Management, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suspension in fundraising was reported earlier today by
the Wall Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biocon Ltd. (BIOS), India&#8217;s biggest
biotechnology company, slumped the most in almost three months
after an insulin distribution agreement with Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biocon fell 6.3 percent to 250.75 rupees, the most since
Dec. 19, at the close in Mumbai. The stock was the biggest loser
in the 19-member BSE India Healthcare Index. (BSETHC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All rights to the products returned to Biocon yesterday and
insulin under the Univia and Glarvia brands will now be sold by
the Indian company, the two drugmakers said in a joint statement
today. Biocon received $100 million in upfront payments in
October 2010 after Pfizer agreed to sell four of the Bangalore-
based company&#8217;s medications globally while another $100 million
was kept in escrow pending certain milestones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change &#8220;negatively impacts&#8221; prospects for Biocon&#8217;s
insulin products, particularly in developed markets such as the
U.S. and Europe, Bino Pathiparampil, an analyst at IIFL Ltd.
wrote in a note to clients. As part of the settlement, Biocon
will keep all the upfront and milestone payments it has received
and that should help &#8220;neutralize the impact,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 10 percent of the estimated 366 million people
affected by diabetes worldwide have the Type 1 form that&#8217;s
marked by the inability to produce insulin, a hormone that turns
blood sugar into energy, according to the International Diabetes
Federation in Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Alliances &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Biocon will continue to work with its existing partners
in several markets and will pursue a commercial strategy on its
own and through new alliances in other markets,&#8221; Chairman Kiran Mazumdar Shaw said in a statement. The two drugmakers have
agreed it is in their &#8220;best interest to move forward
independently,&#8221; the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Biocon was aimed at helping Pfizer, the
world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, tap the more than $14 billion global
market for insulin, which is dominated by Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB),
Sanofi and Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A change of business priorities at Pfizer led to the end of
the pact, Shaw said in an interview on the Bloomberg UTV
television channel today. Biocon received a &#8220;substantial
portion&#8221; of the $100 million kept in escrow, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, will continue developing a
portfolio of medicines both internally and through
collaborations, Diem Nguyen, Pfizer&#8217;s general manager for
biosimilars, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will continue to be active in our own research and
business development efforts for diabetes, which represents a
huge unmet medical need,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB), the world&#8217;s
biggest insulin manufacturer, rose to a record-high in
Copenhagen trading after Pfizer Inc. (PFE) pulled out of a deal to
sell diabetics products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novo rose as much as 1.1 percent to 812 kroner, an all-time
high. The stock advanced 4.5 kroner, or 0.6 percent, to 807.50
kroner at 11:08 a.m. in the Danish capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, yesterday returned
products rights to Biocon Ltd. (BIOS) Pfizer agreed in October 2010 to
pay $200 million to the Bangalore-based company for four types
of insulin, including a generic version of Novo&#8217;s NovoLog.
Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based Novo generates about three-quarters of
its annual revenue from sales from its diabetes care unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see this news as a clear positive for Novo,&#8221; Michael Novod, a Copenhagen-based analyst with Nordea Markets, said in a
note today, repeating a strong buy recommendation on Novo
shares. &#8220;We believe this highlights how difficult and
challenging it is -- and will be -- to bring competitive
biosimilar insulins to the U.S. and EU markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is proving
that banks aren&#8217;t destined to be also-rans in the $12 trillion
mutual fund business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company in 2011 became the first bank to crack the list
of 10 largest U.S. stock and bond fund managers, according to
research firm Strategic Insight. Under global funds chief George Gatch, JPMorgan&#8217;s lineup posted higher net sales growth as a
percentage of assets than any other firm with at least $50
billion, even as the bank spurned the charge by investors into
index funds and posted middle-of-the-pack fund returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their performance as an asset gatherer has been
phenomenal,&#8221; Geoff Bobroff, a mutual fund consultant in East
Greenwich, Rhode Island, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Their
fund performance isn&#8217;t one to gather a lot of attention, but
they&#8217;re solid from a business standpoint.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While rival banks sought to sell asset management units
following the financial crisis, JPMorgan escaped relatively
unscathed, allowing it to spend on the unit and lift long-term
fund assets by 160 percent since 2008. The largest U.S. bank by
assets succeeded in part by courting financial advisers to
complement its in-house sales force and by offering hedge-fund-
like products that have become more popular as investors flee
traditional stock funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds owned by banks, brokerages and insurers have lost
ground over the past decade to pure money managers such as
Vanguard Group Inc. and Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asset management unit, which also includes money funds
and separate accounts for institutions and wealthy investors,
produced 11 percent of JPMorgan&#8217;s $21.5 billion in fourth-
quarter revenue and 8.1 percent of its profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Avenue of Growth&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s still a relatively small piece in terms of its total
contribution to earnings, but it&#8217;s an avenue of growth at a time
when growth in traditional banking has been constricted,&#8221; said
Shannon Stemm, an analyst at Edward D. Jones  Co. in St. Louis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net deposits of $17.9 billion in 2011 were the third-
highest dollar amount in the industry, trailing only those of
Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based Vanguard and Pacific Investment
Management Co. in Newport Beach, California, according to data
compiled by Morningstar Inc. As JPMorgan&#8217;s long-term fund assets
grew to $139 billion, the firm climbed four spots on the
research company&#8217;s list, leapfrogging rivals including 10th-
ranked OppenheimerFunds Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to remain in the top five in net flows every year
for the foreseeable future,&#8221; Gatch said in an interview at his
New York office. &#8220;If we do that, we&#8217;re well-positioned as the
markets normalize.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanguard, with $1.31 trillion in stock and bond mutual
funds as of Dec. 31, is the biggest manager, followed by Los
Angeles-based Capital Group Cos.&#8217; American Funds, Boston&#8217;s
Fidelity Investments and Pimco. The data exclude money market
funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ignoring Indexing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s success has come through a mix of old and new
strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatch, 49, who joined the firm in 1986 and took over the
mutual funds business in 2001, has driven growth in part through
an internal sales force of financial advisers who can sell the
firm&#8217;s funds as well as those of rivals, a fading approach that
some observers say creates a conflict of interest. He&#8217;s also
pouring resources into capturing business from independent
registered investment advisers, or RIAs, the fastest-growing
competitor to traditional brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatch has done it almost exclusively with actively run
funds, another anachronism. U.S. investors pumped 2 1/2 times as
much money into index-tracking funds, including exchange-traded
products, in the past five years as they did into those whose
managers pick securities. That leaves JPMorgan winning more
business in a shrinking portion of the funds industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Imaginative&#8217; and &#8216;Aggressive&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the bank has been innovative in designing
funds that bring institutional-style investing options to
individual customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, it opened JPMorgan U.S. Large Cap Core Plus (JLPSX), a so-
called 130/30 fund designed to bet on stocks rising and
declining, and JPMorgan Tax Aware Real Return, which combines
inflation and tax protection. The firm&#8217;s go-anywhere absolute-
return bond fund, JPMorgan Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (JSOAX),
was started in October 2008 and has $13 billion in assets. The
$2.45 billion Highbridge Dynamic Commodities Strategy, a fund
that can wager on or against commodity-linked securities, began
in January 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the whole, they&#8217;ve had good performance, they&#8217;ve been
imaginative in the funds they&#8217;ve opened and been very aggressive
in marketing them,&#8221; Burton Greenwald, a mutual fund consultant
in Philadelphia, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the global financial crisis, rivals
including Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. (C) cut jobs and
sold off units to raise capital, leaving JPMorgan the biggest
bank by assets by the end of last year&#8217;s third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marketing Push &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its relative good health has allowed the firm to commit
more resources to asset management. Spending on sales and
marketing will rise 10 percent this year compared with 2011,
according to Gatch and his institutional counterpart, Michael
O&#8217;Brien. They declined to disclose dollar figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to its stock and bond mutual funds, JPMorgan
managed $293 billion for institutions as of Dec. 31, up 15
percent in two years. The company also runs money market funds
and institutional cash products holding about $456 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatch casts the rise of JPMorgan funds as a turnaround that
began soon after the bank&#8217;s 2006 purchase of Bank One Corp. The
deal led to the largest merger of mutual fund companies to that
point, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The two bank fund families were muddling along,&#8221; Gatch
said. &#8220;We changed our expectations and objectives.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emphasis on Research &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combined lineup was trimmed almost immediately by 14
percent, to 122 funds. Sales teams were rebuilt and refocused on
backing up products with market analysis and investing guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were trying to train people in things that weren&#8217;t our
expertise, like practice management and estate planning,&#8221; Gatch
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is appealing to RIAs by establishing a reputation
for putting research first and the hard-sell second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the bank hired David Kelly as chief market
strategist and started his &#8220;Dr. Kelly&#8221; series of online audio
and video reports. Kelly, who has a Ph.D. in economics from
Michigan State University, held an Aug. 8 conference call for
advisers on Standard  Poor&#8217;s downgrade of U.S. debt that
attracted 7,900 participants. The firm also stages invitation-
only seminars for financial advisers in which strategists,
portfolio managers and analysts make presentations and answer
questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They realized that top RIAs want to be treated like
institutional clients,&#8221; said Donald Phillips, managing director
of Chicago-based Morningstar. &#8220;They want information and
commentary. They don&#8217;t want sales pitches.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Independent Advisory Channel &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deposits through RIAs grew by 30 percent last year, said
Kristen Chambers, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, who declined to
disclose the dollar volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of the RIA has accompanied a decline among
brokerages. The amount of money fee-only RIAs in the U.S.
oversee increased by 25 percent to $1.3 trillion in the three
years through 2010, the latest year for which data were
available, according to Cerulli Associates in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the same period, client assets at the four largest
broker-dealers, known as wirehouses, fell by 12 percent to $4.78
trillion even as the firms gradually shifted to fee-based client
accounts. The money overseen by bank-owned broker-dealers such
as JPMorgan&#8217;s decreased by 12 percent to $464.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Supermarket&#8217; Era Ends &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grip of big advisory networks on mutual fund sales has
also loosened. As recently as the 1990s, brokers, banks and
insurance companies dominated the top 20 spots among U.S. mutual
fund families, when money funds are included in total assets.
That changed as competition, regulatory scrutiny and the decline
of the &#8220;financial supermarket&#8221; model at companies such as
Citigroup Inc. led many distributors to sell their in-house fund
brands, Loren Fox, a senior research analyst at Strategic
Insight in New York, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The split between the advisory and investment management
businesses gathered momentum in the past five years as
brokerages moved toward a fee-based business, which meant more
of their representatives had a legal duty to act in the best
interest of clients, Bobroff said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential Conflicts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a fiduciary, the conflict is substantial, and thus all
the divorces,&#8221; Bobroff said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, then part-owner of brokerage Morgan Stanley (MA)
Smith Barney, sold its money management business to Legg Mason
Inc. (LM) in 2005. Merrill Lynch unloaded its mutual funds to
BlackRock Inc. (BLK) in 2006, and Morgan Stanley (MS) sold its retail funds
business to Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan not only hasn&#8217;t abandoned proprietary fund sales,
it has beefed up its sales force. The number of financial
advisers at the Chase retail banking network; JPMorgan Private
Bank, which caters to ultra-high-net-worth clients; and JPMorgan
Securities, a brokerage unit, has grown by 48 percent in the
past three years to 5,220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal sales channels account for about 20 percent of
net deposits to JPMorgan&#8217;s mutual funds, Gatch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other top 10 families, only Columbia, owned by
Minneapolis-based Ameriprise Financial Inc., has a related unit
of financial advisers offering its funds alongside those run by
others. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. is the only
wirehouse with a funds unit on Morningstar&#8217;s list of the 50
largest families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Opposite Direction&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The whole industry has been moving in just the opposite
direction,&#8221; Greenwald said. &#8220;As long as their funds perform
well, they&#8217;re OK, but there&#8217;s a real or implied conflict of
interest when you sell your own brand of funds. If performance
falls, it could be an issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t enjoy any advantage over competitors
offered at Chase and the private bank, as sales agents have no
extra incentives to sell in-house funds, according to Gatch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We operate on a level playing field with other investment
management firms,&#8221; he said. Gatch chalked up the internal sales
to his staff&#8217;s insight into the needs of Chase clients and
JPMorgan&#8217;s ability to deliver a product &#8220;as good, if not
dramatically better, than what our competitors offer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan funds have been solid, albeit unspectacular,
Greenwald said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bond Fund Strength &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock and bond funds, on average, beat 47 percent of
competitors in 2011, 53 percent over the past three years, 56
percent over five years and 57 percent over 10 years, according
to Morningstar. The data, which isn&#8217;t weighted by assets,
exclude funds of funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan funds aim to produce consistent risk-adjusted
returns, Gatch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re not going to blow you up, but they&#8217;re not going
to place you in the top rankings,&#8221; Rob Wherry, a Morningstar
analyst, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The returns of the firm&#8217;s four biggest funds, all of which
focus on bonds, have generally been stronger. They beat 57
percent of competitors in 2011, 38 percent over three years, 81
percent over five years and 80 percent over 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their fixed income is certainly what stands out,&#8221; Wherry
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s largest fund is the $24.9 billion JPMorgan Core
Bond Fund (WOBDX), managed by Douglas Swanson. The fund outperformed 84
percent of rivals in the five years ended Dec. 31, with an
average annual return of 7 percent, according to Morningstar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Multiple Boutiques&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest stock fund is the $7.31 billion Mid-Cap Value
Fund (FLMVX), which bested 85 percent of rivals over five years with an
average annual return of 2 percent. The fund is managed by a
team led by Jonathan Simon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan funds are run by autonomous investment operations
including fixed-income teams in Cincinnati; Columbus, Ohio;
Boston; and London, as well as equity groups in New York, London
and Hong Kong. All manage strategies for both individual and
institutional clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The business is built on multiple boutiques sitting on
one industrial-strength platform,&#8221; O&#8217;Brien said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Brien, like Gatch, has worked to beef up sales efforts,
while focusing more on customers outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When O&#8217;Brien, 48, took his post in 2010, 65 percent to 70
percent of institutional assets came from U.S. clients. He said
he is seeking to increase international assets to 50 percent by
2015, with sales targets including defined-benefit pension funds
in Europe, global insurance companies and sovereign wealth
funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Passive Plans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has no interest in building its own passive
investing unit, regardless of the popularity of index funds,
O&#8217;Brien said. He didn&#8217;t rule out entering the business via
acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatch was less enthusiastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Does beta have a place? Sure,&#8221; Gatch said, referring to
investments designed to match market returns. &#8220;In some cases
we&#8217;ll use ETFs in diverse portfolios that we manage. But we
think we&#8217;re going to do a better job for investors if we
maintain our focus exclusively on active management.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, when Greg Smith arrived
at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) almost 12 years ago, the legendary
investment firm was something like the Make-A-Wish Foundation --
existing only to bring light and peace and happiness to the
world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, who was executive director and head of the firm&#8217;s
U.S. equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, does not go into details in his already notorious op-ed
article in Wednesday&#8217;s New York Times, &#8220;Why I Am Leaving Goldman
Sachs.&#8221; But one imagines Goldman bankers spending their days
delivering fresh flowers to elderly shut-ins and providing
shelters for abandoned cats. Serving clients was paramount. &#8220;It
wasn&#8217;t just about making money,&#8221; Smith writes. &#8220;It had something
to do with pride and belief in the organization.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must have been a terrible shock when Smith concluded
that Goldman actually was primarily about making money. He
spares us the sordid details, but apparently it took more than a
decade for the scales to finally fall from his eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says that Goldman has changed. &#8220;Culture was always a
vital part of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s success. It revolved around
teamwork, integrity, a spirit of humility, and always doing
right by our clients.&#8221; And he warns: &#8220;Without clients you will
not make money. In fact, you will not exist.&#8221; It&#8217;s tragic that
Goldman is losing an employee who realizes that you need
customers to stay in business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what an employee! He worked at Goldman as an intern in
college and worked there continuously until today. &#8220;I was
selected as one of 10 people (out of a firm of more than 30,000)
to appear on our recruiting video, which is played on every
college campus we visit around the world.&#8221; Then there was being
&#8220;a Rhodes Scholar national finalist&#8221; and &#8220;winning a bronze medal
for table tennis at the Maccabiah Games in Israel, known as the
Jewish Olympics.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have some advice for Smith, as well as the thousands of
college students who apply to work at Goldman Sachs each year:
If you want to dedicate your life to serving humanity, do not go
to work for Goldman Sachs. That&#8217;s not its function, and it never
will be. Go to work for Goldman Sachs if you wish to work hard
and get paid more than you deserve even so. (Or if you want to
make your living selling derivatives but don&#8217;t know what a
derivative is, as Smith concedes in passing that he didn&#8217;t at
first.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman and other investment banks do perform an important
role in our economy, and Goldman bankers -- most of them, at
least -- can hold their heads up high. But it is not charity
work. Goldman&#8217;s clients are mostly very well-off. Smith&#8217;s lament
that the bank no longer serves their needs above and beyond its
own does not tug at our heartstrings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects to remove reference to debt collateral in third
paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, is leading more than $9 billion of bond sales after
announcing a 20 percent dividend increase and an equity buyback
program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is marketing three-year benchmark notes that are
expected to yield 130 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the offering who
asked not to be identified because terms are not set. A
benchmark bond is at least $500 million in size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Lease Finance Corp. (ILFC), the plane-leasing unit
of American International Group Inc. (AIG), is also selling three- and
seven-year senior notes, according to a person familiar with
that transaction who also asked not to be identified because the
terms are not set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which the Federal Reserve said yesterday had
passed its stress test for capital adequacy under an &#8220;extremely
adverse&#8221; economic scenario, announced a $15 billion equity
buyback as yields at about record lows offer attractive
borrowing rates for companies. Investment-grade bonds yield 3.49
percent, within 10 basis points of the all-time low of 3.4
percent reached on March 2, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S Corporate Master index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When a credit has wind at its back, it can do whatever it
wants in the market,&#8221; Timothy Cox, executive director of debt
capital markets at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York, said
about the JPMorgan bond sale in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Very Anxious&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank is leading more than $9 billion of
debt sales today, following issuance of $60.1 billion last week,
the most in records going back to 1999, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Treasurers have been very anxious to tap the market,&#8221;
Cox said. &#8220;Some people think &#8216;if I don&#8217;t get in here now, I may
miss the boat.&#8217; &#8221; Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. issued $1.5
billion of five-year, 2.55 percent notes yesterday, Bloomberg
data show. Cox, who helped manage the sale, said that investors
placed orders for almost $7 billion of bonds. &#8220;The new-issue
market still is green for go,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan announced a five-cent increase in its quarterly
dividend to 30 cents a share. It authorized $12 billion of stock
buybacks for 2012. The firm was among 15 major banks that passed
the Fed&#8217;s stress test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ILFC&#8217;s three-year notes are expected to yield 5.125 percent
and the seven-year debt may pay 6.125 percent, said the person
familiar with the offering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The California State Teachers&#8217;
Retirement System, the second-largest U.S. public pension fund,
opposed Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s executive-pay plan and the decision to
combine the roles of chairman and chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping the top jobs separate is in the best interest of
the company and shareholders, Calstrs Director of Corporate
Governance Anne Sheehan said in a statement today. The media
company&#8217;s performance is disconnected from its pay practices,
the West Sacramento, California-based pension fund said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calstrs&#8217;s opposition put it among 43 percent of holders
that voted against the compensation package, based on a
preliminary count supplied by Burbank, California-based Disney.
Investors approved all 10 nominees at yesterday&#8217;s annual
meeting, including CEO Robert Iger, who also became chairman. He
was re-elected with 97 percent approval, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calstrs, with $149 billion in assets, is second to the
California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System among U.S.
pension funds. The teachers&#8217; fund holds about 5 million Disney
shares, worth $191 million, its statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No board nominees got less than 73 percent support from
shareholders, the company said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calpers supported all Disney nominees and its pay plan,
according to Wayne Davis, a spokesman. The fund owns 5.7 million
shares, said Brad Pacheco, another spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest theme-park operator and owner
of Pixar, ABC and ESPN, hasn&#8217;t had a single person with both
titles since 2004, when then-CEO Michael Eisner gave up the
chairman position under pressure from shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iger&#8217;s Pay &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger received $33.4 million in total compensation last
year, according to company filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six percent of Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 companies garnered
less than 60 percent support for executive-pay plans last year,
according to Say-on-Pay.com, a website about shareholder issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive pay is &#8220;entirely in line with&#8221; peers including
CBS Corp. (CBS) and Comcast Corp., Disney said in a March 1 filing.
Naming Iger chairman will &#8220;enable a healthy mentoring process&#8221;
for succession, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney lost 1.2 percent to $43.48 at the close in New York
today. The shares have gained 16 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A departing Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) employee mounted an unprecedented public attack on its
&#8220;toxic and destructive&#8221; culture in a New York Times opinion
piece, becoming the first serving insider to openly criticize
the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Smith, identified by the newspaper as an executive
director and head of the bank&#8217;s U.S. equity derivatives business
in Europe, will leave the firm after 12 years, blaming Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn
for losing hold over the firm&#8217;s culture. Executive directors are
junior to managing directors and partners, the most senior rank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I attend derivatives sales meetings where not one single
minute is spent asking questions about how we can help
clients,&#8221; Smith, a Stanford University graduate, wrote in the
New York Times. &#8220;It&#8217;s purely about how we can make the most
possible money off of them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack adds to criticism from politicians and
protesters who blame the company for triggering the financial
crisis and profiting at clients&#8217; expense. Goldman Sachs has
faced congressional hearings probing its role in the financial
crisis and paid $550 million in 2010 to settle a lawsuit
accusing it of misleading investors in a collateralized debt
obligation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Heartfelt Piece&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will certainly be damaging for the firm,&#8221; said John Purcell, founder of London-based executive search firm Purcell 
Co. &#8220;It&#8217;s obviously a very heartfelt piece. Maybe he&#8217;s made a
sufficient amount of money in his life that he isn&#8217;t
particularly bothered if he isn&#8217;t employed in financial services
again and works in a completely different world like teaching.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell $4.17, or 3.4 percent, to $120.37 in New
York trading at 1:34 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to Smith&#8217;s mobile phone in London wasn&#8217;t answered.
Goldman Sachs said it disagreed with his criticism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In our view, we will only be successful if our clients
are successful,&#8221; the firm said in a statement. &#8220;This
fundamental truth lies at the heart of how we conduct
ourselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It makes me ill how callously people talk about ripping
their clients off,&#8221; Smith wrote. &#8220;&#8216;Over the last 12 months I
have seen five different managing directors refer to their own
clients as &#8216;&#8216;muppets,&#8217;&#8217; sometimes over internal e-mail.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Not Shocking&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein and Cohn addressed the criticism in a memo to
employees today. &#8216;&#8216;In a company of our size, it is not shocking
that some people could feel disgruntled,&#8217;&#8217; they said in the
memo. &#8216;&#8216;A recent survey of employees found that 89 percent
believe the firm provides &#8216;exceptional service&#8217; to clients and
that a similar percentage of the firm&#8217;s 12,000 vice presidents,
the rank held by Smith, felt that way, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees are allowed to express concerns anonymously,
according to the memo. &#8216;&#8216;We are not aware that the writer of the
opinion piece expressed misgivings through this avenue, however,
if an individual expresses issues, we examine them carefully and
we will be doing so in this case,&#8217;&#8217; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith blamed the company&#8217;s management for promoting
employees who made money for the firm, often by getting
customers to buy products that Goldman Sachs was trying to get
rid of. If clients can&#8217;t trust the firm, they will stop doing
business with it, however smart its employees, Smith wrote in
the Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Spirit of Humility&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Culture was always a vital part of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
success,&#8221; he wrote in the New York Times. &#8220;It revolved around
teamwork, integrity, a spirit of humility, and always doing
right by our clients,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t just about making
money; this alone will not sustain a firm for so long. It had
something to do with pride and belief in the organization. I am
sad to say that I look around today and see virtually no trace
of the culture that made me love working for this firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s score was among the lowest in a recent
study of corporate reputations, according to a Feb. 13 statement
from Harris Interactive Inc. (HPOL), a market research firm. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki" date="Mar 14, 2012 11:49 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-14/jpmorgan-s-premature-disclosure-surprises-investors-irks-fed.html"><headline>JPMorgan Dividend Surprises Investors, Irks Fed</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, surprised investors and the Federal Reserve when the
firm announced two days early that it received regulatory
approval for a 20 percent dividend increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan surged 7 percent on yesterday&#8217;s news, which helped
drive up the shares of competitors and major stock indexes. The
central bank, which tested 19 of the largest U.S. financial
firms to gauge their ability to withstand another severe
economic downturn, decided to release the results at 4:30 p.m.
in Washington, also two days ahead of schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s disclosure prompted other lenders, including
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group
Inc. (PNC), to accelerate the disclosure of their dividend plans. It
also irritated some staff at the Fed, which had planned to
release the test results ahead of the industry, said one person
familiar with the central bank&#8217;s operations who declined to be
identified because the discussions were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It certainly lit a fire under the other bank holding
companies, especially the problem institutions which thought
they had more time to cushion the blow,&#8221; said Karen Shaw Petrou, a co-founder and managing partner at Washington-based
Federal Financial Analytics Inc., a regulatory consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Placing Blame &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s news release, published at 3:04 p.m. in New
York, was the result of less-than-perfect communication between
the company and the Fed and wasn&#8217;t related to the regulator&#8217;s
accelerated announcement of the stress-test results, a senior
Fed official told reporters on a conference call. The central
bank doesn&#8217;t fault JPMorgan or anyone for the move, the official
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbara Hagenbaugh, a Fed spokeswoman, and JPMorgan&#8217;s Joe Evangelisti declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news caught the markets and industry analysts, who were
preparing for a March 15 release date, off guard. Brian Foran, a
senior bank analyst at Nomura Securities, compared the
experience to the wait for his newborn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As many of you know I recently had a baby,&#8221; Foran said
in an e-mail to clients. &#8220;It was remarkably similar to having a
stress test -- you work towards a due date but the reality is it
can come at any moment. And once it does, your sleep schedule is
immediately impaired.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Started to Leak &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed officials told bank executives earlier yesterday that
they were concerned that some of the results had started to leak
to the public and decided to release the results after U.S.
markets had closed, according to two people who were briefed on
the calls. The release was moved up amid concern that some
information about the test may have been released inadvertently,
said a senior Fed official, who didn&#8217;t elaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other banks subject to the test were waiting until after
the Fed&#8217;s results were out to announce their capital plans, said
one of the people and a senior Fed official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, boosted its dividend to 30 cents a share, from 25 cents,
and authorized a $15 billion share repurchase plan after passing
the stress test, the New York-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investors said it looked like an act of defiance by
Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jamie Dimon basically thumbed his nose at the Fed,&#8221; said
Charlie Smith, who oversees $1.2 billion as chief investment
officer of Fort Pitt Capital Group Inc. in Pittsburgh. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what he does, and he&#8217;s got the balance sheet to do it. He&#8217;s got
enough of the cards to say, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to do what I want even if
it&#8217;s going to force the Fed to come out with its announcement
early.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bernanke Confirmation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who turned 56 yesterday, publicly confronted Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke last year over the central bank&#8217;s move
to increase capital requirements on lenders, asking whether
overzealous regulation had gone too far and was curbing economic
growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have a great fear someone&#8217;s going to try to write a
book in 20 years, and the book is going to talk about all the
things that we did in the middle of the crisis to actually slow
down recovery,&#8221; Dimon told the Fed chairman during a June
banking conference in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s Tier 1 capital ratios fell to a low of 5.4
percent under the Fed&#8217;s most adverse scenario, above the 5
percent threshold required to pass the test, the Fed said
yesterday. The central bank projected that JPMorgan&#8217;s home
loans, credit cards and other debt could decline by $55.8
billion while trading and derivatives operations would lose
$27.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unemployment Rate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst-case scenario includes a U.S. unemployment rate
as high as 13 percent and a 20 percent drop in home prices,
according to the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank required the nation&#8217;s largest lenders to
show they have credible plans for maintaining capital and
continuing lending in an economic downturn. JPMorgan said the
Fed told the company it completed its review and &#8220;did not
object&#8221; to the bank&#8217;s capital plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Fed is basically releasing examination data showing
who are the good guys and who are the bad guys, and that&#8217;s going
to drive money away from the weaker names,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a
former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and
analyst at FBR Capital Markets. &#8220;They are picking winners and
losers. I didn&#8217;t think the Fed would ever do that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dimon&#8217;s Stake &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $15 billion in stock buybacks would be enough for the
firm to repurchase about 346 million shares at yesterday&#8217;s
closing price. That represents about 9 percent of shares
outstanding. Dimon&#8217;s personal stake in JPMorgan gained almost
$15 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan climbed $2.85 to $43.39 yesterday, leading the KBW
Bank Index of 24 U.S. lenders to a 4.6 percent gain, the most
since November. The lender&#8217;s announcement also helped to pad
gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which climbed 1.7
percent to 13,177.68, the highest in more than four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and the KBW Bank Index were little changed as of
11:45 a.m. today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new JPMorgan payout is in line with the $1.15 to $1.25
annual dividend per share estimated by Charles Peabody, an
analyst at Portales Partners, in a March 1 report. The share
repurchase, which includes $12 billion for 2012 and $3 billion
for the first quarter of next year, also is in line with his
prediction of $7 billion to $9 billion if employee incentive
stock is excluded. That will cost the bank about $5.5 billion
over the 12-month buyback program, Peabody said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and three other banks agreed to pay $25 million to
New York to resolve some monetary claims over the use of a
mortgage database after reaching a $25 billion national
settlement over foreclosure practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued Bank of
America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo  Co. in February over their
use of the mortgage registry known as MERS, accusing the lenders
of deceiving homeowners and conducting improper foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with the three banks, as well as Citigroup
Inc. (C) and Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY), was filed yesterday in federal
court in Washington. The five lenders agreed in February to a
$25 billion settlement with 49 states and the federal government
to resolve claims of abusive foreclosure practices. That
settlement requires a federal judge&#8217;s approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup each
agreed to pay $5.9 million to New York, according to the court
filing. Ally agreed to pay $1.25 million. Ally and Citigroup
aren&#8217;t named in New York&#8217;s MERS lawsuit. The nationwide
foreclosure settlement preserves claims raised against the banks
in the New York case and any similar claims that may be asserted
against Citigroup and Ally, according to the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danny Kanner, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said in a phone
interview that the agreement resolves some monetary claims
against the banks. The core claims of the lawsuit will proceed,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We intend to aggressively litigate this case to finally
prohibit the widespread illegal and deceptive practices of the
banks set forth in our complaint,&#8221; Kanner said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan, and
Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based Ally, declined to
comment on the settlement. Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for New
York-based Citigroup, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative of the other two lenders didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to e-mails seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement precludes New York from seeking penalties of
$5,000 for each violation in exchange for the $25 million,
according to Kanner. The state will continue to pursue damages
incurred by New York homeowners as a result of the banks&#8217; use of
the MERS system, he said. The state will also seek court-ordered
changes to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The national foreclosure settlement case is U.S. v. Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), 12-00361, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). The New York case is People of the State
of New York v. JPMorgan Chase  Co. 2768-2012, New York State
Supreme Court (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mets Owners to Call Sandy Koufax, Morgenthau at Madoff Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax and former Manhattan
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau will be called as witnesses
in a trial of whether the owners of the New York Mets can keep
$303 million they withdrew from Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee liquidating Madoff&#8217;s firm claims the owners,
Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, blinded themselves to evidence of
Madoff&#8217;s fraud and shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to keep the principal
they withdrew before the fraud became public in 2008. Wilpon and
Katz intend to use Koufax and Morgenthau to show the jury they
were unaware Madoff was a con man, they said in court papers
filed March 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Koufax will testify about how he came to open his
account and the positive things Mr. Wilpon told him about
investing with Madoff Securities,&#8221; according to the filing.
&#8220;It strains credulity to think that Mr. Wilpon would expose his
oldest and closest friend to potential financial ruin -- for no
benefit to Mr. Wilpon himself -- if he subjectively believed
that Madoff Securities might be operating a Ponzi scheme.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koufax and Morgenthau were named on a list of 12 witnesses,
including Wilpon and Katz themselves, who the owners plan to
call at the trial. The disclosures came in a flurry of court
papers filed March 12 and yesterday, giving a preview of the
evidence both sides expect to present in the trial scheduled to
begin March 19 in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee, New York lawyer Irving Picard, sued Wilpon and
Katz in 2010, along with dozens of family members, trusts and
related businesses, trying to get $1 billion in profits and
principal they withdrew from their Madoff accounts. In a series
of rulings, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff has limited the
amount Picard may claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 73, pleaded guilty in 2009 to orchestrating what
prosecutors called the biggest Ponzi scheme in history, and is
serving a 150-year sentence in a federal prison in North
Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Katz, 11-cv-03605, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ex-GE Manager Not Guilty of Murder, His Lawyer Tells Jury &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemy Neuman isn&#8217;t guilty of premeditated murder because he
was legally insane when he shot to death the husband of a co-
worker, a defense lawyer told jurors as a trial neared an end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hemy Neuman on Nov. 18, 2010, did not have the mental
capacity to distinguish right from wrong,&#8221; defense attorney Bob
Rubin said yesterday in his closing arguments in Decatur,
Georgia. &#8220;In fact, he thought he was doing the right thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors waived their right to make their arguments
first. They will try later to convince the jury that Neuman, 49,
was legally sane when he shot to death Russell &#8220;Rusty&#8221;
Sneiderman, 36. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense hasn&#8217;t denied that Neuman intercepted and
killed Sneiderman in front of the Dunwoody Prep preschool, where
he had dropped off his 2-year-old son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sneiderman&#8217;s wife, Andrea, 35, worked with Neuman at GE
Energy in Atlanta. The couple had an emotional personal
relationship that may not have included sex, according to trial
testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Sneiderman worked for Neuman in software systems
support at the company, where he was an engineer overseeing
5,000 people, according to evidence in court. She isn&#8217;t charged
with a crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense testimony was disputed by Pamela Crawford, a
forensic psychologist, and William Brickhouse, a psychiatrist
who&#8217;s the DeKalb County Jail mental health director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both testified that Neuman isn&#8217;t bipolar, depressed or
legally insane. Someone who is psychotic can&#8217;t plan and perform
a killing as Neuman did, Crawford said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuman faces life in prison without parole if convicted of
murder or life without parole or parole after 30 years if
convicted of murder while mentally ill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State v. Neuman, 11CR1364-5, Georgia Superior
Court, DeKalb County (Decatur). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banks Sued By North Carolina Official Over Mortgage Registry &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) were among
companies sued by a North Carolina county official over
allegedly forged mortgage documents and the use of a mortgage
database under attack by states and counties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies named in the lawsuit filed forged mortgage-
related documents, misled homeowners and impaired property
rights, according to a complaint filed yesterday by Jeff
Thigpen, the Guilford County Register of Deeds. The county
includes Greensboro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our office uncovered an abundance of falsified, forged
and fraudulently executed mortgage documents,&#8221; Thigpen said in
a statement. &#8220;But our investigation only found the tip of the
iceberg. We need the banks to clean up their mess.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks and Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems Inc.
have been sued by attorneys general in Massachusetts and New
York over the MERS database. Delaware sued the company without
filing claims against banks. Texas counties, meanwhile, are also
pursuing claims against MERS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, and
Vickee Adams, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, declined to comment
about the complaint. The lawsuit also names JPMorgan Chase 
Co., Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and others as defendants.
Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan, and Kevin Heine, a
spokesman for BNY Mellon, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janis Smith, a spokeswoman for Merscorp Holdings Inc., said
in a statement that the complaint contains &#8220;a lot of political
rhetoric&#8221; and &#8220;misconstrues&#8221; the role of MERS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Guilford County ex rel. v. Lender Processing
Services, 12-CVS-4531, General Court of Justice, Superior Court
Division, Guilford County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Daniel Och Sued by Ex-Employee Achache Over 2009 Termination &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Och, founder of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group
LLC (OCH), was sued by a former employee, Arnaud Achache, who accused
Och of forcing him out to boost his own interest in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achache, a citizen of France who lives in Beverly Hills,
California, filed the complaint March 9 in New York State
Supreme Court in Manhattan, seeking more than $50 million in
actual damages and more than $100 million in punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achache said he joined Och-Ziff in about July 2003 from
Societe Generale SA (GLE) and became a non-managing member of the
firm&#8217;s operating groups in January 2005, when he received a
1 percent ownership interest. Achache said he was terminated as
a limited partner in March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendants, acting by and through Och for his direct
benefit, and to the detriment of plaintiffs, terminated Achache
as a limited partner of the Operating Group Entities in
violation of the Agreements of Limited Partnership, for the sole
purpose of gaining for himself a larger equity interest in
breach of his fiduciary duties,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for New York-based Och-
Ziff, declined to comment on the lawsuit yesterday in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Achache v. Och, 650737/2012, New York State
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;MBF Clearing Sued by CFTC, Accused of Not Segregating Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBF Clearing Corp. was sued by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and accused of failing to properly segregate
customer accounts from its own and of violating the Commodity
Exchange Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBF employees from September 2008 to March 2010 deposited
$30 million to $60 million in customer funds into a U.S.
government money market fund at JPMorgan Chase  Co. without
properly segregating them, the CFTC alleged March 12 in a
complaint in federal court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds weren&#8217;t properly titled, and redemption
provisions didn&#8217;t comply with CFTC regulations, the agency said.
Nor was there proper documentation for the account, it said. MBF
also allegedly failed to obtain customer segregation
acknowledgement letters on two accounts holding funds for
foreign customers from February 2007 to April 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC asked for a court order barring MBF&#8217;s &#8220;unlawful
acts and practices&#8221; and unspecified civil penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark B. Fisher, MBF&#8217;s president and founder, said in an
interview that the firm  &#8220;invested customer segregated money in
a U.S. government money market fund in the strongest bank in the
world, JPMorgan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC&#8217;s complaint acknowledges that MBF was informed by
JPMorgan on actual account statements that the account was
described as a &#8220;Commodity Customer Segregated Bank Account,&#8221;
Fisher said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What the complaint fails to say is that MBF Clearing
Corp. had placed its customer funds into the JPMorgan government
money market account two days after Lehman Brothers filed for
bankruptcy for the sole purpose of protecting its customers&#8217;
funds by depositing them in the safest bank in the world and in
the most secure investments, namely U.S. government
securities,&#8221; Fisher said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed the largest bankruptcy
in U.S. history on Sept. 15, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as MBF was notified the JPMorgan account might not
qualify for segregation, the firm &#8220;moved all of the customer
funds out of this account and reported what had occurred to its
designated self-regulatory agency, the CME Group Inc.,&#8221; Fisher
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not a nickel of customer money was lost,&#8221; Fisher said.
&#8220;We are disappointed that the CFTC has chosen to address this
matter through an enforcement proceeding.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CFTC v. MBF Clearing Corp., 12-cv-1830, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AstraZeneca Sues FDA Over Generic Seroquel Warning Denial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
seeking to overturn the regulator&#8217;s denial of a request that
generic copies of its Seroquel antipsychotic come with warnings
about high blood sugar and suicidal tendencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca is seeking an injunction barring the FDA from
approving copies of Seroquel until Dec. 2, when exclusivity
expires on clinical trial data that show a link between Seroquel
and hyperglycemia, or until a federal court has a &#8220;meaningful
opportunity to review imminent FDA action,&#8221; the London-based
company said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA on March 7 denied two so-called Citizen Petitions
filed by the U.K. drugmaker on Sept. 9 that asked the regulator
to withhold final marketing approval for generic versions of
Seroquel, also known as quetiapine fumarate, that omit
mentioning the risks, AstraZeneca said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rebekah Brooks, Husband Said to Be Arrested in Hacking Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive officer of News
Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s U.K. publishing unit, was arrested a second time by
London police as the year-old phone-hacking probe turned to a
possible cover up, according to a person familiar with the
situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan Police said they arrested five men and a
43-year-old woman in a probe to investigate a potential
conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, without identifying
the suspects. Brooks&#8217;s husband Charlie, a former racehorse
trainer, was also arrested, the person said, declining to be
identified because the matter is confidential. Police also
detained Mark Hanna, who headed security for the News
International unit, according to a spokeswoman for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe into the phone-hacking scandal at Rupert
Murdoch&#8217;s News of the World tabloid has continued to expand to
add an investigation into bribes to public officials and police.
More than 20 people have been arrested as part of Operation
Weeting, the phone-hacking investigation, and at least 10 have
been questioned since the beginning of the year in the bribery
probe. The police service said for the first time that it
consulted with prosecutors before making yesterday&#8217;s arrests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police can hold a suspect without filing charges for as
long as 36 hours. Perverting the course of justice carries a
maximum sentence of life imprisonment, according to the Crown
Prosecution Service&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPS didn&#8217;t return a call and the MPS declined to
comment beyond the statement. David Wilson, a spokesman for the
43-year-old Brooks, declined to immediately comment and her
attorney, Stephen Parkinson, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also arrested yesterday in the early morning raids between
5 a.m. and 7 a.m. London time were a 46-year-old man in West
London, a 38-year-old man in Hertfordshire and a 48-year-old man
at an office address in East London. All were arrested as part
of Operation Weeting and a number of addresses are being
searched, the police said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Lehman Executive Jack&#8217;s $35 Million Estate Faces Tax Auction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $35 million estate of Bradley H. Jack, the former
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) managing director who was arrested
twice for allegedly forging drug prescriptions, may be sold at a
municipal auction after he failed to pay property taxes since
July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack owes $271,923 on his 20-acre (8-hectare), waterfront
compound in Fairfield, Connecticut, according to town tax
collector Stanley Gorzelany. It&#8217;s the town&#8217;s biggest overdue tax
bill on a residence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He is the most delinquent taxpayer,&#8221; Gorzelany said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack, 53, turned himself in and was charged March 9 with
second-degree forgery for a November incident at a CVS pharmacy
in which he faked the date on a doctor&#8217;s prescription for a
controlled substance, according to Captain Sam Arciola of the
Westport Police Department. Jack was released on $5,000 bond and
has a March 21 court appearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Jack was arrested after he allegedly tried to pass
forged prescriptions for 12 pills of the painkiller Oxycontin
and nine of Ritalin, a drug used to treat attention deficit
disorder, Fairfield police said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack had received treatment for cancer, had had a valid
prescription in the past and had no prior criminal record, his
attorney, Robert G. Golger, said in court in August. Golger
didn&#8217;t immediately return a call yesterday seeking comment on
the tax sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack joined New York-based Lehman in 1984 and ran
investment banking from 1996 to 2002, when he became co-chief
operating officer. He decided to retire from New York-based
Lehman to pursue work in the nonprofit sector and spend time
with his family in June 2005. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Citizens Bank, Customers Seek Mediation in Overdraft Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania and plaintiffs in a lawsuit
challenging overdraft fees asked for a delay in proceedings
while they pursue private mediation, according to a court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parties have agreed to engage in private mediation in
an effort to resolve this case without further litigation,&#8221; the
Pittsburgh-based bank and the customers said yesterday in a
filing in federal court in Miami. They agreed to suspend court
filings on whether to certify the case as a class-action, or
group, lawsuit. A mediation session is scheduled for April 17,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 30 banks have cases before U.S. District Judge
James Lawrence King in Miami. The customers say the banks
reorder debit-card transactions in their computers to maximize
overdraft fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
reached a preliminary agreement to pay $110 million to settle
litigation. Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S. bank
by assets, agreed last year to pay $410 million without
admitting liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Bank NA agreed to a $35 million settlement with
customers in November. An Associated Banc-Corp. (ASBC) unit, Associated
Bank, agreed in November to pay $13 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation,
09-md-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AU Optronics, Two Executives Found Guilty of Price Fixing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AU Optronics Corp. (2409) and two of its executives were found
guilty yesterday of fixing prices for screens used in computers
and televisions. Two other company officials were found not
guilty by a federal jury in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said executives of the Taiwan-based company met
with competitors secretly in hotel rooms and karaoke bars from
2001 to 2006 to set liquid crystal display prices in response to
an oversupply that pushed down prices by 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company president H.B. Chen was found guilty along with Hui
Hsiung, who was executive vice president during the alleged
conspiracy. The jury also said the amount of gain from all
conspirators in the case was more than $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.J. Chen, a director of the company&#8217;s desktop display
group, and Hubert Lee, a senior manager for the group, were
found not guilty. The judge declared a mistrial on the fifth
company executive, Steven Leung, who was also a senior manager
of the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AU Optronics is the only LCD maker charged with price-
fixing by the U.S. to take its case to trial. Since 2008, rivals
including LG Display Co. (034220), Chunghwa Picture Tubes (2475), Chi Mei
Optoelectronics Corp. (3009) and Sharp Corp. (6753) agreed to plead guilty and
pay more than $860 million in fines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennis Riordan, an attorney who represents AU Optronics and
its U.S. unit, which was also found guilty yesterday, said the
defense will file motions for acquittal and a new trial. A fine
for the company, which would come at sentencing after those
motions are ruled on, may total as much as $1 billion, he said.
All five executives still work for the company, Riordan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The magnitude of the possible fine, $1 billion, may shock
a lot of people. AUO has only provisioned for about one third of
that,&#8221; said Jamie Yeh, who rates the stock underweight at
Barclays Bank Plc in Taipei. &#8220;The fact that they lost the case
was expected&#8221; and may account for the share&#8217;s decline being
less than the daily limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At every step, our lawyers and accountants have discussed
the appropriate provisions,&#8221; AU Optronics Chief Financial
Officer Andy Yang said yesterday. He declined to say how much
has already been provisioned or whether that figure will
increase after yesterday&#8217;s verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case is just beginning,&#8221; Riordan said in an
interview after the verdict. &#8220;The most important question it
raises, which the jury didn&#8217;t get, is does the Sherman Act apply
to conduct that takes place on foreign soil?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Huston, a Justice Department attorney, declined to
comment after the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Lin, 3:09-cr-00110, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs to Pay $7 Million Over CFTC Trading-Account Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to pay $7 million to
resolve regulatory claims it failed to properly supervise
commodities trading accounts, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator accused the New York-based firm&#8217;s Goldman
Sachs Execution  Clearing LP unit of failing to supervise
subaccounts managed from 2007 to 2009 by a broker-dealer that
engaged in &#8220;questionable conduct,&#8221; the CFTC said in a
statement yesterday. Goldman Sachs agreed to disgorge $1.5
million in fees and commissions it had collected from the broker
and pay a $5.5 million civil penalty, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When registrants become aware of questionable activity,
they must not simply rely on assurances from interested parties
and their representatives, but instead must diligently
investigate,&#8221; David Meister, the CFTC&#8217;s enforcement chief, said
in a statement. &#8220;As this case indicates, the Commission will
hold registrants accountable if they fail in this regard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment on the settlement. The company resolved the
claims without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the CFTC said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Credit Suisse Banker Fined Over Bond Offering &#8216;Charades&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) banker in London, Nicholas
Kyprios, was fined 210,000 pounds ($330,000) for disclosing
confidential client information to a fund manager in what
regulators called a &#8220;guessing game.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyprios, head of European credit sales at the bank,
indicated to the manager that the bank&#8217;s client Liberty Global
Inc. (LBTYA) was close to issuing bonds to finance its acquisition of
German cable company UnityMedia GmbH, after the manager told
Kyprios he didn&#8217;t want information he couldn&#8217;t act on, the
Financial Services Authority said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse was working for Liberty on the takeover and
also served as lead book runner for the 2.5 billion-euro ($3.3
billion) bond issue to partly finance the deal. In response to
questions during a November 2009 call about who was issuing the
bonds, Kyprios told the manager they could &#8220;play this game&#8221;
and &#8220;you&#8217;re going to be my charades partner.&#8221; Kyprios ruled
out possible issuers and signaled confirmation when the manager,
who the FSA didn&#8217;t identify, guessed UnityMedia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse &#8220;deeply regrets&#8221; that one of its employees
has been sanctioned by the FSA, the Zurich-based bank said in a
statement. It &#8220;fully supports the FSA&#8217;s actions to ensure
information is properly controlled and has reinforced the FSA&#8217;s
decision by imposing its own financial penalty&#8221; on Kyprios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When questioned by the regulator, Kyprios told them the
conversations were &#8220;banter&#8221; that didn&#8217;t disclose any
actionable information. He was fined for improper market conduct
and received the FSA&#8217;s standard 30 percent discount on the fine
for settling early. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyprios, who still works at the bank, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Takeda Actos Judge Names Lead Attorneys in Cancer Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge overseeing lawsuits alleging Takeda
Pharmaceutical Co. (4502)&#8217;s Actos diabetes medicine causes cancer
appointed 19 plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers to manage litigation involving
U.S. claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeda, Asia&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, may face as many as
10,000 claims that Actos causes bladder cancer after U.S.
regulators found last year the drug was linked to the disease.
Federal lawsuits against the drugmaker were consolidated before
U.S. District Judge Rebecca Doherty in Lafayette, Louisiana, in
December. The first hearing on the cases is set for March 22,
according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court has determined to effect the selection of lead
counsel, liaison counsel and plaintiffs&#8217; executive and steering
committees before the March 22nd-23rd status conference,&#8221;
Doherty said in a March 12 note posted on the court&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits claim patients who use Actos, a prescription
drug approved to treat type 2 diabetes, face increased risks of
developing bladder cancer. The plaintiffs also claim that Takeda
and co-defendant Eli Lilly  Co., based in Indianapolis,
withheld information about the risk and failed to provide
adequate warnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given that litigation is pending, we can&#8217;t comment,&#8221;
Jocelyn Gerst, a U.S.-based spokeswoman for Takeda, said in a
telephone interview about the selection of the plaintiffs&#8217;
group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doherty named attorneys Richard Arsenault and Paul Pennock
as lead plaintiffs&#8217; counsel in the case and also appointed them
to the executive committee, along with lawyers Mark Robinson and
Hunter Shkolnik. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arsenault, a products-liability lawyer based in Alexandria,
Louisiana, served as one of the leading lawyers in consolidated
cases filed against Merck  Co. (MRK) over its Vioxx painkiller that
resulted in a $4.85 billion settlement in November 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennock, a New York-based attorney, was one of the lawyers
leading the consolidated suits against AstraZeneca Plc over its
Seroquel antipsychotic drug. The London-based drugmaker agreed
last year to pay a total of about $350 million to resolve
patients&#8217; claims that the drug caused diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles-based Robinson, who has won multimillion-
dollar jury awards against carmakers such as Ford Motor Co., is
a co-lead counsel in sudden-acceleration lawsuits against Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shkolnik, based in New York City, served as a member of the
plaintiffs&#8217; steering committee in lawsuits against Medtronic
Inc. (MDT) over flawed heart defibrillators. The cases later settled
for more than $114 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits are consolidated in In Re: Actos Products
Liability Litigation, 11-2299, U.S. District Court, Western
District of Louisiana (Lafayette). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Judicial Picks Will Get Senate Vote as Reid Decries Holdup &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he will
require votes in coming days on 17 of President Barack Obama&#8217;s
judicial nominees, escalating a fight with Republicans over
confirmations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Republicans have prevented the Senate from doing its
constitutional duty,&#8221; Reid of Nevada said on the Senate floor
March 12. He said Republicans are holding up &#8220;consensus
nominees,&#8221; including some approved unanimously by the Senate
Judiciary Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reid&#8217;s decision follows failed talks with Senate Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, over a slate of
nominees to put forward for a vote. The Senate this year has
confirmed seven federal judges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-two judicial nominees are pending before the Senate,
and Reid is forcing votes on all of the 17 district court judges
on that list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine of the lower-court nominees were approved last year by
voice vote in the Judiciary Committee. Of those approved by the
panel this year, all but two cleared the committee with only one
&#8220;no&#8221; vote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the

of its unit in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leme will help in &#8220;deepening the firm&#8217;s relationship with
existing clients and expanding its portfolio of new clients,&#8221;
the New York-based bank said today in an e-mailed statement. He
will report to Alejandro Vollbrechthausen, the president of the
division, and Stephen Scherr, the bank&#8217;s head for Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Brazil is living an important moment, and there are huge
opportunities for Goldman Sachs to help its clients,&#8221; Leme said
in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leme, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1993, will move to Sao

&lt;p&gt;New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg visited Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s headquarters in
Manhattan in a show of support after a departing employee
publicly criticized the firm&#8217;s culture yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The mayor stopped by to make clear that the company is a
vital part of the city&#8217;s economy, and the kind of unfair attacks
that we&#8217;re seeing can eventually hurt all New Yorkers,&#8221; said
Stu Loeser, a spokesman for the mayor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg visited the firm today about 11 a.m. and met with
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and numerous
employees, Loeser said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Smith, an executive director who sold U.S. equity
derivatives to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa,
wrote in a New York Times opinion piece that he is leaving the
firm after 12 years. Smith assailed the company&#8217;s treatment of
clients and blamed Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn for
losing hold over the bank&#8217;s culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They responded in a memo to current and former employees,
saying that Smith&#8217;s assertions don&#8217;t reflect the company&#8217;s
values, culture or &#8220;how the vast majority of people at Goldman
Sachs think about the firm and the work it does on behalf of our
clients.&#8221; David Wells, a bank spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call seeking comment after business hours. &lt;/p&gt;

parent Bloomberg LP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index
companies have never paid more dividends following increases
this week by banks including JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co., according to
Howard Silverblatt, SP&#8217;s senior index analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announced payouts imply an annual dividend rate of $29.02
per index share, Silverblatt said in a note today. The prior
record was $28.96 in June 2008 before the figure slid 26 percent
to $21.44 in August 2009. It has since risen 35 percent. SP 500
companies are paying out 30 percent of profits, less than the
average of 52 percent, SP data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies have the money, they have the ability, and
dividends are back in fashion,&#8221; he said in a telephone
interview today. &#8220;We would expect to see more banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan boosted its quarterly dividend by 20 percent to 30
cents a share this week, after the Federal Reserve completed
stress tests of the 19 largest U.S. banks to gauge their ability
to withstand a severe economic downturn. Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and
U.S. Bancorp also boosted their payouts and authorized share
repurchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial stocks in 2007 accounted for 30 percent of SP
500 dividends, he said. The amount has fallen to 13 percent,
which is the second-highest among 10 industries, according to
SP data. The consumer-staples group contributes 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dividend Aristocrats &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies with the best track records of paying dividends
are lagging behind the rest of the stock market this year after
concern about the European debt crisis gave them better returns
in 2011. The SP 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index (SPDAUDT) of companies
that raised payouts for at least 25 straight years returned 7.1
percent in 2012 through yesterday, trailing the 11 percent gain
for the entire SP 500. In 2011, the returns were 8.3 percent
and 2.1 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved U.S. economic data coupled with speculation
European leaders will contain the region&#8217;s debt crisis have
pushed investors to riskier companies. Financial and technology
stocks, which have the two lowest dividend yields in the SP 500
among 10 industries, have risen the most in 2012. Last year,
utilities and consumer-staples companies led. They have the
second- and third-highest dividend rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined profits by SP 500 stocks rose 9.9 percent to a
record $92.23 a share in 2011, Bloomberg data show. Companies
are seeking ways to give back money to shareholders after piling
up more than $1 trillion of cash in the fourth quarter of last
year, according to SP data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current SP 500 dividend yield is 1.96 percent. That
compares with the average of about 3.24 percent between 1970 and
1994, before the Internet bubble helped drive down yields to a
low of 1.05 percent in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) is being investigated
by Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator for not meeting the agency&#8217;s request
for safeguards to avoid new leaks after a November spill at the
Frade field off the coast of Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron faces fines for its handling of the spill after the
probe is completed, an official at the agency, who declined to
be named because of agency policy, said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has requested permission from the regulator, known
as the ANP, to halt production at Frade after a new oil slick of
about 5 liters appeared at the field this week, Rafael
Williamson, a corporate affairs director at Chevron, said at a
press conference in Rio de Janeiro today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frade was Brazil&#8217;s 12th-largest producing field in January
with 65,000 barrels a day in oil and natural gas output,
according to information on the regulator&#8217;s website. Chevron
holds a 52 percent stake in Frade and is the operator. Partners
include Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) with 30 percent and Frade Japao
Petroleo Ltda. -- a joint venture of INPEX Corp. (1605), Sojitz Corp. (2768)
and JOGMEC -- with 18.26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell 0.6 percent to $110.03 at the close in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will release the
next version of its Xbox console in 2013 at the earliest, as the
company squeezes at least one more year of sales out of its
current model, said two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company may show the successor to its Xbox 360 in June
2013 at the E3 conference and put it on sale that same year,
said the people, who declined to be named because the plans are
confidential. David Dennis, a company spokesman, said earlier
today that Microsoft won&#8217;t discuss new Xbox hardware at this
year&#8217;s E3, quelling speculation that the device would be
unveiled at the 2012 show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox 360, bolstered by the Kinect motion-sensor
accessory, had its best year of sales in 2011 -- the console&#8217;s
seventh on the market. Announcing the next model too soon risks
hurting orders for the current lineup, and new consoles
typically lose money for their first few years. The Xbox 360 is
profitable, giving the company incentive to keep it on store
shelves for a longer period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re still selling a lot of Xbox 360, and they&#8217;re
making money,&#8221; said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush
Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think the world needs
them to put a new console out just because we&#8217;re bored.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer (PFE) Inc. Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read received a 44 percent raise in total compensation last
year to $25 million in his new role as head of the world&#8217;s
largest drugmaker, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read, 58, was paid $1.7 million in base salary, a $3.5
million cash bonus, stock and option awards, pension and other
benefits. The cash bonus was $900,000 more than his target for
the year, New York-based Pfizer said in the filing. Read&#8217;s total
compensation was $17.4 million in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer topped its financial goals for 2011 and Read&#8217;s raise
&#8220;adjusted his salary grade to reflect the change in his
position to CEO,&#8221; the company said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read is shrinking Pfizer as he shifts the company into a
new phase after its top-selling cholesterol pill Lipitor began
facing generic competition last December. He also is planning to
divest the animal health and nutritionals units and trimming
overlaps from a decade of mega-mergers. The CEO said Pfizer will
focus its research on five clinical areas, ending work on
respiratory, allergy and gene-therapy treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s board said company shareholders were upset by the
$24.7 million final-year pay of former CEO Jeffrey Kindler, who
left the company in December 2010 and was replaced by Read. The
2011 shareholder vote on executive pay passed with 56 percent
compared with 96.8 percent the year before, the drugmaker&#8217;s
board members said in their report about executive compensation
included in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The vote outcome was highly disappointing to Pfizer, its
board of directors and its compensation committee,&#8221; the board
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the board said it had made compensation more
performance-based for top executives. Read would be paid $22.4
million for &#8220;termination without cause,&#8221; or $32.6 million in
case of a change in ownership of the company, according to the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was once a
punch line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Great Depression, the then-small partnership on
Pine Street became a target of national ridicule because of a
scandal involving the Goldman Sachs Trading Corp., a publicly
traded investment trust that blew up after the stock market
crash of 1929. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, comedian Eddie Cantor, who had lost $100,000 and
sued Goldman Sachs for $100&#160;million, made the firm a running
joke in his stand-up routines. In one of his bits, Cantor would
appear onstage with a stooge who tried to squeeze juice from a
dry lemon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Cantor would ask. Without missing a beat,
the stooge would say, &#8220;The margin clerk for Goldman Sachs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since being subjected to Cantor&#8217;s barbs, Goldman Sachs
has cultivated an image not just as Wall Street&#8217;s preeminent
firm but also as a paragon of financial virtue. But Goldman&#8217;s
supposedly pristine reputation has always been more invented
than earned, Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its March 19
issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s principal regulator at the time, sued the company for
failing to make adequate disclosures regarding a synthetic
collateralized debt obligation it manufactured and sold at the
height of the housing bubble. Rather than fight the SEC, Goldman
Sachs settled the charges for $550 million, the largest fine
ever extracted from a Wall Street firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financial Crisis &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein received a public flogging
from U.S. Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat and chairman
of the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which
also released 900 pages of internal company documents that
exposed the role the firm played in fomenting and exacerbating
the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs subsequently convened a group of its powerful
insiders to review the firm&#8217;s &#8220;Business Standards.&#8221; The
committee&#8217;s report, issued in January 2011, rehashed the bank&#8217;s
mantras about putting its clients&#8217; interests before its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Conflicts of interest and the firm&#8217;s approach to dealing
with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our
reputation and our long-term success,&#8221; Goldman Sachs boasted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this true? Has being dragged through the proverbial mud
time and time again -- most recently yesterday in a New York
Times op-ed by Greg Smith, a departing Goldman Sachs executive
director -- made the firm any more responsive to the criticism
directed its way? In a place as secretive as Goldman Sachs,
what&#8217;s really going on inside its sleek, new $2.4&#160;billion
downtown Manhattan headquarters is difficult to discern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heads I Win &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a blistering opinion handed down Feb. 29 by a Delaware
judge makes a convincing case that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s heads-I-win,
tails-you-lose approach to business hasn&#8217;t changed at all. And
it goes a long way toward explaining why, almost four years
after the financial crisis, the system is still rigged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, El Paso Corp. (EP), a leading producer and transporter
of natural gas, which Goldman Sachs was advising, agreed to a
$38&#160;billion merger with Kinder Morgan Inc., a pipeline and
storage company in which Goldman Sachs owns a big chunk of
equity. In response, a group of El Paso shareholders asked Leo Strine, chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery, to block
the merger, in part because of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s conflicts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Private-Equity Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strine&#8217;s opinion detailed the labyrinthine history of the
El&#160;Paso-Kinder merger and Goldman Sachs&#8217;s role in it. Bear with
me here. Through one of its private-equity funds, Goldman Sachs
owned a 19&#160;percent stake in Kinder Morgan -- valued at
$4&#160;billion -- and controlled two seats on the company&#8217;s board.
Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t serve as an MA adviser to Kinder Morgan --
that fell to Evercore Partners Inc. and Barclays Capital -- but
Goldman Sachs possessed considerable influence inside the Kinder
Morgan boardroom, even though Goldman board members recused
themselves during the El Paso negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had another role, as MA adviser to El Paso,
and this is where things got tricky. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s involvement
with El Paso began around the time the firm released the
&#8220;Business Standards&#8221; report. El Paso hired Steve Daniel, a
senior oil-and-gas banker at Goldman Sachs with an undisclosed
$340,000 stake in Kinder Morgan, to advise El Paso on the
spinoff of its oil- and natural-gas exploration business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last May 24, El Paso announced a planned spinoff of the
exploration assets, which Goldman Sachs valued at between
$8&#160;billion and $10 billion. If the spinoff was successfully
completed, Goldman Sachs would receive a $25 million fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pipeline Business &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on Aug. 30, Kinder Morgan informed El Paso that it
was interested in buying the company for $25.50 in cash and
stock, so that it could get its hands on El Paso&#8217;s pipeline
business, which it wanted to keep. In essence, Kinder Morgan was
bidding to buy all of El Paso and then continue with the sale of
the exploration business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The El Paso board rejected the first Kinder Morgan offer as
too low. A week later, Kinder Morgan threatened to launch a
hostile deal against El Paso. Given the obvious Goldman Sachs
conflict, El Paso decided to add Morgan Stanley (MS) as an adviser
but, according to Strine, Goldman Sachs refused to amend its
engagement letter with El Paso to allow Morgan Stanley to get a
fee if the exploration business was spun off but the merger
didn&#8217;t take place. Morgan Stanley would receive its $35 million
fee only if El Paso agreed to merge with Kinder Morgan. (Goldman
would receive $20 million.) If the spinoff alone occurred, only
Goldman Sachs would get paid ($25 million). Heads-I-win, tails-
you-lose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Merger Agreement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 18, El Paso CEO Douglas Foshee reached a deal with
Richard Kinder, co-founder of Kinder Morgan, to sell El Paso for
$27.55 a share in cash and stock. But then Kinder reneged,
claiming the projections used were too optimistic. Instead of
walking away, Foshee agreed to a lower deal at $26.87 per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merger agreement, signed on Oct. 16, included a $650
million break-up fee and a no-shop provision that prevented El
Paso from actively seeking higher offers. Meanwhile, Goldman
Sachs lowered its estimate of the value of the spinoff of the
exploration business by $2 billion, making the merger appear
better than that alternative. The merger also worked to the
benefit of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s $4 billion principal position in
Kinder Morgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After agreeing to sell his company to Kinder Morgan for the
lower price, Foshee asked Kinder Morgan for permission to pursue
a management buyout of the exploration business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;reality is that Foshee was interested in being a
buyer of a key part of El Paso at the same time he was charged
with getting the highest possible price as a seller of that same
asset,&#8221; according to Strine. &#8220;At no time did Foshee come clean
to his board about his self-interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apollo, Riverstone &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 24, El Paso&#8217;s management, along with Apollo Global
Management LLC and Riverstone Holdings LLC -- founded by two
former senior Goldman Sachs executives -- announced that it was
buying El Paso&#8217;s exploration business for $7.15 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Pierce, a Kinder Morgan spokesman, said El Paso&#8217;s
management isn&#8217;t buying any of these assets. Instead, El Paso
&#8220;entered into a definitive agreement to sell its exploration
and production business to Apollo Global, Riverstone and
others.&#8221; Management is working out its equity arrangement with
the buying group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Double-Dealing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this evidence of double-dealing, the
transaction went through. Strine decided not to enjoin the
merger since no other offer for El Paso was on the table. El
Paso shareholders approved it on March 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon closing, Goldman Sachs will get its $20 million fee
for advising on the El Paso merger and, presumably, its $25
million fee for advising on the sale of the exploration assets
to Foshee, Apollo, and Riverstone. Morgan Stanley will get its
$35 million fee for advising El Paso. Foshee will get his chance
to make a fortune, beyond the $90 million he&#8217;s getting in the
Kinder Morgan merger, as a principal in the Apollo/Riverstone
deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Paso disputes Strine&#8217;s opinion, saying that Foshee isn&#8217;t
a principal in the Apollo/Riverstone deal and that he stands to
earn about $34.5 million in the merger, according to Richard Wheatley, an El Paso spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foshee also got, according to Strine, an &#8220;obsequious&#8221;
thank-you call from Blankfein. And Goldman&#8217;s $4 billion
investment in Kinder Morgan will continue to grow because it was
able to buy the El Paso assets it wanted on the cheap, without a
true market test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Concern and Distrust&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This kind of furtive behavior engenders legitimate
concern and distrust,&#8221; Strine concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some at Goldman Sachs will retort that the conflicts were
disclosed -- except for Steve Daniel&#8217;s stake in Kinder Morgan--
and accepted by all parties. El Paso&#8217;s shareholders received a
37 percent premium to the closing price of the stock the day
before the deal was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who was harmed? The short answer is that El Paso&#8217;s
shareholders deserved a CEO and MA adviser who were free of
entanglements with Kinder Morgan and could be trusted to work
solely in the best interests of the company&#8217;s investors, rather
than themselves. The longer answer is that the behavior of
Goldman Sachs and Foshee is a serious affront to our collective
sense of fair play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greg Smith &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his extraordinarily public resignation letter, Greg
Smith, who had spent time recruiting the best and the brightest
to Goldman Sachs, wrote, &#8220;I knew it was time to leave when I
realized I could no longer look students in the eye and tell
them what a great place this was to work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proper functioning of Wall Street is too vital to the
economy to tolerate the duplicitous practices of Goldman Sachs
and firms like it, especially after what the American people did
to rescue these businesses in their darkest hours. The country&#8217;s
political class appears to lack the power or will to hold large
financial institutions to account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a massive leadership vacuum at the top of Wall
Street today; and it&#8217;s quite possible that only continued,
relentless public shaming will force the leaders of these firms
to make the kinds of cultural changes necessary to bring their
actions in line with normative behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where have you gone, Eddie Cantor? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Goldman, a partner with Larry Silverstein on the redevelopment of offices at the World Trade
Center site, bought a Manhattan penthouse for $13.8 million, 7.7
percent less than its seller first sought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s purchase of the three-story co-operative
apartment at 941 Park Ave. was disclosed today in New York City
Department of Finance records. The four-bedroom Upper East Side
apartment was listed for sale in October with an asking price of
$14.9 million, according to property website StreetEasy.com. The
seller is listed as Peter Frelinghuysen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This fabulous three-story penthouse apartment feels like
a house set on the top of a full-service prewar building,&#8221;
according to a property listing by Mary Rutherfurd and Leslie
Coleman, brokers at Brown Harris Stevens. &#8220;From the elevator
landing, one enters the front hall which is graced with a
staircase sweeping up to the bedroom level, and is lit from
above by a domed skylight in the roof.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment on the purchase through an
assistant. Rutherfurd and Coleman declined to comment through
Amy Gotzler, a spokeswoman for Brown Harris Stevens.
Frelinghuysen didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman is president and founder of BLDG Management Co., a
New York-based commercial real estate investment company. He and
Joseph Cayre helped to finance Silverstein&#8217;s initial $3.2
billion purchase of a 99-year lease of the trade center, six
weeks before it was destroyed by terrorists on Sept. 11, 2001.
Goldman is heir to a real estate fortune amassed by his father,
Irving, and an uncle, Sol Goldman, once a partner in the
Chrysler Building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blankfein, Brokaw &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman already owns an apartment on a lower floor of the
co-op building, located at Park Avenue and 81st Street, where
neighbors have included Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein and Tom Brokaw, the television newsman,
according to public records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-op Goldman purchased spans the building&#8217;s 15th and
16th floors and includes two staff bedrooms, a library and a
rooftop terrace  with &#8220;open city views down Park Avenue,&#8221;
according to the listing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchases of Manhattan luxury apartments, defined as the
top 10 percent of all sales by price, declined 13 percent in the
fourth quarter to 201 deals, according to a Jan. 4 report by New
York appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and broker Prudential Douglas
Elliman. The median price of those transactions fell 4.6 percent
to $4.15 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday a London employee of Goldman Sachs penned a 1,200-word opinion
piece in the New York Times alleging that top managers in the company
ridicule and take&#160;advantage of their clients. Greg Smith wrote of the investment
bank where&#160;he worked for 12 years that he no longer liked the "trajectory of its
culture" and quit his job. The piece sparked a storm of criticism and debate on
Wall Street. "People who care only about making&#160;money will not sustain this
firm&#8221; or the trust of its clients "for very&#160;much longer," Smith concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smith episode lies close to the heart of sustainability, a point echoed
in his likely inadvertent word choice. That's because much of&#160;sustainability, or
responsibility, or whatever companies choose to call it, essentially boils down
to corporate governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forces external to a company can reveal blind spots in management's
assessment of risks and opportunities. Pressure on&#160;companies to divest from
investments in South Africa in the 1980s is one&#160;example. Companies ill-prepared
for a low-carbon economy might now feel&#160;punished by high oil prices and
increasingly costly regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the Smith controversy have to do with social justice and
environmental preservation? Not much. But it has everything to do with blind
spots and mitigating risk to a company's reputation.&#160;Smith's is an attack on
Goldman Sachs's corporate governance, a category that includes, but isn't
limited to, environmental and social issues.&#160;Corporate governance and
transparency rightfully takes up more space in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index ranking questionnaire than either of the other topics, to pick just one
measure. Goldman Sachs was admitted into the Index in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Kennedy, CEO of the Kennedy Group, a London-based recruitment firm,
told Bloomberg news that Smith may have aired a few comments that are&#160;true, but
he's placed himself on a pedestal. The reason he's been at&#160;Goldman Sachs for 12
years is that he liked the name and probably liked the&#160;money.&#157; That is true,
simply by virtue of Smith showing up for work. But&#160;the point here for managers -
- and the driver of some companies into&#160;sustainability strategy -- is that Smith
stopped liking the name so much&#160;that he waived the money and tattled in
public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sustainable" companies attract and retain employees by&#160;being good companies.
That means being responsive to the needs of clients, shareholders, employees and
the communities they interact with. Bright people are often willing to work for
less money if an employer's values align with their own. Greg Smith is probably
now one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) saw $2.15
billion of its market value wiped out after an employee assailed
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein&#8217;s management and the
firm&#8217;s treatment of clients, sparking debate across Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares dropped 3.4 percent in New York trading
yesterday, the third-biggest decline in the 81-company Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index, after London-based Greg Smith
made the accusations in a New York Times op-ed piece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, who also wrote that he was quitting after 12 years
at the company, blamed Blankfein, 57, and President Gary D. Cohn, 51, for a &#8220;decline in the firm&#8217;s moral fiber.&#8221; They
responded in a memo to current and former employees, saying that
Smith&#8217;s assertions don&#8217;t reflect the firm&#8217;s values, culture or
&#8220;how the vast majority of people at Goldman Sachs think about
the firm and the work it does on behalf of our clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, 84, whose
&#8220;Volcker rule&#8221; would limit banks like New York-based Goldman
Sachs from making bets with their own money, called Smith&#8217;s
article &#8220;a radical, strong&#8221; piece. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s a
business that leads to a lot of conflicts of interest,&#8221; Volcker
said at a conference in Washington sponsored by the Atlantic
magazine. &lt;/p&gt;

Greenberg told Bloomberg Television&#8217;s Betty Liu today in an
interview on the &#8220;In the Loop&#8221; program. &#8220;And a trader has a
short-term memory, and a short-term look at things, and that
change really has changed the culture of Goldman Sachs. It is
not the Goldman Sachs that represented companies as an
investment banker.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Smith yesterday blamed Goldman Sachs Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein and President Gary Cohn for a &#8220;decline
in the firm&#8217;s moral fiber&#8221; in a New York Times op-ed piece in
which Smith announced his resignation from a post in London
selling derivatives. Executives at Goldman Sachs are mistreating
clients even after the firm paid $550 million to settle a fraud
suit with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Smith wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg said he counted on Goldman Sachs for investment
banking when he ran the New York-based insurer. AIG later took
billions of dollars of losses on collateralized debt obligations
it backed for Goldman Sachs and ran short of cash. The insurer
averted bankruptcy only because of a U.S. bailout that swelled
to $182.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil traded near the lowest price in
more than a week as signs of rising U.S. stockpiles were
balanced by concern that spare production capacity may be
insufficient to cover any supply disruption in the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures were little changed after falling 1.2 percent
yesterday. Inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point
for West Texas Intermediate oil, reached a nine-month high, the
Energy Department said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said global
spare capacity is at &#8220;dangerously low levels&#8221; and oil-market
fundamentals will tighten this year, pushing Brent crude to $130
a barrel in 2013. Saudi Arabia will make up any &#8220;perceived or
real&#8221; shortfall, Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said in Kuwait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market will hold here, or move higher,&#8221; said
Christopher Bellew, a senior broker at Jefferies Bache Ltd. in
London, who last month correctly predicted Brent&#8217;s rise above
$120 a barrel. &#8220;Iran shows every sign of remaining a source of
tension, the struggle in Syria looks like it will be a prolonged
stalemate, and the extent to which Saudi can fill the supply
shortfall, and for how long, is unknown.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for April delivery was at $105.62 a barrel, up 19
cent, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 12:17 p.m. London time. The contract yesterday dropped $1.28
to $105.43 a barrel, the lowest close since March 6. Prices are
7 percent higher this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for April settlement was at $124.93, down 4
cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract expires today. The more active May futures were down 6
cents at $124.52. The European benchmark contract&#8217;s premium to
New York-traded West Texas Intermediate was at $19.31, compared
with $19.54 yesterday, the widest gap since Oct. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crude Stockpiles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude supplies nationwide rose 1.8 million barrels
last week to 347.5 million barrels, the highest level in six
months, the Energy Department said yesterday. They were forecast
to gain 1.6 million barrels, according to the median of nine
analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. The increase was
the seventh in eight weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline stockpiles fell 1.4 million barrels, the Energy
Department report showed. They were forecast to decline by 1
million. Distillate inventories, a category that includes diesel
and heating oil, slid 4.7 million barrels, compared with a
projected drop of 1.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markets Balanced &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil markets are balanced and have ample output and refining
capacity, Saudi Arabia&#8217;s al-Naimi said yesterday at the biennial
International Energy Forum. Market volatility is caused by
speculation, he told the meeting of producers and consumers.
U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu said he is &#8220;enthusiastic&#8221;
about Saudi willingness to produce more oil to help offset the
effect of economic sanctions on Iran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect prices to average $130 in 2013, so we expect
them to rise higher between now and then,&#8221; said Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
New York-based head of energy research, David Greely. &#8220;On a 12-
month horizon we see Brent prices at $127.50.&#8221; Brent averaged
$110.78 a barrel in 2011 and $80.32 in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declining production rates at oilfields in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries have &#8220;accelerated
precipitously&#8221; and will continue to worsen, Bank of America
Corp. said today in an e-mailed report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union is seeking to ban imports of products
including petroleum oils and natural gas from Iran and to bar
global bank-transfer messaging companies from providing services
to entities subject to EU sanctions, according to a draft
regulation obtained by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Unreasonable Measures&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran&#8217;s oil exports will probably decline by 50 percent when
the sanctions take full effect in July, according to the
International Energy Agency. Shipments will fall by at least
800,000 barrels a day, David Fyfe, head of the IEA&#8217;s market and
industry division, said by phone from Paris, citing discussions
with market participants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;unreasonable measures&#8221; will raise costs for
governments pursuing them and bolster Iran&#8217;s oil revenue, the
Islamic republic&#8217;s oil minister, Rostam Qasemi, said yesterday
at the IEF meeting in Kuwait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil may extend its decline in New York after breaching
technical support yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. On the daily chart, futures settled below a
symmetrical triangle formation going back almost three weeks.
Investors tend to sell contracts on such a so-called downside
breakout. The top of the triangle, representing technical
resistance, was about $107.70 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko&#8217;s government has prevented several opposition leaders
and journalists from leaving the country since the EU expanded
its sanctions against senior government officials, the
Belarusian Association of Journalists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least eight people associated with either opposition
politics, human rights activism or independent media have been
prevented from leaving the former Soviet republic since Feb. 27,
said Zhanna Litvina, head of the media freedom watchdog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litvina said by phone that she herself was prevented from
leaving the country today when border guards put an &#8220;exit
denied&#8221; stamp in her passport as she tried to board a flight to
Warsaw at the Minsk International Airport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This kind of pressure is practically a tradition in
Belarus, but it&#8217;s getting more intense now because of the
economic problems the government is facing,&#8221; Litvina said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Alexey Begun, head of the Interior Ministry&#8217;s
Citizenship and Migration service in Minsk, nor Dmitry
Levchenko, head of the service&#8217;s passport and foreign travel
department, could be reached immediately when Bloomberg called
their offices seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union on Feb. 27 added 21 officials to a list
of more than 200 it accuses of political repression, freezing
their assets and banning them from entering the trading bloc.
Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, expelled the EU&#8217;s
representative and the Polish ambassador in Minsk in return,
prompting all other EU countries to withdraw their ambassadors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belarus, a landlocked country between Poland and Russia, is
seeking to extend payments on a bailout loan from the
International Monetary Fund and receive a new $3.5 billion
credit. The country has Europe&#8217;s highest inflation and interest
rates, which reached 107 percent and 38 percent, respectively,
last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H+H International A/S (HH), which has
been resisting a takeover from a rival controlled by Goldman
Sachs Capital Partners since 2010, fell the most in 16 months in
Copenhagen after a German court said it would prohibit a merger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H+H fell as much as 21 percent, the most since November
2010, making it today&#8217;s biggest loser in the Copenhagen all-
share index. The stock declined 11 kroner, or 20 percent, to
44.50 kroner at 9:54 a.m. in Denmark&#8217;s capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Danish maker of lightweight concrete said late
yesterday the Bundeskartellamt issued a decision saying it would
block Xella International GmbH taking over H+H within the German
market. Copenhagen-based H+H said it will continue to pursue its
strategy on &#8220;a stand-alone basis&#8221; even if Xella, which is
controlled by Goldman&#8217;s private equity unit and Pai Partners,
decides to appeal the court&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After rejecting Xella&#8217;s contemplated takeover offer in
November 2010, the board of directors embarked on a turnaround
process for H+H which is now well under way,&#8221; the Danish
company said. Xella had submitted a pre-merger notification with
H+H to competition authorities in the E.U. and Germany without
the involvement of H+H, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Smith, the former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) derivatives salesman whose critique of the Wall
Street firm earned him $150 from the New York Times, has eluded
book agents and publishers who say his story could make him a
lot more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sky&#8217;s the limit,&#8221; said Esther Newberg of
International Creative Management in New York who&#8217;s been a
literary agent for 35 years. She said two of her colleagues have
reached out to Smith. &#8220;Agents and publishers are trying to talk
to him. The feedback we get is that he&#8217;s hiding for a while.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said in a March 14 opinion piece that a &#8220;toxic and
destructive&#8221; environment at Goldman Sachs drove him to quit
after 12 years. He reignited a debate about Wall Street that
played out on televisions and in newspapers around the world.
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable and highest-paying firm in
Wall Street history before the 2008 financial crisis, said it
disagreed with Smith&#8217;s depiction and that most employees say the
company provides exceptional client service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has also been unsuccessful in attempts to
contact Smith, who e-mailed his resignation at the same time his
article was published, a person familiar with the matter said.
The New York Times reported that Smith, a South African and a
Stanford University graduate, flew to New York this week from
London, where he&#8217;s worked for about a year. Smith didn&#8217;t reply
to a voicemail left on his mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;

A screen grab from Facebook shows a man identified as Greg Smith, a former employee of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. taken from his Facebook page on Thursday, March 15, 2012. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. saw $2.15 billion of its market value wiped out after an employee assailed Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein&#8217;s management and the firm&#8217;s treatment of clients, sparking debate across Wall Street. Close
&lt;/p&gt;
</body></entry><entry author="By Phil Mattingly and James Rowley" date="Mar 16, 2012  4:45 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-16/goldman-employee-reinforces-need-for-volcker-rule-democrats-say.html"><headline>Goldman Op-Ed Shows Need for Volcker Rule, Democrats Say</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
employee who criticized the company&#8217;s culture in a newspaper
column bolsters the case for Wall Street restrictions like the
Volcker rule, congressional Democrats said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the March 14 New York Times (NYT) opinion piece by former
executive director Greg Smith drew no requests for hearings or
investigations, lawmakers including Senators Carl Levin of
Michigan and Jeff Merkley said the article showed why the U.S.
needs tighter restrictions on Wall Street practices. The two
Democrats authored the Volcker rule&#8217;s ban on proprietary trading
and conflicts of interest in the Dodd-Frank Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress can&#8217;t &#8220;legislate the culture but I think the
heart of this goes to why we needed the Merkley-Levin
amendment,&#8221; Merkley, a member of the Senate Banking Committee,
said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers on Capitol Hill yesterday said the piece, which
has ricocheted through Wall Street firms, has had less of an
impact in Washington, where New York-based Goldman Sachs&#8217;
business practices and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C.
Blankfein were the targets of congressional hearings in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;A Little Research&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Doing a little research before you call for hearings is
important to understand the totality of the story,&#8221; Senator
Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat on the Banking Committee,
said yesterday in an interview on Bloomberg Television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on the
Banking Committee, said Smith&#8217;s comments deserve greater
scrutiny. He was skeptical there was much Congress could do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The biggest factor of change won&#8217;t be frankly because of
a statute or an investigation,&#8221;  Reed said in an interview.
&#8220;It will be the clients will come in and say we want a better
deal, we want assurances that our best interests are your sole
thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith&#8217;s column questioned the firm&#8217;s culture and said &#8220;the
interests of clients continue to be sidelined in the way the
firm operates and thinks about making money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been concerned about reaction to the
article from members of the House and Senate banking panels, as
well as Levin, who led a Senate investigation that produced a
639-page report that blamed the firm&#8217;s trading practices for
contributing to the financial crisis, according to a person
familiar with the firm&#8217;s thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defending the Firm &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s Washington office has been fielding calls about
the op-ed from congressional staff, administration officials and
other policy makers, the person said. In their conversations,
the in-house lobbyists are relaying a defense of the firm that
was included in a companywide memo from Blankfein and Gary Cohn,
the president and chief operating officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. Goldman Sachs shares fell 13 cents to
$122.93 at 4:15 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation panel&#8217;s report came less than a year
after Goldman Sachs paid $550 million to resolve Securities and
Exchange Commission claims that it failed to disclose that hedge
fund Paulson  Co. was betting against, and influenced the
selection of, collateralized debt obligations the company was
packaging and selling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Ethical Depths&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin told reporters yesterday that Smith&#8217;s article was
further confirmation of his subcommittee&#8217;s findings of &#8220;the
ethical depths to which Goldman had fallen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No further hearings are warranted by the panel he leads,
Levin said, because Goldman Sachs is &#8220;being scrutinized by a
number of entities and institutions already.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There still is an ongoing review by New York law
enforcement folks, I don&#8217;t think the Justice Department has
finished its review,&#8221; Levin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said when Levin&#8217;s report was released that it
didn&#8217;t mislead anyone about its activities and gave truthful and
accurate testimony to the committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein and Cohn addressed Smith&#8217;s criticism in a memo to
employees on March 14, noting that in a company of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s size, &#8220;it is not shocking that some people could feel
disgruntled.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Employee Survey &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent survey of employees found that 89 percent believe
the firm provides &#8216;exceptional service&#8217; to clients and that a
similar percentage of the firm&#8217;s 12,000 vice presidents, the
rank held by Smith, felt that way, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees are allowed to express concerns anonymously,
according to the memo. &#8220;We are not aware that the writer of the
opinion piece expressed misgivings through this avenue, however,
if an individual expresses issues, we examine them carefully and
we will be doing so in this case,&#8221; Blankfein and Cohn said in
the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said he
told his staff not to circulate Smith&#8217;s article. &#8220;There but for
the grace of God go us,&#8221; Gorman said at an event in New York
hosted by Fortune magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Barney Frank, the top Democrat on the House
Financial Services Committee, said the column serves as a
rebuttal to bank arguments that restrictions in trading
activities would result in increased costs for market
participants such as pension and mutual funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who Benefits? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What he does is to reinforce the notion that much of the
benefit from what they do goes to them and not to the broader
society,&#8221; Frank, who helped draft the law that bears his name,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make it criminal,
but it does remove one of the arguments against the new
restrictions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks, asset managers and mutual funds voiced concerns
in February comment letters to regulators over the impact that
rule barring proprietary trading may have on markets due to the
decrease in liquidity it may cause. Similar concerns have been
raised about some of the new rules being drafted to regulate the
derivatives market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other lawmakers, in part because of the hearings held
by Levin, the column had less impact than it had on Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not anything that we didn&#8217;t already know,&#8221;
Representative Brad Miller, a North Carolina Democrat on the
Financial Services panel, said in an telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised its
forecast for the dollar against the euro and the yen this year,
citing U.S. fiscal tightening that will weigh on higher-yielding
currencies as the Bank of Japan increases stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trade partners, will hold at
current levels during the next quarter before weakening,
currency strategists led by John Normand wrote in a note to
clients today. The firm lowered its end-of-year forecast for the
euro versus the dollar to $1.36 from $1.38. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expiration of tax cuts enacted during President George W.
Bush&#8217;s tenure, an increase to payroll taxes and other spending
cuts will drive the U.S. economy into a recession and lead to
further dollar gains as investors seek haven assets, JPMorgan
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fiscal retrenchment of this magnitude would probably
guarantee a U.S. recession and U.S. dollar strength versus most
currencies through deleveraging,&#8221; Normand wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar has risen 1.2 percent against the euro so far
this month. It fell 0.7 percent to $1.3167 at 4:07 p.m. in New
York. It dropped 0.2 percent to 83.37 yen after rallying 8.4
percent this year. The Dollar Index (DXY) fell 0.4 percent to 79.881. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against the Japanese currency, the dollar will strengthen
to as high as 86 by mid-June before ending the year at 83. While
projections for further stimulus from the Bank of Japan may
weigh on the yen, the long-term downtrend remains for dollar-yen
depreciation, Normand wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa indicated last
week the central bank will keep using monetary policy as a tool
to tackle deflation. The BOJ unexpectedly added 10 trillion yen
($128 billion) to its asset-purchase program on Feb. 14. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Times (NYT), drawing
criticism for running an op-ed by a former Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) executive attacking the bank, said the piece was one of
thousands of unsolicited submissions it receives weekly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We got it by e-mail,&#8221; New York Times editorial page
editor Andrew Rosenthal said in a telephone interview. Smith was
paid about $150 for his submission, a typical amount, said a
person with direct knowledge of the situation who declined to be
identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. The newspaper
pays varying amounts for its op-eds, except to public figures or
politicians, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street, including Morgan Stanley (MS) Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, has faulted the newspaper for publishing
an op-ed piece based on the view of one among more than 30,000
Goldman Sachs employees. All the facts that could be checked
were checked in Smith&#8217;s submission, Rosenthal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The purpose of the op-ed page is to air an important
position,&#8221; Rosenthal said. &#8220;We&#8217;re saying, &#8216;This is
interesting,&#8217; and by the way, &#8216;interesting,&#8217; very often means
it&#8217;ll make you crazy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the March 14 op-ed that explained why he was quitting,
Greg Smith called Goldman Sachs&#8217;s culture &#8220;toxic and
destructive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein rebutted
Smith&#8217;s claims in a letter to employees the same day, saying his
assertions didn&#8217;t reflect the New York-based bank&#8217;s values and
how the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of its employees think about their
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Piece Merited Publication &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Gorman said he told staff not to circulate
the op-ed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was surprised that anyone would run an op-ed piece
based upon the view of a single employee,&#8221; Gorman said today at
an event in New York hosted by Fortune magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith was identified by the newspaper as an executive
director and head of the bank&#8217;s U.S. equity derivatives business
in Europe. While Smith wasn&#8217;t among the most senior executives
at Goldman Sachs, his screed against the firm&#8217;s culture merited
publication, Rosenthal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal declined to say when Smith&#8217;s letter was received
and how long it took for the editorial staff to verify the
submission. The majority of op-ed pieces are commissioned, or
from writers who have previously written for the section, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Very few come over the transom queue,&#8221; Rosenthal said.
&#8220;Some of them famously have -- this is one of them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) informed the
government of Iraq it froze its contracts with the semi-
autonomous region of Kurdistan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We received the letter from Exxon to freeze the oil
contract with Kurdistan,&#8221; Iraqi Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-
Luaibi told reporters today in Paris. Entry into Kurdistan will
&#8220;depend on a new oil and gas law and if it&#8217;s approved there is
a good chance to solve all the problems with Kurdistan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq received a letter from Exxon March 5 and the company
may be allowed to join a next bidding round for oil contracts
&#8220;if we receive another letter on this issue,&#8221; al-Luaibi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said by e-mail he declined to
comment on al-Luaibi&#8217;s comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s central government has so far refused to recognize
production-sharing agreements between foreign companies and
Kurdistan, home to about 40 percent of Iraq&#8217;s 115 billion
barrels of reserves. The central government insists on service
contracts with foreign companies, rather than production-sharing
contracts, and says it needs to pre-approve any agreements
concerning energy resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production from Kurdistan is more than 180,000 barrels a
day and the central government is receiving about 70,000 barrels
a day, the Iraqi minister said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), which dropped
prices on its Internet-based cloud-computing service last week,
said it will keep cutting when it can, putting pressure on
competitors like Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to keep its own prices low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers of Amazon&#8217;s EC2 service, which lets clients run
their programs on the online retailer&#8217;s server computers, saw
price cuts of as much as 37 percent on March 5, and other Amazon
cloud service prices were trimmed as well. Microsoft responded
days later with reductions on its rival Azure services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect prices to be lower and lower over time, and
load volumes to be higher and higher,&#8221; said Adam Selipsky, a
vice president at Amazon Web Services. Amazon has lowered prices
19 times in the 6 years it has sold Amazon Web Services, which
has gained customers as more companies seek to run and store
applications in outside data centers instead of maintaining the
servers themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they tussle over price, the resulting narrower profit
margins may be tough to swallow for both companies. Microsoft is
under pressure from investors concerned about its entry into
markets where costs are higher than its traditional software
business. Meanwhile, Amazon&#8217;s stock has slid about 25 percent
from a record in October as expanded investments in areas such
as cloud services and the Kindle Fire tablet halved margins in
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s another round of a race to the bottom, and this
won&#8217;t be the last one,&#8221; said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC
Partners in New York. &#8220;Amazon has made it pretty clear that
they are interested in share over profits, at least for now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Margin Shock &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Amazon are jousting to stay competitive on
price for a reason: The market for so-called public cloud
services will increase from $21.5 billion in 2010 to $72.9
billion in 2015, according to the most recent forecast from
researcher IDC, released in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a veteran of the retail business -- with its razor-thin
margins -- Seattle-based Amazon is more adept at dealing with
pricing pressure than Microsoft, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon&#8217;s margins are about 10 percent on cloud services, a
higher rate than its retail businesses, estimates David Smith,
an analyst at Gartner Inc. For Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, whose operating margins are 60 percent or wider on
Windows and Office software, the scantier cloud profits are a
more difficult adjustment, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon&#8217;s overall operating margin -- an indicator of
profitability that measures revenue minus operating expenses --
narrowed by more than half to 1.8 percent last year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft&#8217;s was little changed at
39 percent in fiscal 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Passing On Savings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Amazon is setting the price, and that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s
going to be for some time,&#8221; said Smith. While Selipsky said the
company is trying to pass along its operational savings to
customers, Gartner&#8217;s Smith said the reductions are more about
pressuring rivals. &#8220;It&#8217;s in their best interest to cut because
they force the others to lower prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pricing pressure is likely to persist as new companies
enter the market. Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) is now testing a competing
service and plans to release it officially this spring, said
Michael Thacker, a spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google last week also trimmed the price of its cloud-based
storage service. Amazon had cut the price on its competing
service last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meredith Lynch, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to
comment on the price competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way Amazon might lose pricing power is if an
overseas provider with even lower costs enters the cloud-
services market, or a company that operates in another industry
with low margins, such as a website-registration company like Go
Daddy Group Inc. (DADY), starts to offer the same services, said Smith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a commodity business,&#8221; said BGC&#8217;s Gillis. &#8220;These
are ubiquitous services where you win with massive scale, and
the way that you achieve massive scale is to lower the price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman said he told staff not to circulate a
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) employee&#8217;s op-ed criticizing that firm
and that it wasn&#8217;t fair for a newspaper to publish it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was surprised that anyone would run an op-ed piece
based upon the view of a single employee,&#8221; said Gorman,
speaking at an event in New York hosted by Fortune magazine.
&#8220;To pick a random employee, I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair, and I
didn&#8217;t think it was balanced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs employee, Greg Smith, assailed that
firm&#8217;s top managers and treatment of clients while explaining in
a New York Times op-ed why he was quitting. Goldman Sachs said
it disagrees with his assertions. The New York-based firm sent a
memo to current and former employees, saying most of its workers
believe it provides exceptional service to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gorman joins JPMorgan Chase  Co. CEO Jamie Dimon in
warning executives not to take advantage of the op-ed, which has
opened a public debate over how New York-based Goldman Sachs
treats customers. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s shares lost $2.15 billion in
value on March 14, the day it was published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At any point in time, somebody&#8217;s unhappy with me, with
the organization, with the board, with the direction of the
firm,&#8221; Gorman said. &#8220;There but for the grace of God go us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petroleos de Venezuela SA will end
all ventures with Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) after an arbitration case at
the World Bank is resolved, Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said in an interview with El Mundo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision on assets nationalized by Venezuela in 2007
could come at the end of this year or early 2013, Ramirez said,
according to the interview published today in the Caracas-based
newspaper. The Washington-based International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes, part of the World Bank, is
handling the arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and PDVSA, as the state company is called, each have
a 50 percent stake in the Chalmette refinery in Louisiana. The
state oil company wants to convert a heavy crude upgrader at the
Petromonagas facility in Venezuela into a full refinery that can
process crude currently sent to Chalmette, said Ramirez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, PDVSA has started a process to divest its 50 percent
stake in the Nynas AB venture with Neste OYG that operates
refineries in Sweden, Belgium and the United Kingdom, Ramirez
told the paper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CarVal Investors LLC, a money

&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group Inc. equity
strategists joined JPMorgan Chase  Co. in switching to a
forecast for European earnings growth this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team led by Andrew Garthwaite at the Swiss bank increased
its estimate for 2012 profit growth to 1 percent today. The
brokerage had predicted a contraction of 5 percent. JPMorgan&#8217;s
Mislav Matejka changed his prediction on March 12 to 5 percent
earnings growth from a previous forecast of stagnation.
Analysts&#8217; earnings revisions in the region have turned positive,
meaning upgrades outnumber downgrades, for the first time in
almost a year, according to Citigroup Inc. data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved earnings would give bulls more room to argue that
stocks will extend gains. Valuations have climbed at the fastest
pace since 2009 even though several European nations have
entered a recession. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) has risen 11
percent this year as the European Central Bank lent $1.3
trillion to banks to keep credit markets open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors want to see a more fundamentally driven rally,
rather than a low-quality technical rebound, and confirmation
through the earnings revisions turning positive may drive the
next leg,&#8221; Matejka, a London-based strategist at JPMorgan, said
in a phone interview today. &#8220;We think earnings revisions
bottoming out will allow investors to participate with more
confidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Positive Earnings Revisions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data (CGEREUXU) from Citigroup on Feb. 17 showed that positive
revisions in analysts&#8217; European earnings projections outnumbered
negative changes on a weekly basis for the first time since May
2011 after economic reports in the U.S. exceeded estimates.
Negative annual profit revisions on Stoxx 600 companies
outnumbered upgrades by 7 percent last week, according to data
from JPMorgan, their smallest majority since March 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If this trend is sustained, it will help support stock
markets,&#8221; Citigroup strategists led by Robert Buckland wrote in
a report on March 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx 600 (SXXP) is trading at 11.34 times the estimated
profits of its members, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
compared with 9.1 times in September. The jump in the ratio is
the steepest for any six-month period since October 2009, the
data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Managing
Directors Cynthia A. &#8220;Cindy&#8221; Brower and Wendy E. Sacks, 19-
year veterans who split a job in the credit-sales group, are
leaving the firm, people with knowledge of their exits said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brower, 46, and Sacks, 40, who met in the New York-based
bank&#8217;s training program when they joined on the same day in
1993, had been sharing a sales role for the past three years so
they could each work part-time, said the people, who asked to
remain anonymous because the departures haven&#8217;t been announced.
The pair handled sales of loans and distressed debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their decision to leave wasn&#8217;t connected to this week&#8217;s
resignation by Greg Smith, a London-based employee in equity-
derivative sales who cited the firm&#8217;s &#8220;toxic and destructive&#8221;
environment in a New York Times op-ed explaining why he was
quitting after 12 years, the people said. The firm, which said
it disagreed with Smith&#8217;s assertions, sent a memo to current and
former employees, saying most of its workers believe it provides
exceptional service to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While Goldman typically faced little employee turnover,
departures among partners and managing directors have increased
substantially over the past year,&#8221; Charles Peabody, an analyst
at Portales Partners LLC in New York who rates the stock
&#8220;outperform,&#8221; wrote in a March 14 research note. &#8220;Top
executives who have been instrumental in building many of GS&#8217;s
successful businesses, and made great fortunes in the process,
are stepping away in the face of a changing environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compensation Drops &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company lost about 50 partners, the highest level of
employee, in the 12 months through January as revenue and
compensation fell at Goldman Sachs and throughout the industry.
The firm also eliminated 2,400 jobs last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, rose
2.2 percent to $123.06 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, recouping most of the loss it suffered the
day before following the publication of Smith&#8217;s opinion piece.
The stock is up 36 percent this year, beating the 21 percent
gain in the 81-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brower and Sacks worked in the fixed-income division
throughout their careers at Goldman Sachs, and current and
former colleagues said they were successful and highly regarded.
Sacks decided to retire a few weeks ago for personal reasons,
according to two of the people. Brower also decided to leave
after the firm offered her different work schedules, three of
the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Columbia Recruiting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brower spent her first 13 years in high-yield debt sales,
was promoted to managing director at the end of 2003 and was the
sales manager from 2004 to 2006 before taking her most recent
role. She also led recruiting efforts for the fixed-income
division at Columbia Business School and was involved in the
firm&#8217;s women&#8217;s network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She worked at Dillon Read  Co. and Kidder Peabody  Co.
before joining Goldman Sachs and had a master&#8217;s degree in
finance and marketing from Columbia. She didn&#8217;t reply to a
message left on her mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sacks, who was promoted to managing director in 2006,
started her Goldman Sachs career in interest-rate sales and
joined bank-loan sales in 2001. She didn&#8217;t reply to an e-mail
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s bank-loan division suffered high-level
departures last year, including Buckley T. Ratchford, the
partner who was global head of bank-loan trading and distressed
investing; and Blake W. Mather, a partner who ran bank-loan
sales. The company had approximately $1 billion in unrealized
losses related to relationship lending activities last year,
according to an annual filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A German court ordered Berlin&#8217;s
Deutsches Historisches Museum to return a collection of 4,259
posters looted by the Gestapo to the son of Hans Sachs, a Jewish
dentist who fled Nazi Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bundesgerichtshof in Karlsruhe, the highest court in
Germany for civil affairs, today overturned a January 2010
ruling by a Berlin appeals court. Sachs, a retired airline pilot
from Sarasota, Florida, has been fighting a legal battle for his
father&#8217;s posters since a German government panel rebuffed his
claim in 2007. The Deutsches Historisches Museum, owned by the
German government and the state of Berlin, estimates their value
at more than 4.5 million euros ($5.9 million.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t describe what this means to me on a personal
level,&#8221; Sachs said in a statement sent by his U.S. lawyer, Gary Osen. &#8220;It feels like vindication for my father, a final
recognition of the life he lost and never got back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nazis stole about 650,000 artworks, the New York-based
Jewish Claims Conference estimates. International restitution
guidelines agreed in 1998, known as the Washington Principles,
have paved the way for a number of high-profile claims for art
in museums by Nazi victims and their heirs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Lawsuits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany was one of the countries that endorsed that accord.
The Culture Ministry has said the government is concerned that a
decision in Sachs&#8217;s favor may lead to a slew of similar lawsuits
by heirs who have been compensated for lost artworks but have
not had them restituted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) should be
prohibited from boosting its dividend or repurchasing stock
because Federal Reserve stress tests showed the investment bank
is too leveraged, according to former regulator Sheila Bair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leverage ratios of four financial firms dropped below 4
percent under the stressed scenario, according to test results
the Fed released this week. Two of those firms, Citigroup Inc. (C)
and MetLife Inc. (MET), were prohibited from raising dividends or
repurchasing shares. The central bank approved the capital plans
of two others, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No distribution should have been approved that would
bring the leverage ratio below 4 percent,&#8221; Bair, the former
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said yesterday
in an interview. &#8220;With leverage of 25-to-1, during a crisis,
these banks would likely suffer a run.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bair, before leaving the FDIC in July, fought for the
leverage ratio to be more central in U.S. and international bank
regulations. Even though her ideas were accepted initially at
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the European Union
has since balked at implementing a leverage ratio in addition to
other capital requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leverage ratio caps bank borrowing based on total
assets on the balance sheet, ignoring the riskiness of different
holdings. When a bank is highly leveraged, a small change in
asset prices is enough to wipe out capital, making it insolvent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Minimum Threshold &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed set a leverage ratio of 3 percent, the minimum
required by U.S. law, as the threshold for 15 of the 19 banks
that underwent stress tests. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (MS) and
Citigroup were in the 3 percent group. MetLife, the largest U.S.
life insurer and owner of a banking operation, was in the 4
percent group. All of the firms are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns Cos. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) both
had capital ratios that met regulatory requirements, based on
their risk-weighted assets, just before they collapsed in 2008.
Their simple leverage exceeded 33-to-1, or was below 3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two investment banks faced a run from their short-term
creditors who refused to renew overnight or weekly loans when
concern about the value of their assets mounted. Investors focus
on the leverage ratio, not-risk-based capital measures, during
market turmoil, Bair said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This underscores another weakness of the tests: They
didn&#8217;t really stress liquidity,&#8221; said Bair, now a senior
adviser at Pew Charitable Trusts, a Washington-based nonprofit.
&#8220;The investment banks are particularly vulnerable to liquidity
failures because they don&#8217;t have a large, core deposit base.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;thin&#8221; one-kilometer (0.6 mile)
oil stain was identified in Brazil&#8217;s offshore Frade field, where
Chevron Corp. (CVX) suspended production this week after a new sea-
floor seep, the country&#8217;s navy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stain was found yesterday by a navy inspector flying
over the area in the Atlantic Ocean, the navy said in a
statement dated yesterday on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The navy, Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator ANP and federal
environmental agency Ibama will monitor Chevron&#8217;s cleanup of the
stain, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls placed to the navy seeking further information went
unanswered, and a Chevron spokesman wasn&#8217;t immediately
available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, which was stopped from exploring in the field
after a spill of as much as 3,000 barrels in the area in
November, requested authorization from ANP on March 15 to
suspend production there while it investigates a new sea-floor
seep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based company captured less than
five liters (1.3 gallons) from the seep, Rafael Williamson, a
director of corporate affairs at Chevron, said at a press
conference in Rio de Janeiro on the same day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A judge in Brazil barred 17 Chevron
Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG) executives yesterday from leaving the
country after a new leak near an offshore oil well that spilled
110,000 gallons (416,395 liters) last year, the Associated Press
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal judge&#8217;s order names George Buck, the chief
operating officer of Chevron&#8217;s Brazilian division, and includes
16 other Chevron and Transocean officials, AP said, citing
Marcelo del Negri, a spokesman for Brazilian federal
prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Chevron Brasil nor its executives have been
formally notified of any action by the judiciary, Chevron told
Bloomberg News in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We will defend the
company and its employees and any legal decision will be abided

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) named Thom Gruhler,
who oversaw advertising campaigns for telecom and technology
clients at McCann Worldgroup, to run Windows Phone marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gruhler, 42, was global managing partner of telecom and
technology at the agency, Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest
software company, said today in a statement on its website.
Before that he ran the Verizon Wireless account, overseeing the
teams that developed the &#8220;Can you hear me now?&#8221; campaign. He
becomes the third marketing vice president to try selling
Microsoft&#8217;s revamped Windows Phone software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the product has gotten positive reviews, it accounts
for a 2 percent share of the market for smartphone operating
systems, according to Gartner Inc., a research company. In
December, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer
removed Andy Lees as head of the phone-software business, naming
Terry Myerson to the post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Windows Phone is a uniquely compelling product, and Thom
will help us bring that to life for our customers,&#8221; Myerson
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is refining its
marketing plan for targeting the consumers it believes will
respond to the Windows Phone brand, Myerson said in an interview
last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lees said in an interview last year that the phones would
see an increase in marketing dollars, which may be spent to
improve incentives for retailers&#8217; employees to tout Windows
Phones to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job of marketing vice president was last held by Achim
Berg, who moved to oversee relationships with operators last
year. Windows Phone 7 was introduced in 2010 with marketing led
by Todd Peters, an executive Microsoft recruited from Staples
Inc. to add consumer-marketing experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) moved up the
release of first-quarter results, matching JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
and positioning the two most profitable U.S. lenders to set the
tone for the industry&#8217;s earnings season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo will report on Friday, April 13 at 8 a.m. New
York time, about an hour later than JPMorgan, according to a
March 13 statement. JPMorgan, which has been the first of the
largest U.S. banks to report results since January 2009,
announced its timing on March 16. Wells Fargo had been last to
report among the four biggest lenders, including Bank of America
Corp. and Citigroup Inc., as recently as last April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the two strongest U.S. banks, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo
will set the standard used by investors and analysts to evaluate
results that come later from rivals, said Marty Mosby, an
analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC. The change also may show
that Wells Fargo executives are confident about first-quarter
results and that Chief Financial Officer Timothy J. Sloan, who
was named to the post in February 2011, is more comfortable in
his role at the San Francisco-based company, Mosby said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Being in the front allows you to set the stage for your
earnings and how you want them interpreted,&#8221; Mosby said in an
interview. &#8220;Everyone else then has to react.&#8221; Units at the two
banks represent most of the industry&#8217;s business lines, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo had reported earlier in the earnings cycle,
then fell back after the purchase of Wachovia Corp., Mary Eshet,
a company spokeswoman, said in phone interview. The bank moved
the date earlier in recent quarters, she said. JPMorgan&#8217;s
earnings schedule depends on the timing of its board meeting,
Joseph Evangelisti, a bank spokesman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo is the biggest home lender and ranks fourth by
assets among U.S. banks. JPMorgan, based in New York, leads by
assets and deposits. New York-based Citigroup, ranked third by
assets, plans to post results April 16, while Bank of America,
ranked second and based in Charlotte, North Carolina, expects to
report on April 19, according to company statements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chief executive officers of
Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s and Transocean Ltd.&#8217;s Brazilian units are among
17 executives at the two companies banned from leaving the
country pending an investigation into an offshore oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s George Buck and Transocean&#8217;s Michael Legrand were
on the list of managers that federal prosecutors asked Judge
Vlamir Costa Magalhaes to ban from leaving Brazil, according to
a copy of the request sent today by Marcelo Del Negri, a
spokesman for the prosecutor&#8217;s office. The judge issued the ban
March 16, referring to the &#8220;people listed&#8221; on the request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nov. 7 leak of 3,000 barrels of oil at Chevron&#8217;s $3.6
billion Frade field off the coast of Rio de Janeiro occurred at
a time when Brazil is increasing scrutiny of deepwater drilling
following the 2010 Macondo spill in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico,
about 1,630 times bigger. Transocean owned the rig involved in
the spill, which state and federal lawmakers have criticized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They took this out of proportion,&#8221; Cleveland Jones, an
oil specialist and geology professor at Rio de Janeiro State
University, said in a telephone interview, referring to Brazil&#8217;s
reaction to the leak. &#8220;It&#8217;s far from the coast and it&#8217;s a small
volume.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seepages are common in regions such as the Gulf of Mexico
and the North Sea, Jones said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has not been notified of the court order yet,
Claudia Afflalo, a press officer for the company, said in a
telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro. Chevron will defend
itself and its employees, spokesman Kurt Glaubitz said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday. Guy Cantwell, a spokesman for
Transocean, (RIG) declined to comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clear Motives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives &#8220;appear to have foreign citizenship or
financial conditions and clear motives to want to leave the
country,&#8221; Costa Magalhaes said in the order. Their departure
&#8220;at this time and under the current circumstances, would pose
great risk to the investigation and the eventual application of
the criminal law,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Chevron shut what oil production remains at the
field after detecting a new leak, Glaubitz said. He said the
shutdown was temporary and the company will conduct a geologic
study of the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frade was producing about 60,000 barrels a day before last
week&#8217;s spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-biggest U.S. oil company by market
value, and the Brazilian Navy identified a &#8220;thin&#8221; sheen of oil
at the Frade field on March 16 that extended about a kilometer
(3,280 feet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose 0.5 percent to $110.80 at 3:50 p.m. in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years after the Teamsters union
faced off against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to keep YRC Worldwide
Inc. (YRCW) out of bankruptcy, the second-biggest U.S. trucker is back
on the brink. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps tied to the company, whose units
include New Penn, Holland and Reddaway, imply an 87 percent
chance of default, according to data provider CMA. Bonds from
Overland Park, Kansas-based YRC, which employed 32,000 on Dec.
31, have lost 50 percent of their value in six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as a strengthening U.S. economy boosts profits at
FedEx Corp. and Con-Way Inc., YRC is set to lose $68.6 million
this quarter, according to the average estimate of four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, which would be its eighth loss in nine
periods. Its competitors grabbed market share by lowering prices
and attracting customers after YRC averted bankruptcy in 2009
through a debt exchange with a face value of $470 million. YRC&#8217;s
revenue fell to $4.9 billion last year from $9.9 in 2006 while
long-term borrowings rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a whole lot of faith that this will work
itself out over the near term,&#8221; said David Berge, an analyst at
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service in New York. &#8220;There&#8217;s still a fairly
high likelihood of them being in a default or distressed
situation over the next year, year and a half. They&#8217;re still
burning cash.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YRC projects it won&#8217;t earn enough money to satisfy lender
requirements starting in the second quarter, meaning it will
have to either negotiate a new arrangement or accelerate debt
payments, according to a Feb. 28 filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;In Compliance&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If lenders demand repayment, YRC &#8220;will not have sufficient
cash and cash flows from operations to repay such
indebtedness,&#8221; it said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The current covenant package and corresponding forecast
were set by the previous management team,&#8221; Jamie Pierson, YRC&#8217;s
chief financial officer, wrote in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We
fully anticipate resetting the covenants so that we will be in
compliance the second quarter and beyond.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on YRC jumped to 44.5 percent upfront
on March 7, the highest level since 2009, before falling to 43.3
percent on March 15, according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. That means the upfront cost to
protect $10 million of YRC bonds from default for five years
increased to $4.45 million in addition to $500,000 annually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonds Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives traders were demanding 35.2 percent upfront at
the end of last year. YRC&#8217;s swaps were the fourth-worst
performers in the past three months compared with other
companies worldwide, according to the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its 10 percent bonds due in March 2015 dropped to 36 cents
on the dollar as of March 14 from 72 cents in September,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Shares of the company
have dropped 11 percent this year to $8.91 as of 11:19 a.m.
today in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2009, YRC extended a tender-offer deadline six
times before bondholders agreed to swap equity for debt,
allowing the trucker to delay a $19 million interest payment
that would have left it in an &#8220;unsustainable&#8221; position,
according to a regulatory filing at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bondholder pushback prompted International Brotherhood
of Teamsters President James Hoffa to ask federal and state
authorities to review &#8220;questionable promotion&#8221; of credit-
default swaps tied to YRC debt. He named Goldman Sachs, Deutsche
Bank AG, Toronto Dominion Bank, Barclays Capital, and UBS AG as
firms with a &#8220;history of making markets&#8221; in derivatives trades
that would profit from YRC&#8217;s bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Goal Line&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said at the time that the New York-based bank
&#8220;neither has a position in, nor makes markets in, YRC corporate
bonds or credit-default swaps.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After YRC received bondholder approval, Bill Zollars, its
chief executive officer at the time, said Goldman Sachs,
Deutsche Bank, Aristeia Capital LLC, Silverback Asset Management
and a Smith Management LLC unit &#8220;got us over the goal line by
going into the market, buying bonds and tendering them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zollars previously said that &#8220;the most difficult
bondholders to deal with were investors with credit-default
swaps that paid off if the company went bankrupt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later, YRC&#8217;s auditor, KPMG LLP, said the
company&#8217;s financial condition raises &#8220;substantial doubt about
the company&#8217;s ability to continue,&#8221; according to the Feb. 28
filing. The trucker has $175 million of pension payments and
$48.3 million of lease obligations due this year, according to
the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top Providers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company&#8217;s market share substantially declined over
the past few years,&#8221; Standard  Poor&#8217;s analysts led by Anita Ogbara wrote in a Feb. 29 report. As a result of YRC&#8217;s &#8220;well-
publicized financial distress, its competitors sought to gain
market share by pricing aggressively.&#8221; they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ratio of YRC&#8217;s costs compared with revenue increased in
the past two quarters, while Con-Way&#8217;s decreased, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The less-than-truckload business,
which relies on a healthy U.S. economy for its success, is
concentrated among the top providers, with the 10 biggest
carriers accounting for about 67 percent of the $33 billion U.S.
and Canadian market, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YRC has about $1.3 billion of indebtedness, an amount that
will increase because YRC is incurring new debt to pay some of
its interest, the filing showed. Most of the company&#8217;s debt
matures in 2014 and 2015. Its enterprise value, the sum of its
stock-market capitalization and net debt was $1.22 billion on
March 16, down from $4.09 billion at the end of 2005. Its
aggregate equity price has declined to $65.7 million from $2.56
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Operational Story&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since the company&#8217;s finalization of its last
restructuring of July 2011, there&#8217;s been significant management
changes to focus on the company&#8217;s operations,&#8221; Iain Gold, the
Teamsters union&#8217;s director of strategic research and campaigns,
said. &#8220;This is an operational story that, given time, markets
will reflect more accurately the value of the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is divesting assets and resources not related
to its core less-than-truckload business -- in which it hauls
goods for more than one customer in the same trailer -- in North
America, according to Pierson&#8217;s statement. It sold some of the
assets from its Glen Moore truckload operating subsidiary to
Celadon Trucking Services Inc., in said on Dec. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Management &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, James Welch took over as CEO and a new board of
directors was installed, with James Hoffman, former president of
Alliant Energy Resources, acting as chairman. Michelle Russell
was appointed general counsel and secretary this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YRC said it appointed Pierson as CFO in November. He
previously was a managing director at Alvarez  Marsal North
America LLC, where he focused on out-of-court restructurings and
senior management advisory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The restructuring gave them time, but they certainly
weren&#8217;t out of the woods,&#8221; said Berge of Moody&#8217;s, which has
assigned YRC a corporate family rating of Caa3, the lowest rung
of a category considered to be of poor standing and high credit
risk. &#8220;Last time around they were reliant on a couple of
transactions being successfully completed. Now they&#8217;re reliant
on the market cooperating with them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Equity Partners LLC, JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s buyout arm, sold its remaining stake in AMAG
Austria Metall AG (AMAG) to BC Industrieholding GmbH and
Raiffeisenlandesbank Oberoesterreich AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BC, which already owns shares in Lenzing AG (LNZ), Semperit AG (SEM)
and Allgemeine Baugesellschaft Porr AG (POS), agreed to buy a 29.9
percent stake in the Austrian aluminum maker, while RLB OOe
acquired 4.7 percent, boosting its holding to 16.44 percent,
according to statements from the companies. The companies didn&#8217;t
say how much they paid for the AMAG stakes. On the basis of
AMAG&#8217;s closing share price on March 16, the stakes are valued at
about 233 million euros ($307 million), according to Bloomberg
calculations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds advised by One Equity took control of AMAG in 2010
when it bought Constantia Packaging AG. It sold most of its
shares in AMAG in an initial public offering in Vienna last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BC Chief Executive Officer Michael Junghans said last year
that BC, which is the investment vehicle of a non-profit
foundation dedicated to &#8220;promote Austrian entrepreneurship,&#8221;
was looking for a &#8220;fourth pillar&#8221; to compliment its holding in

four fuel retailers including the Bulgarian units of OMV AG (OMV) of

by a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive attacking the
bank, said the piece was one of thousands of unsolicited
submissions it receives weekly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We got it by e-mail,&#8221; New York Times editorial page
editor Andrew Rosenthal said in a telephone interview. Smith was
paid about $150 for his submission, a typical amount, said a
person with direct knowledge of the situation who declined to be
identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street, including Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, has faulted the newspaper for publishing
an op-ed piece based on the view of one among more than 30,000
Goldman Sachs employees. All the facts that could be checked
were checked in Smith&#8217;s submission, Rosenthal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The purpose of the op-ed page is to air an important
position,&#8221; Rosenthal said. &#8220;We&#8217;re saying, &#8216;This is
interesting,&#8217; and by the way, &#8216;interesting,&#8217; very often means
it&#8217;ll make you crazy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the March 14 op-ed that explained why he was quitting,
Greg Smith called Goldman Sachs&#8217;s culture &#8220;toxic and
destructive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein rebutted
Smith&#8217;s claims in a letter to employees the same day, saying his
assertions didn&#8217;t reflect the New York-based bank&#8217;s values and
how the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of its employees think about their
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cohan Not Surprised Politics Has Entered Goldman Debate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Cohan, author of &#8220;Money and Power: How Goldman
Sachs Came to Rule the World&#8221; and a Bloomberg View columnist,
and Bloomberg&#8217;s Christine Harper talked about the ramifications
of the opinion piece from outgoing Goldman Sachs Group executive
Greg Smith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They spoke with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle on
Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Opinion Piece Political Fallout Discussed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg&#8217;s Phil Mattingly, Julianna Goldman and Peter Cook
discussed the political repercussions of Greg Smith&#8217;s New York
Times (NYT) op-ed piece on Goldman Sachs. They spoke on Bloomberg
television&#8217;s &#8220;InBusiness With Margaret Brennan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;EU Seeks Information on Italy&#8217;s Draft Law on Unbundling Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission is seeking information from Italy
to determine if proposed legislation will affect the powers of
the national telecommunications authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A national legislative provision which would restrict the
decision-making authority&#8221; of the Italian agency &#8220;would be
incompatible with EU telecoms rules,&#8221; Dennis Abbott, spokesman
at the Brussels-based commission, said in an e-mail summarizing
part of a letter the EU sent to the Italian government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an amendment to a draft law, Italy is seeking to boost
competition in the telecommunications market with rules to open
up network access and services, including maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU said there would be no &#8220;such concern&#8221; on the draft
law&#8217;s compatibility with EU law if the provision were limited to
&#8220;explicitly facilitating&#8221; the Italian agency&#8217;s exercise of its
powers, including the ability to require network operators to
set out access terms that avoid charging rivals for facilities
they don&#8217;t need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overseas Borrowings by Indian Companies May Surge After Tax Cut &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian companies building the nation&#8217;s roads, ports and
power plants may borrow more from overseas after the government
reduced the tax on interest paid to foreign investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called withholding tax was cut to 5 percent from 20
percent, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said March 16 in his
budget presentation for the year starting April 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Manmohan Singh plans to spend $1 trillion in
the next five years to improve infrastructure as the South Asian
nation seeks to lift out of poverty 828 million people the World
Bank says live on less than $2 a day. The central bank raised
rates 13 times in the past two years, the fastest pace of
increases by any monetary authority in Asia, making rupee-debt
costlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five-year borrowing costs in the local currency for
companies rated AAA by Standard  Poor&#8217;s Indian unit Crisil Ltd.
are at 9.46 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surge in overseas borrowings is &#8220;inevitable&#8221; because
rates are not likely to soften immediately, said K. Raja Gopal,
chief executive officer at the power unit of Lanco Infratech
Ltd., India&#8217;s second-largest, non-state power utility, said in a
phone interview from New Delhi March 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Barnier to Propose Retail Investment Product Rules Next Month &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michel Barnier, the European Union&#8217;s financial services
chief, said that he would present proposals next month to
bolster oversight and protection of money managed by so-called
ucits funds. The EU will also publish rules on investment
opportunities that banks offer their customers, Barnier said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ucits are undertakings for collective investment in
transferable securities. The rules on ucits are needed to
prevent another Bernard Madoff-type scandal, Barnier said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldspreads Finds &#8216;Financial Irregularities,&#8217; Suspends Shares &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldspreads Group Plc (WSPR), a British broker and spread-betting
company, suspended trading in its shares after finding
&#8220;possible financial irregularities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has informed the Financial Services Authority
and will make further announcements &#8220;in due course,&#8221; London-
based Worldspreads said in a statement March 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the uncertainty as to the outcome, Worldspreads is
currently unable to assess its financial position, and inform
the market accordingly, and considers the suspension to be
appropriate,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Will Answer Privacy Questions Over Safari &#8216;Cookies&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) will cooperate with privacy regulators looking
into how its advertising &#8220;cookies&#8221; were enabled by Apple
Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s Safari Internet browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has been removing the files since discovering that a
temporary link created between Safari and Google&#8217;s servers
enabled other ad cookies to be set on the browser program, the
company said March 16. The Wall Street Journal reported March 16
that Google is being investigated by U.S. and European Union
regulators for using Safari users&#8217; information and bypassing the
Apple software&#8217;s privacy settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will of course cooperate with any officials who have
questions,&#8221; Mountain View, California-based Google said in an
e-mailed statement. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t anticipate this would happen,
and we have been removing these advertising cookies from
Safari.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s privacy policy is under review by France&#8217;s data-
protection agency acting on behalf of other European regulators.
The world&#8217;s largest Web-search provider defied two requests by
the National Commission for Computing and Civil Liberties, known
by its French acronym as CNIL, to suspend changes to the policy
while it was determined whether those changes comply with
European privacy standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNIL is preparing a list of questions to send to Google
next week, a spokeswoman for the agency said March 16. She
declined to comment on whether the questionnaire would cover the
Safari cookies, and declined to be cited by name, citing CNIL
policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Italy Said to Pay Morgan Stanley $3.4 Billion on Derivative &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Morgan Stanley (MS) said in January it had cut its &#8220;net
exposure&#8221; to Italy by $3.4 billion, it didn&#8217;t tell investors
that the nation paid that entire amount to the bank to exit a
bet on interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy, the second-most indebted nation in the European
Union, paid the money to unwind derivative contracts from the
1990s that had backfired, said a person with direct knowledge of
the Treasury&#8217;s payment. It was cheaper for Italy to cancel the
transactions rather than to renew, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the terms were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost, equal to half the amount to be raised by Italy&#8217;s
sales tax increase this year, underscores the risk of
derivatives countries use to reduce borrowing costs and guard
against swings in interest rates and currencies can sour and
generate losses for taxpayers. Italy, with record debt of $2.5
trillion, has lost more than $31 billion on its derivatives at
current market values, according to data compiled by the
Bloomberg Brief Risk newsletter from regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction may prompt regulators to push for greater
transparency and regulation of how governments use derivatives,
said the head of the European Parliament panel that deals with
market rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley said in a Jan. 19 filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission that it &#8220;executed certain
derivatives restructuring amendments which settled on January 3,
2012&#8221; and reduced its Italian exposure by $3.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
firm, declined to comment further. Officials at the Italian
treasury in Rome declined to comment on the contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exchange-Traded Funds Targeted in EU Clampdown on Shadow Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchange-traded funds may face tougher regulation of their
derivatives trades as part of a European Union clampdown on so-
called shadow banks that could pose a threat to the region&#8217;s
financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said today that it is examining
potential &#8220;conflicts of interest&#8221; affecting ETFs, a type of
fund that tracks an index and whose shares are publicly traded.
The regulator is also reviewing whether banks and other
financial firms are using so-called repurchase agreements, or
repos, to build up excessive levels of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While financial watchdogs have reined in excessive risk
taking by banks in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in 2008, they are concerned that lenders and other
financial firms can use ETFs, repos and other off-balance sheet
activities to evade the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adair Turner, chairman of the U.K. Financial Services
Authority, warned last week that shadow banking is &#8220;potentially
very unstable&#8221; and vulnerable to liquidity shocks. Supervisors
shouldn&#8217;t allow &#8220;complex interconnectivity&#8221; and &#8220;high
leverage to develop in unregulated institutions or markets,&#8221; he
said. The shadow banking industry in Europe is worth $22
trillion, and $25 trillion in the U.S., by some estimates,
Turner said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geithner&#8217;s Bid to Recoup TARP Money Gets Boost From Stress Tests &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner is getting a boost
from the Federal Reserve as he seeks to recoup taxpayer money
used to bail out banks during the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regions Financial Corp. and Zions Bancorporation (ZION) last week
said they plan to repay money they received through the Troubled
Asset Relief Program after passing Fed stress tests. The tests,
designed to ensure that the largest U.S. banks could withstand
another severe recession, indicate that that the two lenders are
strong enough to repay TARP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury is trying to unwind the biggest chunks of TARP
as President Barack Obama gears up for his re-election campaign.
The public outcry over bailouts in 2008 and 2009 remains part of
the political debate. Republican presidential candidate Rick
Santorum, who was against bailouts, has criticized rival Mitt
Romney for supporting aid to banks while opposing help for
automakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regions and Zions are the biggest recipients of aid among
the 361 banks left in the bailout program. Regions, based in
Birmingham, Alabama, owes $3.5 billion, and Salt Lake City-based
Zions must return $1.4 billion. Their payments would reduce the
total still owed by banks to the Treasury by about a third, to
$11.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury is now starting to divest stakes in the
remaining banks, most of them small or medium-sized. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Japan FSA to Increase Asset Manager Oversight, Nikkei Reports &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Agency will more closely monitor
asset managers that cater to smaller numbers of investors, the
Nikkei newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group includes 3,000 asset managers, according to the
Nikkei publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator March 14 received reports from 265 asset
managers surveyed after the loss of funds at AIJ Investment, the
Nikkei reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Indian court quashed charges
against Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s local unit of hosting content that was
deemed offensive by some people in the country.
     Delhi High Court Judge Suresh Kait set aside today a trial
court order for initiating criminal proceedings against
Microsoft for allegedly hosting the content. Company officials
don&#8217;t need to appear before a lower court on May 23, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s Information Technology Minister Kapil Sibal has
called for stringent rules to restrict provocative online images
and text having the potential to incite religious riots. Vinay
Rai, who edits an Urdu-language newspaper, had asked the lower
court to prosecute 21 companies, saying some material on their
websites had the potential to trigger conflict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft had filed a petition on the grounds that
neither the text of the complaint nor evidence adduced by the
complainant made any reference to Microsoft, and that it was
contrary to law to summon a party against whom no allegation was
made,&#8221; Debjani Mukherji, a spokeswoman for Microsoft in the
southern Indian city of Hyderabad, said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Kait this month quashed criminal proceedings against
Yahoo! Inc (YHOO).&#8217;s local unit in the same case. He also last month
exempted executives of Google Inc. (GOOG) and Facebook Inc. (FB) from
appearance in a lower court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s local unit last month told a court that it has
removed some content from its India domains, blocking the
material from search results, YouTube and the social-networking
site Orkut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindu-majority India is home to more than 138 million
Muslims, comprising about 13 percent of the world&#8217;s second-
largest population. The other minorities include Christians,
Sikhs and Buddhists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five states are considering whether
they will sue to challenge Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX)&#8217;s bid for Medco
Health Solutions Inc. (MHS) if federal antitrust regulators approve
the deal, two people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State attorneys general in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Texas and California are waiting to see if the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission approves the $29.1 billion proposed
acquisition, said the people, who weren&#8217;t authorized to speak
publicly and asked not to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State officials are concerned the FTC will approve the deal
with conditions that don&#8217;t guard against rising prescription
prices and decreased pharmacy services, the people said. A
combined Express Scripts-Medco would be the largest U.S. manager
of pharmacy benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 25 states, including the five considering a
lawsuit, are investigating the deal for possible antitrust
violations, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two pharmacy groups opposing the acquisition said last week
the FTC asked them to suggest ways to revise the deal so it
wouldn&#8217;t harm competition. The request may indicate the agency
will approve the deal with conditions, said Jeffrey Schmidt, a
former director of the FTC&#8217;s Bureau of Competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states could seek a temporary delay in the
acquisition&#8217;s close and a court order to permanently prevent the
deal&#8217;s consummation, said Billy Vigdor, an antitrust lawyer with
Vinson  Elkins LLP in Washington who represents investors with
an interest in the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult for states to win when the FTC has
allowed a deal to go through, said Andrew Gavil, an antitrust
law professor at Howard University in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Tierney, a spokesman for the Ohio attorney general, and
Danny Kanner, a spokesman for the New York attorney general,
declined to comment on the possibility of a lawsuit. Nils
Frederiksen, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania attorney general,
and Lauren Bean, a spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general,
also declined to comment. Nick Pacilio, a spokesman for the
California attorney general, declined to comment. Brian Henry, a
spokesman for St. Louis-based Express Scripts, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowell Weiner, a spokesman for Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-
based Medco, and Cecelia Prewett, an FTC spokeswoman, also
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bank Whistle-Blower Awarded $18 Million in Foreclosure Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney Lynn Szymoniak had spent a career investigating
insurance fraud when a bank moved to foreclose on her Florida
home in 2008. Almost four years later, the fraud she said she
uncovered by combing through mortgage documents earned her $18
million, Bloomberg News&#8217;s Jef Feeley and David McLaughlin
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Szymoniak, 63, is among six whistle-blowers who will pocket
$46.5 million as part of a $25 billion national foreclosure
settlement that state and federal officials reached in February
with five banks, including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), according to the U.S. Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When they did this to her, they picked the wrong person
at the wrong time in the wrong place,&#8221; Richard Harpootlian,
Szymoniak&#8217;s attorney in two whistle-blower cases, said in an
interview. &#8220;They stuck their hand into the beehive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Szymoniak&#8217;s examination, in which she relied on her
experience as an insurance-fraud investigator, led to her claims
against banks for submitting fraudulent documents to the federal
government asserting that they owned loans insured by the
Federal Housing Administration, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The national foreclosure settlement with the five banks,
which resolves claims of abusive foreclosure practices, provides
mortgage relief to borrowers, pays $1.5 billion to those who
lost their homes to foreclosure, and sets standards for how the
banks service mortgage loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement, whistle-blower claims are being
settled for about $228 million, according to court papers filed
in federal court in Washington. A group of six whistle-blowers
will receive $46.5 million out of that amount, said Alisa
Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The national foreclosure settlement case is U.S. v. Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), 12-00361, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Brian Kim Admits to Grand Larceny in $6 Million Ponzi Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Kim, founder and operator of the hedge fund Liquid
Capital Management LLC, pleaded guilty to grand larceny after
being accused by Manhattan prosecutors of running a $6 million
Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim entered the plea March 16 before Justice Charles
Solomon of New York State Supreme court in Manhattan, admitting
nine of 26 counts against him. Sentencing was set for April 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim, 36, who fled overseas when he was about to be tried in
another case, apologized for dragging out the proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I know these matters could have been resolved a long time
ago,&#8221; he told the court. He said he had no &#8220;malicious
intent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim was taken into custody in October 2011 by authorities
in Hong Kong, where he fled before a U.S. trial scheduled to
begin in January 2011 on charges that he stole $430,000 from a
Manhattan condominium complex where he lived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He admitted that crime March 16 as well. Kim told the judge
the stolen money went to his investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ponzi scheme indictment in February 2011 charged him
with running a fraud from January 2003 to January 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim told clients they were investing in safe and stable
securities, prosecutors said. Instead, he traded in highly
speculative contracts and diverted money to himself, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state case is People v. Kim, 2011/86, New York State
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). The CFTC suit is
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Kim, 11-cv-01013,
and the federal criminal case over the passport fraud is U.S. v.
Kim, 11-cr-00642, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gupta&#8217;s Lawyer Says &#8216;Wrong Man&#8217; on Trial in Insider Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director Rajat
Gupta, accused of passing nonpublic information to Galleon Group
LLC fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, said March 16 that the U.S. had
the &#8220;wrong man&#8221; on trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s lawyer, Gary Naftalis, said that Rajaratnam had a
different Goldman Sachs tipper, who gave him confidential
information about Intel Corp. (INTC) and Apple Inc. (AAPL), the lawyer said.
That Goldman source was also caught on government wiretaps
passing the inside information, Naftalis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 63, who denies wrongdoing, is scheduled to go on
trial May 21 for leaking tips to Rajaratnam about Goldman Sachs
and Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), where Gupta was also a director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are wiretaps, wiretaps that they&#8217;ve had for years,
that this confidential information is being given out,&#8221;
Naftalis argued March 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact is important because we have the issue that you
have the wrong man on trial here,&#8221; Naftalis said. &#8220;They know
that there is a person at Goldman Sachs who has leaked inside
information on at least two securities, on Apple and Intel, to
Mr. Rajaratnam. It is certainly clear to us this is hot
information. We intend to press on this issue. We think there is
a much more circumstantial case that that person should be
sitting in the box than us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors disclosed in a Feb. 3 letter to U.S. District
Judge Jed Rakoff, who is presiding over the case, that
Rajaratnam had a second &#8220;insider at Goldman Sachs&#8221; who leaked
tips to Rajaratnam. Rakoff has referred to this individual as
&#8220;Mr. X.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors also said the tips didn&#8217;t relate to Goldman
Sachs or Procter  Gamble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Goldman Sachs executives, David Loeb and Henry King,
are under investigation by the U.S. for possible insider-trading
charges, according to people with knowledge of the probe who
declined to be identified because the matter isn&#8217;t public.
Testimony from Rajaratnam&#8217;s trial last year showed that Loeb,
head of Asia Equity Sales in New York with a focus on Taiwan,
had dealings with Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers didn&#8217;t identify the Goldman Sachs insider in court
March 16. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on Naftalis&#8217;s assertions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, who was convicted by a jury last year of all 14
counts against him, is serving an 11-year prison term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Morgan Keegan Loses Dismissal Bid in $8 Billion Fairfax Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Keegan, the brokerage being sold to Raymond James
Financial Corp. (RJF), lost its bid to be dismissed from an $8 billion
lawsuit brought by Canadian insurer Fairfax Financial Holdings
Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairfax, in its 2006 lawsuit, accused investors of
conspiring with analysts and researchers to spread false rumors
and drive down Fairfax&#8217;s stock price in a so-called bear raid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey Superior Court Judge Stephan C. Hansbury in
Morristown ruled March 16 that there was more to the case than
whether Morgan Keegan&#8217;s analyst reports were free speech
protected by the U.S. Constitution&#8217;s First Amendment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s more to this case than the statements made in a
couple of reports,&#8221; the judge said. &#8220;It seems to me an
innocent truthful statement could be part of the conspiracy,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit once included as defendants the hedge funds SAC
Capital Advisors LP, Third Point LLC and Kynikos Associates LP.
The remaining defendants, including New York hedge fund Exis
Capital Management Inc., have argued the case doesn&#8217;t have
enough connection to New Jersey to allow Fairfax&#8217;s anti-
racketeering counts, which allow for tripling the $8 billion in
claims. Toronto-based Fairfax brought other claims in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hansbury said he will schedule a trial for September. Bruce
Collins, a lawyer for Morgan Keegan, told the judge he will file
another motion before then to get his client dismissed. Collins
declined to comment on the ruling after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairfax, which owns stakes in Canadian and U.S. insurers,
said in its complaint that the hedge funds coordinated with
stock analysts so the funds could profit through short sales,
selling borrowing shares in anticipation of making money by
replacing them with cheaper shares after the price dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s $8 billion damage claim is based on
allegations that the hedge funds&#8217; actions depressed Fairfax&#8217;s
credit ratings, diminished its ability to make acquisitions and
reduced the amount it could raise in debt and equity offerings,
according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH) v. SAC Capital
Management LLC, L-2032-06, Superior Court of New Jersey, Morris
County (Morristown). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Former Madoff Employees Seek Evidence They Were Lied To &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five former employees of Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities LLC asked that prosecutors be ordered to turn over
evidence they were lied to about the firm&#8217;s activities to help
them fight charges they aided their boss&#8217;s fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annette Bongiorno, Joann Crupi, Daniel Bonventre, Jerome
O&#8217;Hara and George Perez asked U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor
Swain March 16 to order prosecutors to turn over potentially
favorable information, including statements from Frank DiPascali
Jr., a key Madoff lieutenant who is cooperating with the
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We seek disclosure of any and all information suggesting
that Madoff and others provided false explanations to customers,
financial institutions, and regulators or employees in order to
disguise the fact that BLMIS was not investing customer funds,&#8221;
the defendants said in papers filed in federal court in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants claim the government last month turned over
partial FBI reports of interviews with DiPascali that suggest
that Madoff, DiPascali and others kept them in the dark about
the fact they weren&#8217;t investing any of their clients&#8217; money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Hara and Perez, both former computer programmers, were
arrested and charged in November 2009. Bonventre, Madoff&#8217;s ex-
operations chief, was charged in February 2010. Bongiorno, who
recruited investors and helped run Madoff&#8217;s investment advisory
office, and Crupi, who worked for Madoff for 25 years, were
charged in November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the defendants&#8217; papers, the notes show
DiPascali told investigators that Madoff told people he was
trading in Europe, not on U.S. exchanges. When confronted by
Perez and O&#8217;Hara, Madoff &#8220;gave the impression he was not doing
anything wrong,&#8221; according to the notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Bonventre, 10-CR-228, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardinal Health Drug Shipments in Florida Blocked by Court [bn:WBTKR=CAH:US]  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardinal Health Inc. [] must stop distributing controlled
substances from its Lakeland, Florida, center as an appeals
court weighs the legality of a U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration order blocking the shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington rejected March 16
Cardinal Health&#8217;s request to put on hold a lower court&#8217;s Feb. 29
decision upholding the DEA suspension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardinal Health &#8220;has not satisfied the stringent
requirements for an injunction pending court review,&#8221; the three
judge panel ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton on Feb. 29 said that the
government sufficiently proved that the distribution facility
posed a public safety threat by shipping heavy volumes of the
prescription painkiller oxycodone to pharmacies, including two
owned by a unit of CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We activated our contingency plans earlier in the month
and will continue to endeavor to meet our customers&#8217; needs with
minimal disruption from our other distribution centers,&#8221; Debbie
Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Dublin, Ohio-based Cardinal Health,
said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton, on March 14, ordered two CVS stores in Sanford,
Florida, to stop filling prescriptions of controlled substances
during the DEA investigation. He said the DEA produced enough
information to show that pharmacists at the stores filled
prescriptions for the painkiller oxycodone that they knew or
should have known would lead to the drug being diverted for
illegal uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVS appealed that ruling and Walton&#8217;s order was temporarily
placed on hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three judges in the March 16 ruling on Cardinal Health
-- U.S. Circuit Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, David Tatel and
Janice Rogers Brown -- are the same ones considering the CVS
appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Cardinal Health v. U.S. Department of
Justice, 12-05061, and Holiday CVS LLC v. Holder, 12-05072, U.S.
Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UBS, BNP Paribas Roles Probed in French Madoff Investigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) and BNP Paribas SA (BNP) are the focus of a Paris criminal
investigation of claims French investors were duped into putting
their money in funds linked to Bernard Madoff via the banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Paris appeals court issued rulings in January and
February instructing Investigating Judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke to
expand his probe and concentrate on the banks, which acted as
intermediaries between the investors and the Madoff funds,
lawyers for investors said March 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The appeals court very strongly advised the investigating
judge to look into BNP and UBS to verify whether these didn&#8217;t,
by participation or negligence, take part in the crime or the
harm suffered,&#8221; said Jean Reinhart, representing a Frenchwoman
who lost money in LuxAlpha Sicav-American Selection fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 73, pleaded guilty in 2009 to orchestrating what
prosecutors called the biggest Ponzi scheme in history and is
serving a 150-year sentence in a federal prison in North
Carolina. Van Ruymbeke is investigating how French investors
came to lose money in the New Yorker&#8217;s fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS denied having had any knowledge of Madoff&#8217;s fraud and
&#8220;will take all appropriate steps to demonstrate that these
allegations are false and without foundation,&#8221; the Zurich-based
bank said in an e-mailed statement March 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for BNP Paribas didn&#8217;t return calls for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court also told Van Ruymbeke to get the official list
of LuxAlpha investors from Luxembourg&#8217;s financial regulator,
where the fund was registered, said Veronique Lartigue, a lawyer
for other investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lartigue said she thinks the list will show the banks
themselves are the listed shareholders, rather than the
individuals for whom they were acting. If so, &#8220;the private
investors, individuals, bank clients wouldn&#8217;t be the losers,
they would have to be repaid their losses because in fact it&#8217;s
the banks who were&#8221; invested with Madoff, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Ruymbeke refused to follow up on these angles, leading
the prosecution and victims to ask the court to order him. &#8220;It
didn&#8217;t interest him,&#8221; Lartigue said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 20 investors have claimed to be victims as part of
the French investigation, Reinhart said. Local losses attributed
to Madoff&#8217;s fraud may have been as much as 500 million euros
($659 million), France&#8217;s financial markets regulator estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lehman Brothers Receives $850 Million in Neuberger Berman Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), the failed investment bank
that is planning a payment to creditors next month, received
$850 million for its preferred equity in asset manager Neuberger
Berman Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman won court approval in December for a plan to sell
its minority equity stake in Neuberger Berman, a transaction
that it said would generate $1.5 billion, almost double an offer
received in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $850 million will be available when Lehman makes a
distribution to creditors scheduled for April 17, Lehman said
March 16 in a statement. New York-based Lehman, which collapsed
in 2008, said March 6 that it exited bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuberger Berman intends to be fully employee-owned in the
next four to five years, Standard  Poor&#8217;s wrote in a March 6
note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TV Cameras Rejected in U.S. Supreme Court Health-Care Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court rejected media and lawmaker requests
for television coverage of this month&#8217;s arguments on President
Barack Obama&#8217;s health-care law, and agreed to release same-day
audio recordings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court, in a statement citing the &#8220;extraordinary public
interest&#8221; in the case, said it will post the audio on its
website each afternoon of the three-day argument. The court
generally releases audio on a weekly basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court will hear six hours of arguments March 26-28 --
the most in 44 years -- and probably rule in late June. The
central question in a challenge by 26 states and a business
trade group is whether Congress exceeded its authority by
requiring Americans to either get insurance or pay a penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices have never allowed video coverage of their
arguments. Over the years, the justices have provided a number
of explanations: that they would lose their anonymity, that
cameras would change the dynamic in the courtroom, and that news
organizations would use only snippets of the arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the health-care case, the court received requests for
live video or audio coverage from a dozen lawmakers and more
than 30 media organizations, including Bloomberg News and C-
SPAN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s three-paragraph statement didn&#8217;t mention video
cameras. The court&#8217;s spokeswoman, Kathy Arberg, said that the
court won&#8217;t allow television coverage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Most Popular Docket on Bloomberg Law system last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s, which filed the biggest
bankruptcy in U.S. history in 2008, had the most-read docket on
the Bloomberg Law system last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy became America&#8217;s most costly in April
2010, when it surpassed the $757 million cost of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ)&#8217;s
three-year liquidation, according to data assembled by
bankruptcy professor Lynn LoPucki at the University of
California, Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
and most profitable U.S. bank, dismissed about 5 percent of its
equities trading desk today, according to two people with
knowledge of the cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Gulya, an equity-derivatives sales representative
in emerging markets, was among the departing employees,
according to the people, who asked for anonymity because
personnel matters are private. Data on the current size of the
equities trading staff wasn&#8217;t immediately available. The New
York-based bank ranks first by assets among U.S. lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan typically culls its workforce as part of periodic
staff reviews, according to one of the people. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the bank, said she couldn&#8217;t
comment. Dealbreaker reported the job cuts earlier today, saying
they were closer to 10 percent of the trading floor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s treasury and securities services division in
January dismissed about 100 people, less than 1 percent of the
unit&#8217;s workforce, as part of the bank&#8217;s periodic staff
adjustments, a person briefed on the move said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will pay
$150 million to settle a lawsuit claiming losses from the bank&#8217;s
securities lending program, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed by three union pension funds, which
represented a class of all investors in a group of structured
debt securities. The settlement was announced last month. The
parties disclosed the terms of the agreement in a filing in
Manhattan federal court March 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds claim they lost money that New York-based
JPMorgan invested for them in medium-term notes issued by Sigma
Finance Corp., a structured investment vehicle that collapsed in
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The union pension funds representing the class are the
AFTRA Retirement Fund, the Imperial County Employees&#8217; Retirement
System and the Investment Committee of the Manhattan and Bronx
Surface Transit Operating System. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement must be approved by a judge before it can
take effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Board of Trustees of the AFTRA Retirement Fund
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 09-cv-686, U.S. District Court,

&lt;p&gt;Michael Workman, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s executive director in fixed income in Moscow, quit
to join Otkritie Financial Corp., a month after the U.S. bank&#8217;s
co-heads and chief trader in the Russian capital left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otkritie hired Workman to replace George Urumov, who the
Russian brokerage accuses in a lawsuit of helping to defraud it
of $183 million, Alexey Karakhan, an Otkritie spokesman, said
today by phone in Moscow. Urumov denies the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs last month said Paolo Zannoni, chairman of
Italian investment banking, will take over as chief of Russian
operations from co-heads Chris Barter and Jean Raby -- the third
leadership change for the Wall Street firm in as many years.
Barter is setting up his own investment management firm and Raby
is returning to Paris to work for the bank there. Peter Kizenko,
the former chief trader in Moscow, also left in February, and
started a commercial sauna business in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, a member of
President Dmitry Medvedev&#8217;s advisory committee for turning
Moscow into a financial center, has struggled to build a
business in Russia. The bank scaled back operations in Moscow
soon after opening an office in 1994 amid a worldwide
retrenchment and returned in 1998, weeks before Russia defaulted
on domestic debt, prompting it to withdraw almost entirely
before ramping up again in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s press service in Moscow declined to comment
on Workman&#8217;s departure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Great Potential&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The opportunity to build a new business line was what
attracted me to Otkritie,&#8221; Workman said by phone in Moscow.
&#8220;There&#8217;s great potential to develop structured products,
Russian Eurobonds and locally traded OFZ Euroclearable bonds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urumov &#8220;strongly denies all the allegations made against
him,&#8221; Farrer  Co., the firm representing his defense, said in
an e-mailed statement on Feb. 17. Urumov allegedly defrauded
Otkritie of $160 million through offshore transactions involving
Argentine warrants and $23 million in bonuses meant for
subordinates while working as the brokerage&#8217;s global head of
fixed income in London, according to court documents and lawyers
on the case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Exxon Valdez has been sold for
scrap 23 years after causing the worst tanker spill in U.S.
history, which led to new designs for oil carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now called the Oriental Nicety, the vessel was sold for
about $16 million, Maryland-based Global Marketing Systems Inc.,
the world&#8217;s biggest cash buyer of ships for demolition, said in
a report March 16. Converted into an ore carrier in 2007, it
changed owners and names four times since the 1989 accident,
American Bureau of Shipping records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spill, which dumped 11 million gallons of oil in
Alaska&#8217;s Prince William Sound, was the largest in U.S. waters
until the 2010 accident at BP Plc (BP/)&#8217;s Macondo oil well in the Gulf
of Mexico. It&#8217;s still the country&#8217;s largest leak from a tanker,
and it led to the U.S. requirement for ships to have two hulls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The accident pointed out that the biggest risk involved
in oil transport is the impact an accident can have on the
environment,&#8221; Thomas Zwick, an analyst at Oslo-based shipping
consultant Lorentzen  Stemoco AS, said in an e-mail today.
&#8220;Large companies can go under as a consequence of the financial
liabilities bestowed upon them following an accident.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S. oil company, still
faces litigation from the spill. The Irving, Texas-based company
spent three years and $3.86 billion to clean up the spill, which
damaged 700 miles of coastline and killed more than 36,000
birds, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVC Capital Partners Ltd. hired
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to explore a possible sale of a stake
in Formula One in an initial public offering, said a person with
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any deal to sell part of CVC&#8217;s 63.4 percent holding may
value the auto-racing series at more than $10 billion and
Singapore is a possible listing venue, the person said,
declining to be identified as the deliberations are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An IPO by Formula One would be a boost to Singapore, which
is vying with Hong Kong to attract companies from across the
world seeking to capitalize on Asia&#8217;s growing economies. Formula
One Chief Executive Officer Bernie Ecclestone said he would
remain in his position under CVC&#8217;s plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s the intention: business as usual,&#8221; Ecclestone,
81, said in a phone interview. Ecclestone said he has no plans
to sell his 5.3 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecclestone, who has owned or managed the sport&#8217;s commercial
unit since 1995, is negotiating with teams over terms that
expire after this year and according to Sky News has offered
Ferrari SpA and Red Bull GmbH&#8217;s entrants as much as $45 million
to sign up through 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecclestone said it&#8217;s &#8220;not really&#8221; necessary for the
negotiations with teams to be concluded before a share sale and
there was no deadline for the talks. He declined to say if any
of the 12 teams had agreed to new terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re in the middle of sorting that out,&#8221; Ecclestone
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s always the same with these long-winded things but
it will get sorted out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Singapore Attraction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sky News reported yesterday that CVC hired Goldman Sachs to
study a placement of part of its stake in Formula One.
Spokespeople for CVC and Goldman Sachs declined to comment on
the possible IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manchester United Ltd. (MNU), the record 19-time English soccer
champion, may revive a Singapore IPO, people familiar with the
matter said this month. A Formula One share sale will enhance
&#8220;brand Singapore,&#8221; according to Christopher Wong, a Singapore-
based senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management
Asia Ltd., which manages more than $87 billion in assets in the
region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Listing it in Singapore appeals to the growing popularity
of the sport in this part of the world, which is driving the
growth of F1,&#8221; Wong said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC bought Formula One in a leveraged buyout in 2005 and
2006 using $2.5 billion of loans. Other shareholders include the
administrators of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. who hold 15.3
percent and Ecclestone&#8217;s former wife Slavica who owns 8.5
percent through Bambino Holdings Ltd. The series has annual
sales of 1.17 billion euros ($1.55 billion) and employs 200
people, according to the CVC website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Interest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. and the Agnelli family&#8217;s Exor SpA expressed an
interest in buying CVC&#8217;s stake last year, although analysts said
a phone-hacking scandal that closed News Corp.&#8217;s News of the
World tabloid had pushed a possible bid down its agenda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formula One added India to its racing circuit last year and
also holds Grand Prix races in China, Malaysia, Japan, Korea and
Singapore. The 2012 season began two days ago with the
Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formula One may be drawn to a Singapore listing because of
the city-state&#8217;s efforts to cultivate itself as a destination
for wealthy individuals, Aberdeen&#8217;s Wong said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Singapore has created this whole ecosystem around private
banking, wealth management, the integrated resorts, arts and
culture for the rich and famous,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Singapore Race &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore began staging a Formula One race in 2008. The
government supported the event as part of a goal to boost
tourism. The race contract ends this year and Singapore hired
consultants to assess its impact on the city-state&#8217;s economy,
the Straits Times reported in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore&#8217;s exchange is vying with Hong Kong for brand-name
listings as Europe&#8217;s credit crisis deters companies from going
public there. Hong Kong hosted IPOs by Prada SpA and Samsonite
International SA last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manchester United received the Singapore stock exchange&#8217;s
approval in September to raise about $1 billion in an IPO,
people with knowledge of the matter said at the time. The
process then stalled as volatile stock markets made equity sales
more difficult to pull off, bankers said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasuries climbed, pushing 10-year
note yields down the most in more than two weeks, as the Federal
Reserve bought $4.03 billion in U.S. debt and sales of
previously owned homes unexpectedly declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Yields (USGG10YR) reached the highest levels since October yesterday,
luring back investors after prices slid for nine straight days,
the longest losing streak in almost six years. Investors have
been re-evaluating the prospects of further monetary stimulus
since Fed policy makers raised their assessment of the economy
March 13. Mortgage applications fell amid higher rates, and Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said a rise in oil may hurt growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Weaker home-sales data, a drop in mortgage applications,
Fed buying and comments from Bernanke about damage from energy
prices and Europe have given Treasuries a reason to rise,&#8221; said
Ian Lyngen, a government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group
LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. &#8220;Equally, the market&#8217;s inability
to sell off further has signaled a halt to the selling momentum
as the market is reassessing the severity of the price action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on 10-year notes dropped six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 2.30 percent at 5:02 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They fell as much as
eight basis points, their biggest intraday decline since March
6. The price of the 2 percent securities due in February 2022
climbed 17/32, or $5.31 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 3/8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten-year yields touched 2.40 percent yesterday, the highest
level since Oct. 28. They have gained more than 40 basis points
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty-year bond yields declined six basis points today to
3.38 percent and touched 3.37 percent, the lowest in a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bernanke on Energy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields reached the lows of the day after Bernanke told the
House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform higher energy
prices may weaken the U.S. economy by sapping consumer spending.
That &#8220;would probably slow growth, at least in the short run,&#8221;
he said. Bernanke also said Europe&#8217;s financial and economic
situation &#8220;remains difficult&#8221; even as stresses have eased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between yields on 10- and 30-year Treasuries, the
yield curve, widened to 108.9 basis points after reaching 108.6
basis points yesterday, the least since Jan. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The short-term inflation risk is more in the five- and
10-year sector, and doesn&#8217;t extend out to the 30-year,&#8221; CRT&#8217;s
Lyngen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 14-day relative strength index for 10-year note yields
declined to 66.6 today after exceeding 70 for five straight
days. A reading above 70 indicates to some traders that a gain
in the yields may be hard to sustain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking a Breather &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are taking a bit of a breather with the Fed
buying, and the danger that the Fed could step back in if rates
get too high&#8221; said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist in
New York at Credit Suisse Group AG, one of the 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t break the 2.4
percent level, which is important from a technical standpoint.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 10-year note yields have climbed from the record low
1.67 percent set Sept. 23, they&#8217;re still below the average of
3.87 percent over the past decade. They&#8217;ll end the year at 2.54
percent, according to the average estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of banks and securities companies, with the most recent
projections given the heaviest weightings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on the benchmark note were 31 basis points higher
than those on 10-year German bunds today after the spread
reached 32 basis points on March 19, the widest since July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Treasuries have dropped to the
lowest level in two years. The contracts, which typically
decline as investor confidence improves, eased to 31 basis
points, the lowest since March 2010, according to data provider
CMA. The firm is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Purchase &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed bought Treasuries today due from April 2018 to
February 2020 as part of its program to swap $400 billion of
shorter-maturity U.S. debt in its holdings with longer-term
securities to cap borrowing costs. It is acquiring U.S. debt
every day this week, the longest period of consecutive daily
purchases since January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank upgraded its view of the U.S. economy this
month while reiterating a pledge to keep its target lending rate
at virtually zero through at least late 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market has finished discounting the Fed outlook for
now, and intense selling has been replaced with moderate inflows
of cash,&#8221; Jim Vogel, head of agency-debt research at FTN
Financial in Memphis, Tennessee, wrote in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of traders&#8217; expectations for inflation that&#8217;s
tracked by the Fed has risen this year to 2.76 percent, the
highest level since September, as of March 16. The five-year,
five-year forward break-even rate, which projects annualized
price increases over a five-year period starting in 2017,
matches the 2.76 percent average over the past decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rate Bets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forward markets for overnight index swaps, whose rates show
what traders expect the federal-funds effective rate to average
over the life of the contract, signal a quarter-percentage point
advance around September 2013 from the current effective rate of
0.15 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last
month, such an increase in the effective rate wasn&#8217;t predicted
until early 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in yield between 10-year Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities (USGGBE10) and nominal notes, known as the break-even
rate, shrank for the first time in 11 days, decreasing four
basis points to 2.40 percent, from 2.44 percent yesterday. The
figure indicates the annual rise in consumer prices investors
expect over the next 10 years. The average over the past year is
2.19 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. will sell $13 billion of 10-year TIPS at an
auction tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Home Purchases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasuries extended gains today after a report from the
National Association of Realtors showed U.S. purchases of
existing homes declined 0.9 percent last month to a 4.59 million
annual pace, compared with a Bloomberg survey projection of a
0.9 percent rise to 4.61 million. January&#8217;s revised total was
4.63 million, the highest since May 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatility fell today after climbing yesterday to the
highest level this year. Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s MOVE
index, which measures Treasury price swings based on options,
declined to 89.5 basis points, after reaching 93.3 basis points
yesterday, the most since Dec. 29. It fell to 69.9 basis points
on March 12, the lowest since July 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage applications in the U.S. dropped last week,
reflecting the biggest slump in refinancing since November. The
Mortgage Bankers (MBAVBASC) Association&#8217;s index declined 7.4 percent in the
period ended March 16 from the prior week, the Washington-based
trade group reported today. The refinance index decreased 9.3
percent, while the purchases gauge fell 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinancing of mortgages slowed as borrowing costs rose.
The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan was 4.19 percent,
the highest since late November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD), the biggest
professional-networking website, rose to the highest closing
price since August after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised its
rating on the stock to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn gained 6.5 percent to $97.78 at the close in New
York, the highest close since Aug. 3. The Mountain View,
California-based company has advanced 55 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which first sold shares to the public in May,
has about 150 million members. LinkedIn&#8217;s appeal to recruiters,
and its ability to boost customer engagement through new
products such as a mobile application, should allow its hiring-
solutions and marketing-services businesses to do better than
expected, Heath Terry, a Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote in a note
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;LinkedIn is one of the companies best positioned to
benefit from growth in mobile usage given its reliance on
subscriptions over advertising,&#8221; wrote Terry, who previously
rated the shares neutral. &#8220;This will be a key factor in driving
outperformance in the sector over the next few years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fourth quarter of 2011, LinkedIn&#8217;s hiring solutions
revenue more than doubled from a year earlier to $84.9 million,
while sales in the marketing-solutions business increased 77
percent to $49.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transocean Ltd. (RIG), the rig operator
at Chevron Corp.&#8217;s (CVX) $3.6 billion Frade project in Brazil, was
spared by the country&#8217;s oil regulator in an investigation of a
3,000-barrel oil spill in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were &#8220;no problems with Transocean&#8217;s platform,&#8221;
Magda Chambriard, the head of the oil regulator known as ANP,
told reporters today in Rio de Janeiro, referring to
Transocean&#8217;s drilling equipment. &#8220;Transocean doesn&#8217;t have a
direct role with us, it is with the operator&#8221; Chevron, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator is carrying out 25 separate probes into the
leak and is waiting for Chevron to respond to its findings,
Chambriard said. The oil slick at Chevron&#8217;s field off Rio&#8217;s
coast occurred at a time Brazil is increasing scrutiny of deep-
water drilling following the 2010 Macondo spill in the U.S. Gulf
of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean is included in a separate lawsuit filed today by
federal prosecutor Eduardo Santos. Seventeen Chevron and
Transocean executives were banned by a federal court from
leaving Brazil pending the investigation by the prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean fell 0.7 percent to $56.97 at 1:55 p.m. in New
York. It pared losses of as much as 1.7 percent after
Chambriard&#8217;s comments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul G. Allen, a co-founder of
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), pledged an additional $300 million to the brain
center that bears his name to study how vision works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Allen Institute for Brain Science, based in Seattle and
founded in 2003, will begin a 10-year project to map the visual
system. That brings Allen&#8217;s total contribution to $500 million,
said Allan Jones, the chief executive officer of the institute,
in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, starting in mice, will involve several hundred
scientists and will apply knowledge from genomics, anatomy,
computer modeling and physiology. A map of the visual cortex,
the place in the brain that receives and processes the messages
of sight, may help improve understanding of higher brain
function, said Christof Koch, chief scientific officer of the
Allen Institute and R. Clay Reid of Harvard University Medical
School in Boston, in an editorial today in the journal Nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although the institute&#8217;s project will focus on visual
stimuli in mice, it will capture fundamental aspects of higher
brain functions: perception, conscious awareness and decision-
making, and how they lead to action,&#8221; Koch and Reid, who is
joining the Allen Institute, said in the article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once understood in mice, scientists may turn to the human
visual system, the researchers said. Human brains have a mass of
about 3 pounds, while mouse brains are .001 pounds. Human brains
have 86 billion neurons, mice have only 70 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neural Networks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers will catalog neurons and measure the electrical
activity of the cells as they transmit messages into and out of
the visual cortex. Using techniques of genetic engineering that
make the neurons light up, they will watch circuits activate
whenever the animal makes a decision, enabling them to chart the
anatomy of neural networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Allen Institute has found a unique niche to do these
things at a large scale,&#8221; Jones said. Usually in academic
settings, individual researchers&#8217; questions drive the science.
This allows for a more-systematic approach, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support the initiative, the Institute plans to double
its current staff to more than 350 people over the next four
years. Today&#8217;s donation will fund the first four years of the
new project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2011, the Institute created a gene map of the
human brain and made it freely available to assist researchers
studying disorders such as Parkinson&#8217;s disease and autism. That
effort followed a 2006 map of the mouse brain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks will probably begin a
&#8220;steady upward trajectory&#8221; over the next few years because any
declines in economic growth are already reflected in share
prices,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given current valuations, we think it&#8217;s time to say a
&#8216;long goodbye&#8217; to bonds, and embrace the &#8216;long good buy&#8217; for
equities as we expect them to embark on an upward trend over the
next few years,&#8221; Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity
strategist at Goldman Sachs in London, wrote in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospects for returns in equities versus bonds &#8220;are as
good as they have been in a generation,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) is trading at 11.2 times
estimated earnings, compared with an average of 11.8 over the
past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
index dropped 11 percent last year as policy makers tried to
stop Greece&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis from spreading. The MSCI
World Index (MXWO) is trading at 13.2 times estimated earnings after
falling 7.6 percent last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Periods of sustained falls in the market are typically
better times to buy for the long run,&#8221; Oppenheimer wrote.
&#8220;Partly, of course, this is also a function of valuations
typically improving after a period of sustained losses in the
market. Nonetheless, the key point is that in particularly bad
economic periods, once the news is fully priced, investment
outcomes tend to improve.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bond Yields &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro area&#8217;s economy will contract 0.1 percent this
year, the European Central Bank&#8217;s projections show, down from
its previous forecast for 0.3 percent growth. At least six of
the 17 nations that use the euro are in recession. The ECB left
its benchmark rate at 1 percent earlier this month. The central
bank also said this month that inflation in the euro area will
probably exceed the bank&#8217;s 2 percent limit this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the Federal Open Market Committee said this
month that economic conditions would still warrant holding the
benchmark interest rate near zero at least through late 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gains in bond yields can also support equities, according
to Goldman. Ten-year yields have climbed from a record low of
1.67 percent set on Sept. 23, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
U.S. 10-year yields were little changed at 2.37 percent at 9:30
a.m. in London, near their highest in almost five months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would expect the early rises in bond yields to be
positive for equity prices as they both become a reflection of
rising growth and inflationary expectations, and could expect
some equity re-rating in the initial stages of rising yields,&#8221;
Oppenheimer wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities offer an opportunity now, the strategist wrote,
saying some risks to future growth are exaggerated, and emerging
markets may offset fiscal policy tightening in some developed
markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, said its Windows Phone operating system
will propel it past Apple Inc. (AAPL) in China&#8217;s smartphone market as
its partners release devices costing as little as $158. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing Apple is an &#8220;interim goal&#8221; as the company&#8217;s
longer-term objective is to supplant Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android as
the local market leader, Simon Leung, Microsoft&#8217;s chairman and
chief executive officer for the Greater China region, told
reporters in Beijing today. He didn&#8217;t give a time frame for
reaching the targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is poised to become the world&#8217;s biggest smartphone
market in 2012, making it crucial for manufacturers and sellers
in the battle for sales. Shipments of the devices, used to
download games and movies, will jump 52 percent to 137 million
units in China this year, allowing the country to overtake the
U.S. for the first time, research company IDC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will continue to drive the price down,&#8221; Leung said.
&#8220;Our goal is number one. Having a goal to be number two is not
really a goal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s manufacturing partners will &#8220;definitely&#8221;
offer devices in the price range of 1,000 yuan ($158), Leung
said, without specifying which partners or devices would meet
the target. Rather than make its own phones, Microsoft supplies
software to handset manufacturers including Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) (NOKIA), Samsung
Electronics Co., HTC Corp. (2498) and ZTE Corp. (763), Leung said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 16-gigabyte iPhone 4S costs 4,988 yuan at Apple&#8217;s online
store in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Developing Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leung, who spoke before a ceremony to unveil the new
Windows Phone 7.5 operating system in China, declined to discuss
specific handsets using the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A post on Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone Blog said that HTC has
started selling the first Windows Phone in the country. The HTC
Eternity is an unlocked handset with a 4.7-inch screen, front-
and rear-facing cameras, and comes with popular Chinese apps,
the blog said, without giving the price for the handset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winston Yung, chief financial officer and spokesman for
Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC, didn&#8217;t immediately answer calls to
his mobile phone after normal business hours today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Widening Reach &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to bring its Windows Phone software to 23
more countries for a total of 63 and put the operating system on
less expensive smartphones, it said last month. The company aims
to move quickly in developing economies, where Google and Apple
are less dominant, before cheaper Android phones can strengthen
Google&#8217;s position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone will account for 7.5 percent of the China
market this year, trailing the 12 percent share of Apple&#8217;s IOS
and Android&#8217;s 70 percent, said Teck-Zhung Wong, a Beijing-based
analyst at IDC. By next year, Windows share will rise to 15
percent, surpassing Apple&#8217;s 13 percent, while still trailing
Android&#8217;s 66 percent, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Windows Phone ramp-up in China won&#8217;t really begin
until the second quarter, so the numbers are still low,&#8221; Wong
said. &#8220;From next year the ramp-up will be more rapid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2016, Windows Phone is forecast to have a 20 percent
share in China, ahead of Apple&#8217;s 16 percent and trailing
Google&#8217;s 60 percent, Wong said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fresh Proposition&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone will gain market share from Apple because it
represents a &#8220;fresh proposition&#8221; as an alternative and will
also feature in a wider range of devices, Wong said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Windows Phone will have a lot of equipment manufacturing
partners and more device choice at more different price
points,&#8221; Wong said. &#8220;That alone, as opposed to what Apple is
doing, will give Windows Phone an advantage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandy Shen, a Shanghai-based analyst with Gartner Inc. said
Microsoft will have to fight against the prevalence of iPhone
and Android devices at the high-end of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will take a while before people appreciate the
offering,&#8221; Shen said. &#8220;It&#8217;s never too late for a really good
product, but there are still improvements to be made on the
Windows Phone device itself and to establish the ecosystem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is exploring the possibility of opening its own
retail stores in the country, Leung said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also said he met with senior Chinese leaders yesterday
to discuss the nation&#8217;s ban on game consoles, including
Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox, without making any progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ban is &#8220;a little bit frustrating,&#8221; Leung said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner agreed to answer questions in writing in Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
which claims the bank contributed to Lehman&#8217;s collapse in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geithner&#8217;s agreement, noted in a March 16 filing by the
U.S. in federal court in Washington, forestalls a judge&#8217;s ruling
on whether he could be compelled to testify in the case. U.S.
District Judge Reggie Walton yesterday accepted the arrangement
and ordered both sides to update him by April 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the parties should reach an impasse or plaintiff is
otherwise dissatisfied with the written responses, the parties
shall so notify the court,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney John
Interrante said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman sued Geithner in February, alleging that the
Treasury Department &#8220;has for many months delayed and ultimately
refused&#8221; to allow testimony by the secretary. His testimony is
key to Lehman&#8217;s contention that JPMorgan siphoned off $8.6
billion during the 2008 credit crisis, according to a court
filing in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geithner, at the time president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, discussed the collateral JPMorgan was demanding for
its loans with Richard Fuld and Jamie Dimon, Lehman&#8217;s and
JPMorgan&#8217;s chief executive officers, in the week before Lehman&#8217;s
bankruptcy, according to the filing. He also met with Dimon and
Henry Paulson, then Treasury Secretary, to discuss &#8220;concerns&#8221;
that Dimon was using the crisis to strengthen his bank at
Lehman&#8217;s expense, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson, according to the March 16 filing, has also agreed
to answer questions in writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman claims in court papers to have interviewed more than
200 witnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which lent $70 billion to Lehman&#8217;s brokerage
around the time of the 2008 bankruptcy, sued Lehman back after
the $8.6 billion suit, alleging Lehman defrauded its lender into
making the loan. JPMorgan has asked a judge to dismiss Lehman&#8217;s
suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
2008, listing $613 billion in debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testimony case is Official Committee on Unsecured
Creditors of Lehman Brothers Holdings In., 12-00098, U.S.
District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). The main case
is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), 08-13555, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase Bank
NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Taylor Bean Finance Chief Admits Role in $3 Billion Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor, Bean  Whitaker Mortgage Corp.&#8217;s former finance
chief admitted to helping his boss, Lee Farkas, commit what
prosecutors say was one of the largest bank frauds in U.S.
history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delton de Armas, 41, pleaded guilty March 20 in federal
court in Alexandria, Virginia, to one count of conspiracy to
commit bank and wire fraud and one count of false statements in
a scheme that contributed to the failures of Montgomery,
Alabama-based Colonial Bank and its parent, Colonial BancGroup,
once among the nation&#8217;s 25 biggest depository banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He faces as many as 10 years in prison when he&#8217;s sentenced
by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema on June 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As CFO, Mr. de Armas could have put a stop to the fraud
the moment he discovered it,&#8221; U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride said
in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Instead, the hole in Ocala Funding
grew to $1.5 billion on his watch, and as it grew, so did his
lies to investors and the government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2005 through August 2009, de Armas helped Farkas and
other conspirators misappropriate more than $1.5 billion from
Ocala Funding LLC, a financing vehicle used and controlled by
Taylor Bean, according to a statement of facts filed by
prosecutors and signed by de Armas. De Armas issued false
financial reports that masked shortfalls at Ocala Funding in
order to keep auditors at bay and investors on board, the
document states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I regret I didn&#8217;t speak up more,&#8221; de Armas, of
Carrollton, Texas, told Brinkema yesterday after being asked
about his role in covering up Taylor Bean and Ocala Funding&#8217;s
financial problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farkas, the ex-chairman of Taylor Bean, is serving a 30-
year sentence after being convicted in April of 14 counts of
conspiracy and bank, wire and securities fraud in what
prosecutors said was a $3 billion scheme involving fake mortgage
assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Armas, 12-00096, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Chase Settles AFTRA Pension Suit for $150 Million &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. will pay $150 million to settle a
lawsuit claiming losses from the bank&#8217;s securities lending
program, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed by three union pension funds, which
represented a class of all investors in a group of structured
debt securities. The settlement was announced last month. The
parties disclosed the terms of the agreement in a filing in
Manhattan federal court March 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds claim they lost money that New York-based
JPMorgan invested for them in medium-term notes issued by Sigma
Finance Corp., a structured investment vehicle that collapsed in
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The union pension funds representing the class are the
AFTRA Retirement Fund, the Imperial County Employees&#8217; Retirement
System and the Investment Committee of the Manhattan and Bronx
Surface Transit Operating System. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Board of Trustees of the AFTRA Retirement Fund
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 09-cv-686, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;States Shielded From Medical-Leave Suits by U.S. High Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court shielded states from claims that
they illegally denied medical leave to workers, dividing along
ideological lines in a clash about the federal government&#8217;s
power over the states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices, voting 5-4, ruled against a Maryland state
court employee who was fired after requesting medical leave. The
majority said states can&#8217;t be sued for violating the sick-leave
provisions of the U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision marks a shift for the court, giving new life
to a line of rulings that in the 1990s progressively bolstered
states&#8217; immunity from lawsuits and split the nine justices. The
court had stopped moving in that direction in 2003, when it said
state workers could seek damages for violations of other
provisions in the federal family-leave law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy,
Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, all appointed
by Republican presidents, formed the majority. The ruling
prompted Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appointed by a Democrat,
to take the unusual step of reading a summary of her dissent
from the bench. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision affects only public employers and doesn&#8217;t
apply to companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Maryland,
10-1016. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pacific Capital Bancorp Investor Sues Over $1.5 Billion Bid &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Capital Bancorp (PCBC) was sued by an investor who
contends directors failed to obtain the best price for the
company in a $1.5 billion buyout offer from UnionBanCal Corp. (UB) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Capital&#8217;s board had a duty to maximize shareholder
value in the deal, and should have negotiated a higher price
than the agreed-upon $46 a share, Ernesto Rodriguez said in a
complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders will receive &#8220;grossly inadequate
consideration&#8221; in the deal, said Rodriguez, who asks a judge to
grant the case class-action status, on behalf of all outside
shareholders, and to stop the buyout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UnionBanCal, based in San Francisco, said in a March 12
statement it would acquire Santa Barbara-based Pacific Capital
to expand in central California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debbie Whiteley, a spokeswoman for Pacific Capital, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment about the
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Rodriguez v. Ford and Pacific Capital Bancorp.,
CA7341, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sun Hung Kai Executive Director Arrested in Bribery Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16), Hong Kong&#8217;s biggest developer
by market value, said an executive director was arrested by the
city&#8217;s anti-corruption body as part of an investigation into
alleged bribery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun Hung Kai has set up a panel of three board members to
handle the investigation into Thomas Chan Kui-Yuen, the
developer said in a statement to the city&#8217;s stock exchange March
19. The shares declined to the lowest in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chan was in charge of land acquisitions by the $38 billion
builder of Hong Kong&#8217;s tallest office tower. The company has
been run by co-chairmen Thomas and Raymond Kwok since the ouster
as chairman in 2008 of their brother Walter, who alleged they
opposed his questions over corporate governance matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Independent Commission Against Corruption is
investigating a suspected &#8220;offense or offenses&#8221; related to the
city&#8217;s Prevention of Bribery Act, Sun Hung Kai said in its
statement yesterday without giving further details. ICAC
spokesman Alan Tse declined to comment, as did Sun Hung Kai
spokeswoman&#8217;s Margaret Ng. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chan, an executive director for Sun Hung Kai since 1987, is
responsible for land acquisitions and project planning,
according to the company&#8217;s latest annual report. His age is
given as 65 in the report, which was published in October. He
was paid HK$11 million ($1.4 million) in the financial year
ended June 2011, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transocean Holders&#8217; Suits Over Rig Explosion Tossed by Judge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean Ltd. (RIG), owner of the oil rig leased to BP Plc (BP/) that
exploded and spewed millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of
Mexico, doesn&#8217;t have to face investor claims that the company
failed to disclose repeated safety failures, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean shareholders can&#8217;t make a case that Chief
Executive Officer Steven Newman made &#8220;materially false and
misleading statements&#8221; about the company&#8217;s safety record in
violation of federal securities laws, U.S. District Judge Naomi
Reice Buchwald in New York concluded yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some shareholders contend Newman made statements on calls
with analysts in 2009 and 2010 that were designed to mislead
investors about Transocean&#8217;s pattern of safety violations and
artificially inflate its share price. The suits also allege the
CEO failed to disclose problems that later were linked to the
fatal explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig that led to the
largest offshore spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To allow lead plaintiffs&#8217; claims to proceed because
certain undisclosed safety issues may have contributed to the
Deepwater Horizon disaster would be to permit a claim based on
fraud by hindsight,&#8221; Buchwald said in her 46-page ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very pleased with the order and the result,&#8221; Lou
Colasuonno, a spokesman for Vernier, Switzerland-based
Transocean, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Transocean and BP were sued by investors as part of a
wave of litigation generated by the April 2010 spill from the
Macondo Well off the coast of Louisiana. Many of the cases have
been consolidated before a judge in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s ruling covers at least two securities cases
against Transocean that were consolidated before Buchwald in
federal court in New York, according to an October 2010 court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities case is Foley v. Transocean Ltd, 10-cv-5233
(NRB), U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (New
York). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Banks Suing N.Y. Over MBIA Restructuring Won&#8217;t Demand Jury &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks suing a New York state regulator over the decision to
approve the 2009 restructuring of bond insurer MBIA Inc.&#8217;s (MBI)
insurance business won&#8217;t seek a jury trial in the case,
according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA, based in Armonk, New York, was sued by financial
institutions after the 2009 split of its main bond-insurance
unit into two businesses. The banks claim the restructuring was
intended to defraud policyholders and rendered MBIA Insurance
Corp. insolvent. Former state Insurance Superintendent Eric
Dinallo was sued separately under a law that allows court review
of administrative decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks won&#8217;t demand a jury in the case against the
regulator and agreed to have it tried by Justice Barbara R.
Kapnick of state Supreme Court, Robert Giuffra, a lawyer for the
petitioners, said March 19 in a letter to the judge. A trial is
to begin between May 2 and 14, according to Giuffra&#8217;s letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG will withdraw from the MBIA litigation, a person
familiar with the matter said March 15. Switzerland&#8217;s biggest
lender is one of four remaining banks in the lawsuit that bought
default protection from MBIA against losses on mortgage-linked
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen other firms dropped out of the suits, including
Morgan Stanley (MS) and Barclays Plc, after settlements that
terminated their hedges with MBIA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are ABN Amro Bank NV v. Dinallo, 601846-2009, and
ABN Amro Bank NV v. MBIA, 601475-2009, New York State Supreme
Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stifel to Pursue Claims Against RBC After Settling With Schools &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stifel Financial Corp. (SF), sued by five Wisconsin school
districts over collateralized debt obligations, said it will pay
them $13 million and plans to join them in pressing claims
against Royal Bank of Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payment may convert Stifel from a defendant to a
plaintiff in a lawsuit the districts filed against Toronto-based
RBC in 2008. The St. Louis-based financial services firm cited
&#8220;numerous misrepresentations, omissions and conflicts of
interest&#8221; contained in CDOs created by the Canadian bank and
sold to trusts set up by the districts for $200 million with
money they raised by issuing asset-backed notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The CDOs were collateral for the notes and those CDOs are
now worthless,&#8221; Stifel said yesterday in a statement issued
jointly with the districts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBC issued a statement March 19 calling Stifel&#8217;s claims
&#8220;preposterous.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We vehemently deny their allegations,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original complaint was filed in state court in
Milwaukee by school districts in Kenosha, Waukesha, West
Allis/West Milwaukee, Whitefish Bay and Kimberly. Stifel and the
schools said they need court permission to file their amended
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No district, if it had known what we now know about the
product that RBC actually sold us, would have made this
investment,&#8221; Kenosha schools Superintendent Michele Hancock
said in the joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBC said in its statement that Stifel unilaterally designed
this investment, and had represented to the bank in writing that
the CDOs were suitable for the schools&#8217; objectives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Kenosha Unified School District v. Royal Bank
of Canada (RY) Europe Ltd., 2008-cv-013726, Milwaukee County,
Wisconsin Circuit Court (Milwaukee). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Apple Fails to Wrest Android Data From Motorola Mobility &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) lost a bid to force Motorola Mobility Holdings
Inc. (MMI) to turn over data about Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s development of the
Android mobile-phone operating system and planned acquisition of
the mobile phone manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Circuit Judge Richard A. Posner, who in June will
preside over back-to-back patent trials pitting Apple against
Motorola, denied the production request in a single-paragraph
order issued March 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The motion is vague and overbroad and Motorola&#8217;s
objections are persuasive,&#8221; Posner wrote. The mobile phone
maker&#8217;s opposition to Apple&#8217;s March 16 demand was filed under
seal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google last month received U.S. and European Union approval
for its planned $12.5 billion acquisition of Libertyville,
Illinois-based Motorola Mobility, which already makes phones
reliant upon the Android system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, would also
acquire about 17,000 patents. In a regulatory filing March 19,
Motorola said it expected the sale to close in the first half of
this year, while adding that it can provide no assurances the
transaction will be approved by China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, based in Cupertino, California, makes the rival
iPhone which runs on the company&#8217;s proprietary software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility (MMI), which spun off from Motorola Inc. last
year, has been warring with Apple over patent rights in U.S. and
European courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Apple, declined to
comment on Posner&#8217;s decision. Jennifer Erickson, a Motorola
Mobility spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t reply to telephone and e-mail
messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apple Inc. v. Motorola Inc., 11-cv-08540, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Morgan Stanley Broker Faces Testimony Loss in Ruling&#8217;s Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Morgan Stanley broker Mark Mensack, ordered by
industry arbitrators to repay $1.2 million in bonus and lawyer&#8217;s
fees, may struggle to overturn the ruling after eight hours of
testimony went unrecorded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mensack, now a managing director at Piedmont Investment
Advisors, said he is seeking to appeal a decision after it led
to his bankruptcy. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
which organizes arbitration proceedings for brokerages, their
employees and customers, told him that eight of the 18 hours of
testimony from the hearing weren&#8217;t recorded due to mechanical or
human error, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The missing testimony may make it more challenging for
Mensack to have the arbitration panel&#8217;s decision overturned, a
procedure that is almost always daunting, said Howard Meyers, a
professor at New York Law School. Finra doesn&#8217;t have a process
for challenging awards. A court can overturn a ruling if
arbitrators acted corruptly, disregarded the law or had no basis
for an award, according to Finra&#8217;s website. Parties have 90 days
after a ruling to file a motion to vacate it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Courts actually favor arbitration because it clears up
their dockets, and they are very loathe to look behind an
arbitrator&#8217;s reasoning, so there are very limited grounds for
vacating,&#8221; said Meyers. &#8220;If this individual thought there was
something that was said during arbitration that would be useful
to show some grounds for vacating, he&#8217;s got an uphill battle
now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelle Ong, a spokeswoman for Finra, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays&#8217; Companies Say McKillen Tried to Profit on Hotel Rescue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick McKillen, the developer suing David and Frederick
Barclay, sought a $5 million-pound ($7.9 million) annual fee as
part of a failed bid to use Qatari investors to restructure the
debt of three luxury London hotels, lawyers for the Barclays&#8217;
companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKillen was questioned on the second day of the London
trial about his efforts as the director of Coroin Ltd., the
owner of Claridge&#8217;s, the Berkeley and the Connaught, to find a
solution to its 660-million-pound debt in 2010 and 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed fee for McKillen to stay on if Qatari
investors took a majority stake &#8220;was really an inducement to
sell your shares,&#8221; said Kenneth Maclean, who represents the
Barclays&#8217; companies. McKillen said the money was for hotel
refurbishment. &#8220;This was a budgeted fee for future work,&#8221; he
told the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coroin is worth more than 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion),
according to McKillen, who owns 36 percent of it. The Barclays
bought 800 million euros ($1.06 billion) of its debt last year
from Ireland&#8217;s National Asset Management Agency, the so-called
&#8220;bad bank&#8221; which houses distressed loans resulting from the
country&#8217;s property crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKillen says the brothers acted dishonorably in trying to
acquire the hotels and is seeking a court ruling that he has the
right to buy the remaining shares in Coroin. His lawyers argued
the Barclays intend to divide up the company and sell the 200-
year-old Claridge&#8217;s and the other hotels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raj Sethi, a managing director in
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s commodity-derivatives trading group,
quit after 14 years and may join a hedge fund, according to a
person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sethi, 35, who once ran the bank&#8217;s U.S. power-trading
business, left earlier this week, said the person who asked not
to be identified because the information is private. Ben Jacobs,
a vice president in the commodities group, also quit last week,
the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sethi and Jacobs, who traded the firm&#8217;s money as part of
their jobs, add to the exodus of proprietary traders who have
left New York-based Goldman Sachs and other firms because of new
U.S. regulations. The Volcker rule, named for former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, seeks to reduce the chance that
banks will make risky investments with their own capital and put
depositors&#8217; money at risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the departures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs started shuttering its proprietary-trading
desk in 2010, prompting Pierre-Henri Flamand and Morgan Sze, who
had run the global principal strategies group, to start their
own hedge funds in London and Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Macro Fund &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., Bennett Grau and Mark Mallon are teaming up
with former colleague Marc Mezvinsky to start a global macro
hedge fund this year, a person with knowledge of their plans
said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sethi joined Goldman Sachs in 1998 in New York and later
moved to Singapore and London, where he traded oil and other
commodities. He returned to New York in 2006 and most recently
traded commodities with a macro focus. Macro is a strategy that
seeks to profit from broad economic trends by trading everything
from currencies to bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taimur Hassan, who was responsible for Goldman Sachs&#8217;s oil
trading across Europe, the Middle East and Asia, quit in
December to start his own hedge fund, Financial News reported
last month, citing company filings and sources familiar with the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia was running low on
cash in August 2009 as Pennsylvania lawmakers refused to pass a
temporary sales-tax increase for the state&#8217;s biggest city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unable to sell notes with the legislation in flux, the
fifth-most populous U.S. city turned to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) for
a $275 million loan. The firm was rewarded two years later, when
Philadelphia chose it over 13 other banks to manage a $254
million negotiated bond issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan brought their balance sheet to support the
city,&#8221; said Nancy Winkler, Philadelphia&#8217;s treasurer. &#8220;That&#8217;s
an important relationship, their ability to bring that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which emerged from the worst financial crisis
since the 1930s as the most profitable U.S. bank, has parlayed
crisis-era loans to cities and states and a willingness to
outbid other firms in local government bond auctions into
becoming the top underwriter of municipal debt last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the first time
the firm held that rank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turnaround was a milestone for JPMorgan&#8217;s municipal-
bond department, which has been marred by its involvement in two
of the biggest scandals in the history of U.S. public finance: a
so-called pay-to-play scheme in Jefferson County, Alabama, that
contributed to the biggest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy, and a
federal probe that uncovered bid rigging of municipal-bond
investment products. It also underscores state and local
officials&#8217; willingness to overlook bankers&#8217; past abuses when
they set out to borrow money in debt markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Good Service&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I haven&#8217;t found an investment bank that hasn&#8217;t had some
problem in the last three years,&#8221; California Treasurer Bill Lockyer said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We do business with
them all. I think they provide good service. I think they&#8217;ve
been highly ethical with us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2009, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million
settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to
end a case over secret payments to friends of Jefferson County
commissioners in the sale of sewer bonds and interest-rate
swaps. The county filed for bankruptcy protection four months
ago. Last July the firm agreed to pay $211 million in a separate
settlement with state and federal regulators, admitting that
former employees had rigged bids of municipal-investment
contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, JPMorgan managed $35.7 billion of long-term bond
sales, $200 million more than Bank of America Merrill Lynch, its
closest competitor, according to Bloomberg data. This year
through March 19, JPMorgan also ranked first, with Bank of
America second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Deploying Our Capital&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Deploying our capital for municipalities and non-profits
all around the country is one of the most powerful ways we, as
an institution, can use our position of strength,&#8221; said Paul Palmeri, 46, who was selected to head New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s
public-finance department on March 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis that began in 2007 led to a
consolidation of investment banking, including in the $3.7
trillion U.S. municipal market. Bear Stearns Cos., the broker-
dealer operation of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc (LEH). and Merrill
Lynch  Co. (MER) were absorbed by JPMorgan, Barclays Plc (BARC) and Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) respectively. UBS AG (UBSN) left the public finance
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year JPMorgan, Bank of America Merrill, Citigroup Inc. (C)
and Morgan Stanley (MS) managed 46 percent of the $283.3 billion in
long-term municipal debt issued in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance fell 36 percent from the previous year because the
federal Build America Bonds program expired and cash-strapped
governments curbed new borrowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmeri took over the bank&#8217;s municipal business from Jeff Bosland, who was promoted last week to the head of sales and
marketing for fixed income and equities in the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drummer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmeri, a drummer who played in high school and college
bands and counts Rush&#8217;s Neil Peart and rock-fusion percussionist
Shane Gaalaas among his favorites, was formerly head of
municipal sales and trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bosland and Palmeri joined JPMorgan&#8217;s municipal department
from other parts of the bank in April 2008. Bosland, who was
JPMorgan&#8217;s head of agency trading and underwriting, became co-
head of public finance. Palmeri, who worked in the bank&#8217;s
mortgages group, became head of short-term municipal sales and
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial damage was all around them. A month before,
JPMorgan had acquired Bear Stearns in a forced sale, after
clients and investors pulled $17 billion in cash from the 85-
year-old firm in two days, fearing losses on subprime bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the SEC was probing JPMorgan&#8217;s sales of $5
billion of bonds and derivatives to Jefferson County. And
federal prosecutors were targeting the bank&#8217;s former head of
municipal derivative sales and at least four others in a
criminal antitrust investigation into bid rigging involving
products that state and local governments use to invest bond
proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Work to Do&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very fair to say, when we began in 2008, we had a
lot of work to do,&#8221; said Palmeri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of their first priorities was integrating the JPMorgan
and Bear Stearns banking teams. JPMorgan cut about 70 of its
public finance employees, replacing some of them with Bear
personnel. The acquisition boosted JPMorgan&#8217;s profile in state
housing finance and helped it expand its national banking
coverage. Key hires in transportation and public power brought
in more clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also started addressing its regulatory and legal
issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2008, JPMorgan said it would close its
municipal derivatives desk, stopping the sales of interest-rate
swaps to states and local governments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later, the SEC sued two former JPMorgan bankers,
saying they made more than $8 million in secret payments to
friends of Jefferson County commissioners. The firm inflated the
cost of the swaps to cover the payments, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Langford, the former Jefferson County commissioner in
charge of finance, was found guilty on U.S. criminal charges of
accepting bribes from a local investment banker who had received
payments from JPMorgan. No charges were filed against the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under chief executive Jamie Dimon, who joined the bank
after the Jefferson County deals were done, JPMorgan largely
avoided investing in subprime housing loans. Dimon has said the
bank didn&#8217;t need $25 billion in bailout money offered by the
Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the only major U.S. financial institution to
remain profitable throughout the crisis. On March 13, it raised
its dividend and authorized a share-repurchase plan after
passing the Federal Reserve&#8217;s tests of how lenders would fare in
an economic decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Continuing to Lend &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank continued to lend to state and local governments
throughout the recession as others pulled back, with the support
of senior management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They walked into the financial crisis with one of the
strongest bank balance sheets. Why not use it?&#8221; said
Christopher &#8220;Kit&#8221; Taylor, former executive director of the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. &#8220;You probably knew you
were going to get the underwriting on the other side.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2009, after California closed a $24 billion
budget deficit, JPMorgan loaned the state $1.5 billion so it
could pay IOU&#8217;s issued during a cash crisis. The loan helped
keep the state funded until September, when it could issue $8.8
billion in short-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, JPMorgan loaned California $500 million for
four months at 0.2 percent so the most-populous U.S. state could
pay bills after tax collections trailed budgeted amounts.
Barclays, which acquired Lehman&#8217;s investment banking and capital
markets operations, also lent the state $500 million, charging a
lower interest-rate than other banks, Lockyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$1.9 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Barclays also co-managed a $1.9 billion
refinancing for the state. Lockyer said that the favorable terms
of the short-term loan &#8220;was one of the considerations&#8221; for
hiring the two banks to handle the refinancing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockyer said JPMorgan&#8217;s support in hard times is something
officials remember when issuing new bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When there&#8217;s a stretch on the side of the bank and a good
deal for the state, we certainly consider that when we&#8217;re doing
future business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not automatic but it
certainly gives them brownie points.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to offering direct loans, JPMorgan has
increased its focus on competitive underwriting, showing a
greater willingness to commit the bank&#8217;s capital to buy bonds
and then resell them to investors. JPMorgan increased its share
of competitive long-term bond issues last year to 19.5 percent
from 10.3 percent the previous year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Sale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a competitive sale an issuer offers its bonds for sale
and banks bid against each other to purchase the bonds. The bank
assumes the risk it might not be able to sell all the bonds it
bought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, about 20 percent of debt issued by states and
local governments is sold through competitive bids. The rest is
done through negotiated underwriting, in which municipalities
select a bank in advance to price the bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s readiness to take risks in competitive
underwriting was on display in December 2008, when, a week after
Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich was arrested, it was the only
bank to bid on a $1 billion portion of $1.4 billion in short-
term notes. The state had delayed the deal because of
Blagojevich&#8217;s indictment for bribery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also bought $9.1 billion of $9.8 billion of short-
term notes auctioned by Texas last August -- the biggest
competitive auction in municipal-market history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Shows Our Commitment&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That shows our commitment to use our balance sheet when
we think it&#8217;s appropriate to help our clients,&#8221; Palmeri said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This December, in a $400 million auction of Massachusetts
bonds on December 20, JPMorgan offered a total interest cost of
2.57 percent, beating Bank of America, the second-lowest bidder,
offering 2.79 percent. The competition helped Massachusetts save
$880,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the Massachusetts deal, JPMorgan agreed to buy
$40 million of bonds maturing in 2021, paying $114 per $1,000
security. The same day, $10 million of the bonds were sold to a
customer for $113 per $1,000 bonds, a $100,000 loss, trade
records filed with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Incredibly Important&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not a high-margin business, but it&#8217;s a business
that&#8217;s incredibly important to our clients,&#8221; said James Lansing, JPMorgan&#8217;s head of municipal debt capital markets. &#8220;If
a firm is willing to commit its own capital to underwrite bonds
and it&#8217;s confident that it can distribute that paper, that&#8217;s a
great fact that other issuers can point to and say, &#8216;I know I
can award negotiated business to this underwriter because
they&#8217;re going to get great execution.&#8217; &#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s what happened in Washington State last year. The
state chose JPMorgan from a pre-qualified pool of banks to
manage $1.1 billion of bonds. The state selected JPMorgan in
part because of the bank&#8217;s participation in its competitive bond
sales and also its expertise in structuring transportation
deals, said Chris McGann, a spokesman for Treasurer James
McIntyre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re able to place the bonds and they&#8217;re familiar with
the type of investors who like to invest in Washington,&#8221; McGann
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has beefed up its distribution to individual
investors through strategic agreements with UBS and Charles
Schwab  Co. The agreements give JPMorgan access to 17,000 of
the two firms&#8217; retail brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond the Scandals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That JPMorgan was able get underwriting business in
Philadelphia shows it has moved beyond the scandals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, two former JPMorgan bankers pleaded guilty to
arranging a $50,000 payment to a bond lawyer and fundraiser for
former Mayor John Street to get underwriting business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That prompted officials working for the new mayor, Michael Nutter, to avoid doing underwriting business through JPMorgan
for more than year, Treasurer Nancy Winkler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That changed when JPMorgan loaned Philadelphia money to pay
its bills in August 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They got rid of a lot of people, a lot of leadership, as
well as the bankers,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The bankers that they have
covering the city are very good. We need to be able to have them
as partners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB) acquired 750 patents
from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), adding intellectual
property that may help it counter allegations of patent
infringement, a person with knowledge of the transaction said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents cover various technologies such as software and
networking, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the deal hasn&#8217;t been made public. The acquisition would
swell the size of Facebook&#8217;s portfolio, which includes at least
56 issued patents and 503 filed U.S. patent applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, the world&#8217;s biggest social-networking service, is
bolstering its legal defenses amid a standoff with rivals that
have broader intellectual property portfolios. Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) sued
Facebook this month, accusing it of infringing patents covering
critical website functions. Facebook may have shelled out
hundreds of millions of dollars for the IBM patents, said Erin-
Michael Gill, a managing director at MDB Capital Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a very big deal,&#8221; said Gill, who is chief
intellectual property officer at MDB, an investment bank focused
on intellectual property. While it&#8217;s not clear how strong the
patents are, &#8220;Facebook is now where it&#8217;s supposed to be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yahoo suit involves patents covering Internet privacy,
advertising and information sharing. Sunnyvale, California-based
Yahoo asked for an order barring Facebook from infringing the 10
patents. It&#8217;s seeking triple damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Thaw, a spokesman for Menlo Park, California-based
Facebook, declined to comment, as did Ed Barbini, a spokesman
for IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earlier Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook already has been acquiring patents from other
holders, including early social-networking site Friendster and
computing company Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), according to the U.S.
Patent  Trademark Office. Yahoo, Google Inc. and Microsoft
Corp. all have at least 1,000 patents, according to MDB, based
in Santa Monica, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook&#8217;s IBM deal could help assuage concerns that the
company lacks the intellectual property it needs, Gill said. The
social network filed for an initial public offering last month,
increasing investor scrutiny of the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, which had almost $4 billion in revenue last year,
announced earlier this month that it set up a new credit line of
$5 billion, replacing a $2.5 billion revolving line, that will
be used for working capital and other general corporate
purposes. The funds also will help Facebook cover the potential
legal costs of patent litigation with Yahoo, according to a
person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record IPO &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook also had 33 corresponding patents and 149 filed
applications in foreign countries as of the end of last year,
according to the IPO filing. The company is seeking to raise $5
billion in the offering, making it the largest Internet IPO on
record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook expects more patent lawsuits in the future,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect the number of patent and other intellectual
property claims against us to grow,&#8221; the company said in the
Feb. 1 document, prior to Yahoo&#8217;s actions. &#8220;We may introduce
new products, including in areas where we currently do not
compete, which could increase our exposure to patent and other
intellectual property claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already, Facebook ranked No. 28 on the list of companies
most frequently targeted in patent cases last year, with 22
suits, according to LegalMetric.com. That&#8217;s more than companies
such as Cisco Systems Inc. and Yahoo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Weapons in Arsenal&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They need to have some weapons in their own arsenal,&#8221;
Thomas Scott, a lawyer at Goodwin Procter LLP in Washington,
said in an interview last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquired patents made up $51 million of Facebook&#8217;s goodwill
and intangible assets in 2011, up from $33 million in 2010,
according to Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, meanwhile, has been offering portions of its patent
hoard to Internet companies. The Armonk, New York-based
computer-services giant has made a series of intellectual-
property deals with Google (GOOG) over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM continues to add to its patent trove, receiving 6,180
new patents last year. The company has topped the list of U.S.
patent recipients for 19 straight years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global corporate bonds won&#8217;t match
the record-setting returns of the first two months of the year
for the rest of 2012, Barclays Plc analysts said, joining
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in predicting equities would outperform
fixed income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased volatility and reduced liquidity will prevent the
extra yield investors demand to hold corporates instead of
government bonds from returning to historical lows, Barclays
credit strategists led by Jeffrey Meli wrote in a report today.
High dollar prices, in addition to low interest rates, make it
difficult for spreads to compress further, according to the
analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see limited additional yield compression from this
point on,&#8221; Sherif Hamid, one of the Barclays analysts who wrote
the report, said in a telephone interview from London. &#8220;We view
equities as representing a more attractive risk-reward
opportunity than credit, particularly investment-grade credit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate bond spreads in the U.S., which have declined by
74 basis points since the start of the year to 269 basis points
yesterday, are still above the 130 basis points reached in
February 2007, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Long Good Buy&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think it&#8217;s time to say a &#8216;long good bye&#8217; to bonds, and
embrace the &#8216;long good buy&#8217; for equities as we expect them to
embark on an upward trend over the next few years,&#8221; Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s Peter Oppenheimer and Mattheiu Walterspiler wrote in a
research note yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global corporate debt returned 3.8 percent in January and
February, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. It
has lost 0.3 percent this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low interest rates could dissuade total-return investors,
the Barclays analysts wrote. The Federal Reserve has taken
extraordinary measures since the September 2008 failure of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. to lower borrowing costs, which
helped push the 10-year Treasury yield to 1.72 percent Sept. 22,
2011, the lowest since at least 1962. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Barclays analysts calculate that investment-grade
credit in the U.S. and in Europe can only absorb small increases
in benchmark yields before total returns turn negative. Yields
on investment-grade bonds in the U.S. reached a record low of
3.4 percent on March 2 from as high as 4.16 percent in October,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond dealers reduced holdings of corporate debt securities
to $50.6 billion on March 14 from $129.1 billion in September
2008. &#8220;Investors are going to demand a higher spread for the
decreased liquidity,&#8221; Marc Gross, a money manager at RS
Investments who oversees $3 billion in fixed-income funds, said
in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $125
million of securities linked to developer Larry Silverstein&#8217;s 7
World Trade Center in New York, refinancing debt against the
building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercial-mortgage bonds rated Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and BBB- by Fitch Ratings, the lowest
investment-grade rankings, priced to yield 310 basis points more
than the benchmark swap rate, according to a person familiar
with the offering, who declined to be identified because terms
aren&#8217;t public. The refinancing also includes $452.8 million of
senior tax-exempt Liberty bonds that were not offered with
today&#8217;s transaction, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CMBS deal comprises debt against the 52-story tower in
downtown Manhattan constructed in 2006, according to Moody&#8217;s.
The property is 95.2 percent leased to 28 tenants, the rating
company said in a report. The largest tenant is Moody&#8217;s,
accounting for 38.7 of the available space, according to Fitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tower was built to replace a building destroyed in the
Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering is different from more common commercial-
mortgage backed securities deals in that it is less diversified
than those that bundle loans from multiple borrowers on as many
as 100 properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank forecasts for commercial-mortgage bond sales in 2012
range from Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s $25 billion to Credit Suisse
Group AG&#8217;s projection of as much as $45 billion. About $4
billion has been issued this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CMBS Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks arranged about $28 billion of commercial-
mortgage backed securities last year, compared with $11.5
billion in 2010. Rising sales are a boon for property owners
with loans coming due. Borrowers have $51 billion of mortgages
packed into bonds maturing this year, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative yields on top-ranked commercial-mortgage bonds
have plunged to 181 basis points more than Treasuries, the
lowest since May, according to the Barclays Capital CMBS Aaa
Super Duper Index. That&#8217;s down from a high of 323 basis points
on Oct. 4, at the height of the European sovereign-debt crisis.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kristian Orssten, head of EMEA loan
and high-yield capital markets at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), said
more borrowers are asking about bilateral loans, which involve
only one lender. He made the comment at a syndicated loan
conference in London yesterday organized by Euromoney Seminars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the impact of increased bilateral lending: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are seeing more inquiries in Europe for bilaterals as
borrowers find it more difficult to get consensus among lenders
for terms and documentations in today&#8217;s market condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;This is an alarming sign. If it becomes a trend in the
syndicated loan market it will negatively affect transferability
and transparency.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should sell the dollar
against the yen, betting the U.S. currency will weaken about 4.5
percent to 79, because of a &#8220;potential reversal of recent yen-
negative factors,&#8221; according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a substantial risk that the sharp move in the
yen will reverse at least partially in the new fiscal year,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs analysts led by London-based Thomas Stolper wrote
today in an e-mailed report. &#8220;Seasonal patterns point in that
direction. The surprise improvement in the February trade
balance in Japan supports our view and we are now also coming
very close to fiscal year-end in Japan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should end the trade should the dollar close
above 84.50 yen, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar weakened 1.2 percent to 82.42 yen at 4:34 p.m.

&lt;p&gt;TiVo Inc. (TIVO) said Microsoft Corp.
agreed to drop patent-infringement litigation that could have
led to a U.S. import ban on TiVo&#8217;s television set-top boxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TiVo said in a regulatory filing it didn&#8217;t grant patent
rights to Microsoft, and it agreed to drop counterclaims against
the Redmond, Washington-based software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft filed patent-infringement complaints at the U.S.
International Trade Commission in Washington and in federal
court in San Jose, California, after TiVo sued Microsoft client
ATT Inc. ATT agreed to pay TiVo at least $215 million in
January to end that dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TiVo, based in Alviso, California, has asserted its patent
rights after increased competition in the market for digital-
video recording services it pioneered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ITC case, a judge was scheduled to release his
findings next month, while a mirror case filed in federal court
in San Jose was on hold while the ITC matter was under way. A
second case in California, alleging infringement of additional
Microsoft patents, was put on hold while the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office took a second look at the patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TiVo still has pending litigation against Verizon
Communications Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases settled are Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. TiVo Inc.,
10cv240, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California (San Jose), Microsoft v. TiVo, 11cv2896, U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Washington (Seattle).

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) said China&#8217;s recent
decision to let Citigroup Inc. issue credit cards may be the
start of a broader market opening that will allow the world&#8217;s
largest payments processor to expand in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa will keep investing in its business of processing
foreign-denominated payments in the world&#8217;s second-largest
economy, Elizabeth Buse, group president responsible for most
business outside the Americas, said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television today. China UnionPay Data Co. has a
monopoly on handling yuan payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global payment volumes at Visa surpassed $1 trillion last
year, with 30 percent from Asia, Buse said. Volume growth in
China was more than 50 percent, she said. Citigroup last month
became the first foreign bank allowed to issue credit cards in
the world&#8217;s most populous nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We hope that the license that has been granted to Citi is
just the beginning of a broader opening of that market,&#8221; said
Buse. The only thing that might &#8220;immediately&#8221; lead to a market
opening is a U.S. complaint about the monopoly at the World
Trade Organization, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting on the U.S.&#8217;s criticism, the WTO is investigating
China&#8217;s requirement that yuan-denominated payments be executed
through China UnionPay Data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s Watson computer, which beat champions of the quiz show
&#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; last year and is starting to be sold to insurers
and banks, is to provide help to doctors and patients on
diagnosis and treatment for cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and IBM
have agreed to collaborate on the development of a Watson-based
service that will assist the hospital group&#8217;s doctors with the
diagnosis of cancer and suggest treatment options by mining the
most current and comprehensive information available, the two
parties said in a joint statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining Watson with Sloan-Kettering&#8217;s clinical knowledge,
as well as with the latest cancer research, will make the
service a &#8220;decision support tool,&#8221; Armonk, New York-based IBM
and Memorial Sloan-Kettering said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM says Watson&#8217;s skills -- interpreting queries in natural
language, consulting vast volumes of unstructured information
quickly, and answering questions with a defined level of
confidence -- can be applied to many industries. It has already
sold the technology to WellPoint Inc. (WLP), the U.S. insurer, and
Citigroup Inc. (C), and expects to generate billions in new revenue
by 2015 from putting Watson to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Physicians require a lot more information to make the
proper decision as we learn more about the biology of cancer,&#8221;
Martin Kohn, IBM&#8217;s chief medical scientist, said in an
interview. Using Watson &#8220;we have access to much more
information than we could possibly accomplish by reading on our
own, or even 100 people reading.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Grand Challenge&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson is being taught oncology and being programmed with
the types of questions it will be posed in a similar way to when
it was trained for &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; Applying Watson to the field of
cancer diagnosis and treatment, &#8220;given its importance on both a
human and economic level, is exactly the type of grand challenge
IBM Watson can help address,&#8221; Kohn said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sloan-Kettering and IBM are already developing the first
applications using Watson related to lung, breast and prostate
cancers, and aim to begin piloting the solutions to some
oncologists in late 2012, with wider distribution planned for
late 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The combination of transformational technologies found in
Watson with our cancer analytics and decision-making process has
the potential to revolutionize the accessibility of information
for the treatment of cancer in communities across the country
and around the world,&#8221; Sloan-Kettering Chief Executive Officer
Craig B. Thompson said in the statement. &#8220;We also expect
tremendous new research opportunities to emerge from this
collaboration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Artificial Intelligence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2011, about 15 million viewers watched Watson
beat former &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter
-- a highly publicized victory in artificial intelligence that
IBM always aimed to apply to the business world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supercomputer, including its work in the health-care
and finance industries, will contribute &#8220;a portion&#8221; of IBM&#8217;s
target of $16 billion of analytics revenue in 2015, Manoj Saxena, the man responsible for finding Watson business, said in
a February interview. That portion will &#8220;have a B next to it,&#8221;
Saxena said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson may generate $2.65 billion in revenue in 2015,
adding 52 cents of earnings per share, Ed Maguire, an analyst at
CLSA in New York, estimated in a November research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider,
reported revenue of $107 billion in 2011 and earnings of $13.06
a share. The company ended 2011 with $11.9 billion in cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s shares rose less than 1 percent to $204.69 at
the close in New York yesterday. The shares have increased by 30
percent in the past 12 months and on March 5 closed above $200
for the first time, factoring in stock splits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon S. Corzine, MF Global Holding
Ltd. (MFGLQ)&#8217;s chief executive officer, gave &#8220;direct instructions&#8221; to
transfer $200 million from a customer fund account to meet an
overdraft in a brokerage account with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
according to a memo written by congressional investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edith O&#8217;Brien, a treasurer for the firm, said in an e-mail
quoted in the memo that the transfer was &#8220;Per JC&#8217;s direct
instructions,&#8221; according to a copy of the memo obtained by
Bloomberg News. The e-mail, dated Oct. 28, was sent three days
before the company collapsed, the memo says. The memo does not
indicate whether that phrase was the full text of the e-mail or
an excerpt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s internal e-mail was sent as the New York-based
broker found intraday credit lines limited by JPMorgan, the
firm&#8217;s clearing bank as well as one of its custodian banks for
segregated customer funds, according to the memo, which was
prepared for a March 28 House Financial Services subcommittee
hearing on the firm&#8217;s collapse. O&#8217;Brien is scheduled to testify
at the hearing after being subpoenaed this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the course of that week, MF Global (MFGLQ)&#8217;s financial
position deteriorated, but the firm represented to its
regulators and self-regulatory organizations that its customers&#8217;
segregated funds were safe,&#8221; said the memo, written by
Financial Services Committee staff and sent to lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empresa Distribuidora 
Comercializadora Norte SA (EDN) fell to its lowest price in almost
three years after JPMorgan Chase  Co. said the Argentine power
distributor may default on its bond payment next year as the
government&#8217;s caps on utility rates constrain cash flows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in the company, also known as Edenor, fell 1.9
percent to 1.03 pesos at the close in Buenos Aires, the lowest
price since June 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edenor won&#8217;t default this year and bonds would see
&#8220;significant upside&#8221; if negotiations with the government over
tariffs produce positive results, analyst Isabela Bacchi wrote
in the report today. JPMorgan maintained its recommendation to
buy Edenor bonds due in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Edenor bonds due in 2022 fell 16 basis points, or
0.16 percentage point, to 18.5 percent at 5:25 p.m. in Buenos
Aires, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. They have
soared 405 basis points in the past month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is being sued
by a trader who says he accepted a contract from the investment
bank because a typographical error made him believe he would be
paid 10 times what was actually offered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kai Herbert, a Switzerland-based currency trader, is suing
JPMorgan for about 580,000 pounds ($920,000), his lawyers said
at a trial in London this week. The original contract said
Herbert&#8217;s annual pay would be 24 million rand ($3.1 million).
JPMorgan blamed the mistake on a typographical error and said
the figure should have been 2.4 million rand, according to court
documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That must have been the moment your heart sank,&#8221; Judge
Henry Globe said at the trial this week, referring to when
Herbert discovered the mistake. Herbert resigned from UBS AG (UBSN) in
June 2010 following the offer from JPMorgan to relocate to
Johannesburg. Herbert didn&#8217;t report for work after discovering
the discrepancy and JPMorgan rescinded the employment offer in
December 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has been unemployed since, other than eight months at
Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) where he was fired in a round of layoffs
in November. Banks globally have cut about 196,000 jobs since
the start of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;How can you possibly suggest that they would pay you so
much money for an executive director level job?&#8221; Charles
Ciumei, a lawyer for JPMorgan, asked during Herbert&#8217;s cross-
examination. The bank said Herbert could have mitigated his lost
earnings by taking the position at the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banker salaries are the focus of several cases in London
courts. Commerzbank AG (CBK) is being sued by former bankers at
Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd. whose bonuses were cut by 90 percent
after being acquired by Commerzbank in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If it is too good to be true, then it probably is, but if
the trader signed the contract in good faith it is probably
binding,&#8221; Adrian Crawford, an employment lawyer at Kingsley
Napley LLP in London who isn&#8217;t involved in the case, said in a
phone interview. &#8220;It is all about the subjective view of the
trader and JPMorgan will have to prove he knew there was a
mistake in the contract but signed it anyway.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Haywood, a spokeswoman at JPMorgan declined to
comment. Herbert&#8217;s lawyer, Dale Langley, declined to comment as

&lt;p&gt;After several drinks at a Greek
restaurant on Manhattan&#8217;s Third Avenue in the summer of 2006,
two computer programmers at Bernard Madoff&#8217;s investment firm
asked their supervisor whether the boss&#8217;s business was a scam,
Bloomberg News&#8217; David Glovin and Bob Van Voris report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Frank DiPascali laughed off the
question, telling George Perez and Jerome O&#8217;Hara that Madoff was
honest. DiPascali would later tell the FBI he wondered why they
took so long to ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His chronicle of the dinner, and the lengths to which
Madoff went to convince employees that his massive fraud was a
legitimate business, were revealed for the first time in FBI
reports made public last week. Attached to court filings by ex-
Madoff employees facing fraud charges, they contain interviews
with DiPascali -- Madoff&#8217;s chief aide -- who in 2009 pleaded
guilty to his role in the biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, when Perez and O&#8217;Hara confronted Madoff and asked why
there was no sign of stock trades, Madoff exploded, DiPascali
told the FBI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You are not going to tell me how to run my business,&#8221;
Madoff insisted during a meeting in the office of the firm&#8217;s
operations chief, Daniel Bonventre, according to DiPascali.
&#8220;Trades occur overseas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 73, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and is serving
a 150-year term for cheating investors out of $20 billion in
principal. Five employees -- Perez, O&#8217;Hara, Bonventre, Annette
Bongiorno and Joann Crupi -- are accused of aiding Madoff in his
fraud. Defense attorneys said they&#8217;ll use DiPascali&#8217;s comments
to establish their clients were unaware of Madoff&#8217;s scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonventre and Bongiorno began working for Madoff in 1968,
with Bongiorno rising to the level of supervisor and account
manager. Crupi, an employee since 1983, tracked daily bank
account activity, prosecutors said. Perez and O&#8217;Hara started at
the firm in the early 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five were arrested in 2009 and 2010. In addition to
DiPascali, who began working for Madoff in 1975, former
employees David Kugel, Enrica Cotellessa-Pitz and Eric Lipkin
have pleaded guilty and are aiding prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Bonventre, 10-CR-228, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Loses $373 Million Arbitration to American Century &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was ordered by arbitrators to pay $373
million to American Century Investments over claims that
executives led by Jes Staley enriched the bank at the expense of
the fund-management firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award, issued privately in August, focused on
JPMorgan&#8217;s promise to promote American Century products when the
bank acquired the firm&#8217;s retirement-plan services unit, or RPS,
in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Staley, then JPMorgan&#8217;s asset-management chief,
mistakenly thought there was a limit on the bank&#8217;s liability if
it didn&#8217;t meet obligations, executives failed to make good on
the deal, arbitrators found. Employees were instead rewarded for
pushing JPMorgan&#8217;s own products, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In short, JPM and RPS stacked the cards against ACI,&#8221;
the arbitrators wrote in the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arbitrators awarded American Century $373 million plus
9 percent annual interest until paid in full. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, set aside funds
to cover the award during last year&#8217;s third quarter. Parties in
the case had agreed to resolve it privately through arbitration
and the ruling had been sealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley, 56, was promoted to lead JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank
in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was brought to the American Arbitration
Association in 2009 and tried before a two-person panel in
February and March of last year. In their ruling, the panelists
said they reviewed about 600 exhibits and heard testimony from
almost 50 witnesses, including Staley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Almost no one including the top executives of JPM and RPS
down the chain of command paid any attention to what the revenue
agreement said&#8221; unless it applied to the bank&#8217;s own earnings,
the arbitrators wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We disagree strongly with the arbitrator&#8217;s decision and
award,&#8221; Kristen Chambers, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, said yesterday. &#8220;Among other things, it misinterprets
the contract, ignores facts favorable to us such as the
performance of certain American Century funds during the period
in dispute, and ignores expert opinions that were favorable to
us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Doyle, a spokesman for Kansas City, Missouri-based
American Century, said the firm is &#8220;very pleased&#8221; with the
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is American Century Investment Management Inc. v.
J.P. Morgan Invest Holdings LLC, 58 148 Y 00220 09, American
Arbitration Association (Kansas City). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Milan Settles Derivatives With UBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Depfa
Bank Plc agreed to unwind interest-rate swaps with the city of
Milan&#8217;s government in a 455 million-euro ($600 million)
transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the settlement, the banks, which are on trial for
fraud, closed the swaps yesterday at a &#8220;positive&#8221; mark-to-
market for the city, according to an e-mailed statement from the
Italian municipality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement isn&#8217;t for damages and doesn&#8217;t indicate any
acceptance of responsibility by the banks, according to the
statement. Milan agreed to drop claims for damages in the U.K.
and Italy, where the banks face criminal charges. Milan agreed
to forgo civil claims in return for a &#8220;discount&#8217; on the cost of
closing the swaps, it said. The criminal trial will continue.
Officials for the four banks declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lenders charged 101 million euros in so-called hidden
fees for arranging the derivatives that adjusted payments on the
city&#8217;s 1.7 billion-euro bond offering in 2005 and from
subsequent restructurings, according to city prosecutor Alfredo
Robledo. The fees are fraudulent given that they weren&#8217;t
disclosed, he said as he secured charges against the banks in
March 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;It&#8217;s hard to tell the net position of the settlement
without the actual contracts,&#8221; which typically remain private,
said Michael Dempster, founder of the University of Cambridge&#8217;s
Centre for Financial Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds from the settlement will be held by the four
banks as a guarantee on other derivative contracts that the city
and the banks will maintain, according to the statement. Two-
thirds of the settlement has been invested in Italian government
bonds, according to the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stanford&#8217;s Twitter Complaint Fails to Win Fraud Retrial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford, found guilty of running a $7 billion
Ponzi scheme, lost a retrial bid in which his lawyers argued
that Twitter comments by courtroom news reporters may have
influenced the jury that convicted him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendant&#8217;s motion for a new trial is denied,&#8221; U.S.
District Judge David Hittner in Houston ruled yesterday without
elaboration in a single-sentence decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, was found guilty on 13 of 14 criminal counts
after a six-week trial in which prosecutors convinced jurors
that he misled investors about what was being done with proceeds
of the certificates of deposit they bought from Stanford
International Bank Ltd. in Antigua. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford is scheduled to be sentenced June 14. The four
wire-fraud charges and five mail-fraud charges he was convicted
of each carry a maximum punishment of 20 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense lawyers, in a March 20 filing, said journalists&#8217;
real-time coverage of the trial on Twitter improperly influenced
the jurors, who had been warned to avoid other forms of media
coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Sweeney, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment on yesterday&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oracle Investor Sues Over $200 Million Whistle-Blower Accord &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. (ORCL) directors, including Chief Executive Officer
Larry Ellison, were sued by an investor for failing to mitigate
damages when the company agreed to a $200 million whistle-blower
settlement with the U.S. government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directors violated their fiduciary duties by forcing the
government into extensive litigation even though they knew the
allegations were &#8220;grounded in fact,&#8221; shareholder Jordan R.
Weinrib said in a complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery
Court (1400L) in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rather than attempt to settle all claims at that time by
the institution of appropriate corporate therapeutics and the
paying of what would have been a small fine, the board insisted
on digging in and litigating the matter extensively,&#8221; Weinrib
said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, announced in October, resolved a lawsuit
claiming Oracle induced the General Services Administration to
buy $1.08 billion in software from 1998 to 2006 by falsely
promising the same discounts offered to favored commercial
customers. The payout was the largest ever obtained by the GSA
under the False Claims Act, which lets citizens sue on behalf of
the government and share in any recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Oracle employee Paul Frascella filed the case in
2007. The Justice Department pursued the case after joining the
whistle-blower lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinrib is seeking unspecified damages on behalf of the
company. Deborah Hellinger, an Oracle spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Weinrib v. Ellison, CA7350, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Siemens Sued Over Cancellation of Alarm Funding IPO &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens First Capital Commercial Finance LLC was sued in
New York state court for breach of contract over the
cancellation of an initial public offering for a security-alarm
service business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed March 21 in New York state Supreme Court in
Manhattan, accuses Siemens First Capital of &#8220;intentionally
destroying&#8221; three related companies that were planning an
initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens told Whitecap (US) Fund I LP, the majority owner of
Alarm Funding LLC, the parent of the three companies, in March
2011 that the companies had defaulted on an $85 million loan
because the public offering hadn&#8217;t been completed by March 1,
according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies had never missed a payment on the loan and
had repaid $47 million, the complaint shows. Whitecap and two
related entities filed the suit, which seeks damages of more
than $20 million, on behalf of the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Siemens was not content with what it was entitled to
under the contract, i.e. repayment in full over time,&#8221;
according to the lawsuit. &#8220;Instead, Siemens wished to extract
as much money as possible from the alarm funding companies as
quickly as it could.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Whitecap (US) Fund I LP v. Siemens First
Capital Commercial Finance LLC, 650888/2012, New York state
Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CVS Ordered to Stop Controlled Drug Sales at Two Pharmacies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) must stop filling prescriptions for
controlled substances at two of its pharmacies in Sanford,
Florida, while an appeals court weighs a U.S. order barring the
sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington yesterday rejected
a request by CVS to put the order by the Drug Enforcement
Administration on hold. A lower court judge on March 13 upheld
the DEA suspension, which resulted from an investigation into
oxycodone sales by the pharmacies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Appellant has not satisfied the stringent requirements
for a stay pending appeal,&#8221; the three-judge panel ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different three-judge panel on March 16 turned down a
similar bid by Cardinal Health Inc. (CAH), the second-largest U.S.
drug distributor by revenue, to forestall the suspension of its
Lakeland, Florida, facility from distributing controlled
substances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said the DEA produced
enough information to show that pharmacists at the CVS stores
filled prescriptions for the painkiller oxycodone that they knew
or should have known would lead to the drug being diverted for
illegal uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carolyn Castel, a CVS spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Cardinal Health v. U.S. Department of
Justice, 12-05061, and Holiday CVS LLC v. Holder, 12-05072, U.S.
Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ATT Accused of Improperly Billing U.S. Program for Deaf &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unit of ATT Inc. (T) is accused of improperly billing the
U.S. for millions of dollars in reimbursements of text-based
communications under a federal program for the hearing-impaired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department intervened March 22 in a
whistle-blower lawsuit in federal court in Pittsburgh that
alleged the phone company violated the False Claims Act. ATT
failed to ensure that users of the Federal Communications
Commission program were eligible, the U.S. alleges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Federal funding for Telecommunications Relay Services is
intended to help the hearing- and speech-impaired in the United
States,&#8221; Stuart Delery, acting assistant attorney general for
the Justice Department&#8217;s civil division, said yesterday in a
statement. &#8220;We will pursue those who seek to gain by knowingly
allowing others to abuse this program.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, ATT allowed thousands of calls
to be made on the system by users in Nigeria and other countries
seeking to defraud U.S. merchants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marty Richter, a spokesman for Dallas-based ATT, said in a
statement that the company followed the FCC&#8217;s rules for
providing Internet Protocol Relay services and for seeking
reimbursement for those services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the FCC is aware, it is always possible for an
individual to misuse IP Relay services, just as someone can
misuse the postal system or an e-mail account, but FCC rules
require that we complete all calls by customers who identify
themselves as disabled,&#8221; Richter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Lyttle v. ATT Communications of Pennsylvania,
10-01376, U.S. District Court, Western District of Pennsylvania
(Pittsburgh). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ernst  Young Suit Over Lehman Fees Sent to N.Y. State Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit accusing Ernst  Young LLP of facilitating a
&#8220;major accounting fraud&#8221; by helping Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ) deceive the public about its financial condition was sent
back to New York state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan yesterday
said the lawsuit, filed in state supreme court in December 2010
by then-New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and later moved
to federal court, should be tried in state court. Cuomo&#8217;s
successor, Eric Schneiderman, has continued to pursue the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaplan said he reviewed the matter even after the state
dropped its objection to having the case tried in federal court
and &#8220;now concludes that the removal was improper because the
case does not come within federal jurisdiction.&#8221; The claims in
the complaint are predominantly based on state and not federal
law, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed by the court&#8217;s ruling, and we are
reviewing it,&#8221; Charlie Perkins, an Ernst  Young spokesman,
said in an e-mail. &#8220;We will continue to vigorously defend
ourselves in this matter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Securities and ERISA
Litigation, 09-MD-2017, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley Pay Suit Dismissal Upheld by Appeals Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dismissal of a Morgan Stanley (MS) shareholder lawsuit
brought in 2010 over $45 billion paid to the firm&#8217;s employees in
three years was upheld by a New York appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders including the Security Police and Fire
Professionals of America Retirement Fund sued Morgan Stanley,
former chairman John Mack and other executives in February 2010,
accusing the company of making improper compensation and bonus
payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York State Supreme Court Justice Shirley Werner
Kornreich threw out the suit in December 2010, citing a
requirement that shareholders first make a demand on a board
before suing on behalf of a company or show that such a move
would be futile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeals court in Manhattan upheld the dismissal
yesterday, saying the complaint lacks specific allegations
needed to determine whether work done by company employees was
&#8220;of such limited value to the corporation that no reasonable
person in the directors&#8217; position&#8217;&#8217; would have approved their
pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The complaint does not adequately plead waste,&#8221; Justice
Peter Tom, of the state Appellate Division First Department,
wrote. &#8220;It lacks the &#8216;specific allegations of unconscionable
transactions and details regarding who was paid and for what
reasons they were paid.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mack ceded his chairman role at New York-based Morgan
Stanley in January to Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, who
took over as CEO for Mack at the end of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Security Police and Fire Professionals of
America Retirement Fund v. Mack, 600359-2010, New York State
Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Madoff Trustee Appeals $59 Billion Ruling in UniCredit Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm appealed a court
ruling that tossed most of his $59 billion in claims against
UniCredit SpA (UCG), Sonja Kohn and other defendants, following
earlier appeals seeking to recover about $30 billion in damages
from banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff trustee Irving Picard&#8217;s notice of appeal and
document record were transmitted yesterday to U.S. District
Court in Manhattan by a U.S. appeals court, according to
filings. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff on Feb. 21 dismissed
Picard&#8217;s claims under the racketeering statute, which allows for
triple damages, saying he hadn&#8217;t proved his allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard now has $90 billion in claims before the appeals
court, out of about $100 billion he had demanded in more than
1,000 suits to gather money for customers with Madoff Ponzi
scheme losses. Rakoff and another district judge, Colleen
McMahon, dismissed the $90 billion in claims in Picard&#8217;s suits
against banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co., HSBC Holdings Plc,
UBS AG (UBSN) and UniCredit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his written opinion on the UniCredit racketeering case,
Rakoff said Picard made a &#8220;casual assertion&#8221; that the
defendants &#8220;fed, perpetuated and profited from&#8221; Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi
scheme, and failed to show a direct relationship between the
alleged criminal acts and resulting injuries to the con man&#8217;s
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff also dismissed common-law claims including unjust
enrichment and conversion. He directed that the remaining claims
be returned to bankruptcy court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year sentence in a federal
prison in North Carolina for running a Ponzi scheme that
defrauded investors of an estimated $20 billion in principal.
Picard and his law firm, Baker  Hostetler LLP, have charged
about $273 million for their work on the Madoff estate so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Kohn, 11-CV-1181, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Baum Foreclosure Firm Settles With New York for $4 Million &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven J. Baum PC, the largest foreclosure law firm in New
York until it shut down last year, reached a $4 million
settlement with the state over abuses in its legal work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the money paid by the firm, Pillar Processing LLC,
Steven Baum himself and managing partner Brian Kumiega will be
used to help homeowners facing foreclosure or victims of
predatory lending, New York State Attorney General Eric
Schneiderman said yesterday in a statement. Baum formed Pillar
in 2007 to process foreclosure documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Baum firm cut corners in order to maximize the number
of its foreclosure filings and its profits,&#8221; Schneiderman said
in the statement. Baum and Kumiega have also agreed not to
represent lenders or servicers in new foreclosure cases for two
years, Schneiderman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm said in a statement that it didn&#8217;t admit
wrongdoing as part of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, the firm, based in Amherst, New York, just
north of Buffalo, reached a $2 million agreement related to its
foreclosure practices with Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara. After that settlement was announced, Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, the mortgage-finance companies under U.S.
conservatorship, dropped Baum from their lists of law firms
eligible to handle foreclosures. The firm then said it would
close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After an exhaustive 10-month investigation, the attorney
general&#8217;s office did not identify a single instance where a
foreclosure proceeding was brought by the Baum firm where the
homeowner wasn&#8217;t actually in default,&#8221; Elkan Abramowitz, a
lawyer for the settling parties, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Court News &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Christie Nominee for Supreme Court Turned Down by Senate Panel &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Chris Christie&#8217;s nominees to the New Jersey (STONJ1) Supreme
Court became the first in modern times to be rejected by state
lawmakers following a Democrat-controlled confirmation hearing
the Republican governor called a &#8220;partisan circus.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillip Kwon&#8217;s nomination to one of two court vacancies was
rebuffed in a 7-6 vote, largely along party lines, after
Democrats questioned a $160,000 settlement of U.S. government
allegations that family members sought to avoid financial
reporting requirements tied to their business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats, who control the Legislature, have vowed to fight
harder against the governor, who they say has bullied them to
get his way. Midway through his first term, the two sides are at
odds over tax-cut plans. A court on March 8 overruled Christie&#8217;s
abolition of a housing agency, and 27 groups filed a legal
appeal yesterday of his policy to waive environmental
regulations in some cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To see what Phil went through today is frankly not only a
disappointment for me personally but also a disappointment for
the state, the process and the judicial system,&#8221; Christie said
following the vote. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t act like officeholders or
statesmen. They acted like politicians, and that&#8217;s what the
people hate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christie told reporters he didn&#8217;t have a backup for Kwon,
who would have been the court&#8217;s first Asian-American justice.
The governor said he didn&#8217;t anticipate changing his criteria for
judicial candidates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kwon&#8217;s rejection was the first time a nominee for the high
court was turned down by the Senate Judiciary Committee since
the modern Constitution of 1947, according to Winnie Comfort, a
spokeswoman for the New Jersey courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the hearing centered on the Justice Department
settlement with Kwon&#8217;s mother and wife, who own a liquor store
in Mount Vernon, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors filed complaints related to two bank
accounts in June 2011 and seized $290,236, asserting the
business illegally &#8220;structured&#8221; 222 cash deposits to avoid
breaching a $10,000 threshold that triggers currency transaction
filing requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business, KCP Wines  Liquor Corp., settled with the
U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in Brooklyn, New York, forfeiting
$159,630 without admitting wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the hearing, Kwon said he advised his mother that
structuring the deposits might raise &#8220;red flags&#8221; with the
banks involved. He said his subsequent involvement was confined
to helping her obtain a lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My mother was not evading taxes,&#8221; Kwon said. &#8220;She made
a mistake.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats on the committee said Kwon should have advised
his mother of the reporting requirements and told her to make
larger deposits. Christie has defended his choice of Kwon,
saying in January that the lawsuit didn&#8217;t involve him &#8220;in the
least.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asia gasoil refining profits headed
for their first decline in four weeks, and losses from making
fuel oil widened. A trading unit of JPMorgan Chase  Co. bought
gasoil in Singapore for the first time in two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Middle Distillates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. bought 150,000 barrels of
gasoil with 0.5 percent sulfur from Hin Leong Trading Pte at a
discount of 25 cents to benchmark prices of the grade, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of traders who monitored transactions
on the Platts window. The cargo was for loading April 18 to
April 22. JP Morgan Ventures previously bought a gasoil cargo on
March 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gasoil crack, or its premium to Dubai crude, fell 55
cents, or 3.5 percent, to $15.05 a barrel at 6:10 p.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
This crack spread is at the lowest since March 7 and has fallen
7.7 percent this week, the biggest weekly decline since Feb. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jet fuel&#8217;s premium to gasoil was at 20 cents a barrel, down
from 38 cents a week earlier. A narrower regrade indicates it is
less profitable to make aviation fuel over diesel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fuel Oil &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips sold 20,000 metric tons of 380-centistoke (N6SHS380)
fuel oil for loading April 18 to April 22 to China International
United Petroleum  Chemical Co., the survey showed. The Chinese
trader, also known as Unipec, paid a premium of $1.50 a ton over
benchmark prices of the grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. sold 20,000 tons of 380-centistoke grade
loading April 12 to April 16 to Hin Leong at a premium of $2 a
ton to average prices published by Platts in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuel oil&#8217;s discount to Dubai crude widened to $6.38 a
barrel from $6.17 yesterday. The spread, a measure of losses for
refiners turning oil into residual products, has widened 14
percent this week, retracing some of last week&#8217;s gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the viscosity spread, was at $11.25 a ton, widening
from $11 a week earlier, PVM data showed. This means bunker, or
marine fuel, rose less than higher-quality fuel oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Light Distillates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naphtha&#8217;s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
to $123.19 a ton at 6:17 p.m. Singapore time from $120.26
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack
spread has gained 13 percent this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitol bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON (MOGFC92S) gasoline loading
April 7 to April 11 from Gunvor Group Ltd. at $133.60 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Refinery News &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cosmo Oil Co. is preparing to start the No. 2 crude-
distillation unit at its refinery in Chiba, according to a
statement on the company&#8217;s website today. Production will resume
at the 120,000 barrel-a-day unit after safety approvals by
prefectural officials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emilio Azcarraga, chairman of
Mexican broadcaster Grupo Televisa SAB, urged billionaire Carlos Slim to stop what he said were actions to block competition in
the country&#8217;s telecommunications market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa won&#8217;t oppose the Mexican government&#8217;s plans to
create a new TV network to increase competition in the
broadcasting industry, Azcarraga said in an opinion column
published yesterday on the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s website.
Azcarraga&#8217;s company also is willing to offer concessions to the
nation&#8217;s antitrust agency to win approval for its planned entry
in the mobile-phone market, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico loses 2.2 percent of its gross domestic product
annually from high mobile-phone prices and low Internet use,
Azcarraga said, citing a study by the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development. Slim has tried to block competition
in telecommunications and has used legal tactics to delay
regulators, Azcarraga said, without providing examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mexico is changing for the better. Televisa is too,&#8221;
Azcarraga said. &#8220;So should someone with the vision, the talent
and the clout of Carlos Slim.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arturo Elias, Slim&#8217;s spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately return
phone and e-mail messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim&#8217;s mobile-phone company, America Movil SAB (AMXL), has sought
legal orders of constitutional protection against decisions on
tariffs and interconnection rules by the nation&#8217;s phone
regulator. Telefonica SA (TEF) and Grupo Iusacell SA (CEL*) have used similar
tactics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s antitrust agency voted in January to block
Televisa&#8217;s $1.6 billion plan to take a 50 percent stake in
Iusacell, the third-largest mobile-phone carrier in Mexico,
after America Movil and Madrid-based Telefonica. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Broadcasting Alliance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency rejected the deal in part because it would have
created an alliance between Televisa and Ricardo Salinas, who
controls Iusacell and TV Azteca SAB, Televisa&#8217;s biggest
broadcasting rival. Such a partnership might encourage the
broadcasters to work together in the TV business, in which they
already attract almost all over-the-air viewers, the agency
concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is willing to create &#8220;firewalls&#8221; to address the
agency&#8217;s concern, Azcarraga said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in January, Mexico&#8217;s Federal Telecommunications
Commission decided against taking a vote on whether to go
forward with plans to grant new broadcast television licenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we may have seemed against this in the past,
Televisa does not oppose the creation of a third, fourth or even
fifth nationwide broadcast TV network,&#8221; Azcarraga said. &#8220;If
and when the Communications Commission announces the terms of an
auction for additional television frequencies, we will not
legally challenge it -- so long as the rules create a level
playing field for competition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon S. Corzine, MF Global Holding
Ltd. (MFGLQ)&#8217;s chief executive officer, gave &#8220;direct instructions&#8221; to
transfer $200 million from a customer fund account to meet an
overdraft in a brokerage account with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
according to a memo written by congressional investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edith O&#8217;Brien, a treasurer for the firm, said in an e-mail
quoted in the memo that the transfer was &#8220;Per JC&#8217;s direct
instructions,&#8221; according to a copy of the memo obtained by
Bloomberg News yesterday. The e-mail, dated Oct. 28, was sent
three days before the company collapsed, the memo says. The memo
does not indicate whether that phrase was the full text of the
e-mail or an excerpt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The account could have contained both client and company
funds, the memo notes. Whether the transferred funds were those
of the company, its clients or both is not known. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If client funds were transferred at his direction, it
raises new questions,&#8221; Seth Berenzweig, managing partner at
Berenzweig Leonard LLP, a law firm in McLean, Virginia, said in
an interview with Bloomberg Television. &#8220;This is a new storm
cloud that is now headed for Jon Corzine and it raises a lot of
issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s internal e-mail was sent as the New York-based
broker found intraday credit lines limited by JPMorgan, the
firm&#8217;s clearing bank as well as one of its custodian banks for
segregated customer funds, according to the memo, which was
prepared for a March 28 House Financial Services subcommittee
hearing on the firm&#8217;s collapse. O&#8217;Brien is scheduled to testify
at the hearing after being subpoenaed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Funds Were Safe&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the course of that week, MF Global (MFGLQ)&#8217;s financial
position deteriorated, but the firm represented to its
regulators and self-regulatory organizations that its customers&#8217;
segregated funds were safe,&#8221; said the memo, written by
Financial Services Committee staff and sent to lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Goldberg, a spokesman for Corzine, said in a
statement that Corzine &#8220;never gave any instruction to misuse
customer funds and never intended anyone at MF Global to misuse
customer funds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinay Mahajan, global treasurer of MF Global Holdings,
wrote an e-mail on Oct. 28 that JPMorgan was &#8220;holding up vital
business in the U.S. as a result&#8221; of the overdrawn account in
London, which had to be &#8220;fully funded ASAP,&#8221; according to the
memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$200 Million Transfer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the afternoon of Friday, October 28, MF Global
transferred $200 million from a segregated customer account at
JPMC to cover a $175 million overdraft in one of MF Global&#8217;s
JPMC accounts in London,&#8221; the memo says. &#8220;Ms. O&#8217;Brien wrote in
an e-mail that the transfer was &#8216;Per JC&#8217;s [Jon Corzine&#8217;s] direct
instructions&#8217;.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barry Zubrow, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief risk officer, called Corzine
to seek assurances that the funds belonged to MF Global and not
customers. JPMorgan drafted a letter to be signed by O&#8217;Brien to
ensure that MF Global was complying with rules requiring
customers&#8217; collateral to be segregated. The letter was not
returned to JPMorgan, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine, 65, in testimony in front of the House panel in
December, said he did not order any improper transfer of
customer funds. Corzine also testified that he never intended a
misuse of customer funds at MF Global, and that he doesn&#8217;t know
where client funds went. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Never Intended&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I never gave any instruction to misuse customer funds, I
never intended anyone at MF Global to misuse customer funds and
I don&#8217;t believe that anything I said could reasonably have been
interpreted as an instruction to misuse customer funds,&#8221;
Corzine told lawmakers in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his statement, Goldberg said Corzine did not specify
which funds should be used to replenish the JPMorgan account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He never directed Ms. O&#8217;Brien or anyone else regarding
which account should be used to cure the overdrafts, and he
never directed that customer funds should be used for that
purpose,&#8221; Goldberg said. &#8220;Nor was he informed that customer
funds had been used for that purpose.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy trustee overseeing the liquidation of the
company&#8217;s brokerage subsidiary has estimated a $1.6 billion
shortfall between customer claims and assets available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers and investigators from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission and
Department of Justice have been reviewing events leading up to
MF Global&#8217;s bankruptcy filing. Executives including Corzine, a
Democrat who served in the Senate from 2001 to 2006 and as
governor of New Jersey from 2006 to 2010, gave testimony on the
collapse at three congressional hearings last year. Corzine was
co-chairman of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) before entering
politics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Congressional Report &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican and
chairman of the Financial Services oversight and investigations
subcommittee, is preparing a final report on his investigation
into the firm&#8217;s failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the goals of our investigation is not only to find
out where the money went but to identify what went wrong in
order to prevent this from happening again,&#8221; Neugebauer said in
a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Brien is scheduled to appear before lawmakers with
Christine Serwinski and Laurie Ferber, two other MF Global
executives named by Corzine as being involved in the
transaction, according to the memo. Henri Steenkamp , the firm&#8217;s
chief financial officer, is also scheduled to testify, as is a
representative from JPMorgan who has not yet been identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;European Bet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global and its brokerage sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy
after a $6.3 billion bet on the bonds of some of Europe&#8217;s most
indebted nations prompted regulator concerns and a credit rating
downgrade. Corzine quit MF Global Nov. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his testimony, Corzine identified O&#8217;Brien as someone
with knowledge of a transfer of funds from customer accounts
before the firm sought bankruptcy protection Oct. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reid H. Weingarten, O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s lawyer, did not respond to a
phone call and e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo&#8217;s account of the e-mail exchanges aligns with what
Terrence Duffy, the executive chairman at CME Group Inc. (CME), told
lawmakers during a December congressional hearing. Auditors at
CME, which had authority to oversee MF Global, learned from an
employee of the brokerage that Corzine knew about the loans
involving a European affiliate, Duffy told committee members. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesco Plc (TSCO), Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and Asda,
the U.K. supermarket chain owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), have
pledged to cut portions and reformulate products as part of a
U.K. government drive to curb obesity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle SA (NESN), the world&#8217;s biggest food company, and Premier
Foods Plc (PFD), owner of the Hovis bread and Bisto gravy brands, are
also among the 17 companies committing to reduce calories, the
U.K. Department of Health said in a press release today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This pledge is just the start of what must be a bigger,
broader commitment from the food industry,&#8221; Health Secretary
Andrew Lansley said in the statement. &#8220;Eating and drinking too
many calories is at the heart of the nation&#8217;s obesity problem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Great Britain will invest 15 million pounds ($24
million) by 2014 to reformulate some of its soft drinks and cut
the average number of calories per liter by at least 30 percent,
the company said today in a press release on its website. It
will also increase the marketing budget for its Diet Coke and
Coca-Cola Zero products by 25 percent, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 60 percent of adults and a third of 10 and 11
year olds are overweight or obese in England, the Department of
Health said in the statement.&#160;The plan is designed to reduce
consumption by 5 billion calories a day by reformulating
products, reviewing portion sizes, educating consumers and
boosting marketing of lower calorie options, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Encouraging Start&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a very encouraging start,&#8221; Dr. Susan Jebb,
Cambridge, England-based head of diet and population health at
the government-funded Centre for Diet and Activity Research,
said in a statement. &#8220;I am impatient to make progress. I know
some other companies are already developing their plans, but we
need everyone, all companies -- from all sectors and all sizes -
- to step up and act for the good of the nation&#8217;s health.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. policy makers are also seeking to reduce an obesity
rate that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says
has more than doubled since 1980 to 72 million people. The
administration said Jan. 25 that school lunch counters will
start replacing breaded patties and canned fruit with fresh
tomatoes and chef salad while Michelle Obama has enlisted
companies including Wal-Mart to fight childhood obesity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K.-based Premier Foods will reduce calories across one-
third of its portfolio by 2014 and provide consumers with lower
calorie choices in at least 30 percent of the company&#8217;s new
products as part of the initiative, it said in a statement on
its website today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Premier Foods calorie plans will focus on the company&#8217;s
power brands including Ambrosia, Batchelors, Hovis, Loyd
Grossman, Mr. Kipling and Sharwood&#8217;s,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marks  Spencer Group Plc (MKS), WM Morrisons Plc, J Sainsbury
Plc (SBRY), Waitrose Ltd., Kerry Foods Ltd., Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT), Mars
Inc. (MMC), PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), Unilever NV (UNA), Whitbread Plc (WTB)&#8217;s unit Beefeater,
Subway Restaurants and Compass Group Plc (CPG) have also signed the
initiative, according to the Department of Health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) won&#8217;t be expelled
from Brazil for two offshore oil spills, O Estado de Sao Paulo
reported, citing an interview with Mines and Energy Minister
Edison Lobao. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the national oil regulator, or ANP, is convinced
Chevron was negligent, neither of the two spills were large
enough to justify expelling the company, Lobao told the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has said, following a leak at its offshore Frade
project in November and a second seep this month, that it acted
correctly and there was no negligence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) General
Counsel Laurie Ferber twice resisted providing assurances to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) that the broker was complying with rules to
segregate customers&#8217; collateral, saying language in a draft
provided by the bank was too broad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferber said JPMorgan was &#8220;specifically interested in two
transfers&#8221; that occurred the morning of Oct. 28. The first was
a $200 million transfer from a segregated customer funds account
at MF Global Inc., the firm&#8217;s brokerage, to a &#8220;house&#8221; account,
followed by a second transfer of $175 million from the house
account to a London subsidiary&#8217;s account at JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although I had no reason to believe that any non-
compliant transfers from segregated accounts had occurred or
would occur, I did not think that any individual officer or
employee should be asked to issue such a broad certificate,&#8221;
Ferber said in testimony prepared for a March 28 House Financial
Services subcommittee hearing. Any employee making such an
assurance, she said, would have had to personally handle all the
transfers or been able to review all the transactions within the
available timeframe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican who
leads the Financial Services investigations subcommittee, will
hold a third hearing on the bankruptcy that left a customer
funds shortfall estimated at $1.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treasurer to Testify &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those set to testify this week is Edith O&#8217;Brien, an
MF Global (MFGLQ) executive based in Chicago and identified by former
Chief Executive Officer Jon S. Corzine as having knowledge of
transfers of funds from customer accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferber&#8217;s testimony addresses transfers that have come under
question in the wake of a Financial Services panel staff memo
circulated to lawmakers last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the afternoon of Friday, October 28, MF Global
transferred $200 million from a segregated customer account at
JPMC to cover a $175 million overdraft in one of MF Global&#8217;s
JPMC accounts in London,&#8221; the five-page staff memo says. &#8220;Ms.
O&#8217;Brien wrote in an e-mail that the transfer was &#8216;Per JC&#8217;s [Jon
Corzine&#8217;s] direct instructions&#8217;.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barry Zubrow, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief risk officer, called Corzine
to seek assurances that the funds belonged to MF Global and not
customers. JPMorgan drafted a letter to be signed by O&#8217;Brien to
ensure that MF Global was complying with the rules, the memo
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her testimony, Ferber said she spoke to officials at the
bank on Oct. 28 and requested they narrow the language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Letter Unsigned &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I then spoke to the person in Chicago whom JPMorgan
identified in the certificate and was given the understanding
that she would sign the certificate if it were limited to the
two transactions the bank had expressed interest in,&#8221; Ferber
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferber does not identify the individual in Chicago. Ferber
conferred a second time with JPMorgan, which complied with the
request and provided a new draft the next day with narrower
language. Ferber said she turned the revised draft over to a
colleague and was not involved in discussions after that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter to JPMorgan was never signed, according to the
House memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global and its brokerage sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy on
Oct. 31 after a $6.3 billion bet on the bonds of some of
Europe&#8217;s most indebted nations prompted regulator concerns and a
credit rating downgrade. Corzine quit MF Global Nov. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Corzine, Steven Goldberg, said last week
that the former MF Global chief &#8220;never gave any instruction to
misuse customer funds and never intended anyone at MF Global to
misuse customer funds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Never Intended&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine, in testimony before the House panel in
December,said he didn&#8217;t order any improper transfer of customer
funds. He also testified that he never intended a misuse of
customer funds at MF Global, and that he doesn&#8217;t know where
client funds went. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I never gave any instruction to misuse customer funds, I
never intended anyone at MF Global to misuse customer funds and
I don&#8217;t believe that anything I said could reasonably have been
interpreted as an instruction to misuse customer funds,&#8221;
Corzine told lawmakers in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Brien is scheduled to appear before lawmakers with
Christine Serwinski, another MF Global executive, and Henri Steenkamp, the firm&#8217;s chief financial officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steenkamp, in his testimony, said he had &#8220;limited
knowledge&#8221; of the movement of segregated customer funds in the
final days before the firm&#8217;s failure. Steenkamp said he
understood that lawmakers would have questions this week about
the missing funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I share many of these questions and I am personally
extremely frustrated and distressed that they remain outstanding
and the client funds have not been paid in full,&#8221; Steenkamp
said in his prepared remarks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day By Day, a Paris-based research
company with 80 clients, gave the best trading recommendations
on European equities over the past three years, trumping Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), according to a
report by AQ Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study by London-based AQ measured which firms gave the
most accurate forecast on stock movements. Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS) and Credit Suisse took second and third
place, respectively, while Goldman Sachs took the eighth spot in
the rankings, which were released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valerie Gastaldy, a technical strategist and partner at Day
By Day who studies charts of trading patterns to predict price
changes, decides which stocks and industries to favor. A team of
five analysts assist her. She said that cutting losses early is
a central part of her strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If a stock loses 15 percent, for example, I stop my
buy,&#8221; Gastaldy said in an interview. &#8220;I&#8217;ll say &#8216;wait a minute,
I was wrong,&#8217; and that makes an enormous difference. Last March,
I had a buy on banks and by May, I didn&#8217;t have a single one even
though fundamental analysts still had a lot.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx 600 Banks Index (SX7P) fell 5.3 percent from the start
of March 2011 to the beginning of May, before tumbling a further
43 percent though Nov. 23 amid concern the euro-region debt
crisis was spreading from Greece to the larger economies of
Italy and Spain, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Best Advice&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AQ said it scored the success of each trading
recommendation and compiled an average over the past three
years. Research houses that gave absolute recommendations were
measured on the basis of a share-price change, while companies
that gave relative suggestions were graded on the price movement
compared with an underlying index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a view of who gave the best advice over a tough time
in the equity research world,&#8221; William Russell-Smith, managing
director at AQ Research, said in an interview. &#8220;The result is
based on having the highest scores and being the most
consistent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gastaldy, 47, was born in Monaco and earned an MBA from the
Essec business school in a suburb of Paris. She said she learned
technical analysis about 25 years ago while working as a market
maker at Meeschaert-Rousselle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her manager agreed to give a technical analysis course for
executives at Dauphine University, and wanted someone to split
the hours with him. Gastaldy studied the technique to teach the
classes and found that it worked better than fundamental
analysis, where investors look at metrics such as price-to-
earnings ratios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Futures Products &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She later managed futures products for private clients at
Tuffier Ravier Py. After taking nine years off to raise her
three children, she joined Day By Day in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gastaldy said she has a &#8220;top down&#8221; strategy, looking
first at the market, then the industries and finally at specific
stocks. She analyzes the economic cycle using data from the
Tempe, Arizona-based Institute for Supply Management and studies
market sentiment by looking at how prices evolve versus implied
volatility. Once she determines how enthusiastic investors are
about taking on risk, she decides which industries to favor and
which to avoid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When aversion to risk is about fear of a hard landing in
China, like today, then it&#8217;s best to be cautious about
automakers or basic-materials stocks,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Specific Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the selection of specific shares, Gastaldy buys stocks
with the highest relative strength within their industry, and
sells those with the lowest score on this measure. Relative
strength gauges a stock price compared with the average of other
shares in the industry group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although her equity picks sometimes can mirror those of
fundamental analysts, she said her views often deviate in the
cases of stocks that face takeover speculation, such as Hermes
International SCA. (RMS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Hermes&#8217;s family owners created a new holding
company after LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, the world&#8217;s
largest maker of luxury goods, built up a 22 percent stake. The
new capital structure should limit speculation of a takeover,
according to HSBC Holdings Plc analysts. Gastaldy started a buy
recommendation on Hermes earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fundamental analysts say it&#8217;s too expensive so won&#8217;t buy
it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I look at the relative strength and if the
momentum is favorable, I&#8217;ll buy it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gastaldy also recommends buying banks and has a buy rating
on Paris-based Societe Generale SA, Barclays Plc and Banco
Santander SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I will try to play financials longer than usual, so for a
few months,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I hope I can do it. If the market
tells me I&#8217;m wrong though, I won&#8217;t push it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. (T) plans to start selling a
Nokia Oyj smartphone with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) software for half of
what it charges for the iPhone, as the device&#8217;s makers seek to
break Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s dominance of the U.S. market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lumia 900, which runs on ATT&#8217;s network using faster,
so-called long-term-evolution technology, will start selling for
$99.99 on April 8, the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier said
today in a statement. The latest iPhone and newest handsets
running Google&#8217;s Android software typically start at $199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia is counting on Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone software to
reignite sales in the U.S., where the iPhone, Android makers
such as Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)&#8217;s
BlackBerry control 92 percent of the market. Microsoft is trying
to increase its share of the mobile software market to expand
beyond the slower-growing personal-computer market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The pricing is aggressive,&#8221; said Avi Greengart, an
analyst at research firm Current Analysis in Teaneck, New
Jersey. &#8220;They are hoping to use price to get people to buy a
product with an operating system they aren&#8217;t familiar with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the $99.99 price, customers need to sign up to a
two-year contract with ATT. The Dallas-based carrier will also
sell the phone without a contract for $449.99, said Steven
Schwadron, an ATT spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those price points suggest that ATT is subsidizing each
Lumia by about $350. That compares with a $450 subsidy for the
the cheapest version iPhone 4S, which sells for $199 with a
contract and $649 without one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Must Win &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop, a former
Microsoft executive, started rebuilding the Espoo, Finland-based
company&#8217;s smartphone strategy around the Windows Phone operating
system last year. Nokia had previously focused on its own MeeGo
and Symbian operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia and Microsoft have said they are willing to spend
money to fuel sales. Microsoft said last year it would pay Nokia
$1 billion to develop and promote Windows phones. Elop said in
October that marketing spending on the Lumia series would be
triple the money spent on previous product sales promotions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose 1.8 percent
to $32.59 at the close in New York. Nokia advanced 0.4 percent
at 3.99 euros in Helsinki. ATT added 0.9 percent to $31.79. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lumia 900 has a 4.3-inch (11-centimeter) screen, larger
than that of the iPhone, and an 8-megapixel camera. Customers
can order it online starting March 30, ATT said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest

million online users after a weekend upgrade caused problems
with its consumer website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Customers have not been able to access Chase.com at times

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. credit
traders Matthew Knopman and Philip Ha are leaving for hedge
funds after the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets cut jobs and
pay last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knopman will start at Anchorage Capital Group LLC on May 1,
according to three people familiar with the move, who declined
to be identified because it hasn&#8217;t been announced. Ha will join
MKP Capital Management LLC in New York, another person said.
Knopman and Ha are among at least four credit traders who have
left the New York-based bank for hedge funds since November. Rob Jackson joined Cyrus Capital Partners LP in February, two people
said, and Tim Reilly departed last month, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs cut compensation 21 percent last year as
revenue slid 26 percent, led by a 34 percent drop in revenue
from trading fixed-income, currencies and commodities, the
company reported in January. About 50 Goldman Sachs (GS) partners,
the most senior rank, left the company in the 12 months through
January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonuses for fixed-income traders across Wall Street were
cut by an average of 35 percent to 45 percent, according to Alan Johnson, president and founder of compensation consulting
company Johnson Associates Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knopman and Jackson declined to comment and Ha and Reilly
couldn&#8217;t be reached. Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for
Anchorage, Konstantin Shishkin, a spokesman for MKP, and Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, said they couldn&#8217;t
comment on the moves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) doesn&#8217;t have
to pay a trader 580,000 pounds ($921,000) after a missing
decimal point in an employment contract led him to believe his
salary would be 10 times what was offered, a London court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kai Herbert, a Switzerland-based currency trader, sued
JPMorgan for lost earnings claiming he signed a contract to
relocate to Johannesburg for a salary of 24 million rand ($3.1
million). JPMorgan said there was a typographical error and the
figure should have been 2.4 million rand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Herbert took the commercial risk of accepting the offer,
knowing full well that the figure was an error,&#8221; Judge Henry
Globe said in today&#8217;s judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trader resigned from UBS AG (UBSN) in June 2010 following the
offer from New York-based JPMorgan to relocate to South Africa.
Herbert didn&#8217;t report for work after discovering the discrepancy
and JPMorgan rescinded the employment offer in December 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herbert has been unemployed since, other than eight months
at Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), where he was fired in a round of job
cuts in November. Banks globally have cut about 196,000 jobs
since the start of 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Eyes Wide Open&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Herbert, with his eyes wide open, took a chance and it
has not worked out for him,&#8221; Charles Ciumei, a lawyer for
JPMorgan, said in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herbert originally sought more than 2 million pounds, Globe
said. That figure subsequently fell to just over 1 million
pounds and finally to 580,000 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has been gross exaggeration in relation to the
claim,&#8221; Globe said and ordered that Herbert pay costs of 85,000
pounds within 28 days. Herbert wasn&#8217;t present for the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Haywood, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to
comment. Dale Langley, Herbert&#8217;s lawyer, wasn&#8217;t immediately
available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Herbert v. JPMorgan, High Court of Justice
Queen&#8217;s Bench Division, No. HQ11X02595. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon S. Corzine, MF Global Holding
Ltd.&#8217;s former chief executive officer, may face potential legal
liability if investigators show he knew customer money might be
used when he ordered $200 million transferred to a U.K. account
as his brokerage neared collapse, Bloomberg News&#8217; Linda Sandler
and Phil Mattingly report that former prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. co-chairman gave &#8220;direct
instructions&#8221; to move money from a U.S. account to meet an
overdraft with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) just days before MF Global&#8217;s
bankruptcy, according to a memo by congressional investigators.
Such accounts may have contained assets belonging to both
customers and MF Global. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice and federal regulators are
investigating the firm&#8217;s Oct. 31 collapse. Corzine, a Democrat
from New Jersey who served in the U.S. Senate and as governor,
told Congress last year he never directed customer funds be used
improperly. Though showing he deliberately used customer money
would be the key to a criminal case, former prosecutors said
Corzine, who hasn&#8217;t been charged with any wrongdoing, could be
deemed liable in civil cases for misuse of customer money simply
for ordering the hole in JPMorgan&#8217;s account plugged, if it turns
out customer funds were used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not whether he specified,&#8221; John Moscow, a former
chief prosecutor in the office of Manhattan District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau, said yesterday in an interview. &#8220;The
economics of the situation were he was out of money. The bottom
line is, he was taking a risk with somebody else&#8217;s money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a casino, said Moscow, now with Baker Hostetler LLP in
New York, &#8220;if I put your money on the table, I&#8217;ve committed
larceny as soon as I expose it to risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Levander, a lawyer for Corzine, didn&#8217;t return a call
or e-mail after normal business hours seeking comment on the
probe. A congressional hearing on the issue is set for this
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global and its brokerage sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in New York after a $6.3 billion bet on the bonds of
some of Europe&#8217;s most indebted nations prompted regulator
concerns and a credit-rating downgrade. Corzine, 65, quit MF
Global Nov. 4. The bankruptcy trustee overseeing the liquidation
of the company&#8217;s brokerage subsidiary has estimated a $1.6
billion shortfall between customer claims and assets available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edith O&#8217;Brien, a treasurer for New York-based MF Global,
said in an e-mail quoted in the Congressional memo that the $200
million transfer was &#8220;Per JC&#8217;s direct instructions,&#8221; according
to a copy of the memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The e-mail, dated Oct. 28, was sent three days before the
company collapsed, according to the document. The account may
have contained both client and company funds, the memo states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp.
v. MF Global Inc., 11-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York; The parent&#8217;s bankruptcy case is MF Global
Holdings Ltd., 11-bk-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits/Pre-Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s &#8216;Fabulous Fab&#8217; in Rwanda While Awaiting Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive
director who called himself &#8220;fabulous Fab,&#8221; has done volunteer
work in Rwanda and started a U.S. doctorate program while
awaiting trial in a government fraud suit his bank settled for
$550 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a 2010
complaint that Goldman Sachs and Tourre, 33, who is on unpaid
leave, defrauded investors in a collateralized debt obligation
known as Abacus 2007-AC1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator identified Tourre as a &#8220;resident of Kigali,
Rwanda,&#8221; in court papers filed March 21 in Manhattan federal
court. Tourre had been in the African nation&#8217;s capital working
for a non-governmental organization before beginning his studies
at the University of Chicago, according to a person familiar
with his travels who declined to be identified because the
matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tourre is a U.S. resident studying for a Ph.D. in
economics at the University of Chicago,&#8221; his lawyer, Pamela
Rogers Chepiga, said in a statement March 21. Steve Koppes, a
university spokesman, said Tourre has been enrolled in the
program since September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC alleged the Goldman Sachs executive director didn&#8217;t
disclose that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
securities underlying the Abacus CDO with the intention of
betting against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Goldman Sachs agreed in July 2010 to pay
$550 million, the largest penalty ever assessed by the agency
against a Wall Street firm, to settle allegations against it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre remains a defendant in the case. U.S. District Judge
Barbara Jones in Manhattan last year narrowed some of the claims
against him while allowing the case to go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference to Kigali came in papers filed by the SEC
seeking to question Jorg Zimmerman, a former employee of IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB) in Germany. The SEC claimed Tourre
spoke with Zimmerman to encourage his bank to invest in the
securities. Tourre has denied any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wells Fargo Should Be Forced to Comply With Subpoenas, SEC Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. failed to hand over documents demanded in
U.S. subpoenas and should be forced to cooperate with a probe
into its sale of almost $60 billion in residential mortgage-
backed securities, regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal
judge to compel the bank, the largest U.S. home lender, to
deliver documents it agreed to produce under subpoenas dating
from September, the agency said March 23 in a statement. The SEC
said it&#8217;s looking into possible fraud by the San Francisco-based
company and hasn&#8217;t concluded that anyone broke the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost four years after mounting mortgage defaults prompted
unprecedented government bailouts of the financial system,
regulators are still examining how banks packaged and sold home
loans to investors. The SEC is looking for evidence that firms
failed to disclose underlying credit weaknesses in mortgage
pools and delinquencies, and has also told Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. that they may face civil claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency&#8217;s request, if granted, would give Wells Fargo 14
days to hand over 1,365 e-mails and attachments it has withheld
from the SEC, according to a court filing. The bank said in a
statement that enforcement action is unwarranted and that it
will defend itself in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The watchdog is examining whether Wells Fargo
misrepresented or omitted facts in offerings from September 2006
to early 2008, according to the statement. While the bank
reviewed a sampling of loans and excluded those that failed to
meet its standards, Wells Fargo may not have taken steps to
address flaws in the remainder of the pool, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators are seeking information on the bank&#8217;s
underwriting guidelines and on due diligence, according to the
statement. The agency filed its request in federal court in San
Francisco. Marc Fagel, the head of the SEC&#8217;s office in that
city, declined to comment on the request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wells Fargo believes the subpoena enforcement action is
inappropriate and unwarranted and will vigorously defend itself
in court,&#8221; Mary Eshet, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in an e-
mailed statement. The bank has cooperated with the agency and
believed it had an understanding on the requested documents,
which was violated by the March 23 filing, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Wells
Fargo  Co., 12-80087, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CBOE, McGraw Hill Ask Court to Enforce ISE Option Trade Ban &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) and McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP) asked an Illinois
court to enforce a 2010 order barring International Securities
Exchange LLC from providing a forum for trading of SP 500-based
options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge William O. Maki in Chicago barred ISE from featuring
the listings in July 2010, ruling that the CBOE-owned Chicago
Board Options Exchange holds an exclusive license to offer
options based on the SP 500. The index is a licensed product of
McGraw-Hill&#8217;s Standard  Poor&#8217;s Financial Services LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISE on March 13 announced plans to list options for the Max
SPY index, which it called &#8220;a new proprietary index that
represents 10 times the value&#8221; of the exchange-traded fund
based on the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ISE&#8217;s options actually are structured to be options on
the SP 500,&#8221; McGraw-Hill and CBOE said in a statement March 23
announcing the court filing. &#8220;CBOE and SP brought this action
in order prevent this violation of both CBOE&#8217;s license rights in
SP 500 index options and SP&#8217;s proprietary rights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their court papers, CBOE and McGraw-Hill said they want
the court to issue an order barring ISE from violating the
previous injunction or declare that it would violate that
injunction for ISE to list or provide an exchange market for the
trading of the options or cause the Options Clearing Corporation
to settle them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly McGregor, a spokeswoman for New York-based ISE, said
the company doesn&#8217;t comment on pending litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injunction request was assigned to Cook County Judge
Franklin Valderrama. Lawyers for the CBOE and McGraw-Hill on
April 5 will ask for the matter to be transferred back to Maki,
according to court papers they provided to Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chicago Board Options Exchange Inc. v.
International Securities Exchange LLC, 06CH24798, Cook County,
Illinois, Circuit Court, Chancery Division (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Depfa, Pisa Swaps Feud Needs Trial in Italy and U.K., Judge Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A London judge ruled that a dispute between Depfa Bank PLC, (DEP)
Dexia SA and the Italian province of Pisa over a swaps deal
needs separate trials in Italy and the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the banks had asked the judge to refer the case to a
European Court for a final ruling on jurisdiction, Judge Nigel
Teare refused the request, saying proceedings in the two
countries were different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is one of several being fought over derivatives
used to hedge interest rates sold to European regional
governments by investment banks that turned out to be far more
costly than predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexia and Depfa filed a lawsuit in London in 2009 seeking a
ruling that the swaps are valid. Pisa wants an Italian court to
approve its decision to annul them, according to Teare&#8217;s
judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proceedings are different and the administrative
matters must be heard in Italy,&#8221; Pisa lawyer Germana Lo Iacono-
Smith said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benoit Gausseron at Dexia in Paris didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to a phone call requesting comment. A call to the press
room of Hypo Real Estate Holding AG, Depfa&#8217;s parent company,
wasn&#8217;t answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-NBA Player Tate George Indicted in $2 Million Ponzi Scam &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tate George, a former player for the National Basketball
Association&#8217;s New Jersey Nets and Milwaukee Bucks, was indicted
on charges of running a $2 million Ponzi scheme that targeted
ex-professional athletes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George, 43, raised more than $2 million for his company,
the George Group, after telling investors his real-estate
development portfolio was worth $500 million, according to a
four-count wire-fraud indictment in federal court in Newark, New
Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George, a Newark resident, told prospective investors that
their money would fund the George Group&#8217;s development of real
estate projects in New Jersey and Connecticut, prosecutors
charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Instead of using investments to fund real estate
development projects as promised, George used the money from new
investors to pay existing investors in Ponzi scheme fashion,&#8221;
U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George faces as many as 20 years in prison on each count.
His attorney, Thomas Ashley, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call
seeking comment on the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George was arrested last September on a Federal Bureau of
Investigation complaint charging him with one count of wire
fraud. He was released on $250,000 bail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his arrest, Ashley said: &#8220;He maintains his innocence
and will plead not guilty. All these charges are clearly
defensible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. George, 11-mag-03197, U.S. District
Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deloitte  Touche Sued in New York Over WG Trading Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte  Touche LLP, one of the so-called Big Four
accounting firms, was sued by a pension fund over WG Trading
Co., the company allegedly used in a Ponzi scheme by former
managers Paul Greenwood and Steven Walsh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Iowa Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System suffered
millions of dollars in losses as a result of the scheme,
according to the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in
New York March 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte  Touche served as the auditor of a company
controlled by the operators of the scheme and &#8220;aided and
abetted&#8221; it by issuing &#8220;unqualified and/or &#8216;clean&#8217;&#8221; audit
reports that the pension fund relied on while purchasing
securities that were issued as part of the scheme, according to
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte &#8220;acted in willful blindness of the scheme, and
its auditing practices were so deficient that the audits
amounted to no audit at all, or an egregious refusal to see the
obvious, or investigate the doubtful, and the professional
judgments which it made were such that no reasonable auditor
would have made the same decisions if confronted with the same
facts,&#8221; lawyers for the pension fund said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claims are &#8220;ill conceived&#8221; and without merit,
Jonathan Gandal, a spokesman for Deloitte LLP, said in an e-
mail. Deloitte  Touche, based in New York, is a subsidiary of
Deloitte LLP, the U.S. arm of U.K.-based Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu Ltd., according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Deloitte  Touche LLP did not audit the financial
statements of the Westridge entities at which the fraud
allegedly occurred,&#8221; Gandal said. &#8220;Rather, Deloitte audited
the financial statements of a separate entity, WG Trading
Company Limited Partnership, through 2007, and there is no
information which calls into question either the correctness of
those financial statements or Deloitte&#8217;s full compliance with
professional standards.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any wrongdoing is &#8220;solely attributable&#8221; to the principals
of the Westridge entities, one of whom has already pleaded
guilty to related charges, Gandal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenwood and Walsh were indicted in July 2009 on charges
that they conspired to defraud investors of $554 million. The
U.S. said the scheme stretched from 1996 until the men were
arrested in February 2009. Greenwood pleaded guilty to six
charges, including conspiracy and securities fraud. Walsh has
pleaded not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Iowa Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System v.
Deloitte  Touche LLP, 12-cv-2136, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell Sued in U.K. Over &#8216;Massive&#8217; Oil Spills in Nigeria in 2008 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), Europe&#8217;s largest oil company, was
sued in Britain by 11,000 Nigerians who say their land, rivers
and forests were spoiled by two &#8220;massive&#8221; spills in the Niger
River delta in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed in London March 23 after talks
between Shell and residents of the coastal Bodo community failed
to produce a deal, the group&#8217;s law firm Leigh Day  Co. said in
a statement. While Shell admits liability for the leaks, it
claims local people spilled most of the oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We had thought that the invitation to sit around the
table meant that Shell was taking the impact of the two oil
spills seriously,&#8221; the lawyer for the Nigerians, Martyn Day,
said in the statement. &#8220;We are now left with the only option of
taking the claims through the U.K. courts to obtain justice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, which says 500,000 barrels of oil leaked,
comes two months after Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said
he would seek compensation from Shell, based in The Hague, for
another incident in which nearly 40,000 barrels spilled at the
Bonga field in the country&#8217;s worst offshore spill in more than a
decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before and after the two leaks, &#8220;there were a number of
other spills as the result of illegal theft of oil and sabotage
that resulted in significantly higher amounts of oil being
spilled,&#8221; Jonathan French, a Shell spokesman in London, said
March 23 in a phone interview. Local people have the &#8220;misguided
belief that more oil spilled equals more compensation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wells Fargo Sues Medical Development Over $30 Million Loan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
sued prison-service provider Medical Development International
Ltd. in Delaware Chancery Court seeking to recover $30 million
in loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo contends Medical Development of Ponte Vedra,
Florida, has been in default of the loans &#8220;for quite some
time,&#8221; and asks a judge to appoint a receiver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company and affiliates have &#8220;also engaged in a series
of self-dealing transactions including, among other things, so-
called &#8216;loans&#8217; to executives&#8221; for a &#8220;working farm,&#8221; a
biographical screenplay and payments for &#8220;a Tesla Roadster,&#8221;
lawyers for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said in court papers
filed March 23 in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical Development, with $55.3 million in assets and $74.9
million in liabilities as of Dec. 31, is headed by Chief
Executive Officer Richard Willich and provides medical
contracting, management and administration for federal prisons,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical Development lawyer Tracy Wenzel said officials are
going to review the case and had no immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wells Fargo Bank v. Medical Development
International Ltd., CA7352, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Sued by Currency Trader Over $3 Million Decimal Point &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. is being sued by a trader who says he
accepted a contract from the investment bank because a
typographical error made him believe he would be paid 10 times
what was actually offered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kai Herbert, a Switzerland-based currency trader, is suing
JPMorgan for about 580,000 pounds ($920,000), his lawyers said
at a trial in London this week. The original contract said
Herbert&#8217;s annual pay would be 24 million rand ($3.1 million).
JPMorgan blamed the mistake on a typographical error and said
the figure should have been 2.4 million rand, according to court
documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That must have been the moment your heart sank,&#8221; Judge
Henry Globe said at the trial this week, referring to when
Herbert discovered the mistake. Herbert resigned from UBS AG (UBSN) in
June 2010 following the offer from JPMorgan to relocate to
Johannesburg. Herbert didn&#8217;t report for work after discovering
the discrepancy and JPMorgan rescinded the employment offer in
December 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has been unemployed since, other than eight months at
Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) where he was fired in a round of layoffs
in November. Banks globally have cut about 196,000 jobs since
the start of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;How can you possibly suggest that they would pay you so
much money for an executive director level job?&#8221; Charles
Ciumei, a lawyer for JPMorgan, asked during Herbert&#8217;s cross-
examination. The bank said Herbert could have mitigated his lost
earnings by taking the position at the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Haywood, a spokeswoman at JPMorgan declined to
comment. Herbert&#8217;s lawyer, Dale Langley, declined to comment as
did JPMorgan lawyer Stefan Martin. &lt;/p&gt;

Queen&#8217;s Bench Division, No. HQ11X02595 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SP&#8217;s Model Was &#8216;Garbage In, Garbage Out,&#8217; Australia Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s ignored warnings that notes sold to
Australian towns didn&#8217;t deserve a AAA rating and used faulty
data to support its decision, a lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a simple case of GiGo - garbage in, garbage out,&#8221;
said Noel Hudley, lawyer for a dozen Australian towns seeking to
recoup investments that were wiped out when the notes&#8217; value
collapsed during the 2008 global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The towns claim they lost A$15 million ($15.6 million) of
A$16 million invested in the Community Income Constant
Proportion Debt Obligation Notes. They were unwound less than
two years after the towns bought them as credit spreads
increased and their cash value was exhausted, and the towns
accused SP of giving the notes the highest rating on pressure
from a bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An SP committee determining the rating on the notes had 31
results from tests run by analysts, with 68 percent of those
findings not supporting a AAA rating, Hudley said March 23, on
the first day of closing statements before Justice Jayne Jagot
in Federal Court in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ratings company didn&#8217;t follow procedures that are a
standard in the industry in developing the rating, Hudley said,
citing evidence given by experts during the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You are the wuss for bending over in front of bankers and
taking it,&#8221; Sebastian Venus, who had prepared an internal model
for the notes at SP, wrote to Derek Ding, an analyst
responsible for rating the note, according to e-mail transcripts
presented in court documents. &#8220;You rate something AAA, when
it&#8217;s really A-?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs cited &#8220;selectively&#8221; from the hundreds of
documents that were submitted, SP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those e-mail exchanges also evidence the fact that SP
did not simply rubber stamp ABN&#8217;s opinion,&#8221; the company said.
&#8220;Conflicting views are to be expected in the context of any
serious process of analysis and consideration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closing statements from the towns, LGFS, ABN Amro Bank
and SP are scheduled to take at least until March 30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lockheed Martin to Pay $15.9 Million for Mischarging U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT), the biggest U.S. defense contractor,
will pay $15.9 million to settle allegations it mischarged the
federal government for tools used on military aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement arose from a pricing fraud by a Lockheed
subcontractor that began 14 years ago, according to the Justice
Department. Lockheed Martin passed the excessive costs on to the
government in violation of the False Claims Act, the U.S. said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is troubling that a large defense contractor with
long-established contractual ties with the United States failed
to undertake appropriate measures to ensure the integrity and
validity of the costs it submitted to the United States,&#8221;
Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the
Justice Department&#8217;s civil division, said in the March 23
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement resolves two whistle-blower cases filed in
federal court in Dallas. The whistle-blowers will receive $2
million of the proceeds, according to the Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Stout, a spokesman for Bethesda, Maryland-based
Lockheed Martin, said the company cooperated with the
government&#8217;s investigation into its tool supplier that led to
the conviction of the subcontractor&#8217;s president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. ex rel. Becker v. Tools  Metals Inc.,

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, rose to its highest price in more than four years
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts said the company may go
beyond the divestiture plans it has already announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer climbed 1.5 percent to $22.50 at the close in New
York, the highest value since $22.55 in February 2008. The
shares have increased 8.3 percent since July 6, the day before
Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said the New York-based
company was exploring strategic alternatives for its animal
health and nutrition businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read, at a recent meeting with Goldman analysts, indicated
he may be willing to further split up the company after selling
or spinning off those two units, Jami Rubin, a Goldman analyst,
wrote in a note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see these moves as first steps in a potential full-
scale breakup,&#8221; akin to the split now taking place at Abbott
Laboratories (ABT), Rubin wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott, based in Abbott Park, Illinois, said Oct. 19 it
plans to divide into two publicly traded companies, with one
focused on drug development and the other on products including
medical devices, infant formula and generics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubin said a further breakup would be dependent on Pfizer&#8217;s
success in getting new, brand-name drugs approved by U.S.
regulators. &#8220;If the pipeline is successful and drives
meaningful top-line growth, management will want to separate the
businesses so investors can better value the pharma business,&#8221;
Rubin said in her note. She said that a breakup could happen by
2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Value Creation&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ultimately, our decisions will be driven by value
creation for the businesses and delivering the greatest after-
tax value for our shareholders over time,&#8221; Ray Kerins, a Pfizer
spokesman, wrote in an e-mailed response to questions about the
Goldman report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read previously said he intends to create more detailed
financial reports for the generic and brand-name products, to
help investors better understand the two units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of Pfizer&#8217;s $67.4 billion in 2011 revenue, $18.5 billion
fell under &#8220;established products&#8221; or &#8220;emerging markets.&#8221; The
animal health and infant nutrition units that Pfizer is
currently divesting had $6.32 billion in sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman report said Abbott&#8217;s share jump &#8220;will likely
pressure other CEOs to consider similar strategies if the sum of
the parts is greater than the whole,&#8221; Rubin said in the note.
&#8220;Our recent meeting with PFE&#8217;s CEO Ian Read suggests he is open
to all options to unlock shareholder value, including
considering going further in divesting non-core assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edson Spencer, who as head of
Honeywell Inc. first battled IBM&#8217;s dominance of the computer
market in the 1980s, then gave in and focused his company on
automation and aerospace technology, has died. He was 85. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He died on March 25 at his home in Wayzata, Minnesota,
after battling progressive supranuclear palsy, a
neurodegenerative brain disease, his daughter, Linda Spencer
Murchison, said today in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his 34-year career at Honeywell -- known as Honeywell
International Inc. (HON) since its acquisition in 1999 by AlliedSignal
Inc. -- Spencer rose from an aeronautical engineer to the
company&#8217;s chief executive officer from 1974 to 1987. Midway
through his tenure, Honeywell&#8217;s top competitor in mainframe
computers, International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), settled a
long-running antitrust investigation by the U.S. Justice
Department that had constrained its growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s &#8220;power wasn&#8217;t recognizable before then,&#8221; Spencer
told Computerworld magazine in 1986. With the antitrust case
behind it, IBM invested in new factories and took on Japanese
competitors, &#8220;and the government permitted them to go after new
market share without fear of antitrust reprisal. That&#8217;s when the
name of the game changed, and that&#8217;s the point at which we had
to redirect our own strategies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honeywell, he said, had become &#8220;the freewheeling
entrepreneurs who are charging off in our own direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Outstanding Opportunity&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a year after that interview was published,
Honeywell, then located in Minneapolis, spun off its computer
unit into a venture shared with NEC Corp. of Japan and Groupe
Bull SA, France&#8217;s state-owned computer maker. As part of the
restructuring, Honeywell pledged to eliminate 4,000 jobs, the
Associated Press reported. It also purchased the Sperry
Aerospace Group, maker of electronic gear for military and
commercial aircraft, from Unisys Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement at the time, Spencer called the purchase
&#8220;an outstanding opportunity for Honeywell that positions us for
the long term in a market that is expected to have significant
growth for the next 10 years, commercial and military
aviation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Honeywell&#8217;s aerospace unit, which makes cockpit
controls and auxiliary power units, is the second-largest of the
company&#8217;s four divisions, behind automation and control
solutions. It had $11.5 billion of sales last year, or 31
percent of total sales of $36.5 billion for the company, now
based in Morris Township, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Railroads, Meat Packing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edson White Spencer was born on June 4, 1926, and raised in
Chicago, the son of William M. Spencer, chairman of the North
American Car Corp., which leased and operated railroad cars, and
the former Gertrude White. His maternal grandfather, F. Edson
White, worked his way up to the presidency of the Armour  Co.
meat-packing business and served on the board of Chase National
Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer attended Hotchkiss School in Lakeville,
Connecticut, and was an usher at the 1947 wedding of his
classmate and friend, William Clay Ford, grandson of the founder
of Ford Motor Co., to Martha Parke Firestone, daughter of the
president of the Firestone Tire  Rubber Co. and granddaughter
of its founder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being discharged in 1946 as an officer in the U.S.
Naval Reserve, he graduated from Williams College and earned a
master&#8217;s degree from Oxford University, which he attended for
two years as a Rhodes scholar, according to his resume on the
website of the Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs at
the University of Minnesota, where he was a former chairman of
the Deans Advisory Council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climbing Honeywell&#8217;s Ladder &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He worked for Sears Roebuck  Co. in Sioux City, Iowa; La
Crosse, Wisconsin; and Venezuela before settling in Minneapolis
in 1954. After joining Honeywell in 1954, he worked as regional
manager for Honeywell Asia based in Tokyo from 1959 to 1964,
according to a death notice in the New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He became an executive vice president in 1969 and was
promoted to president and CEO in October 1974. After stepping
down as CEO in 1987, he remained chairman for another year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S.-Japanese relations were among his passions, and he
served on the U.S.-Japan Business Council and the Trilateral
Commission, according to the notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer and his wife of 62 years, the former Harriet
McClure Stuart, were founders and longtime supporters of the
Yellowstone Park Foundation. In addition to Murchison they had
three children: Douglas Stuart Spencer and James McClure Spencer
and Edson W. Spencer Jr., founder and chairman of Affinity
Capital Management in Minneapolis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peru seeks to reduce illegal coca
production by 30 percent in the next five years as it steps up
eradication of the crop, the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is targeting the eradication of 110,000
hectares (271,816 acres) of coca bushes by 2016, the Andean
nation&#8217;s drug control agency known as Devida said in an e-mailed
statement today. Seizures of chemicals used to convert coca
leaves into cocaine will rise to 3,500 metric tons from 1,500
metric tons this year, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising production in Peru has seen the country match
Colombia as the world&#8217;s biggest supplier of the leaf. Each
country produces about 40 percent of the world&#8217;s coca, according
to a  United Nations report last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVC Capital Partners Ltd. hired
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc to
refinance the loan that funded its buyout of Formula One,
according to three people with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the refinancing, the private-equity firm plans
to transfer about $1 billion in cash from the operating assets
of the auto-racing series to a company holding the Formula One
stake, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the deal is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formula One started the process of extending its debt,
which involves raising $2.27 billion of new credit facilities
due in 2017 and 2018 to replace its existing $2.92 billion in
loans due in 2013 and 2014, according to a statement today on
the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $1 billion in cash may be used to pay a dividend to
Formula One&#8217;s shareholders or for acquisitions in the future,
according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Proceeds raised will be kept within the group for general
corporate purposes and the company has no current plans to pay a
dividend,&#8221; Formula One said in the statement. &#8220;The new
facilities will provide the business with a secure, long term
capital structure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC is proposing a new term loan B of $1.38 billion and a
new term loan C of $817 million for Formula One, with an
interest margin of 500 basis points more than the London
interbank offered rate, the people said. The Libor floor will be
1.25 percent. There is also a new $70 million revolving-credit
facility paying interest margin of 450 basis points, according
to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bank Meeting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders are invited to a bank meeting on March 30 in
London, said the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC is exploring a possible sale of a stake in Formula One
in an initial public offering that may value the company at more
than $10 billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said
March 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC accumulated a controlling stake in Formula One in 2006
using $2.5 billion of loans. Other shareholders include the
administrators of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which hold 15.3
percent, and Formula One Chief Executive Officer Bernie Ecclestone&#8217;s former wife, Slavica, who owns 8.5 percent through
Bambino Holdings. The racing series had annual sales of 1.17
billion euros ($1.56 billion) and employs 200 people, according
to CVC&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow in
dollars from each other, serves as a reference for about $360
trillion of financial instruments worldwide. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, nominated former KPMG International Chairman Timothy P. Flynn to its board as two directors step down after more than
a decade at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flynn, 55, was the accounting firm&#8217;s chairman from 2007
through October and served as the U.S. division&#8217;s chief
executive officer from 2005 through 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Gray, chairman of consulting firm Gray Global
Strategies Inc., and David Novak, president and CEO of Yum!
Brands Inc (YUM)., aren&#8217;t seeking re-election, New York-based JPMorgan
said today in a statement. Gray is a holdover from his 1992
appointment to the board of Chase Manhattan Corp. (3285Q) Novak was
carried over from the Bank One Corp. board he joined in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has advanced 39 percent this year through

&lt;p&gt;Treasury investors in a weekly
survey by JPMorgan Chase  Co. reduced expectations that prices
of Treasuries would rise, increasing so-called neutral positions
to the highest level since Feb. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percent of &#8220;net longs&#8221; dropped to 4 percent in the
week ended yesterday, from 10 percent last week, while the
number of outright neutrals in the firm&#8217;s &#8220;all clients&#8221; survey
rose to 66 percent, JPMorgan wrote in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of outright shorts was unchanged at 15 percent,
while the survey showed the level of outright longs dropped to
19 percent from 25 percent. A long position is a bet the price
of a security will rise, while a short position is a wager the
price of a security will drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark 10-year note touched 2.4 percent
on March 20, the highest since October. After dropping to a
record low of 1.67 percent in September, the yield traded as low
as 1.79 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year yield dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.23 percent at 8:55 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t disclose the number of clients in the

&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration today will
defend a requirement that Americans obtain insurance or pay a
penalty -- the core of the president&#8217;s health care overhaul --in
a Supreme Court case central to the Republican campaign to take
over the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of 26 states will say that Congress exceeded its
authority in approving the mandate, as the justices hear their
second of three days of arguments. The government, defending the
president&#8217;s signature legislative victory, will contend that
Congress can require people to buy insurance under its
constitutional power to regulate the interstate health-care
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During yesterday&#8217;s opening session, several justices
suggested they will reject an argument that they can&#8217;t consider
the case until the penalty is imposed in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, justices may signal whether they&#8217;re willing to
overturn the insurance requirement or other parts of the law,
which would extend coverage to 32 million people and revamp an
industry that accounts for 18 percent of the U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time the court rejected a measure with such
sweeping impact was when it voided parts of Franklin D.
Roosevelt&#8217;s New Deal, the package of economic programs in the
1930s passed in response to the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the court throws out Obama&#8217;s insurance mandate, that
&#8220;would constitute the most significant federalism ruling since
the 1930s,&#8221; said Daniel Conkle, a constitutional law professor
at Indiana University&#8217;s Maurer School of Law in Bloomington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices probably will issue a ruling by late June,
less than five months before the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s opening arguments were on a question that could
derail the case: whether the penalty for failing to get
insurance amounts to a tax. An 1867 law blocks lawsuits over
taxes that haven&#8217;t been imposed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justices including Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg
suggested they didn&#8217;t view an 1867 law as barring them from
ruling this year. Ginsburg questioned whether health-care
penalties would be taxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not a revenue-raising measure,&#8221; Ginsburg said.
&#8220;If it&#8217;s successful, nobody will pay the penalty and there will
be no revenue to raise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six hours of arguments spread over three days are the
most the court has heard in a case in 44 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, the last day, the justices will consider what
should happen to the rest of the law if they invalidate the
insurance requirement. The court also will take up whether the
law, by expanding the Medicaid program, unconstitutionally
coerces states into spending more on health care for the poor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fate of the insurance requirement will turn partly on
the court&#8217;s interpretation of the constitutional provision that
lets Congress regulate interstate commerce. Justices&#8217; opinions
in previous cases only hint at how they may apply it to the
insurance requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health-care cases are National Federation of
Independent Business v. Sebelius, 11-393; Department of Health
and Human Services v. Florida, 11-398; and Florida v. Department
of Health and Human Services, 11-400. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Investment Bank Dispute Ordered Reconsidered by High Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court (1000L) told a lower court to reconsider
deadlines for some securities lawsuits, in a dispute about
whether investment banks must face accusations that they
manipulated dozens of initial public offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 8-0 ruling yesterday is a partial victory for seven
Wall Street firms, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley (MS), whose units were among the defendants in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling ordered lower courts to reconsider how long an
investor can wait before filing lawsuits seeking to hold
underwriters and corporate insiders accountable for &#8220;short
swing&#8221; trades, those involving stock held for less than six
months. Under federal securities law, insiders with large enough
holdings must give back any profits from short-swing trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high court overturned part of a decision by the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said a two-year time limit
for lawsuits over short-swing profits doesn&#8217;t begin until
corporate insiders disclose the transactions in regulatory
filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices split 4-4 on whether the law permits any
extension of the deadline beyond two years after the stock-sale
profits are realized. Chief Justice John Roberts didn&#8217;t
participate in the case. The tie vote on that part of the case
leaves intact the portion of the lower court decision that
permits extensions of the deadline under some circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices, in an opinion written by Justice Antonin
Scalia, sent the case back for further proceedings to determine
what those circumstances may be, under rules that permit
extensions of a statute of limitations in situations where a
defendant has fraudulently concealed wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices told a federal appeals court to consider
whether shareholder Vanessa Simmonds had enough information
about the alleged wrongdoing that she should have filed suit
sooner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks had urged a firm two-year limit starting
when stock-sale profits are realized, while Simmonds&#8217;s attorneys
contended the two-year clock shouldn&#8217;t begin running until the
insiders filed the disclosure forms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Credit Suisse v. Simmonds, 10-1261, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SP Can&#8217;t Blame Global Crisis for Notes&#8217; Collapse, Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s can&#8217;t blame the 2008 global financial
crisis for the collapse of notes it recommended because it rated
the debt as a long-term investment, said a lawyer for an
Australian financial adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local Government Financial Services Ltd. sued SP in
Federal Court in Sydney, accusing the company of breach of duty
and negligence in giving the notes the highest investment
rating. LGFS filed the lawsuit after it was sued by a dozen
Australian towns that lost more than 90 percent of their
investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP may face potentially unlimited, or so-called
indeterminable, claims if it&#8217;s found liable for its ratings, the
New York-based unit of McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP) said in written
submissions that it&#8217;s scheduled to present to the court this
week. SP blamed the global financial crisis, when credit
markets froze following the 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., for the notes&#8217; collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To say adverse economic conditions, even very adverse
economic conditions&#8221; could be blamed for the collapse of a AAA-
rated 10-year investment is &#8220;totally unreal,&#8221; Guy Parker,
LGFS&#8217;s lawyer said in his closing statement yesterday before
Justice Jayne Jagot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LGFS and the Australian townships also sued ABN Amro Bank
NV, which became the Australian affiliate of the Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS), and manufactured the investments, according
to Parker. ABN Amro Bank in turn sued SP, saying the ratings
company failed to rate the notes &#8220;well and competently.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strauss-Kahn Charged in France With Prostitute Procurement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the
International Monetary Fund, was charged by three investigating
judges in the northern French city of Lille with procurement in
a prostitution ring, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge stems from an investigation into a prostitution
ring linked to the Carlton hotel in Lille. Investigators
uncovered evidence women had been hired to travel as far as
Washington to have sex with the then-chief of the IMF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn, 62, turned himself in Feb. 21 and was held
overnight to answer questions as investigators sought to
determine whether he knew the women were prostitutes, or how
they were paid. French builder Eiffage SA (FGR) filed a complaint for
embezzlement after an internal probe found an employee spent as
much as 50,000 euros ($66,790) to pay for prostitutes for
Strauss-Kahn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The three investigating judges in Lille in charge of the
so-called Carlton affair have charged Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
with aggravated organized procurement of prostitutes,&#8221;
prosecutors said last night in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges followed a closed-door meeting yesterday
between Strauss-Kahn and judges. Prosecutors said Strauss-Kahn
was ordered not to contact other people involved in the case,
including the eight other people charged in the case, witnesses
and the press, according to the statement. He was released on a
100,000 euro bond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paying for sex is legal in France, while procuring
prostitutes for someone else isn&#8217;t. Under the French penal code,
procurement in the context of a prostitution ring can be
punished by as much as 20 years in jail and 3 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn &#8220;declared with the greatest firmness that he
is not guilty of any of these deeds and never had the least
awareness that the women he met could have been prostitutes,&#8221;
Richard Malka, one of his lawyers, said last night upon leaving
the judges&#8217; offices in Lille. His lawyers will hold a press
conference today in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former IMF managing director gave up his post last year
after being arrested in New York on charges he sexually
assaulted a hotel maid. Local prosecutors dropped that case
because of concerns about his accuser&#8217;s credibility and Strauss-
Kahn returned to France, where he faced a separate accusation of

&lt;h2&gt;Oppenheimer Fund Solicitation Challenged in Investor Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Oppenheimer Holdings Inc. (OPY) fund was sued by a
Massachusetts municipal pension plan that alleges its investment
was solicited with &#8220;materially untrue and misleading
statements.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brockton Retirement Board, which manages the
southeastern Massachusetts city&#8217;s employee pension plan,
yesterday sued Oppenheimer Global Resource Private Equity Fund I
LP, sponsor Oppenheimer Asset Management Inc., the fund&#8217;s
administrator, its general partner and two executives in federal
court in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oppenheimer solicitation allegedly overstated the value
of holdings in the Global Resource Private Equity Fund,
described in a private placement memorandum as a fund of funds
intending to invest in natural resource-related companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a result of defendants&#8217; misleading statements,
plaintiff and other members of the class have suffered
significant damages,&#8221; the pension plan said in a complaint
filed on behalf of other investors who bought into the fund
based on the same solicitations. Requiring minimum investments
of $500,000 for &#8220;Class A&#8221; units and $5 million for &#8220;Class B&#8221;
units, the fund raised $85 million from April 2008 to April
2010, according to the complaint. Total investment, it said, was
$140 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brockton plan invested $5 million, $3.2 million of
which has been drawn upon in capital calls by the fund&#8217;s general
partner, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Maddox of FT Consulting, a spokesman for Oppenheimer,
said the firm hasn&#8217;t seen the complaint yet and had no comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Brockton Retirement Board v. Oppenheimer Global
Resource Private Equity Fund I LP., 12-cv=10552, U.S. District
Court for Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook Asks to Dismiss Suit, Says Ceglia Aims to Disrupt IPO &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB) asked a court to dismiss a claim by Paul
Ceglia for a part of the company, saying he  forged the 2003
contract his case is based on, fabricated e-mails and destroyed
evidence of his alleged fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, which operates the world&#8217;s biggest social-
networking site, also asked to the court to block Ceglia from
seeking evidence from its chief executive officer and cofounder,
Mark Zuckerberg, including about 285 messages from Zuckerberg&#8217;s
Harvard University e-mail account and computers he used as a
student. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceglia hopes to use the litigation to &#8220;leverage his fraud
by disrupting Facebook&#8217;s highly publicized initial public
offering,&#8221; the company said in its court papers. Facebook filed
last month for a planned IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This entire lawsuit is a fraud and a lie,&#8221; Facebook
said, arguing that the case should be thrown out
&#8220;immediately.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceglia&#8217;s lawyers said in a statement yesterday that a jury
should be permitted to consider evidence from Ceglia&#8217;s experts
that his contract is genuine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Ceglia deserves his day in court, where the jury will
resolve this dispute over the ownership of Facebook,&#8221; Ceglia&#8217;s
lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceglia sued Facebook and Zuckerberg in 2010, claiming he
gave Zuckerberg money to develop his idea for Facebook in
exchange for a half-interest in the social network. Ceglia
claims he&#8217;s now entitled to half of Zuckerberg&#8217;s Facebook
holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook yesterday produced about a dozen e-mails that
hadn&#8217;t been disclosed publicly, seeking to bolster its defense
against Ceglia&#8217;s claim. Those e-mails, along with three the
company disclosed in court papers last year, show Zuckerberg
continually demanding money he said Ceglia owed him. Facebook
said it has recovered about 300 e-mails between Zuckerberg and
people who worked for StreetFax, including Ceglia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceglia&#8217;s lawyers have said they want access to Zuckerberg&#8217;s
computers from the time of Facebook&#8217;s founding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides agree Ceglia hired Zuckerberg in 2003 to work on
StreetFax, an Internet business Ceglia was starting to sell
pictures of street intersections to insurance companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook claims the true contract between Ceglia and
Zuckerberg referred only to the StreetFax work and didn&#8217;t
mention Facebook, which Zuckerberg started in 2004. The company,
based in Menlo Park, California, attached a copy of the contract
to the papers it filed yesterday. Facebook said it found the
document on one of Ceglia&#8217;s computers, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ceglia v. Zuckerberg, 1:10-cv-00569, U.S.
District Court, Western District of New York (Buffalo). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Madoff Feeder Fund&#8217;s Liquidators Drop Ernst  Young Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidators of M-Invest Ltd., a so-called feeder fund
for Bernard Madoff&#8217;s bankrupt investment firm, dropped a lawsuit
accusing Ernst  Young LLP of negligence, malpractice and breach
of contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidators said in documents filed in New York State
Supreme Court in December that they were suing the New York-
based accounting firm over audits of M-Invest&#8217;s annual financial
statements from 2003 to 2007 and seeking $900 million in
damages. Ernst  Young said the suit was without merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs discontinued the action, according to a
court document filed March 23. No reason was given. Scott M.
Berman, an attorney for the liquidators, and Charlie Perkins, a
spokesman for Ernst  Young, declined to comment on the filing
in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Bancaire Privee, a private Swiss bank that set up M-
Invest, a Cayman Islands corporation, to invest money with
Madoff, agreed to pay as much as $500 million in December 2010
to settle claims by Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating
Madoff&#8217;s firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement ended claims against Union Bancaire, which
was accused of accused of profiting from Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme.
Union Bancaire and M-Invest didn&#8217;t admit any liability,
according to the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year sentence in a federal
prison in North Carolina after admitting to directing the
biggest Ponzi scheme in history. The Securities Investor
Protection Corp. has said that investors in so-called feeder
funds aren&#8217;t customers of Madoff&#8217;s firm and can&#8217;t make claims on
the estate of the bankrupt brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is M-Invest Ltd. v. Ernst  Young LLP,
653353/2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deutsche Bank to Pay $32.5 Million to Settle Mortgage Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany&#8217;s biggest lender, agreed to pay
$32.5 million to settle claims in U.S. litigation that it lied
about the quality of home loans underlying securities it sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors that sued, including the Massachusetts
Bricklayers and Masons Trust Funds, filed a motion for
preliminary approval of the settlement in federal court in
Central Islip, New York, yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed settlement will provide a substantial
monetary benefit to the settlement class,&#8221; lawyers for the
plaintiffs wrote in the filing. U.S. District Judge Leonard D.
Wexler must approve the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that, once burst, helped push the
U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. The market for
mortgage-backed securities peaked at $2.3 trillion in 2007.
Investors have filed class-action, or group, lawsuits against at
least 16 private issuers of securities backed by mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks have argued the housing collapse, rather than any
misrepresentation on their part, caused investor losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to have resolved this matter,&#8221; Renee
Calabro, a spokeswoman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, said
in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Massachusetts Bricklayers and Masons Trust
Funds v. Deutsche Alt-A Securities Inc., 08-cv-3178, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Central Islip). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Wins Case Against Trader Over Decimal Point Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) doesn&#8217;t have to pay a trader 580,000
pounds ($921,000) after a missing decimal point in an employment
contract led him to believe his salary would be 10 times what
was offered, a London court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kai Herbert, a Switzerland-based currency trader, sued
JPMorgan for lost earnings claiming he signed a contract to
relocate to Johannesburg for a salary of 24 million rand ($3.1
million). JPMorgan said there was a typographical error and the
figure should have been 2.4 million rand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Herbert took the commercial risk of accepting the offer,
knowing full well that the figure was an error,&#8221; Judge Henry
Globe said in yesterday&#8217;s judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trader resigned from UBS AG (UBSN) in June 2010 following the
offer from New York-based JPMorgan to relocate to South Africa.
Herbert didn&#8217;t report for work after discovering the discrepancy
and JPMorgan rescinded the employment offer in December 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herbert has been unemployed since, other than eight months
at Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), where he was fired in a round of job
cuts in November. Banks globally have cut about 196,000 jobs
since the start of 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Haywood, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to
comment. Dale Langley, Herbert&#8217;s lawyer, wasn&#8217;t immediately
available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Herbert v. JPMorgan, High Court of Justice
Queen&#8217;s Bench Division, HQ11X02595. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;R.J. Reynolds Loses Bid to Fight Smoker&#8217;s Verdict in High Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court won&#8217;t review a $28.3 million
wrongful death verdict against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
declining to consider legal questions that may affect thousands
of similar cases by smokers and their families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court yesterday left intact the verdict in a case filed
in the wake of a 2006 Florida Supreme Court decision that lets
plaintiffs in cigarette-liability suits use factual findings by
a jury in an earlier case to prove their claims. Reynolds,
Altria Group Inc. (MO) and other U.S. cigarette makers claim Florida
trial judges are applying the findings too broadly, depriving
them of their right to defend themselves in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Florida state courts are engaged in serial due-
process violations that threaten the defendants with literally
billions of dollars of liability,&#8221; Reynolds said in a brief
seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its 2006 ruling, Florida&#8217;s highest court decertified a
statewide class action and threw out a $145 billion punitive
damage verdict against the industry. At the same time, the court
endorsed many jury findings in the case, including that the
companies were negligent, conspired to hide information about
the dangers of smoking and sold defective products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling is known as the Engle decision, after Howard
Engle, the lead plaintiff in the case filed in 1994 on behalf of
Florida smokers addicted to nicotine who developed cancer, heart
disease and other illnesses. Engle, a Florida pediatrician, died
in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reynolds asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review a case in
which a Pensacola jury in 2009 awarded $3.3 million in
compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive damages to
Mathilde Martin, whose husband, Benny, died of lung cancer at
age 66 after smoking Camel and Lucky Strike cigarettes for most
of his life. An intermediate Florida appeals court upheld the
verdict and the state Supreme Court declined to hear the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Martin, 11-741,
U.S. Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Biomet to Pay $22.9 Million to Settle U.S. Bribery Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomet Inc., (BMET) a closely held maker of medical devices,
agreed to pay $22.9 million to settle U.S. accusations that it
bribed foreign doctors to win business, the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomet, based in Warsaw, Indiana, will pay a $17.3 million
criminal fine to the U.S. Justice Department and $5.6 million to
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC said yesterday
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Biomet under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
yesterday in federal court in Washington. The regulator alleged
the company and four of its subsidiaries from 2000 to 2008 paid
bribes to doctors in Argentina, Brazil and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomet cooperated with the government probes and conducted
its own internal investigation, the company said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Moving forward, we intend to continue to adhere to our
enhanced global compliance procedures, and to promote the
company&#8217;s commitment to the highest ethical standards in all the
markets that we serve,&#8221; Jeffrey Binder, Biomet&#8217;s president and
chief executive officer, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Biomet Inc., 12-00454, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clearwater&#8217;s Edwards Loses Loan Conversion Lawsuit Against ANZ &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Edwards, the chief lawyer at Clearwater Capital
Partners LLC, lost a lawsuit against Australia  New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) in which he claimed the lender had unfairly
converted his multicurrency loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Edwards is a lawyer who works in the finance industry,
who took out a mortgage loan with ANZ on terms he agreed to and
who knew what he was getting into,&#8221; Singapore High Court
Justice Tay Yong Kwang wrote in a ruling made public yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards sued the Australian lender in 2010 after the value
of the loan rose 47 percent to $4.2 million because his U.S.
currency and Japanese yen debt were converted to the Australian
dollar, according to his complaint. The yen and the U.S. dollar
were the worst performers against the Aussie among 16 major
currencies in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case, at its simplest, is one of a borrower who took
out a loan to buy properties and to invest and now refuses or is
unable to pay back,&#8221; Tay wrote in his 57-page ruling. &#8220;It is
not in dispute that Edwards is a financially astute and
sophisticated customer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards, the general counsel of Clearwater which invests in
Asian distressed assets, obtained the loan in 2006 to refinance
his property in Australia&#8217;s Queensland state, according to court
documents. The interest on Australian dollar loans was higher
than the rate on U.S. dollar- or yen-denominated debt, according
to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melbourne-based ANZ had said it was within its rights to
convert the currency according to the loan contract and had
informed Edwards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Jason Glenn Edwards v. Australia  New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd., S489/2010 in the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dewey Law Firm Adds Four Partners to Chairman&#8217;s Office &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dewey  LeBoeuf LLP (1151L), the New York-based law firm that lost
its insurance group to other firms this month, is creating a new
chairman&#8217;s office with five coequal members, including the heads
of its most profitable groups, according to a letter to the
partners obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new members include the heads of its bankruptcy,
corporate, litigation and public policy practice groups,
according to the letter, which also provides current revenue
data. Current Chairman Steven Davis, who will relocate to
London, will be joined in the chairman&#8217;s office by Martin
Bienenstock, who runs the firm&#8217;s restructuring group; Rich
Shutran, head of the corporate department; Jeffrey Kessler, head
of litigation; and Charles Landgraf, who runs the the Washington
office and the legislative and public policy group, according to
the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new management team is being set up after &#8220;internal
requests for more hands-on management,&#8221; Shutran said in a phone
interview yesterday. Once voted in, the new structure will also
send a message to clients that the heads of the most profitable
practices are committed to the firm&#8217;s future, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re responding to a general sentiment that we should be
more involved in the executive management of the firm,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On insurance, we&#8217;re confident that the group&#8217;s departure
has no impact on our firm&#8217;s profitability,&#8221; Shutran said.
&#8220;That group was break-even at best.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dewey earned about $250 million last year, Shutran said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue for the first two months of this year rose 28
percent from a year earlier, and so called billable value
increased 13 percent, according to the letter. Revenue for the
12 months through Feb. 29 grew 6 percent with an increase in
billable value of 9.7 percent, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. traders
led by Pierre-Henri Flamand and Morgan Sze raised more than $4.5
billion for their own hedge funds, helped by the experience of
having worked at what once was Wall Street&#8217;s most profitable
securities firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, none of them has made money for clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two are among at least six traders who have left
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s biggest proprietary-trading group in the past
two years, which the New York-based bank shuttered in response
to new U.S. regulations. All, including Daniele Benatoff and
Ariel Roskis, trailed this year&#8217;s stock market rally after
losing money in 2011, investors said. Elif Aktug, who quit the
bank in 2011, plans to start managing money for outside clients
at her Agora Fund Ltd. in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In spite of their pedigree, many ex-Goldman prop traders
have found it much harder than they originally thought to make
money,&#8221; said Matias Ringel, the New York-based head of research
at EFG Asset Management, which invests in hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor timing led to the slow start for the Goldman Sachs
diaspora as the European sovereign-debt crisis and a fragile
economic recovery in the U.S. dominated global markets. Yet
their failure to generate profits from investments also
highlights the differences between trading at a bank, with its
extensive research, technology and compliance operations, and
running a hedge fund where clients pay top fees and are less
tolerant of risk. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Dakin Campbell" date="Mar 27, 2012  7:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-27/capital-one-stays-cheap-after-beating-jpmorgan-in-tests.html"><headline>Capital One Stays Cheap After Beating JPMorgan in Tests</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) is
among the cheapest U.S. bank stocks, even as Federal Reserve
data show the company is better-equipped than JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) to withstand a severe economic slump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One&#8217;s projected price-to-earnings ratio for the
next 12 months is 9.59, tied with JPMorgan for the lowest among
firms in the KBW Bank Index that passed Fed stress tests this
month, according to analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
The firm&#8217;s Tier 1 common capital ratio, a measure of its ability
to absorb losses, would be almost a percentage point higher than
JPMorgan&#8217;s in the most dire Fed test scenario. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s been too cheap for a long time,&#8221; said Ralph Cole, a
senior vice president of research at Portland, Oregon-based
Ferguson Wellman Inc., which manages $2.9 billion including
Capital One shares. &#8220;You want a growth story, and we think in
the outer years it will be a growth story,&#8221; he said, citing
takeovers that added low-cost deposits and millions of potential
new customers for loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank spent more than
$28 billion since 2005 to transform the firm into the sixth-
biggest U.S. commercial lender by deposits, capped by this
year&#8217;s purchase of ING Direct USA. Even so, more than half of
revenue comes from credit cards, and Fairbank is expanding those
assets with a $2.6 billion purchase from HSBC Holdings Plc.
Analysts say the CEO must show he can control the added expenses
and concentration risk, and raise profit without acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shares Advance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One&#8217;s shares have advanced 35 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 28 percent gain for the KBW
Bank Index. (BKX) That made the McLean, Virginia-based firm the third-
best performer over the past 12 months in the 24-company index.
The stock hasn&#8217;t traded this high since November 2007, before
the worst of the credit crisis took hold. Back in 2006, a share
of Capital One fetched almost $90. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Citigroup Inc. (C) has a lower price-earnings ratio, at
9.33, and the New York-based lender didn&#8217;t pass the Fed&#8217;s stress
tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predict Capital One&#8217;s stock
could reach $62 in 12 months, an 8.7 percent rise that would top
projected returns for all of the 10 biggest U.S. lenders. A
stake equal to almost 10 percent may hit the market in coming
months. Those shares were given to ING Groep NV as part of
Capital One&#8217;s $9.1 billion purchase of the Dutch firm&#8217;s online
bank announced in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ING&#8217;s Overhang &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ING shares are an issue and are keeping some
investors on the sidelines,&#8221; said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst
at KBW Inc., who said their concern isn&#8217;t the most important.
&#8220;The biggest issue or risk is more along the lines of
execution,&#8221; Sakhrani said. He has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on
the shares, meaning he expects the stock to return at least 15
percent over 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairbank has one of the industry&#8217;s biggest cushions against
losses if the economy sours, according to results of the Fed&#8217;s
stress tests. The firm&#8217;s Tier 1 common ratio, assuming the
company took no steps to boost capital, would fall no lower than
7.2 percent in the Fed&#8217;s worst-case scenario, above the 5
percent threshold for a bank to be deemed sufficiently insulated
from an economic shock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s better than 6.3 percent for JPMorgan, the biggest
U.S bank, and 6.6 percent for Wells Fargo, the largest home
lender. Capital One&#8217;s Tier 1 leverage ratio, a measure of how
much equity supports total assets, would fall to 6.2 percent,
higher than New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s 4.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the four core measures examined by the Fed, only Capital
One&#8217;s minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10.7 percent was
below JPMorgan&#8217;s 10.9 percent, the results show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dividend Difference &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Wells Fargo won Fed approval to increase
dividends and share repurchases, pushing their ratios lower.
Capital One&#8217;s ratios got a boost because the lender didn&#8217;t seek
approval to return capital to shareholders this year, Tatiana Stead, a bank spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for growth, the acquisitions of ING Direct and HSBC&#8217;s
credit-card portfolio are &#8220;vehicles to secure additional
customers,&#8221; said KBW&#8217;s Sakhrani. The HSBC deal added about $30
billion of U.S. credit-card assets, while ING Direct came with
about $83 billion of deposits. That boosted Capital One&#8217;s total
deposits to about $211 billion and vaulted the company from
eighth to sixth among U.S. banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One can tap those funds to pitch more commercial,
auto and credit-card lending to 34 million former HSBC and ING
customers who lacked access to products that Capital One offers,
Sakhrani said. The deposits, he said, give Capital One a cheaper
source of funding that will widen net interest margins, the
difference between what the bank pays for deposits and what it
charges for loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mobile Banking &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One, which completed the ING purchase in February,
has told ING customers who are accustomed to depositing checks
through the mail that they will be able to do that using a
computer or mobile application starting in the next few months.
Clients with ING checking accounts also can use automated teller
machines at Capital One branches, broadening their access to
fee-free ATMs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can provide ING Direct&#8217;s current and potential
customers with a far wider array of customer-friendly, value-
enhancing banking products,&#8221; Fairbank, 61, said in a September
investor presentation. The combined firm &#8220;enhances and sustains
key sources of shareholder value over the long-term, including
increased loan volumes, strong and sustainable returns and
strong capital generation,&#8221; he said. Capital One declined to
make the CEO available to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credit-Card Concentration &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the company still relies on credit cards, whose
&#8220;What&#8217;s in your wallet?&#8221; slogan has been ingrained on
consumers through television ads and mailings. The combination
of heavy promotion, consumer rewards and no annual fees have
made Capital One the fifth-biggest U.S. credit-card issuer by
purchases and contributed $2.3 billion of the company&#8217;s $3.1
billion of profit last year. The acquisition of the HSBC
portfolio is scheduled for completion by mid-year, boosting
assets by more than 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One&#8217;s stock looks more expensive measured by price-
to-tangible book value, which stands at 1.7. That&#8217;s higher than
the average of 1.3 for its peers, including 1.4 times tangible
book value for JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headwinds include a nationwide drop in revolving consumer
debt to $2.95 billion in January, the first decrease since
August, according to Fed data. The total of $801 billion is down
from a September 2008 peak of $972 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consumers have paid down debt and appropriately so,&#8221;
Cole said. Still, the decline won&#8217;t last and when borrowing
picks up again, Capital One will be one of the industry&#8217;s
leaders, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fee Squeeze &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threats to revenue from &#8220;swipe fees&#8221; charged to merchants
for each card purchase may also re-emerge. New U.S. laws have
already crimped such fees on debit cards, and a federal anti-
trust lawsuit by merchants against banks and payment networks
over credit-card fees is scheduled for trial later this year,
according to Daniel Furtado, an analyst at Jefferies Group Inc.
A defeat could cut the $1.32 billion the firm reaped last year,
according to its fourth-quarter supplement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&#8217;s the prospect of more dilution. Capital One
sold $1.26 billion of shares this month to help fund the
purchase of HSBC&#8217;s U.S. credit-card assets, which included co-
branded and &#8220;private-label&#8221; cards issued by retailers. That
followed a $2 billion sale in July to help cover part of the
cost of acquiring ING Direct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Raising Alarm &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, on Feb. 17, Capital One issued more than 54
million shares to ING in connection with the purchase, making
the Amsterdam-based firm the largest shareholder with a stake of
almost 10 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One shares slid as much as 8.2 percent on Jan. 20,
a day after the firm said a 25 percent increase in noninterest
expenses pushed down fourth-quarter profit. Management cited
technology and infrastructure needed to handle the additional
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That alarmed investors and made them wary of unexpected
costs related to the transactions, said David Knutson, a credit
analyst in Chicago with Legal  General Investment Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fairbank did not do a very good job of preparing the
market,&#8221; he said in a phone interview. A sluggish U.S. economy
may weigh on card spending, Knutson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among analysts, buy recommendations outweigh sell and hold
ratings by 21 to 9. Furtado at Jefferies said the bank may be
able to boost its 5-cent quarterly dividend or buy back stock in
2013, and he moved his price target to $72 from $50 in a March
19 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earnings Ahead &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Foran, a senior bank analyst at Nomura Securities,
predicts Capital One will earn $7 a share in 2013, more than the
$6.87 consensus in Bloomberg&#8217;s survey of analysts. Foran assigns
a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating with a $54 price target for the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerrold Senser, the CEO of Institutional Capital LLC and
ICAP money manager Robert Stoll, who helps oversee $24 billion,
purchased 7.4 million Capital One shares in the fourth quarter,
making their firm the lender&#8217;s 13th-biggest owner with a 1.3
percent stake, according to Bloomberg data. Icap believes
Capital One&#8217;s purchases will boost long-term profit, Stoll said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A good, focused operator like Capital One can take market
share and you can take it organically, or you can buy it,&#8221;
Stoll said. &#8220;With the ING and HSBC deals, we think they bought
market share at a reasonable price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah O. Norton, who made $1.2
million over 2010 and 2011 as a JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) banker, is
waiting for a U.S. Senate committee to vote on his nomination
for a new job as a $155,500-a-year regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate Banking Committee votes tomorrow on his
nomination to join the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. The committee&#8217;s approval would make Norton one of four
would-be FDIC regulators awaiting confirmation by the complete
Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norton is not alone is pursuing a path from Wall Street to
relatively modest compensation in government. Before joining
JPMorgan, Norton worked in the Treasury department for former
Goldman Sachs chief executive Hank Paulson, who amassed more
than $500 million at New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
before becoming Treasury Secretary in the administration of
President George W. Bush. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some who move from Wall Street to government are drawn to
the prestige of the work, said Clifford Rossi, a former managing
director of Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s consumer lending group and an
executive-in-resident at the University of Maryland&#8217;s Robert H.
Smith School of Business. &#8220;They can always go back to the
private sector at some point, as we have seen, and pick up where
they left off,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western Canada Select oil weakened
after a March 26 fire struck a process unit at Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Billings refinery in Montana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production wasn&#8217;t &#8220;significantly impacted,&#8221; Rachael
Moore, a Fairfax, Virginia-based spokeswoman for Exxon, said in
an e-mail earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS)&#8217;s discount widened $3.50 to $27.50 a
barrel at 3:42 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The refinery imported about 25,000 barrels a day of
oil with gravity below 30 API from Canada in December, according
to the Energy Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thunder Horse&#8217;s premium to WTI added 30 cents to $19.30 a
barrel. Mars Blend (USCSMARS) increased 10 cents to a premium of $15.70
over the U.S. benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light Louisiana Sweet&#8217;s (USCSLLSS) premium to WTI added $1.20 to
$21.90 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE)&#8217;s premium increased 25
cents to $23.50 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poseidon&#8217;s premium narrowed 40 cents to $14.85, while
Southern Green Canyon&#8217;s premium declined 50 cents to $15.75 a
barrel. West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM)&#8217;s discount widened 80 cents to $5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the U.S. may no longer be at
risk of another recession and the housing market is nearing the
bottom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, head of the largest and most profitable U.S. bank,
said today in an interview on CNBC that the Federal Reserve (FDTR) will
maintain policies designed to boost growth until policy makers
are convinced hiring is on the rise across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My own read is that they want to see 300,000 to 400,000
jobs a month for six months before they declare victory,&#8221; Dimon
said. &#8220;If that actually happened, they might reverse course
sooner than people think.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 56, reiterated his upbeat forecast for the economy,
saying that the U.S. housing market is close to &#8220;the inflection
point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although home prices are still falling, &#8220;all the other
signs are flashing green,&#8221; Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Box Inc. will offer corporate
clients access to applications on remote servers via Apple
Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s mobile devices, challenging software makers such as
Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Box OneCloud service lets business clients use more
than 30 applications, such as Quickoffice, PDF Expert and Adobe
Systems Inc.&#8217;s EchoSign, and store all their data on Box&#8217;s
network of servers. Los Altos, California-based Box will work to
expand the available programs in coming months, Chief Executive
Officer Aaron Levie said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Box is one of a bevy of startups, also including Dropbox
Inc., that are trying to gain a foothold in the market for
business collaboration -- now dominated by software giants like
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Oracle and IBM. As more companies move
computing tasks off their own servers, offsite workloads in the
so-called cloud will increase by an average of 50 percent a year
through 2014, according to a Morgan Stanley report last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is one of the most strategic and significant events
for our company this year,&#8221; Levie said. &#8220;A very significant
portion of our long-term revenue will come as a result of
this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company says it has more than 10 million users,
including those from about 82 percent of Fortune 500 companies.
Box, which was founded in 2005, may consider going public in the
next several years, Levie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investors, Rivals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Box doesn&#8217;t disclose its sales. The company offers
customers some free access to servers, then charges for
additional services. Its business-access plan costs $15 a month
per user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has raised $162 million from investors
including Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) and SAP Ventures, the venture
capital firm affiliated with software maker SAP AG. (SAP) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Box faces significant competition. Oracle, the
largest seller of database software, has been making
acquisitions to broaden its offerings in cloud computing. In
February, it agreed to buy Taleo Corp., a maker of online human-
resources software, for $1.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web-storage provider Dropbox raised $250 million in October
from investors including Index Ventures, Benchmark Capital and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. At the time, the service had more than
45 million users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;More and more corporate customers are going to insist the
solution is deeper,&#8221; Michael Fauscette, an analyst at
researcher IDC, said in an interview. &#8220;Other vendors could
compete and, potentially, partner with Box. It&#8217;s probably a co-
existence strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc&#8217;s
interest-rate traders were seated with one of the main rate
setters in its London office to share information, and discussed
rates on conference calls, a fired trader said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan Chi Min, let go over accusations he manipulated the
London interbank offered rate, made the claims in court papers
filed with the Singapore High Court on March 23. Tan, who sued
RBS for wrongful dismissal, has accused the bank of using an
internal probe into Libor manipulation to find scapegoats after
condoning such behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators worldwide are investigating whether banks
attempted to manipulate rates including Libor, the basis for
$360 trillion of securities around the globe. The probes have
called into question whether the banks can be trusted to set the
rates with minimal regulatory oversight. Investigators have
sought information from lenders including RBS, Citigroup Inc. (C)
and Deutsche Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul White, RBS&#8217;s principal rate setter for yen Libor, and
Tan&#8217;s team in London were &#8220;specifically seated together&#8221; in
the London office to &#8220;facilitate the sharing of information and
workload,&#8221; Tan, the bank&#8217;s former head of short-term interest-rate trading for the yen, said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White, who was based in London, was also dismissed as part
of the bank&#8217;s Libor probe, two people briefed on the matter said
last month. He hasn&#8217;t been accused of wrongdoing by regulators.
Contact numbers for White couldn&#8217;t be located through the
Internet or directory assistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patricia Choo, a Singapore-based RBS spokeswoman, declined
to comment on Tan&#8217;s claims. Tan&#8217;s lawyer Suresh Nair declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;UBS Wins Dismissal of Fraud Claim in HSH Nordbank Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) won dismissal of a fraud claim filed against the
bank by HSH Nordbank AG over losses on a collateralized debt
obligation linked to the U.S. subprime-mortgage market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York state appeals court in Manhattan yesterday
dismissed the fraud claim against Zurich-based UBS, reversing an
October 2009 ruling by state Supreme Court Justice Richard Lowe
that allowed it to proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court said HSH Nordbank, a regional German bank
that was bailed out during the financial crisis, was
&#8220;explicitly warned&#8221; of the risks in the transaction and could
have uncovered any misrepresentation by doing its own due
diligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we were to affirm the denial of the motion to dismiss
this fraud claim, we would be judging the sufficiency of a claim
asserted by a 140 billion euro commercial bank by a standard
more lenient than the one by which this court has judged similar
claims made by individual investors against their retail
brokers,&#8221; Justice David Friedman said in the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSH Nordbank, based in Hamburg, sued UBS in February 2008,
accusing the bank of fraud, breach of contract and other claims
over losses on the investment, a CDO called North Street 2002-4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSH Nordbank said in the lawsuit that its predecessor,
Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein, invested $500 million in the CDO
with UBS in March 2002. HSH Nordbank, which was created in June
2003 by the combination of Hamburgische Landesbank and
Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein, said it lost almost all of the
investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is HSH Nordbank AG v. UBS AG (UBS), 600562/2008, New
York Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gupta Denied Bid to Suppress Evidence of Rajaratnam Wiretaps &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director
accused of passing tips to Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj
Rajaratnam, lost a bid to suppress government wiretaps caught on
Rajaratnam&#8217;s mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New York said March 26
that the wiretaps can be used for the same reason that U.S.
District Judge Richard Holwell allowed their use against
Rajaratnam at his trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gupta offers no arguments different from the arguments
Judge Holwell considered in the Rajaratnam case,&#8221; Rakoff said
in an order. &#8220;He argues instead that Judge Holwell&#8217;s
conclusions are in error. The court disagrees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff also granted Gupta&#8217;s lawyers two more hours to
question Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
under oath as part of a related U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission suit against Gupta and Rajaratnam. Rakoff is
presiding over both the criminal and civil cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, a prosecution witness at the Rajaratnam insider-trading trial, was questioned Feb. 24 as part of the parallel
SEC lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC lawyers objected to questions asked by Gupta&#8217;s lawyer,
Gary Naftalis, about the government&#8217;s preparation of Blankfein
for his testimony, citing a legal rule barring Gupta from
discovering information about its legal strategy and the thought
processes of its lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta has pleaded not guilty. He faces as long as 20 years
in prison if convicted of any of the securities fraud charges
and as long as five years if convicted of conspiracy. He may be
fined as much as $5 million if convicted, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is scheduled to go on trial May 21. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wells Fargo Must Face Class Action Over Securities Lending &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) must face a group lawsuit by
institutional investors that claim the bank marketed a risky
securities-lending program as safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Donovan W. Frank in St. Paul,
Minnesota, certified the suit as a class action yesterday,
finding that common issues predominated, including whether Wells
Fargo &#8220;knew or should have known that the investments it
selected did not comport with investment mandates.&#8221; These
issues &#8220;will likely turn on substantially the same evidence for
the class as a whole,&#8221; Frank said in a 21-page decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in 2010 by the City of Farmington Hills
Employees Retirement System, a Michigan pension fund, on behalf
of more than 100 other institutional investors, claimed breach
of fiduciary duty and fraud. The investors sought permission to
pursue the case against Wells Fargo as a group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &#8220;touted&#8221; its securities-lending program &#8220;as
a highly-secure way for its institutional clients to maximize
portfolio returns,&#8221; according to the complaint. Instead, the
pension fund said, &#8220;Wells Fargo invested a substantial portion
of the collateral in extremely risky securities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors also claimed that Wells Fargo concealed
investment performance from class members to prevent them from
exiting the securities-lending program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo will &#8220;appeal the decision immediately,&#8221; Laura
Fay, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based company, said in
an e-mail. &#8220;Wells Fargo categorically denies the allegations
made in this lawsuit and will vigorously defend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class action is City of Farmington Hills Employees
Retirement System v. Wells Fargo Bank NA, 10-cv-04372, U.S.
District Court, District of Minnesota (St. Paul). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Barnes  Noble Wins Dismissal of Four Directors From Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS), the biggest U.S. bookstore chain, won
a judge&#8217;s dismissal of four company directors alleged to have
unfairly sided with founder Leonard Riggio in the company&#8217;s $596
million buyout of his college-textbook firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other people named in a lawsuit, former directors
Lawrence S. Zilavy and Michael J. Del Giudice, must stand trial
along with the chairman and founder, Delaware Chancery Court
Judge Leo Strine ruled yesterday at a hearing in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying there was no evidence they acted in bad faith,
Strine dismissed independent directors Irene Miller, Margaret
Monaco and William Dillard II, along with Leonard&#8217;s brother,
Vice Chairman Stephen Riggio, who recused himself from the vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System,
a holder of company common stock, sued the board Aug. 17, 2009,
contending officials violated their duties and wasted corporate
assets in the sale. The suit seeking damages was filed on behalf
of the company. A trial is tentatively set to begin June 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The independent directors &#8220;had a strong interest in making
sure Barnes  Noble didn&#8217;t overpay&#8221; for the college book firm,
and &#8220;you can&#8217;t be personally liable merely for casting a
vote,&#8221; defendants&#8217; lawyer Kenneth Nachbar told Strine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directors were beholden to Leonard Riggio through long-term
associations, recognized his plans for transition to digital
readers and &#8220;knew Mr. Riggio was the godfather of all this
technology,&#8221; countered plaintiff&#8217;s lawyer Pamela Tikellis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors argued that the board allowed Riggio to
dictate terms and timing of the 2009 buyout of Barnes  Noble
College Booksellers Inc. and didn&#8217;t force him to seek other
offers for the company to justify the purchase price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes  Noble,
declined to comment on the ruling in an e-mail message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Barnes  Noble Stockholder Derivative
Litigation, CA No. 4813, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Sues Former United Commercial Bank Executive Cinderey &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued former
United Commercial Bank Vice President John Cinderey, accusing
him of creating false records tied to the defunct San Francisco-based bank&#8217;s evaluation of loan risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Commercial, a unit of UCBH Holdings Inc., was seized
by regulators in November 2009. It failed following the 2008
credit crisis and caused a $2.5 billion loss to the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.&#8217;s insurance fund, according to the SEC.
Cinderey, 64, was in charge of the bank&#8217;s commercial banking
division, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinderey, taking orders from his superiors during the
financial crisis, &#8220;misstated and omitted material information
in documents provided to the bank&#8217;s independent auditors,&#8221; the
SEC said in its complaint filed yesterday in federal court in
San Francisco. Cinderey &#8220;altered memoranda addressing the risks
associated with certain large loans and the potential losses the
bank faced from the loans,&#8221; which auditors relied on, according
to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three former executives at the bank were sued by the SEC
last year over claims they misled investors by concealing at
least $65 million in loan losses before the lender collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its suit filed in October, the SEC claimed United
Commercial Bank&#8217;s chief executive officer, Thomas Wu, worked
with Chief Operating Officer Ebrahim Shabudin and senior officer
Thomas Yu to hide impaired assets from auditors, causing UCBH
Holdings to understate 2008 operating losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinderey&#8217;s lawyer, Mary McNamara, didn&#8217;t return a call
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Cinderey,
12-01519, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Health Law Seen in Jeopardy After Justices Questioning &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Supreme Court justices voiced skepticism about
President Barack Obama&#8217;s health-care law, hinting they might
strike down his biggest domestic achievement just months before
the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the second of three days in the historic case, justices&#8217;
questions over the law&#8217;s requirement that Americans buy
insurance or pay a penalty indicated they might split 5-to-4,
with five Republican appointees banding together to topple the
law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Anthony Kennedy said the requirement to obtain
coverage is telling individuals they &#8220;must act.&#8221; Kennedy, who
most often occupies the court&#8217;s ideological middle ground, said,
&#8220;That changes the relationship of the government to the
individual in a fundamental way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Samuel Alito called the penalties a &#8220;huge
subsidy&#8221; from young, healthy people who don&#8217;t want insurance to
those who need a lot of health care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law would extend coverage to 32 million people and
revamp an industry that accounts for 18 percent of the U.S.
economy. The court hasn&#8217;t overturned a measure with such
sweeping impact since the 1930s, when it voided parts of
Franklin D. Roosevelt&#8217;s New Deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court probably will rule in late June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration needs the vote of at least one of
the five Republican appointees on the nine-member court to
uphold the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading into yesterday&#8217;s session, Chief Justice John
Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Kennedy and Alito were the
most likely candidates, given their records. All four aimed
questions at U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who argued
in the law&#8217;s defense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;JJ Duped Arkansas Doctors Over Risperdal, Lawyer Tells Jury &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) officials repeatedly misled Arkansas
doctors about the safety of the antipsychotic drug Risperdal,
and the drugmaker should be held responsible for those
deceptions, a lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ&#8217;s Janssen unit made misleading claims about Risperdal&#8217;s
health risks and effectiveness in a letter to more than 6,200
Arkansas doctors, violating the state&#8217;s deceptive-trade
practices law, one of the state&#8217;s lawyers told a jury in Little
Rock yesterday. Arkansas is seeking more than $1.25 billion in
penalties over the campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By the time this case is over, we will prove to you that
Janssen lied about Risperdal&#8217;s dangers just to make money,&#8221;
Fletcher Trammell, an attorney for Arkansas, told jurors in
opening statements in the state-court trial over JJ&#8217;s Risperdal
marketing tactics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the fifth jury trial over states&#8217; claims that JJ, the
second-biggest maker of health products, hid Risperdal&#8217;s
diabetes risks and tricked Medicaid regulators into paying
millions of dollars more than they should have for the medicine.
JJ ended the most recent trial in Texas with a $158 million
settlement in January. The Texas settlement won court approval
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ has said it provided proper warnings about diabetes
risks on Risperdal&#8217;s label and that U.S. regulators approved
those disclosures. Efforts to tie labeling claims to Medicaid
fraud should fail because &#8220;compliance with federal drug
labeling statutes and regulations is not a condition of payment
or participating in&#8221; a state Medicaid program, JJ said in a
July 2010 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janssen didn&#8217;t engage in deceptive trade practices and
didn&#8217;t harm anyone, James Simpson, a company lawyer, told the
jury yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of Arkansas v. Ortho-McNeil-Janssen
Pharmaceuticals Inc., CV07-15345, Pulaski County Circuit Court
(Little Rock). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JJ&#8217;s $158 Million Settlement With Texas Approved by Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson and the state of Texas won court approval
of the company&#8217;s agreement to pay $158 million to settle claims
that the drugmaker fraudulently marketed its Risperdal anti-psychotic drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ reached the settlement in January to resolve claims it
defrauded the state&#8217;s Medicaid program by promoting Risperdal
for uses not approved by U.S. regulators, including for children
with psychiatric disorders. The state also claimed the New
Brunswick, New Jersey-based drugmaker downplayed the health risk
of Risperdal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travis County District Judge John Dietz in Austin, Texas,
approved the settlement yesterday following a meeting in court
with lawyers. JJ and its Janssen unit denied any wrongdoing in
the final agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This settlement represents a resolution to claims brought
by the State in 2004 for alleged Medicaid overpayment during the
years 1994-2008, and will circumvent potentially lengthy and
costly appellate activities,&#8221; Teresa Mueller, a company
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, JJ and Janssen will pay $158 million,
with 40 percent going to the state, 31 percent to the U.S., 17
percent to whistle-blower Allen Jones, who brought the lawsuit,
and the rest to his attorneys, Tommy Jacks, one of Jones&#8217;s
lawyers, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Kelley, spokesman for the Texas attorney general,
declined to comment on the breakdown. The state is getting a
larger share than initially expected, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, reached during trial, was the first time
JJ and its Janssen unit settled a state&#8217;s claims over
Risperdal. The company lost jury trials in South Carolina and
Louisiana over Risperdal marketing. Opening statements in a
trial in Arkansas began yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas case is Texas v. Janssen LP, D-1GV-04-001288,
District Court, Travis County, Texas (Austin). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Soros Insider Trading Appeal Rejected by ECHR Grand Chamber &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire investor George Soros lost a challenge to his
2002 insider trading conviction, with the European Court of
Human Rights&#8217;s Grand Chamber refusing to review whether France
had violated his rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s Grand Chamber declined to hear Soros&#8217;s appeal
in a statement yesterday, without providing any reasoning.
Soros, 81, was convicted by Paris courts in 2002 for using
insider information about Societe Generale SA (GLE) in his trading. He
argued that French market regulations weren&#8217;t clear enough to
hold him responsible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &#8220;a famous institutional investor, well-known to the
business community and a participant in major financial
projects,&#8221; Soros should have been &#8220;particularly prudent&#8221; in
ensuring he was obeying insider-trading laws, the Strasbourg,
France-based European court said in its October decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the French case, Soros was ordered to repay 2.2 million
euros ($2.9 million) he&#8217;d made from the share purchase and
subsequent sale after judges found he&#8217;d acted with the knowledge
that the bank might be a takeover target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While prosecutors filed criminal charges, French stock
market regulators didn&#8217;t pursue Soros, saying insider-trading
laws were too vague to determine whether he&#8217;d broken them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros&#8217;s Paris lawyer, Ron Soffer, declined to immediately
comment on the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Seeks to Dismiss Convictions of Bribe Sting Defendants &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss the convictions
of three men who pleaded guilty in a foreign-bribery sting, a
month after abandoning the case against 19 others charged in the
same alleged conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department, in a filing yesterday in U.S.
District Court in Washington, said an earlier ruling by U.S.
District Judge Richard Leon throwing out conspiracy charges
against other defendants in the case should &#8220;apply equally&#8221; to
Jonathan Spiller, Haim Geri and Daniel Alvirez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government has concluded that further prosecution of
the Gabon-related charges against defendants Spiller, Geri and
Alvirez is unlikely to be successful,&#8221; prosecutors said in the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leon suggested at a hearing yesterday that he would grant
the request. He ordered the parties to submit additional filings
on how to dispose of the guilty pleas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to see the government made the right
decision,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the request of prosecutors, Leon on Feb. 21 dismissed
the indictment accusing 19 security-industry officials of
planning to make payments to a federal agent posing as a
representative of the West African nation of Gabon to secure a
stake in a fake $15 million deal for weapons and security gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time the government used a sting operation
involving undercover techniques to charge violations of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The case was dropped after the
government failed to win convictions of 10 people who went to
trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This outcome was the right thing to do by everyone&#8217;s
standpoint,&#8221; Alvirez&#8217;s lawyer, Asa Hutchinson, said in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geri&#8217;s lawyer, Eric Bruce of Kobre  Kim LLP, said in a
statement that &#8220;it would have been a grave injustice&#8221; for his
client &#8220;to be branded a felon as a result of this failed sting
operation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiller, in a statement, said he was glad &#8220;this painful
episode in my life is now over.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goncalves, 09-cr-00335, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Tax-Evasion Probes Said to Slow as Prosecutors Transfer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department has lost almost 30 percent of
its tax prosecutors in the past month, slowing a U.S. crackdown
on offshore banks that enabled tax evasion, according to four
people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg News&#8217; David Voreacos
reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five of the 95 prosecutors in the tax division left
headquarters in Washington for six-month &#8220;details&#8221; with U.S.
attorneys around the country, and another three took permanent
assignments, according to the four people, who declined to be
identified because they aren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the lawyers handled cases involving foreign banks
or financial advisers suspected of helping U.S. clients cheat on
taxes, the people said. The transfers came amid criminal probes
of at least 11 Swiss financial institutions, including Credit
Suisse Group AG, with the tax division leading or assisting each
prosecution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To move one-third of these people from that effort will
significantly compromise such enforcement at the very time it is
needed to deal with the huge amounts of offshore cases coming to
the tax division,&#8221; said Nathan Hochman, a former assistant
attorney general who oversaw the tax division under President
George W. Bush. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecutors &#8220;have significant experience, training and
knowledge when it comes to the enforcement of tax laws
pertaining to overseas accounts,&#8221; said Hochman, now a partner
at Bingham McCutchen LLP in Santa Monica, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The division also investigates identity theft, illegal tax
shelters and other crimes, while approving every tax case filed
by the 94 presidentially appointed U.S. attorneys serving the
Justice Department around the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Offshore non-compliance by U.S. taxpayers remains a top
priority for the Justice Department&#8217;s Tax Division,&#8221; said
Charles Miller, a Justice Department spokesman. &#8220;We will
continue to pursue those cases vigorously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Promotes Biben to General Counsel for Consumer Banking &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest U.S. bank, elevated home-lending general counsel Matt Biben to head legal strategy for
all of the firm&#8217;s consumer business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biben, who previously worked at Bank of New York Mellon
Corp., will continue overseeing litigation and policy for
mortgages while supervising the bank&#8217;s legal teams for credit
cards, auto financing, student lending and consumer and business
banking, according to an internal memo sent to employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Madoff Trustee&#8217;s Ex-U.K. Lawyer Pleads Guilty to Expenses Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A London lawyer who had represented the U.S. trustee
liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s assets pleaded guilty to
fraudulently claiming 1.2 million pounds ($1.9 million) in
expenses from his law firm, Hogan Lovells LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Grierson, a former partner at the firm in
London who advised on asset-tracing and fraud, admitted to 57
fake travel claims, the Crown Prosecution Service said in a
statement yesterday. He will be sentenced in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fraud is always a serious matter,&#8221; said Sue Patten, the
head of CPS&#8217;s Central Fraud Group. &#8220;Defrauding your employer or
otherwise abusing a position of trust, especially over a long
period of time, makes it particularly serious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving Picard, the U.S. bankruptcy court-appointed trustee
liquidating the accounts of Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities LLC, hired Grierson in 2009 to help recover Madoff
assets in Europe. Grierson, who was charging as much as 610
pounds per hour, dropped the case in 2010 because of client
conflicts when his firm, then Lovells LLP, merged with
Washington-based Hogan  Hartson LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No clients were affected by the fraud and Grierson repaid
the firm, Hogan Lovells said in May, when he was fired. The firm
conducted an internal investigation and referred the matter to
police and the Solicitors Regulation Authority, which oversees
lawyer conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Hinze, a spokesman for Hogan Lovells in London,
declined to comment further yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tax-Lien Probe Wins Sixth N.J. Plea as Lawyer Admits Guilt &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of a New Jersey real estate company became the
sixth person to plead guilty in a federal antitrust probe,
admitting he conspired for a decade to rig auctions of municipal
tax liens throughout the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert E. Rothman, an attorney who owns Rothman Realty
Corp. in Englewood, New Jersey, pleaded guilty yesterday in
federal court in Newark, New Jersey. Rothman, 59, is the sixth
person to admit his role in the scheme and cooperate with a
growing investigation by the Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust
division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothman admitted he helped eliminate competition from 2000
to 2009 by submitting collusive bids at auctions. The group
allocated &#8220;which tax liens each would bid on&#8221; and bought liens
at &#8220;collusive and non-competitive&#8221; rates, he admitted. If
liens were unpaid, their buyers could foreclose against the
property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Antitrust Division&#8217;s investigation into municipal tax
liens is ongoing and active,&#8221; Sharis A. Pozen, acting assistant
attorney general, said in a statement. &#8220;The division will not
tolerate this kind of illegal conduct that harms distressed
homeowners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothman faces as many as 10 years in prison, although he is
likely to get far less time if prosecutors are satisfied with
his cooperation. U.S. District Judge Dennis Cavanaugh set
sentencing for July. He released Rothman on a $100,000 unsecured
bond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothman&#8217;s attorney, Robert Cleary, the former U.S. attorney
in New Jersey, declined to comment on his client&#8217;s plea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rothman, U.S. District Court, District
of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s Ginni Rometty be able to wear a green jacket at
the Masters Tournament? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Augusta National Golf Club prepares to host the
competition next week, it faces a quandary: The club hasn&#8217;t
admitted a woman as a member since its founding eight decades
ago, yet it has historically invited the chief executive officer
of IBM, one of three Masters sponsors. Since the company named
Rometty to the post this year, Augusta will have to break
tradition either way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM holds a rarefied position at the Augusta, Georgia,
course. The company has a hospitality cabin near the 10th hole,
beside co-sponsors Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and ATT Inc. (T) The
companies&#8217; male CEOs have been able to don the club&#8217;s signature
green member blazers while hosting clients. Non-members, who
don&#8217;t wear the jackets, must be accompanied by a member to visit
the course or play a round. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have a dilemma on many levels,&#8221; said Marcia
Chambers, senior research scholar in law and journalist in
residence at Yale University Law School. &#8220;If there&#8217;s been a
tradition of certain CEOs, then they should look at this new CEO
in the same way. The only thing that makes her any different is
her gender.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augusta, which owns and hosts the Masters, sets its own
rules as a private club and has resisted calls for change in the
past. Augusta didn&#8217;t have a black member until 1990, when it
extended an invitation to Gannett Co. (GCI) television President Ron
Townsend, who still belongs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Membership Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty, who does play golf, though not frequently,
inherited the sponsorship from predecessor Sam Palmisano. IBM is
featured in the tournament&#8217;s TV commercials and runs its
website, mobile-phone applications and media-center technology.
Palmisano serves on Augusta&#8217;s technology tournament committee.
He remains IBM&#8217;s chairman -- a role Rometty is likely also to
assume upon his retirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Ethun, a Masters Tournament spokesman, declined to
comment, citing a policy that forbids membership-related
discussions. Edward Barbini, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-
based IBM, also declined to comment. Augusta members are never
officially identified outside the exclusive greens; known
members contacted for this story declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augusta carefully cultivates its image. Running instead of
walking on the course -- for a good vantage point during the
tournament or a bathroom break -- is forbidden. Organizers of
the Masters refer to fans as &#8220;patrons.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Very Private Party &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entertaining clients at the Masters is &#8220;a very private
cocktail party,&#8221; said Casey Alexander, who analyzes the golf
industry as a director of equity research at New York-based
Gilford Securities Inc. &#8220;It&#8217;s very different than the Super
Bowl or the Kentucky Derby. You don&#8217;t see those big corporate
tents. You don&#8217;t see logos lining the fairways and that&#8217;s the
way they want it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty&#8217;s promotion puts the club and the company in an
&#8220;interesting position&#8221; that&#8217;s likely to be tackled privately,
said Patrick Rishe, a sports business professor at Webster
University in St. Louis. Private clubs are &#8220;clever in terms of
the language they use and their rule books,&#8221; and may simply add
an exception for top executives of key sponsors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billy Payne, who succeeded William &#8220;Hootie&#8221; Johnson as
chairman of the tournament and the golf club in 2006, has said
he has &#8220;no specific timetable&#8221; on possibly ending the all-male
membership, which has been enforced since the club was founded
by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts on the grounds of the former
Fruitland Nurseries in 1933. The first Masters Tournament was
held a year later, and in 1937 Augusta members began wearing
green jackets -- a trademark differentiator from guests and golf
fans who buy tickets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Payne&#8217;s Olympic Effort &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payne&#8217;s predecessor Johnson, now 81, ended his 2003 annual
gathering by saying the club&#8217;s position on women wouldn&#8217;t change
&#8220;if I drop dead right now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the chief organizer of the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta,
Payne was known as being a progressive leader. His Olympic
organizing team included influential women Ginger Watkins, Linda Stephenson and Cindy Fowler. The group is credited with
convincing the International Olympic Committee to bring the
games to Georgia&#8217;s capital with its first bid -- the only city
in 50 years to win with its debut effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Payne took over as chairman of Augusta National, he
vowed to help shed the club&#8217;s &#8220;crusty&#8221; image. In recent years,
the tournament has made changes, including a ticketing program
for children. In 2010, Payne publicly criticized the
extramarital affairs of four-time Masters winner Tiger Woods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our hero did not live up to the expectations of a role
model that we sought for our children,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IBM Precedent &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augusta declined to provide a current membership list for
this story. A 2010 partial list obtained by Bloomberg News and
2004 documents published by the Augusta Chronicle and USA Today
show the last four IBM CEOs were members, beginning with John R. Opel, who ran the company from 1981 to 1985 and died last year.
John F. Akers, IBM&#8217;s chief from 1985 to 1993, and Louis V. Gerstner, who helped turn around IBM as CEO from 1993 to 2002,
also were members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano wasn&#8217;t listed as a member in 2004, a year after
taking over IBM. That suggests the club doesn&#8217;t always extend
invitations just as new CEOs take over, raising the possibility
that Rometty would be admitted later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike her golf-enthusiast predecessors, Rometty plays
occasionally. She and her husband, Mark, are avid scuba divers,
splitting their time between homes in White Plains, New York,
and Bonita Springs, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson is a member, as is ATT CEO
Randall Stephenson. Ed Whitacre, Stephenson&#8217;s predecessor, is a
member and in December gave Stephenson his place as a director
on the PGA Tour&#8217;s board -- professional golf&#8217;s inner circle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IBM&#8217;s Technology &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Masters, IBM provides reporters with individual
ThinkPad laptops in the tournament&#8217;s media center. The computers
provide statistics and stream video from the course throughout
the tournament. In 2010, IBM introduced 3D footage of the
tournament on the website it runs for the Masters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All of those platforms are intended to make the patron
feel as though they are experiencing the Masters just as if they
were at Augusta National,&#8221; said Barbini, the IBM spokesman.
IBM&#8217;s media center technology &#8220;allows each journalist to access
anything they need to file a story from a seat in the media
center -- including statistics, interviews and play-specific
video highlights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s official sponsorship began 10 years ago, though it
had been involved earlier. The company has run the masters.com
website since 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to Change? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augusta has faced pressure to change its policy on women
before. Martha Burk, then the president of the National Council
of Women&#8217;s Organizations, led a protest outside the golf
course&#8217;s gates during the 2003 Masters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The club&#8217;s refusal to reconsider female membership prompted
the resignations of then-Treasury Secretary nominee John Snow
and former CBS Corp. (CBS) Chief Executive Officer Thomas Wyman, who
called the policy &#8220;pigheaded.&#8221; Wyman died about five weeks
later. Snow was secretary of the treasury under President George W. Bush from 2003 to 2006, and now is chairman of Cerberus
Capital Management LP, an investment firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rishe, the Webster University professor, said Augusta may
resist the pressure again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a private club, and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re really
concerned about how others perceive them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Their
ratings will not rise and fall based on how people view this
particular topic. Their ratings will rise and fall if Tiger
Woods is at the top of his game, if Tiger and Phil Mickelson and
Rory McIlroy or some combination of them happen to be in the mix
on the final day of the tournament.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Chambers said IBM&#8217;s decision to name Rometty the
first female CEO in the company&#8217;s 100-year history offers a rare
chance for Augusta and its chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Billy Payne, with his history of inclusion and his role
with the Olympics, of all people, should finally take the
plunge,&#8221; Chambers said. &#8220;This is a good opportunity for him to
do it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jes Staley, chief executive officer
of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s investment bank, told CNBC that
equities activity in the first quarter was &#8220;still lighter than
we&#8217;d like to see it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the trading environment in the quarter,
particularly in equities, Staley said it&#8217;s &#8220;down about 20
percent&#8221; from a year ago. &#8220;Fixed-income is a little bit
higher,&#8221; he said in the interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley&#8217;s remarks referred to data provided by Dealogic on
&#8220;equity capital markets issuance, not trading volumes&#8221; for the

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) got a judge to
order a group of unidentified hackers to stop running networks
of infected computers known as botnets that allegedly hijack
online bank accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. in Brooklyn, New
York, today issued a preliminary injunction against 39 John Does
who use hacker aliases such as &#8220;Monstr&#8221; and &#8220;Gribodemon&#8221; to
create a network of botnets running malicious software known as
Zeus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A botnet is a network of infected computers programmed to
send data automatically from their hard drives to a server
controlled by hackers. Hackers infect computers with software
that can steal online banking logins and passwords, which they
can use to transfer money to their own accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s the primary purpose of this scheme,&#8221; said Gabriel
M. Ramsey, a lawyer for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft,
which claims the Zeus botnets controlled by the John Doe hackers
have taken more than $100 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, sued the
unnamed hackers on March 19. The case was made public March 27,
the day after Microsoft said it had seized computer servers in
Pennsylvania and Illinois, while escorted by U.S. Marshals, to
preserve evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Keystrokes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zeus software allows a hacker to monitor a victim&#8217;s
online activity and record keystrokes, according to a March 26
statement from Microsoft. The company said it has detected more
than 13 million suspected infections of Zeus software worldwide
since 2007, and 3 million in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft and its partners took down two Internet
Protocol addresses behind the Zeus command and control
structure, and Microsoft is currently monitoring 800 domains
secured in the operation, which are helping identify thousands
of computers infected by Zeus,&#8221; the company said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramsey said Microsoft and other plaintiffs are speaking to
law enforcement about the matter. He declined to comment on the
case after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A botnet is a collection of computers &#8220;running software
that allows communication among those computers and that allows
centralized or decentralized communication with other computers
providing control instructions,&#8221; according to Microsoft&#8217;s
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Same Codes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Botnets running Zeus software share the same code and
infrastructure, according to the complaint. The names of the
botnets&#8217; creators are unknown, according to the complaint. No
defendants&#8217; representatives appeared at today&#8217;s hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the raids this month marked the second time
it has conducted physical seizures in a botnet operation. Some
Zeus botnet computers are in the Eastern District of New York,
the U.S. jurisdiction that includes the Brooklyn federal court,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also said it believed the lawsuit is the first
to use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
against a botnet operation. The federal RICO law was passed to
fight organized crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs joining Microsoft in the case are Reston,
Virginia-based FS-ISAC Inc., which represents banks and other
financial-services companies in combating cyber threats, and
Herndon, Virginia-based National Automated Clearing House
Association, which manages the ACH Network, &#8220;the backbone for
the electronic movement of money and data,&#8221; according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. v. John Does 1-39, 12-cv-01335,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) should
stop promoting itself as &#8220;putting customers first&#8221; because the
slogan ignores conflicts inherent in trading, said Arthur Levitt, the former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman
and a senior adviser to the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We probably ought to stop saying that because nobody
really puts customers first,&#8221; Levitt, 81, said in an interview
with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television today. &#8220;Business is
a tension between sellers and buyers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our clients&#8217; interests always come first,&#8221; has been the
No. 1 business policy at New York-based Goldman Sachs since the
late 1970s, when then co-Chairman John C. Whitehead drafted a
set of 14 business principles to guide the firm. Levitt&#8217;s
suggestion comes 14 months after a committee on which he served
issued a &#8220;business standards&#8221; report that reaffirmed Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s commitment to putting clients&#8217; interests first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman shouldn&#8217;t play to that,&#8221; Levitt said in the
interview today. &#8220;Goldman should play to their competence,
which is considerable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
criticized by former derivatives salesman Greg Smith in a March
14 opinion piece in the New York Times for failing to live up to
its principle of putting clients first. Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn responded that
Smith&#8217;s assertions &#8220;do not reflect our values, our culture and
how the vast majority of people at Goldman Sachs think about the
firm and the work it does on behalf of clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Alliance Oil Co., (AOIL) a Stockholm-
listed producer and refiner that operates in Russia, fell the
most in seven months after JPMorgan  Co. (JPM) said production has
slipped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares declined 6.6 percent in Stockholm, the most since
Aug. 19. The company&#8217;s output fell 9 percent in the first two
months of the year from the fourth quarter, led by the
Kolvinskoye field, JPMorgan analyst Andrey Gromadin said, citing
statistics from InfoTEK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the field production problems are not fixed quickly
enough, it would mean a material downside to this year&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;European officials must focus on
policies to boost growth or the euro area will face a
&#8220;perpetual problem,&#8221; said Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve got to shift their attention away from just
austerity,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television today in Cernobbio, Italy. &#8220;There has to be
something to get more broad growth, otherwise it&#8217;s going to be a
perpetual problem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European finance ministers are meeting in Copenhagen today
as they seek to balance international demands for a more
powerful war chest with opposition in donor countries led by
Germany to providing additional aid for underperforming
countries on Europe&#8217;s fringes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas some countries such as Italy are showing &#8220;genuine
signs&#8221; of structural reform, there are &#8220;many ongoing
problems&#8221; in the rest of the euro area, O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a hint that Italy has been stabilizing but we do
need more than that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Short of something coming from
the rest of the world as an external stimulus it&#8217;s tough to see
a lot of growth in Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill said that recovery in the U.S. may help drive
global growth and that the country&#8217;s housing market &#8220;is
turning.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.S. has got some legs for at least for the next
couple of quarters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Big picture, there remain all
sorts of issues but I think the U.S. is going to continue to
positively surprise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s
largest entertainment company, will team up with DeNA Co. (2432) to
offer social games featuring the U.S. company&#8217;s characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The games will be introduced globally through DeNA&#8217;s Mobage
social-gaming platform, Burbank, California-based Disney&#8217;s Japan
unit and Tokyo-based DeNA said in a statement today. The first
game, called Disney Party, was introduced in Japan this week,
they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is trying to expand in Japan and began offering its
Disney Mobile service using NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437)&#8217;s network in
February, after starting a similar service with Softbank Corp. (9984)
in 2008. Disney and DeNA will introduce the game Disney Fantasy
Quest in Japan in April and a title based on Marvel Comics
characters this summer, the companies said in today&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Localized versions of the three games will be introduced as
smartphone apps on Mobage networks in North America, Europe,
China and South Korea after July, and the two companies are
considering developing additional titles for the worldwide
market, they said. They also plan to extend the partnership
beyond games to Disney movies, TV shows and smartphone apps, the
companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobage has more than 35 million users in Japan, according
to today&#8217;s statement. DeNA generated sales of more than $1.3
billion in the year ended March 2011, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeNA, Japan&#8217;s biggest social-network website operator, fell
2 percent to 2,293 yen at the close in Tokyo trading before the
announcement. The stock has declined 0.7 percent this year
compared with the 17 percent gain in the Topix Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diageo Plc (DGE), the world&#8217;s largest
liquor maker, appointed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) for advice on gaining control of Jose Cuervo from
family owners, people familiar with the plans said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuervo, owned by Mexico&#8217;s Beckmann family, is expected to
be valued at more than $3 billion and family sellers may gain
cash or shares in Diageo as part of the deal, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diageo, the maker of Johnnie Walker Scotch and Smirnoff
vodka, has an option to buy the company because of its
international distribution rights to the Cuervo brand, a person
with knowledge of the discussions said in May. Diageo&#8217;s
agreement to distribute Cuervo in countries outside Mexico
expires in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions between Diageo and Beckmann family members may
not lead to a deal because it&#8217;s unclear whether all of the
family members are committed to a process, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Diageo declined to comment, as did
spokesmen for Goldman and HSBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diageo, based in London, is pushing into emerging markets
and last year acquired Turkey&#8217;s Mey Icki to add the country&#8217;s
largest maker of Raki liquor for about $2.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supply, notably around the agave plant used to make
tequila, are among issues being discussed, one of the people
said. A competitor, Brown-Forman Corp. (BF/A), in 2007 gained agave
plants through the purchase of Mexico&#8217;s Grupo Industrial
Herradura SA, maker of Herradura and El Jimador tequilas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Agave &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown-Forman in 2008 wrote down the value of dead agave
plants, used to make tequila, due to weather, insects and
disease, a spokesman said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Walsh, Diageo&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in an
interview with the Wall Street Journal on March 26 that he
&#8220;wouldn&#8217;t take anything less than control, or a route to
control,&#8221; when asked about Cuervo. Walsh has previously said
Diageo wouldn&#8217;t distribute the brand under the same terms after
the agreement lapses, and would seek a more lucrative agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of Jose Cuervo works out to about $3.1 billion,
Melissa Earlam, an analyst at UBS AG in London, wrote in a note
published on March 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An all-stock deal would be mostly neutral to Diageo&#8217;s
earnings per share in the second year, while a cash deal would
be about 3 percent accretive to EPS, the report shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuervo is a global leader in tequila with 19 percent volume
share, twice the size of Sauza, the No. 2 player owned by
Fortune Brands Inc., according to the UBS report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sunday Telegraph earlier reported Diageo hired Goldman
to finalize talks with Jose Cuervo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuervo is using Barclays Capital to explore options and
negotiate a potential sale, people familiar with the matter said
in May. &lt;/p&gt;

more oil and natural gas to help fuel the world&#8217;s second-biggest
economy, Chairman Jiang Jiemin told reporters after the earnings
report. The Hong Kong-listed company aims to spend at least $60
billion on global assets this decade to boost the share of
overseas output to half of total production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There isn&#8217;t enough organic growth that can support such a
growth, so PetroChina has to acquire the capacity through major
acquisitions,&#8221; said Neil Beveridge, a senior analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co. in Hong Kong. For PetroChina to reach its
overseas production goal, Beveridge said the company needs to
add capacity equivalent to that of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), which
produced a combined 3.2 million barrels a day of oil and gas
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PetroChina&#8217;s oil and gas production outside China rose 18
percent last year, five times faster than that of domestic
fields, data from the company&#8217;s earnings statement show.
Overseas output climbed to 120.8 million barrels, less than a
tenth of the total of 1.3 billion barrels, or 3.5 million
barrels a day of oil and gas. Based on both crude and gas, Exxon
Chairman Rex Tillerson said on a teleconference March 8 that his
company remains the biggest listed producer at 4.5 million
barrels equivalent a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While PetroChina has emerged as the top publicly traded oil
producer, the company still has &#8220;huge&#8221; potential to expand its
output, Jiang said. Unlisted Saudi Arabian Oil Co. produces
almost 10 million barrels a day of crude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is leading a
group bidding for Edinburgh airport, the Sunday Times reported,
without saying how it obtained the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea&#8217;s Incheon International Airport Corp. and TIAA-CREF
have joined JPMorgan in the bid to buy the airport, the
newspaper said. The group is competing with Global
Infrastructure Partners Ltd., the Sunday Times said. &lt;/p&gt;
