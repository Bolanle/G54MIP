<p>Morgans Hotel Group Co. was sued by
a company director seeking to block a recapitalization tied to
Yucaipa Cos.'' acquisition of one of Morgan''s properties. </p>
<p>Jason Kalisman, a Morgans director and a founding member of
its largest shareholder, OTK Associates, sued the company today
seeking to block the recapitalization until the case is heard
before a Delaware judge. Yucaipa was also named in the lawsuit,
which was sealed except for a cover sheet with a brief
description of the claim filed in Delaware Chancery Court. </p>
<p>Kalisman''s suit also seeks to invalidate decisions to
approve the recapitalization transaction and to set a new
annual meeting date, according to the cover sheet. </p>
<p>Officials of New York-based Morgans said in a statement
today they had agreed to swap the ownership of its Delano South
Beach Hotel in Miami and a restaurant company for Yucaipa''s
investments in Morgans''s convertible notes and preferred stock. </p>
<p>The hotel company''s executives also said they will make a
$100 million rights offering available to shareholders, which
Yucaipa, billionaire Ron Burkle''s investment firm, will backstop
with no fees if the rights are not exercised in full. </p>
<p>Frank Quintero, a Yucaipa spokesman, didn''t immediately
return calls and e-mails seeking comment on the court filing.
Neil Maitland, an outside spokesman for Morgans at New York-
based Abernathy MacGregor Group, declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Board Fight </h2>
<p>OTK, which said in a March 18 statement it owns about
14 percent of Morgans''s shares, is seeking to overhaul the board
to return the company to profitability. The company has lost
money in every quarter since 2007, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>OTK has nominated seven board candidates to be considered
by investors at the company''s May 15 annual meeting, according
to the release. OTK officials contend the current board has
engaged in a number of self-serving transactions and
questionable employment decisions, according to the March 18
statement. </p>
<p>In his suit, Kalisman wants a judge to bar a bid by
Morgans''s board to push the annual meeting back to July 10 and
change the record date for determining which stockholders can
vote from March 22 to May 29, according to court filings. </p>
<p>Kalisman declined to comment. Dan Gagnier, a spokesman for
OTK at Sard Verbinnen  Co., couldn''t be reached for comment on
the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The case is Kalisman v. Friedman, CA 8447, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is developing an
excavation and removal plan for a damaged section of its 96,000-
barrel-a-day Pegasus crude pipeline, which was shut after a leak
was discovered in Arkansas on March 29. </p>
<p>The company said it collected about 12,000 barrels of oil
and water from the spill, classified as major by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, according to a statement from
the Mayflower Incident Unified Command Joint Information Center.
Local officials recommended 22 homes closest to the leak remain
evacuated. </p>
<p>We didn''t really update it much beyond yesterday, so
we''re using 12,000 (barrels of oil and water mixture), hopefully
we can get a newer number tomorrow, said Charlie Engelmann, a
spokesman for Exxon, by phone. We''ve been continuing our
cleanup efforts, without a question. Engelmann said he
couldn''t speculate on timing for repairs to the line. </p>
<p>The line shutdown may limit flow of crude from western
Canada and the U.S. Midwest, exacerbating a glut of oil in the
area. Domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate weakened $1.22
today to $14.01 a barrel against Brent, the international
marker, from $12.79 on March 28, the smallest gap since July. </p>
<p>The 20-inch Pegasus line runs 940 miles (1,512 kilometers)
from Patoka, Illinois, to Nederland, Texas, and serves
refineries around Port Arthur and Beaumont, close to the
Louisiana line. There are four plants near the city able to
process about 1.4 million barrels a day of crude, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The sites are operated by Exxon,
Valero Energy Corp., Total SA and Motiva Enterprises LLC. </p>
<h2>Heavy Crude </h2>
<p>The line was carrying Wabasca Heavy Crude from western
Canada at the time of the incident, Kimberly Brasington, an
Exxon spokeswoman, said yesterday. Wabasca Heavy is a blend of
heavy oil produced in Alberta by Cenovus Energy, Canadian
Natural Resources and other companies that typically has about
4.15 percent sulfur and a 19-20 API gravity, according to Crude
Quality Inc. </p>
<p>Western Canada Select, a blend of heavy bitumen and diluent
that serves as a benchmark for Alberta tar sands formations,
slipped 65 cents a barrel to trade at a $15 discount to WTI at
4:57 p.m. New York time, according to data from Calgary energy
broker Net Energy. </p>
<p>Exxon didn''t offer a timeline for repairs to the line. The
rupture has been located and Exxon is awaiting regulatory
approval from the Department of Transportation to begin
excavation work and repairs, Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for the
company, said by phone yesterday. </p>
<h2>Oiled Ducks </h2>
<p>About 54 claims have been made, according to the joint
statement, and 10 ducks with oil on them have been recovered for
treatment, the statement showed. Two other ducks were found
dead. </p>
<p>A major spill in Michigan in July 2010 shut an Enbridge
Inc. crude pipeline for two months, and the cleanup still isn''t
complete. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last month
directed Enbridge to perform more dredging in Michigan''s
Kalamazoo River as part of a cleanup from a July 2010 rupture of
a 30-inch pipeline that also carried heavy crude. </p>
<p>Exxon was fined $26,200 in 2010 by the U.S. Department of
Transportation''s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration for failing to regularly inspect each point where
the Pegasus line crosses under a navigable waterway. PHMSA
specifically cited the line''s crossing under the Mississippi
River between Missouri and Illinois. </p>
<p>The Arkansas spill was estimated at a few thousand barrels,
according to a statement yesterday from the Mayflower Unified
Command Center, which includes Exxon, Faulkner County and the
city of Mayflower, Arkansas, said in a statement yesterday.
Exxon hasn''t stated the size of the spill. </p>
<p>Fifteen vacuum trucks and 33 storage tanks had been
deployed to the site of the spill to aid clean up efforts,
according to the Unified Command. Exxon has sent 120 workers in
response, and crews were steam-cleaning oil from property today,
according to the joint statement. </p>
<p>No oil had reached nearby Lake Conway, and cleanup crews
have deployed 3,600 feet of boom as a precaution, the command
said. </p>

<p>Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC), the
boutique-hotel operator under pressure from its largest
shareholder, said Yucaipa Cos. will swap interests in the
company''s convertible notes and preferred stock for its
ownership in the Delano South Beach and the Light Group. </p>
<p>Morgans will continue to manage Delano South Beach in Miami
Beach, Florida, as part of a long-term agreement, the company
said today in a statement. Morgans also said it will start a
$100 million rights offering available to shareholders, which
Yucaipa, billionaire Ron Burkle''s investment firm, will backstop
with no fees if the rights are not exercised in full. </p>
<p>Morgans, which put the Delano South Beach on the market
last year, has been selling real estate and using the proceeds
to expand its management operations. The deal with Yucaipa
follows a 15-month strategic review by a special committee of
the board, the New York-based company said. </p>
<p>We have transformed the company from an owner/operator of
hotels into a global brand and management company,  Chief
Executive Officer Michael Gross said on a conference call with
analysts. Today''s announcement marks the significant step
forward in realizing that strategy, allowing us to accelerate
the growth of our business, significantly reduce our risk
profile and enhance our ability to create long-term value for
all of our shareholders. </p>
<h2>Director Lawsuit </h2>
<p>Jason Taubman Kalisman, a director on Morgans''s board and a
founding member of its largest shareholder, OTK Associates,
today sued the company, seeking to block the planned
recapitalization until the case is heard before a Delaware
judge. Yucaipa was also named in the lawsuit, which was sealed
except for a cover sheet with a brief description of the claim. </p>
<p>OTK said last month it was seeking to overhaul the board,
aiming to return the company to profitability or have it pursue
strategic alternatives. Morgans has lost money in every quarter
since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Kalisman declined to comment. Dan Gagnier, a spokesman for
OTK at Sard Verbinnen  Co., couldn''t be reached for comment on
the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Morgans gained 4 percent today to $6.16, the highest
closing price since Dec. 19. </p>
<p>The company has eight signed management deals for hotels
that will start over the next three years, which, combined with
last September''s opening of Delano Marrakech, will almost double
the number of rooms under management, Gross said. The company is
in advanced discussions for deals in Los Angeles, Amsterdam,
Berlin, Paris, Rio de Janeiro and several cities in India, he
said. </p>
<h2>Debt Reduction </h2>
<p>The transactions announced today will reduce Morgans'' debt
and preferred stock obligations by $230 million, including the
elimination of $113 million of debt maturing in 2014, the
company said. After retiring the credit facility secured by
Delano South Beach, which has $35 million of outstanding
obligations, the company said it will have $65 million of cash
left from the rights offering. </p>
<p>Burkle is a member of Morgans''s board. Whether Yucaipa
continues to have representation on the board will depend on the
outcome of the rights offering, Gross said during the call with
analysts. </p>
<p>The transaction was negotiated through a special committee
of independent directors since Yucaipa is a creditor with board
representation, Gross said. The company also retained its own
independent financial and legal advisers to ensure we receive
fair value for our assets, he said. </p>
<p>Morgans acquired a 90 percent interest in the Light Group,
an operator of restaurants and nightclub bars, in 2011. The
transaction with Los Angeles-based Yucaipa is expected to be
completed in the second quarter, Morgans said. </p>

blockbuster Finding Nemo, with Ellen DeGeneres returning as
the voice of the forgetful blue tang fish. </p>
<p>The film is scheduled to reach theaters on Nov. 25, 2015,

statement. I''m not mad it took this long. I know the people at
Pixar were busy creating Toy Story 16.'' But the time they took

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) are finding ways to profit from Brazil''s 15-year
ban on municipal bond sales, issuing notes tied to state loans
guaranteed by the government. </p>
<p>The banks last month sold notes backed by a $1.27 billion
loan to the state of Minas Gerais yielding 4.216 percent. While
the securities were sold at a lower rate than the 5.33 percent
that Credit Suisse charged Minas Gerais in November and let the
state pay back a portion of the principal along with interest
payments, they yield 1.3 times more than similar-maturity
government bonds and carry the same guarantee. </p>
<p>Wall Street''s biggest banks are capitalizing on Brazil''s
decision in August to ease some restrictions on state borrowing
put in place after a $44 billion federal bailout in 1997 by
securitizing the loans they extend as local governments seek to
refinance bailout debt and fund investments. With virtually no
outstanding muni bonds in Brazil, the Minas Gerais notes have
risen 0.32 cent since they were issued at a premium of 109.18
cents on the dollar, according to Cantor Fitzgerald. </p>
<p>It''s clear that the market likes it, Ulisses de Oliveira, a money manager at Galloway Capital Management in Sao
Paulo who helps oversee $400 million of emerging-market debt,
said in a telephone interview. </p>

<p>Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC)''s largest
shareholder called a swap for a Florida hotel and a $100 million
rights offering insider dealings that would benefit board
member Ron Burkle''s investment firm. </p>
<p>The agreement with Burkle''s Yucaipa Cos., which would
acquire the Delano South Beach in exchange for interests in
Morgans''s convertible notes and preferred stock, follows a 15-
month strategic review by a special committee of the board, the
New York-based hotelier said yesterday. </p>
<p>The shareholder, OTK Associates LLC, questions whether
the board''s special committee has appropriately considered, in
earnest, alternatives to consummating yet another ill-timed
transaction with an interested party, especially given that two
of Morgans''s directors have a significant financial interest in
the transaction, according to a statement today. </p>
<p>OTK Associates said last month it was seeking to overhaul
Morgans''s board, aiming to return the company to profitability
or have it pursue strategic alternatives. Morgans, which put the
Delano South Beach on the market last year, has been selling
real estate and using the proceeds to expand its management
operations. </p>
<p>Jason Taubman Kalisman, a Morgans director and a founding
member of OTK Associates, sued the company yesterday, seeking to

before a Delaware judge. Yucaipa was also named in the lawsuit,
which was sealed except for a cover sheet with a brief
description of the claim. </p>
<h2>Voting Equity </h2>
<p>The rights offering would allow Yucaipa to amass a
significant voting equity position because existing
shareholders are unlikely to want to invest in the policies of
the existing management and board, OTK Associates said. </p>
<p>Lex Suvanto, a spokesman for Morgans at the Abernathy
MacGregor Group, declined to comment on the statement. </p>
<p>Whether Yucaipa gains or loses board seats would depend on
the outcome of the rights offering. Under the deal with Morgans,
the firm would backstop the offering with no fees if the rights
aren''t exercised in full. </p>
<p>The transactions were negotiated through a special
committee of independent directors because Yucaipa is a creditor

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) plans to develop
the world''s biggest floating liquefied natural gas project off
the coast of Western Australia as costs to build onshore plants
in the country surge. </p>
<p>Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, and partner BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) expect to decide whether to go ahead with the
Scarborough floating LNG venture in 2014 or 2015, with the
project starting production in 2020 or 2021, documents lodged on
the Australian Environment Department''s website show. </p>
<p>Energy companies from Royal Dutch Shell Plc to Malaysia''s
Petroliam Nasional Bhd. want to turn natural gas into liquid at
sea. In Australia, Shell is developing the Prelude floating LNG
vessel -- expected to be as long as the Empire State Building
and weigh six times as much as the biggest aircraft carrier --
after companies including Chevron Corp. (CVX) experienced budget
overruns at onshore LNG projects in the country. </p>
<p>A floating LNG facility has the potential to lower costs by
eliminating the need for pipelines to the coast and reduce the
venture''s environmental footprint, Jessica Warne, a
Melbourne-based spokeswoman for Exxon, said today by phone. </p>
<h2>Exxon''s Plans </h2>
<p>The Exxon project is expected to cost more than Deutsche
Bank AG''s $12 billion estimate for Prelude, John Hirjee, a
Melbourne-based analyst at the bank, said today by phone. </p>
<p>Exxon''s plan, which may change, would be to produce about 6
million metric tons to 7 million metric tons of LNG a year,
Warne said. Prelude is expected to produce at least 3.6 million
tons of LNG annually, according to its website. The development
is due to start in about 2017, Shell said in 2011. </p>
<p>Exxon''s floating plant in the Carnarvon Basin off northwest
Australia is expected to be about 495 meters (1,624 feet) long
and 75 meters wide, according to the filing. Prelude, expected
to be the world''s largest vessel, will be 488 meters long and 74
meters wide, Shell''s website shows. </p>
<p>About 12 production wells will be drilled in two phases,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in the documents. </p>
<p>The Hague-based Shell''s floating LNG venture will cost
$10.8 billion to $12.6 billion, according to figures the oil
company provided when it approved the project in 2011. Exxon''s
Warne declined to provide a cost estimate for Scarborough. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is halting video-
game development at its recently acquired Lucasfilm division in
an effort to cut costs. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, will
focus on licensing Star Wars content rather than developing
games internally, Miles Perkins, a Lucasfilm spokesman, said. </p>
<p>Disney acquired Lucasfilm, the business founded by director
George Lucas last year for about $4 billion. LucasArts, the
company''s video-game unit, was established in 1982 and its
catalog has included titles such as Lego Star Wars and
Star Wars Battlefront, according to its website. </p>
<p>Moving from internal development to licensing is designed
to minimize risk while achieving a broader portfolio of
quality Star Wars games, the company said in a statement. As
a result of this change, we''ve had layoffs across the
organization, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Perkins declined to say how many Lucasfilm jobs will be
affected. The company employs more than 1,800 people in San
Francisco and other locations, he said. Lucasfilm is looking for
external partners to complete games currently in development
such as Star Wars 1313, he said. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell less than 1

percent this year. </p>

defendants at the company''s expense because Burkle''s company
will acquire a large block of the company''s stock in a $6-a-
share rights offering, and Burkle is likely to be replaced
as a director at a May 15 shareholders'' meeting if the deal
isn''t finished beforehand, according to the complaint. That
meeting has been reset for July 10, a new filing says. </p>
<p>Yucaipa, based in Los Angeles, would acquire the Delano
South Beach hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, in exchange for
interests in Morgans convertible notes and preferred stock.
Yucaipa holds 51 percent, or $88 million, in company notes, and
Mr. Burkle has cemented his day-to-day control over the
company''s operations, according to the complaint. </p>
<h2>Company Survival </h2>
<p>In a motion today in opposition to expedited handling of
the case, Morgans said the transaction is critical to the
company''s survival and that Kalisman has not pled adequately
the irreparable harm necessary to warrant proceeding on the
schedule he seeks. </p>
<p>The company said the effort to delever the balance
sheet came about in part due to significant debt maturities
due in 2014, and that Yucaipa proposed to purchase the Delano
Hotel last July. </p>
<p>OTK Associates has said it wants to overhaul New York-based
Morgans''s board and return the company to profitability. </p>
<p>After learning of OTK''s bid for a new slate of directors,
current directors convened and rammed the transaction
through to put a substantial block of stock in friendly
hands prior to the annual meeting, plaintiff''s lawyer A.
Thompson Bayliss, said in a filing. </p>
<h2>No Guarantee </h2>
<p>Yucaipa is not guaranteed to obtain a large block of
stock as a result of the rights offering, Michael Pittenger, a
lawyer for Morgans, countered in its brief. </p>
<p>Kalisman asked Judge J. Travis Laster for an injunction
barring the recapitalization plan, invalidation of the March 30
vote, a declaration that Yucaipa abetted directors'' violations
of their duties, and unspecified damages on behalf of the
company. </p>
<p>Frank Quintero, a Yucaipa spokesman, didn''t immediately
return calls and e-mails seeking comment on the court filing. </p>
<p>Morgans fell 17 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $6.23 today in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have climbed 12 percent
this year. </p>
<p>The case is Kalisman v. Friedman, CA 8447, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, will pay closely held Bind Therapeutics Inc. as much
as $200 million per potential drug to develop medicines using
its nanotechnology platform. </p>
<p>The companies will collaborate on preclinical work and New
York-based Pfizer will have the option to pursue development of
compounds it selects, Bind said in a statement today. The
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company may receive as much as
$50 million in upfront and development payments and is eligible
for $160 million more per compound tied to regulatory and sales
goals. </p>
<p>The deal is the second this year for Bind, which uses
nanotechnology to selectively reach disease sites in the body in
treating cancer, inflammatory ailments and cardiovascular
disorders without affecting healthy tissue. In January, Amgen
Inc. said it would pay as much as $180.5 million for the right
to develop cancer drugs using Bind''s technology. </p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry is reaching an inflection
point in terms of adopting this as a major strategic technology
for the industry, Bind Chief Executive Officer Scott Minick
said in an interview. </p>
<p>Bind''s technology comes from the laboratories of Robert
Langer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Omid Farokhzad, of Harvard Medical School. Its nanoparticles, which
it calls Accurins, can travel through the body without being
detected or destroyed by the immune system, Minick said.
Carrying potent drugs, the particles home in on specific disease
cells and avoid poisoning healthy ones. </p>
<h2>Results Expected </h2>
<p>In addition to partnerships with Pfizer and Thousand Oaks,
California-based Amgen, Bind is developing a slate of potential
drugs in-house. The company''s leading therapy is BIND-014, which
targets tumors with the cancer drug docetaxel. Bind said last
week it will present results from a first-stage study of the
treatment at the American Association for Cancer Research
meeting on April 9. </p>
<p>Pfizer partnered with Bind because these delivery systems
are a unique approach that potentially offer highly precise
targeted therapeutics increasing the window for broader patient
treatment options, said Lauren Starr, a spokeswoman for the
drugmaker. </p>
<p>Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $29.03 at the close
in New York. The shares have increased 16 percent this year. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, defeated most of a lawsuit brought by Dexia SA over
about $1.6 billion in mortgage-backed securities it bought
before the financial crisis. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan narrowed the
case to five securitization deals from 65 at issue in a
complaint brought by Dexia, according to an order filed today.
Rakoff said he would issue an opinion later explaining his
reasoning. </p>
<p>Dexia, based in Brussels, sued JPMorgan in 2012 along with
the Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual businesses JPMorgan
acquired, accusing the lender of egregious fraud in the sale
of mortgage bonds. Dexia claimed loans backing securities
purchased between 2005 and 2007 were riskier than promised. </p>
<p>Dexia (DEXB) unit FSA Asset Management LLC said in court papers
that JPMorgan received reports from independent mortgage-loan
underwriters showing that 20 percent to 80 percent of the loans
in samples used for testing didn''t meet the underwriting
guidelines, including fraudulent home appraisals or missing
documentation. </p>
<p>Rather than disclose these known defects to FSAM,
defendants bought and sold massive quantities of defective
loans, FSAM said. Defendants secretly overrode the
independent loan underwriters'' determinations, creating a final,
sanitized version. </p>
<p>Rakoff granted part of JPMorgan''s motion for a pre-trial
ruling known as summary judgment. The judge dismissed claims
brought by Dexia and said FSAM can pursue claims related to five
securitizations. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn''t immediately comment about the decision. A
lawyer for Dexia couldn''t be reached for comment. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s fund
management arm is overweight on Slovenia''s bonds and may buy
more as it believes the challenges facing the Alpine nation
won''t force the sovereign into debt restructuring. </p>
<p>Yields on Slovenian dollar-denominated notes due 2022 fell
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to a one-week low
of 5.9 percent by 4:07 p.m. in Ljubljana, 48 basis points below
last week''s record high, according to data complied by
Bloomberg. The country''s bonds tumbled over the last two weeks
on speculation it may be the next euro member to ask for a
bailout after Cyprus''s emergency tax plans soured sentiment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management may expand its modest
overweight position in Slovene bonds if the selloff caused by
ripples from Cypriot efforts to obtain aid resumes, according to
Sam Finkelstein, a money manager who helps manage $40 billion in
emerging-market debt at the company. While Slovenia''s banks are
saddled with bad debts amid a second recession since 2009, the
financial industry is less bloated then in some European Union
peers, he said in an interview. </p>
<p>It''s a very solid investment story and not the same
issues that faced either Greece or Cyprus, Finkelstein said by
phone from London today. If there is further contagion, we''d
be looking to buy that dip. </p>
<p>Slovenia''s crisis isn''t insurmountable, Bostjan Jazbec,
approved by lawmakers as Slovenia''s next central bank president
this week, said in an interview yesterday. </p>
<p>While the country faces a number of challenges and has
a weak coalition government, its banking sector is not
large compared to other EU members and debt-to-GDP is low,
Finkelstein said. The remedy to their challenges is not a
haircut to the government debt. So I''m very comfortable with an
investment in Slovenia. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) plans to keep its $3.2
billion-a-year consumer health business because the unit will be
critical to selling prescription drugs that become over-the-
counter products, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said. </p>
<p>The unit that makes ChapStick lip balm, Advil pain pills
and Centrum vitamins will absolutely stay within New York-
based Pfizer, Read told investors on a conference call arranged
by Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. last week. Medicines shifting to
nonprescription status will be a growing trend, he said. </p>
<p>It''s a business that has a great store of value for us,
Read said on the March 26 call. A recording of the call was
posted online. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, has been shrinking
since Read took over in late 2010, cutting expenses and
divesting its animal health and infant nutrition units. The CEO
has talked about splitting the drug business in two, with one
unit focusing on brand-name medicines and another on those that
don''t have patent protection. </p>
<p>Pfizer does still very much seem to be contemplating this
possibility, but no firm decision has been made yet, said Tim Anderson, a Bernstein analyst, said in a note to clients after
the call. </p>
<p>The drugmaker''s shares rose less than 1 percent to close at
$29.16 in New York. The stock had gained 30 percent in the last
12 months. </p>
<p>The consumer business is headed by Amy Schulman, who also
serves as general counsel and ran the infant nutrition business
until it was sold to Nestle SA (NESN) last year for $11.9 billion. </p>
<h2>Unlock Value </h2>
<p>I do see the synergies with the branded and the generics
part of the business -- much more so than existed with animal
health or with nutritionals, said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst
at New York-based International Strategy  Investment Group Inc.
said in e-mail. Still, a separation could unlock a bit of
value. </p>
<p>If Pfizer chooses to split the company in two, the consumer
unit might be bundled with its generic-drug business, he said. </p>
<p>Pfizer has been trying to expand the consumer line. In
August, the company bought the rights to sell AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)''s
heartburn pill Nexium over the counter. Pfizer paid $250 million
up front, and will pay royalties once the drug goes on sale,
likely in the U.S. about 2014. The company has also said it may
try and develop a nonprescription version of the cholesterol
pill Lipitor, which was once Pfizer''s best-selling product. </p>
<h2>Comfortable Fit </h2>
<p>It in many ways has a very comfortable fit within our
current platform, Schulman said on the investor call. It''s
also an important harbinger of where the market is going. </p>
<p>In emerging markets, prescription drugs will be more
readily available over the counter than they will be in the
U.S., Read predicted. </p>
<p>You could potentially see emerging markets moving faster
on this OTC switch than the very cautious U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, Read said. </p>
<p>Drugmaker Merck  Co. (MRK) is evaluating its consumer unit
because it may not be big enough, Merck CEO Ken Frazier said at
a January investor conference. The Whitehouse Station, New
Jersey-based company got $1.95 billion in sales from the
business last year, with more than a quarter of that coming from
allergy medicine Claritin OTC. </p>
<p>Schulman said that Pfizer''s business, which is larger than
Merck''s, has enough depth in the products and geographies in
which it chooses to sell. I think we have scale in the areas
in which we compete, she said. </p>

<p>Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, will join 70 other
companies, including Australia''s BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP), the world''s
largest mining company, and Japanese commodities trader Mitsui 
Co. Ltd. (8031), to register for an oil block auction scheduled for May
14 and 15, according to a copy of the list seen by Bloomberg
News. </p>
<p>Other companies that will seek to start producing oil in
Brazil include Cnooc Ltd. (883), Premier Oil Plc (PMO), JX Nippon Oil  Gas
Exploration Corp, Panoro Energy ASA (PEN), Hess Corp. (HES), GDF Suez (GSZ) and
Petroliam Nasional Bhd., according to the list. </p>
<p>Brazil hasn''t auctioned oil blocks since 2008. While the
country is home to the world''s largest oil discoveries this
century after finding the so-called pre-salt reserves under the
Atlantic ocean in 2006, the blocks being auctioned in May are
not part of the same geological formation. </p>
<p>The blocks that will be made available for the companies
are located off Brazil''s northeastern and northern coasts, while
the pre-salt finds are off the coasts of the southeast states of
Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Espirito Santo. </p>
<p>Exxon quit its only Brazilian block last year after
drilling three dry holes in deep waters. </p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), BP Group Plc and Statoil ASA (STL) are
among companies that already have production operations in
Brazil that are also competing, as are Total SA (FP) and Repsol SA,

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) may have to face
lawsuits by insurers alleging the company improperly marketed
the epilepsy drug Neurontin after an appeals court found the
cases were improperly denied class-action status. </p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston yesterday found a
lower-court judge erred in refusing to allow so-called third-
party payers, such as health insurers and union funds, to
combine their Neurontin racketeering claims. The appeals court
also upheld a $142.1 million damage award to Kaiser Foundation
Health Plan Inc. over Pfizer''s Neurontin marketing. </p>
<p>We reject the argument that Kaiser''s lawyers didn''t
produce sufficient evidence to uphold the jury verdict, the
court said in a 64-page ruling. </p>
<p>The decision allows hundreds of U.S. health plans to revive
potential class-action racketeering claims that the world''s
largest drugmaker engaged in illegal off-label marketing of
Neurontin for bipolar disorders, said Carl Tobias, who teaches
product-liability law at the University of Richmond in Virginia.
They are telling the judge to take another look at the class-
certification issue, Tobias said. </p>
<p>Pfizer officials said they are considering appealing the
today''s rulings in the Neurontin cases. </p>
<h2>No Basis'' </h2>
<p>Pfizer continues to believe there was no basis in fact or
law for the Kaiser verdict, Chris Loder, a spokesman for the
New York-based company, said in an e-mailed statement. The
drugmaker also contends the trial judge correctly ruled the
insurers shouldn''t be able to proceed as a class with their
claims. </p>
<p>Pfizer and its Warner-Lambert unit are accused in the
insurers'' lawsuits of promoting the drug for uses that weren''t
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to boost
profit. The insurers contend they were duped into covering
Neurontin prescriptions for unapproved ailments, such as bipolar
disorder. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s Warner-Lambert subsidiary pleaded guilty in 2004
to criminal charges filed by the U.S. Justice Department and
paid $430 million to resolve allegations over the company''s
Neurontin marketing. Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert for $120
billion in 2000. </p>
<p>Neurontin''s sales rose from 15 percent off-label in 1994 to
94 percent in 2002, the government said in court filings. The
drug''s sales hit $2.3 billion in 2002. </p>
<h2>Combine Claims </h2>
<p>The insurers sought to combine claims that Pfizer engaged
in racketeering through its Neurontin marketing. U.S. District
Judge Patti Saris denied that request, ruling the plans couldn''t
show Pfizer''s actions caused their damages and therefore weren''t
entitled to have a class-action case certified, according to
court filings. </p>
<p>The appeals court panel, which included retired Supreme
Court Judge David Souter, concluded the plans presented
sufficient evidence to show Pfizer''s illegal Neurontin marketing
caused the insurers'' damages. The panel sent the case back to
Saris to revive the racketeering claims and to reexamine whether
the cases should be certified as a class action. </p>
<p>We express no view as to whether the plaintiffs can, on
remand, meet the requirements for having their cases combined,
the court said. </p>
<p>In the Kaiser case, a federal court jury in Boston
concluded in 2010 Pfizer violated federal racketeering laws
through its Neurontin marketing and it awarded $47.4 million in
damages. </p>
<p>Saris later tripled the award under a provision of the
racketeering statutes. The claims were brought by the Kaiser
Foundation plan and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. Both are units
of Oakland, California-based insurer Kaiser Permanente. </p>
<p>The cases are In RE Neurontin Marketing and Sales Practices
Litigation, 11-1806, 11-1904 and 11-2096, United States Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit (Boston). </p>

<p>Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC) today agreed
to postpone a $6-a-share rights offering until at least May 16,
while dissident investors seek to block a recapitalization plan
with billionaire Ron Burkle''s Yucaipa Cos., court papers show. </p>
<p>OTK Associates LLC, Morgans''s largest shareholder,
yesterday asked a Delaware Chancery Court judge for permission
to join a lawsuit challenging the board''s approval of the plan. </p>
<p>OTK, owner of 13.9 percent of Morgans''s outstanding common
shares, said the vote was designed to dilute its stake and
disrupt a proxy contest the firm was pursuing. </p>
<p>Jason Taubman Kalisman, a Morgans director and co-founder
of OTK, alleged in a complaint unsealed this week that the vote
was invalid because inadequate notice was given of a March 30
directors'' committee meeting. </p>
<p>OTK seeks to protect its interests, and the interests of
all Morgans'' stockholders in meaningful exercise of its voting
rights, and to prosecute certain board members for their
breaches of fiduciary duty, OTK said in a filing yesterday in
Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington. </p>
<p>OTK said in March that it planned to nominate seven
directors to the boutique-hotel operator''s board. OTK accused
the current board of engaging in self-serving deals. </p>
<h2>Swap Interests </h2>
<p>Morgans, based in New York, said April 1 that Los Angeles-
based Yucaipa will swap interests in the company''s convertible
notes and preferred stock for its ownership in the Delano South
Beach hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, and the Light Group. </p>
<p>Yucaipa will also backstop the $100 million, $6-a-share
rights offering available to shareholders with no fees if the
rights aren''t fully exercised, Morgans said. </p>
<p>OTK and Kalisman accused Morgans''s directors of rushing to
complete the deal before a stockholders meeting initially
scheduled for May 15 and now scheduled for July 10. </p>
<p>In a filing today, Morgan lawyer Raymond DiCamillo asked
Chancery Judge J. Travis Laster to schedule a hearing on a
preliminary injunction before May 15. </p>
<p>The case is Kalisman v. Friedman, 8447, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
forecast for U.S. natural gas futures for the remainder of this
year on a tightening shift in market fundamentals after
temperatures fell last month. </p>
<p>Futures in New York will average $4.40 per million British
thermal units for the balance of 2013, Goldman said in a report
e-mailed today. That''s a 17 percent increase from its previous
forecast of $3.75. Cold weather in the U.S. reduced inventories
to 1.7 trillion cubic feet at the end of last month, from 2.5
trillion a year ago, according to the bank. </p>
<p>We believe the need for more production and less need for
coal-to-gas switching will allow prices to move higher, said
Johan Spetz, a commodity analyst at Goldman in New York. A
return to growing production is required to balance the market
after this summer. </p>
<p>Benchmark natural gas futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange climbed 15 percent in March, the most in half a year,
as cold weather increased demand and drained stockpiles in the
U.S. The contract for May delivery was at $3.96 per million
British thermal units, up 0.3 percent, in electronic trading on
Nymex today. </p>
<p>Goldman also opened a trading recommendation to buy call
options on gas for November 2013 at $4.20 per million British
thermal units. The bank maintained its forecast for 2014 at
$4.25, citing a possible increase in supply. </p>
<p>We believe prices are likely to face resistance above
$4.25 in the near term as coal-to-gas switching is still needed
to balance the market, Spetz said. Net, we expect U.S.
natural gas production to be flat year-on-year in 2013 before
returning to close to 2 billion cubic feet a day growth in 2014
year-on-year. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will use an Advanced
Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) processor in its next Xbox game console as it
seeks to cut the cost of building machines and get developers to
create more titles, people with knowledge of the matter said.
AMD surged the most in almost two years. </p>
<p>The Xbox will use an AMD system-on-a-chip that combines
powerful Jaguar central processing units with graphics
chips, said one of the people, who sought anonymity because the
plans aren''t public. The shift to the so-called x86 format
ubiquitous in modern personal computers means Microsoft will
drop the Power PC technology designed by International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM), and game discs made for the current Xbox 360
won''t be compatible. </p>
<p>The switch is a boon for AMD, which is also providing chips
for Sony Corp. (6758)''s coming PlayStation 4, as it seeks a larger
slice of the $67 billion global video-game market to help lessen
its reliance on the shrinking PC industry. Microsoft also stands
to benefit because game developers, who have moved toward making
games for PCs and mobile devices, will find it easier to deliver
those titles for the next Xbox. </p>
<p>We''ll probably see many more titles because the console
makers are saying the publishers are back in the driver''s
seat, said Richard Doherty, president of technology consulting
firm Envisioneering Group. Developers won''t have to reinvent
various features, such as smoke, shading and reflections for
each machine and can essentially create once and port once, and
be done. </p>

<p>General Electric Co. (GE) is tapping
proceeds from the sale of NBC to fund its $3.3 billion purchase
of Lufkin Industries Inc. (LUFK) as Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt takes advantage of an oil-drilling boom. </p>
<p>Oil and gas has become GE''s fastest-growing segment with
sales since 2009 up 57 percent to $15.2 billion amid a shale-oil
boom poised to make the U.S. the world''s largest crude producer.
Revenue at Lufkin, which makes artificial lift equipment that
brings crude and other materials to the surface, rose 37 percent
last year to $1.3 billion. </p>
<p>They''re buying the synergies, the growth, said Brian Finneran, an analyst at William Blair  Co. in New York, which
rates GE market perform. It''s a hot space. They''ve done a
couple deals in the past there. </p>
<p>Buying companies like the oil machinery-maker is a
component of Immelt''s strategy to expand in manufacturing while
shrinking GE Capital after the global financial crisis. GE''s new
three-year incentive plan rewards the CEO in part for increasing
industrial profit, heightening the motive to spend some of the
$16.7 billion in cash from NBC for deals. </p>
<p>GE agreed to sell its 49 percent stake in NBC Universal to
Comcast Corp. on Feb. 12 and announced plans to increase the
size of its share repurchase program the same day. The
divestiture also gave the company the flexibility to do more

<p>A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit is
joining firms from Ares Capital Corp. (ARCC) to Fifth Street Finance
Corp. (FSC) in raising about $2 billion to lend to companies unable to
tap public markets as investors seek to extract high yields. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Liberty Harbor Capital LLC, which is
organized as a so-called business-development company and
primarily lends to companies earning less than $75 million,
plans to raise money in an initial public offering, according to
a March 29 regulatory filing. Last week, New York-based Ares
Capital, the largest BDC, raised about $290 million by selling
shares, while Garrison Capital Inc. completed its IPO. Fifth
Street Finance said it may raise $1 billion. </p>
<p>The flurry underscores the lengths investors are willing to
go to in order to generate returns as the Federal Reserve keeps
benchmark interest rates near zero for a fifth year. While the
debt the BDCs are buying generate yields of 10 percent or more,
it doesn''t typically trade. </p>
<p>Banks have largely abandoned the field in direct lending
to the mid-market and it''s been taken over in the last few years
by BDCs and private funds, Nicholas Marshi, the chief
investment officer at Southland Capital Management, said in a
telephone interview from Santa Monica, California. Marshi
manages funds that invest in BDCs. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) doesn''t
have to face Capmark Financial Group Inc.''s $147 million lawsuit
claiming it was improperly influenced by the bank to refinance
$1.5 billion in unsecured debt in a way that improved its
position as a creditor, a judge said. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan yesterday
ruled that  Capmark, which sued Goldman in 2011, can''t recover
the money. Horsham, Pennsylvania-based Capmark claimed the sum
was an insider preference paid to Goldman within a year of the
Capmark bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Sweet said Capmark can''t claim the presence of a Goldman
employee on its board means that the New York-based bank must
return the $147 million because that argument contradicts its
earlier position in the bankruptcy case. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs represented to the Delaware bankruptcy court
that the secured credit facility was negotiated at arm''s
length,'' Sweet said in a decision made public today.
Plaintiffs now assert a claim that requires the secured credit
facility to have been a non-arms-length transaction. </p>
<p>Capmark, the commercial lender once a part of the former
General Motors Corp., exited bankruptcy in September 2011, co-
owned by lower-ranking creditors, some of whom fought in
bankruptcy court with Goldman Sachs over the refinancing and the
payments to the bank. </p>
<h2>Capmark''s Claim </h2>
<p>Capmark claimed that while the bank owned part of it in May
2009, a group of Goldman Sachs units used their influence to
persuade Capmark to refinance $1.5 billion in unsecured debt
owed the firm. The refinancing allowed Goldman Sachs to collect
$147 million, including $7 million in cash, based on the new
secured loan, according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Adam Shiff, a lawyer for Capmark, didn''t immediately return
a voice-mail message seeking comment on Sweet''s ruling. </p>
<p>Capmark filed bankruptcy on Oct. 25, 2009, blaming falling
property values and a drop in lending. </p>
<p>The case is Capmark Financial Group Inc. (CPMK) v. Goldman Sachs
Credit Partners LP, 11-cv-07511, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) failed to
win dismissal of a lawsuit claiming it engaged in fraud and
racketeering in selling $375 million of residential mortgage-
backed securities to Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton in Newark, New Jersey,
ruled today that Prudential, the second-largest U.S. life
insurer, sufficiently pleaded its claims that Goldman
misrepresented its underwriting standards and practices. Goldman
will have other opportunities to seek dismissal of the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Prudential, based in Newark, bought securities from Goldman
in 16 deals, according to Wigenton''s opinion. </p>
<p>Goldman, based in New York, asked the judge to dismiss the
complaint, arguing that Prudential didn''t adequately state its
case for fraud and racketeering. </p>
<p>Wigenton disagreed, ruling that Prudential adequately
pled a cause of action for fraud and sufficiently stated its
case that Goldman Sachs violated New Jersey''s civil anti-
racketeering statute. </p>
<p>The purchases were made from February 2004 to December
2008, according to the opinion. </p>
<p>The parties have not yet engaged in the pretrial exchange
of evidence. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Scot
Hoffman, a Prudential spokesman, declined to comment on the
ruling. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs also argued that New York law, not New Jersey
law, applies to the fraud and RICO claims. Wigenton ruled that
determining a choice of law at this stage is premature
regarding fraud claims. She made a similar ruling with regard to
the Goldman Sachs motion on the racketeering claim. </p>
<p>The case is Prudential Insurance Co. v. Goldman Sachs 
Company, 2:12-cv-06590, U.S. District Court, District of New
Jersey (Newark). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley''s Alex Glantz and

<p>Glantz, 42, and Davison, 41, will join Centerview Partners

<p>Morgan Stanley deferred all bonuses for employees who have
both total pay of more than $350,000 and incentive compensation
of at least $50,000, a person briefed on the matter said in
January. Compensation costs at the investment banking and

11 percent, excluding accounting charges. </p>
<p>The firm wasn''t alone in cutting and deferring pay last
year. Average 2012 pay for bankers in underwriting and advisory

Johnson Associates Inc. The report said bankers are more
reluctant to switch firms than in previous years. </p>

<p>A group representing Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT), Expedia Inc. (EXPE) and Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) filed an antitrust complaint
against Google Inc. (GOOG) over its Android operating system as part of
a campaign to force the European Union to fine or alter the
conduct of the owner of the world''s largest search engine. </p>
<p>FairSearch, a group of 17 technology and search companies,
said the EU should investigate Google''s deceptive conduct to
lockout competition in the mobile market with a goal to
cement its control over consumer Internet data for online
advertising as usage shifts to mobile. </p>
<p>Google is using its Android mobile operating system as a
Trojan Horse'' to deceive partners, monopolize the mobile
marketplace, and control consumer data, said Thomas Vinje, a
lawyer in Brussels who represents the FairSearch industry group.
Failure to act will only embolden Google to repeat its desktop
abuses of dominance as consumers increasingly turn to a mobile
platform dominated by Google''s Android. </p>
<p>The EU is already investigating Google''s search business
and the Mountain View, California-based company''s rivals have
made nearly weekly entreaties to the EU to take some action.
TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP) and Expedia led a group in March that wrote to
EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, and Microsoft days
later sent the EU a study questioning Google''s search results. </p>
<p>We continue to work cooperatively with the European
Commission, Al Verney, a Brussels-based spokesman for Google,
said in an e-mail today. </p>
<p>Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for Almunia, declined to
comment. </p>
<h2>Mobile Dominance </h2>
<p>According to FairSearch, Google''s Android system was used
as a smartphone operating system in 70 percent of handset units
shipped at the end of 2012. Google also dominates mobile search
advertising with 96 percent of the market, said FairSearch,
citing eMarketer. </p>
<p>Microsoft already has an antitrust complaint against Google
pending with the Brussels-based commission, alleging the company
promotes its own specialist search services, copies rivals''
travel and restaurant reviews, and discriminates against rivals. </p>
<p>The U.S. ended an investigation into Google''s search
business in January, saying there was no evidence that the
company''s actions harmed consumers. The commission, the EU''s
antitrust regulator, is seeking a deal with Google to end its
more than two-year-old probe into antitrust concerns with the
company''s search business. </p>
<h2>Copied Reviews </h2>
<p>Almunia last year asked Google to give him a detailed offer
to address allegations that it copies rivals'' travel and
restaurant reviews, and has agreements with websites and
software developers that stifle competition in the advertising
industry. </p>
<p>After receiving Google''s settlement offer in January,
Almunia said he hoped to check it with rivals and customers in
the coming months and finalize it later this year. </p>
<p>Almunia said in an interview with the New York Times
published yesterday that he expects new proposals from Google
this week to help with concerns over its search practices and
any changes the company proposed would be submitted to
competitors for comment. </p>
<p>Almunia said the company needed to offer the commission a
solution where choices between Google-branded search results and
those of its competitors were clearly visible within the search
engine both on desktop computers and on mobile devices, the
Times reported. </p>

<p>Rising stock prices, rebounding profits, restored dividends and a growing economy are signaling to U.S. banks it''s time for more job cuts. </p> <p>Even after the industry posted its best results since 2006, the six largest U.S. banks announced plans in the first three months of this year to eliminate about 21,000 positions, or 1.8 percent of their combined workforce, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That''s the most since 2011''s third quarter. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), whose 259,000 people produced three straight years of record profit, topped the list with 17,000 reductions scheduled by the end of 2014. </p> <p>Banks are under pressure to keep profit climbing amid weak revenue growth, and employees are among the biggest expenses after interest costs. The most vulnerable people work in units where demand is waning such as mortgage foreclosures. Their departures would come on top of 320,000 jobs culled from U.S. financial companies in the past five years, the data show. </p> <p>They have a better feel for what their business model looks like and they are starting to align headcount, said Robert Dicks, a principal at Deloitte  Touche LLP in New York who advises financial firms on staffing. We were out of whack for a couple of years, but we''re balanced right now. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s after-sales
service of its Surface tablet has attracted criticism from
China''s state-owned radio, following similar reports in the past
month targeting Apple Inc. (AAPL) </p>
<p>The Surface Pro should follow the nation''s law requiring
notebook computers to have a one-year repair warranty for the
whole device and a two-year warranty for main parts, as compared
with the company''s one-year pledge for both, China National
Radio reported yesterday. Joanna Li, a Beijing-based spokeswoman
for Microsoft, said she couldn''t immediately comment on the
report today. </p>
<p>The criticism by China National Radio may be the opening
shot against the world''s largest software maker, similar to what
Apple faced in the past month, said Doug Young, author of the
book The Party Line: How the Media Dictates Public Opinion in
Modern China. After a March 15 report by China Central
Television criticized Apple''s customer service, the People''s
Daily published more than a dozen articles on the subject. </p>
<p>It sounds potentially worrisome; it looks a copycat of
the whole Apple thing, Young said. China National Radio is
trying to jump on the same bandwagon, he said. </p>
<p>Most western companies already provide much better after-
sales service than Chinese companies, Young said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reached an
agreement with an investor for the second straight year to drop
a proposal from its annual meeting that called for an
independent board chairman. </p>
<p>The investment bank instead will give expanded
responsibilities to its lead independent director, James Schiro,
who will set the board''s agenda and write his own letter to
shareholders in the annual proxy statement, New York-based
Goldman Sachs said. In exchange, shareholder CtW Investment
Group will withdraw a proposal to split the roles of chief
executive officer and chairman. </p>
<p>We''ve had a constructive engagement with our
shareholders, and believe that the enhancements we have made
further solidify the independence of the board, David Wells, a
Goldman Sachs spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The deal allows CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, who also has
been chairman since he took control in 2006, to avoid a battle
over dual roles that JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s Jamie Dimon, 57,
faces. That bank''s board urged investors to vote against naming
a separate chairman at next month''s shareholder meeting, saying
Dimon''s dual role remains the most effective leadership
model. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, 54, and Wells Fargo

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world''s
largest entertainment company, cut 150 jobs from its film studio
as part of a cost review, according to a person with knowledge
of the situation. </p>
<p>The firings amount to about 2 percent of the unit''s 7,000
jobs, said the person, who sought anonymity because the number
isn''t being publicly announced. Burbank, California-based Disney
announced the action in an e-mailed statement today. </p>
<p>The firings took place across various studio operations.
Disney has been releasing fewer films and selling fewer DVDs.
The cuts are in addition to those made earlier this year in its
interactive businesses, where console-based video games have
lost ground to mobile and Facebook games. </p>
<p>As part of an ongoing review to ensure that the studios''
operational structure and economics align with the demands of
the current marketplace, we have made the difficult decision to
reduce our staffing levels in several divisions of the studio,
the company said in the statement. </p>
<p>Disney is releasing 10 movies in 2013, down from 38 a
decade ago, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. Sales from
the home-entertainment unit, part of the film studio, fell 9
percent to $2.22 billion last year, on a 12 percent drop in
units, according to the company''s annual report. </p>
<p>The company finished fiscal 2012 with 166,000 employees
overall, up 6.4 percent. Disney earned $5.68 billion on sales of
$42.3 billion in the 12 months ended Sept. 29, a second year of
record profit. </p>
<h2>Other Cuts </h2>
<p>Elsewhere in the company, Disney closed its Junction Point
Studios video-game operation in Austin, Texas, in January and
announced April 3 it was reducing staff at the games unit of
recently acquired Lucasfilm Ltd. to focus on licensing. </p>
<p>Revenue from interactive games and subscriptions dropped 20
percent to $613 million in the latest fiscal year, reflecting a
29 percent decrease in games for console-based systems such as
Sony Corp.''s PlayStation. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, has been making new

<p>The turn in the gold price cycle is accelerating after a 12-year rally as the recovery in the U.S. economy gains momentum, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which reduced forecasts for the metal through 2014. </p> <p>The bank cut its three-month target to $1,530 an ounce from $1,615 and lowered the six- and 12-month predictions to $1,490 and $1,390 from $1,600 and $1,550. Goldman recommended closing a long Comex gold position initiated on Oct. 11, 2010 for a potential gain of $219 an ounce, analysts Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report today. </p> <p>Gold dropped 5.8 percent this year on speculation that the Federal Reserve may pare its stimulus amid an economic recovery. The gold price is in bubble territory, Societe Generale SA said in an April 2 report. Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund backed by bullion, declined to about 1,200 metric tons yesterday, the least since June 2011. Deutsche Bank AG cut its 2013 gold outlook yesterday by 12 percent, citing a strengthening dollar and a lack of haven buying. </p> <p>Despite resurgence in euro-area risk aversion and disappointing U.S. economic data, gold prices are unchanged over the past month, highlighting how conviction in holding gold is quickly waning, the Goldman analysts wrote in the report. While higher inflation may be the catalyst for the next gold cycle, this is likely several years away. </p> <p>Gold for June delivery on the Comex in New York fell 0.5 percent to $1,579.30 an ounce as of 8:52 a.m. local time. The metal advanced 1.1 percent in March, the first monthly gain since September, as policy makers wrangled over Cyprus''s 10 billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout. </p> <h2>Targets Cut </h2> <p>Goldman cut its 2013 gold estimate to $1,545 an ounce from $1,610, trimmed its 2014 forecast to $1,350 from $1,490, and set year-end targets of $1,450 in 2013 and $1,270 in 2014. Goldman recommended starting a short Comex gold position, targeting $1,450 with a stop at $1,650, the analysts wrote. </p> <p>Futures averaged a record $1,671 last year and the 12 straight annual gains in London were the best run in at least nine decades. Bullion will fall to $1,375 by the end of the year as a U.S. recovery leads to rising interest rates, Societe Generale said in the April 2 report. Credit Suisse Group AG cut its 2013 estimate by 9.2 percent to $1,580 a day later. </p> <p>Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse, Societe Generale, Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) and BNP Paribas SA are among banks predicting lower average prices in 2014 than this year. While Deutsche Bank lowered its 2013 gold forecast to $1,637 yesterday, it still expects prices to average $1,810 next year. Bullion futures climbed to an all- time high of $1,923.70 in September 2011. </p> <h2>ETP Holdings </h2> <p>Holdings in exchange-traded products have shrunk 7.6 percent this year, compared with gains in silver, platinum and palladium, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They were 2,432.3 tons yesterday, compared with an all-time high of 2,632.5 tons in December. Speculators held a net-long gold position of 47,164 contracts in the week ended April 2, down 76 percent from October, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. </p> <p>We believe a sharp rebound in gold prices is unlikely, Goldman said. The fall in prices could end up being faster and larger than our forecast, as aggregate speculative net long positions across Comex futures and gold ETFs remain near record highs. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Michael J.

<p>Websites critical of a settlement
that Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) reached with retailers over
so-called swipe fees are misleading and must be corrected, a
federal judge ruled. </p>
<p>The sites contain bad information that may have caused
some retailers to drop out of the settlement, U.S. District
Judge John Gleeson said today in Brooklyn, New York. He gave the
parties a week to decide on changes. </p>
<p>I''m not going to belabor this with you, Gleeson told
Jeffrey Shinder, a lawyer representing retail trade associations
that established the sites and have opposed the settlement.
I''m just talking about basic fairness. </p>
<p>Sites at issue include Merchantsobject.com and home sites
for the trade groups National Community Pharmacists Association,
National Grocers Association and the National Association of
Convenience Stores, among others, according to court filings
submitted by the plaintiffs'' lawyers. </p>
<p>The sites provide one-sided information encouraging
retailers to object and opt out and don''t fully explain
consequences of those actions, the plaintiffs'' lawyers said.
While opting out allows merchants to pursue their own lawsuits
against the credit card firms, it deprives them of the ability
to receive payments for damages under the settlement, the
lawyers said. </p>
<h2>Prominent Placement </h2>
<p>The Merchantsobject site also fails to give prominent
placement to a link to the official, court-approved source of
information about the deal, paymentcardsettlement.com, the
lawyers said. </p>
<p>The non-court-approved websites appear to be causing
actual confusion among class members, said Bonny E. Sweeney, a
lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, in a declaration filed with the
court. Since the sites went live, dozens of form objections have
been filed by merchants apparently using the sites, she said. </p>
<p>It is currently difficult to know whether these class
members intended to opt-out, but did not send the required
letter or whether these class members only meant to object to
the settlement, but picked the ''wrong'' sample document provided
on the various websites, she said. </p>
<h2>Retail Leaders </h2>
<p>Today''s hearing came after the Retail Industry Leaders
Association announced it would opt out and object to the deal,
which may be worth as much as $7.25 billion. The accord,
estimated to be the largest-ever antitrust settlement, would end
a case over claims that the card companies conspired with banks
to fix the fees charged to merchants when customers pay with
plastic. </p>
<p>Several retail groups have opposed the settlement since it
was made public in July, alleging that it doesn''t provide enough
benefit for merchants and gives card companies too much leeway
to raise rates. Retailers including Target Corp. (TGT), Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT), and Home Depot Inc. (HD) have spoken out against the
accord. </p>
<p>We do not think the sites were misleading or that they
misled anyone to object or opt-out, said Shinder, in an e-
mailed statement following the hearing. </p>
<p>We do care deeply about the integrity of this process,
and per the court''s order, will endeavor to work with class
counsel to ensure it is crystal clear that those who
submitted objections from those sites did so because they
believe the settlement is a bad deal, he said. </p>
<p>Lyle Beckwith, a government relations representative for
the National Association of Convenience Stores, one of the
groups behind the Merchantsobject site, called the request for
changes not a big deal. </p>
<h2>Nit-Picking </h2>
<p>This is just unbelievable nit-picking, he said. We
are standing between attorneys and their $700 million payday and
they don''t like it. </p>
<p>Courts have previously ruled that the First Amendment does
not prevent judges from supervising communications with absent
class members about proposed settlements, the plaintiffs said in
court filings. </p>
<p>The settlement covers more than 7 million retailers. If a
sizable percentage chooses to opt out, Visa and MasterCard could
have an option to back out of the deal. </p>
<p>Gleeson granted preliminary approval to the deal in
November. A hearing on final approval is scheduled for
September. </p>
<p>The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court, </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) tumbled the most in
more than a year after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
software maker is struggling with slack personal-computer sales
and its push into consumer devices has failed to gain traction. </p>
<p>In a note to investors today, Heather Bellini, a New York-
based analyst at Goldman Sachs, recommended that investors sell
the stock. She downgraded the shares from a neutral rating.
Since yesterday, at least two other analysts have also reduced
their ratings on shares of the world''s largest software company,
based in Redmond, Washington. </p>
<p>Lackluster corporate demand for Microsoft''s new Windows 8
operating system helped send PC shipments plummeting 14 percent
worldwide in the first quarter, according to IDC, making it the
worst quarter since the researcher starting tracking sales.
Consumers are also increasingly opting to forgo PCs in favor of
smartphones and tablet machines, markets where Microsoft''s
offerings are selling poorly. </p>
<p>The company faces critical secular challenges given the
deteriorating PC demand backdrop, Bellini wrote. Financial
results will gradually deteriorate unless Microsoft
successfully repositions itself as a more meaningful participant
in the new era of consumer compute. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) (MSFT), hurt by a slump in global PC sales, is looking to Israel for innovation from its developers and acquisitions, as well as local startups, according to the company''s top executive in the country. </p> <p>We are trying to create assets for the company, and we recognize that we are Start-Up Nation and we can provide innovation, Yoram Yaacovi, general manager of the Microsoft (MSFT) Israel RD Center, said in an interview in Tel Aviv, referring to the title of a book on the country''s entrepreneurial culture. </p> <p>Microsoft has acquired seven companies and made four strategic investments since 1989 in Israel, where it employs 800 people, including 500 in research and development. These developers are focused on business intelligence for cloud computing, said Yaacovi. Resulting products, such as an Excel tool for the cloud that was integrated into Office 365 BI software, help give companies insight into their data. </p> <p>Business intelligence is an area of double-digit growth for the software maker, said Yaacovi. We in Israel do all the cloud-based business intelligence for Microsoft. We can envision business intelligence migrating to the cloud and then we will build it in Microsoft. </p> <p>The Redmond, Washington-based software maker is looking for new sources of revenue as falling demand for PCs crimps demand for traditional applications. Global PC shipments fell 14 percent to 76.3 million units in the first quarter, according to Interactive Data Corp. The slump was the steepest since IDC began tracking shipments in 1994. </p> <h2>Technology Advantages </h2> <p>It is important to understand what Microsoft is seeking in Israel, said Yaacovi. It''s not a big market and labor isn''t cheap. What it is looking for is technology advantages and entrepreneurial spirit. Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer describes Israel as Silicon Valley Junior, he added. </p> <p>A system to deliver tailored advertisements to Microsoft''s Bing search engine and Live Mail was developed in Israel by engineers from YaData, a company Microsoft bought in 2008. Face- recognition technology developed by a small team in Israel is now used in Microsoft''s Bing, Photo Gallery, and Kinect motion- sensing software, Yaacovi said. </p> <p>Microsoft invested more than $700 million in Israeli acquisitions between 2002 and 2009, according to Israel Advanced Technology Industries, a group representing technology companies and related businesses. </p> <h2>Startup Programs </h2> <p>Microsoft (MSFT)''s Israeli purchases include Internet security company Whale Communications, data-organizing specialist Zoomix Data Mastering Ltd. and Gteko, a maker of networking and support software. The company met with more than 600 startups last year in its quest for acquisitions, Yaacovi said. </p> <p>A year ago, Microsoft (MSFT) also began offering a series of four- month accelerator programs to help startups for the cloud, mobile and online markets. Twenty-three companies have benefited from the courses so far. </p> <p>We recognize that we need to be more in touch with startups, Yaacovi said. We need to speak their language and what better way to bring startups to run on our platform. </p> <p>Startups now on the accelerator program include Screemo, which is developing a cloud-based application to create low-cost advertising campaigns; and WCS Sports, a maker of a system to help owners of sports media rights to give fans personalized video clips and highlight preferred footage. </p> <p>There are so many things going on in the accelerator that can be exciting for the future, Yaacovi said. </p> <h2>Shares Drop </h2> <p>Microsoft stock fell as much as 5 percent in New York after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said personal-computer market-share losses are accelerating and the company''s push into consumer electronics hasn''t gained traction. </p> <p>The stock was down 4.7 percent at $28.85 as of 9:52 a.m., paring its advance to 8 percent this year, compared with an 11 percent advance for the SP 500 index. </p> <p>Microsoft released Windows 8 and the Surface tablet on Oct. 26 to appeal to consumers who are increasingly adopting mobile devices to surf the Internet, access e-mail and store pictures, music, documents and other information. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Maria Levitov" date="Apr 11, 2013  7:03 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-11/jpmorgan-asset-preparing-for-emerging-stocks-rebound-in-2nd-half.html"><headline>JPMorgan Asset Preparing for Emerging Stocks Rebound in 2nd Half</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>JPMorgan Asset Management, the
investing arm of the largest U.S. bank, is preparing for a
rebound in emerging-market equities in the second half of this
year spurred by improved earnings. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Asset is buying Korean automaker shares hurt by
investor concern that a weaker yen will limit their ability to
compete against Japanese exporters,Richard Titherington, chief
investment officer and head of emerging markets, said in an
interview yesterday. The company favors consumer discretionary
stocks with very low valuations and has its biggest
overweight position in China, he said yesterday. </p>
<p>A strong recovery in the second half for emerging
market equities will significantly close the gap with
developed-nation shares, said Titherington, who manages $47
billion in emerging-market stocks. We''ve entered some of the
Korean auto companies where the share prices have fallen sharply
when the yen has weakened on expectation that''s a temporary
headwind, he said. </p>
<p>The benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) has dropped 2.5
percent this year, lagging behind an 8.8 percent surge in the
MSCI World Index (MXWO) of advanced-country stocks, as 58 percent of
developing-nation companies reported worse fourth quarter
earnings than estimated by analysts, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Hyundai Motor Co. (005380), South Korea''s biggest automaker,
extended its decline to 8 percent this year as the Japanese yen
reached its weakest level versus the dollar since April 2009
yesterday. </p>
<p>The yen is around fair value now, so I would expect this
headwind to reverse in the second half of the year,
Titherington said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein a $5 million cash bonus to be paid out in three years if he meets certain targets, on top of $21 million in 2012 compensation. </p> <p>The long-term incentive was $3 million last year and $7 million in 2011 when the program began, the New York-based bank said today in a filing. The awards can shrink or grow depending on whether the firm achieves a 10 percent average return on equity and 7 percent average increase in book value per share. </p> <p>Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, which already gives a portion of top executives'' pay in restricted stock, have been seeking ways to encourage managers to focus on long-term performance. Goldman Sachs''s plan gives the board''s compensation committee, led by former Fannie Mae CEO James A. Johnson, the power to change the awards to so-called named executive officers, or NEOs. </p> <p>Our compensation committee may also, in its sole discretion based on its assessment of an individual NEO''s performance, adjust the amounts that may be paid under this award, according to the filing, which says the committee can give from zero to 150 percent of the amount due. </p> <p>The firm also granted President Gary D. Cohn a $5 million long-term award this year. Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans and John S. Weinberg got $4 million incentives. Last year, all of the firm''s executives named in the proxy received $3 million in long-term incentives, down from $7 million for all of the executives in 2011. </p> <h2>Viniar''s Exception </h2> <p>While the Goldman Sachs awards are initially tied to three-year periods, the board can opt to extend the measurement for another five years. In December, the compensation committee set the performance period for the 2011 incentive pay to end in December 2018 instead of December 2013. </p> <p>One exception is for David A. Viniar, who retired as chief financial officer at the end of January. He will receive any 2011 incentive pay in January 2014 and any 2012 long-term grant in January 2015, according to today''s proxy filing. </p> <p>The board''s ability to change the long-term incentive measures whenever it wants to, and with respect to any individual it singles out, makes the plan a joke because you can be sure the adjustments that are made will be to give an executive a better chance at getting the money, said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan''s law school and business school. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs''s top executives also received payouts from funds managed by the firm during the year, including profits, return of money invested, and their portion of the funds'' management fees, known as overrides. Those payouts during 2012 totaled $31.2 million for Blankfein, $25.8 million for Cohn, $22.2 million for Viniar, $21.3 million for Evans, and $9.6 million for Weinberg, according to the proxy. </p> <p>Other recipients of such fund distributions included Vice Chairman Michael S. Sherwood with $18.7 million; General Counsel Gregory K. Palm, with $29.7 million; and Chief of Staff John F. W. Rogers, with $9.9 million, the proxy showed. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore and Christine Harper" date="Apr 12, 2013 12:01 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-12/goldman-sachs-pays-cohn-more-than-evans-in-first-gap-since-2007.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Pays Cohn More Than Evans in First Gap Since 2007</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Lloyd C. Blankfein''s top deputies
are no longer equal in terms of pay at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) </p>
<p>President Gary Cohn, 52, was awarded a $19 million
compensation package, 12 percent more than Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans and John S. Weinberg, according to the New York-
based firm''s annual proxy filing. The disparity is the first
since 2007, when Blankfein''s bonus set the record for a Wall
Street chief executive officer. </p>
<p>The change may further fuel speculation about which
executive is most likely to succeed Blankfein, 58, who sometimes
out-earned his own boss Henry Paulson. Blankfein, who succeeded
Paulson as Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO in June 2006, said in
a February interview with Bloomberg Television that he has plans
to stay in the top job indefinitely. </p>
<p>If somebody gets more money that could be a sign that
they''re in the running for the job eventually, said Jeanne Branthover, managing director at Boyden Global Executive Search
in New York. A partnership is very big about what message are
we giving each partner?'' </p>
<p>Evans, 55, the vice chairman who oversees Goldman Sachs''s
emerging-markets business, received $17 million, as did
Weinberg, 56, who helps oversee investment banking. David Viniar, who retired as the firm''s chief financial officer
earlier this year, was awarded $19 million. </p>
<p>Cohn''s package for 2012 included a $5.15 million cash
bonus. Evans and Weinberg each got a $4.55 million cash award. </p>
<h2>Performance, Roles </h2>
<p>Differences in pay among the named executive officers, or
NEOs, were primarily to reflect their individual performance,
as well as their roles, the bank said in the filing. No
specific individual performance goals were used by the committee
in making these NEO compensation determinations. </p>
<p>Blankfein received a larger bonus than his deputies for the
first time since 2007, when he set a Wall Street pay record. All
of Goldman Sachs''s named executives received no bonus in 2008,
and then got cash and stock awards of $9 million, $18 million
and $10 million over the next three years. </p>
<p>Blankfein got $21 million for last year, his highest annual
package since 2007, as reported by Bloomberg News in January.
That consisted of $13.3 million in restricted stock and a $5.7
million cash bonus for 2012 in addition to his $2 million
salary, according to today''s filing. </p>
<p>That made him the highest-paid CEO among those at the 10
largest U.S. banks, exceeding the $9.75 million for Morgan
Stanley (MS)''s James Gorman and $11.5 million awarded to JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)''s Jamie Dimon. </p>
<h2>Overcoming Opposition </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
reported its first revenue gain in three years in 2012, as each
of its four divisions showed an increase last year. The bank''s
return on equity was 10.7 percent, up from 3.7 percent in 2011
while less than one-third of what the firm earned in 2007. </p>
<p>The stock rose 41 percent in 2012, the first annual
increase since doubling in 2009. While the shares have rallied
16 percent this year, they''re still 12 percent below their level
at the end of 2010. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s compensation committee has been led by
James A. Johnson, a former CEO of Fannie Mae, as long as the
bank has been a public company. Johnson was re-elected to the
board with about 84 percent of the vote at last year''s
shareholder meeting, overcoming opposition from investment firm
Ruane, Cunniff  Goldfarb Inc. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs cut 900 jobs last year, and compensation
costs rose 6 percent, trailing the 19 percent increase in
revenue. In November, the firm named 70 employees to its so-
called partnership, the fewest in 13 years as a public company,
and said last month that it will start naming managing directors
every two years instead of annually. </p>

<p>Lawyers for plaintiffs in a Visa
Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) antitrust case over interchange fees
asked for final approval of a settlement along with $720 million
in legal fees and $27 million in expenses. </p>
<p>The attorneys, representing a class of more than 7 million
merchants, filed papers late yesterday in Brooklyn, New York,
seeking a final blessing for the accord from U.S. District Judge
John Gleeson. </p>
<p>The settlement, estimated to be the largest ever in an
antitrust case, would provide for about $7.25 billion in cash
payouts, according to a memorandum filed by Robbins Geller
Rudman  Dowd LLP, one of the lead law firms in the case. </p>
<p>With the largest-ever cash relief in an antitrust class
action settlement plus unprecedented rules changes that would
enable merchants to recover their costs of credit card
acceptance the settlement is far more than fair, adequate,
and reasonable,'' the lawyers wrote. </p>
<p>In a separate filing, the lawyer said their request for
attorneys'' fees is reasonable given the complexity of the issues
and the length of time of the eight-year-long case. </p>
<p>The settlement will affect as great a segment of the
United States economy as any previous antitrust class action,
lawyers for the plaintiffs said in the filing, noting that about
60 law firms worked on the case. Such an extraordinary
settlement could result only from a similarly extraordinary
effort by class counsel and their co-counsel. </p>
<h2>Retailers Opposed </h2>
<p>Merchant trade groups and some large retailers including
Target Corp. (TGT), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), Home Depot Inc. (HD) spoke out
against the accord, claiming it isn''t large enough and gives
card companies too much leeway to raise fees in the future. The
lawsuit alleged the card companies and some of the country''s
largest banks conspired to fix prices of fees paid by merchants
when customers pay with plastic. </p>
<p>A hearing on final approval has been scheduled for
September. </p>
<p>The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and
Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), whose trading
loss of more than $6.2 billion last year was fueled by the
adoption of a formula that understated risks, has adopted yet
another model. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said today it employed a new formula to judge the
risk of its credit derivatives position, at least the fourth
such model it''s used since January 2012. The portfolio was built
by Bruno Iksil, known as the London Whale because his bets were
so big they moved markets. </p>
<p>The bank changed its measurement of value at risk, or VaR,
for the credit derivatives book in the first quarter of this
year to achieve consistency with like products within the
corporate and investment bank, JPMorgan said today in a
supplement. This change had an insignificant impact to
average VaR for fixed income and the investment bank''s trading
and credit portfolio, the New York-based bank said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan had previously changed the VaR model, which
estimates the most amount of money a trading position can lose
on 95 percent of the trading days, when the corporate and
investment bank took over most of the credit book from the chief
investment office last year. That change last year reduced
JPMorgan''s estimated risk by 24 percent to $115 million in the
third quarter. </p>

<p>Motif Investing Inc., a Web-based
startup that lets investors buy baskets of stocks based on
themes like home improvement and Obamacare, raised $25 million
in a financing round led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) </p>
<p>Darren Cohen, who leads Goldman''s principal strategic
investments group, is joining Motif''s board as an observer, the
San Mateo, California-based company said today in a statement.
Existing investors Foundation Capital, Ignition Partners and
Norwest Venture Partners contributed to the round. </p>
<p>Founded in 2010, Motif is among an increasing number of
startups offering online products for investors that are
designed to lower the cost of trading while avoiding high-
priced, poor-performing mutual funds. Jemstep Inc. and
FutureAdvisor provide asset-allocation advice and help clients
easily make the recommended trades, while Wealthfront Inc.
manages money online by investing in low-fee index funds. </p>
<p>This space is heating up, Hardeep Walia, 40, Motif''s
chief executive officer, said in an interview. If you think
about what we''ve done in Silicon Valley, we''ve disrupted so many
businesses, but no one''s traditionally had luck in financial
services. </p>
<p>Motif offers custom-made and user-generated funds of up to
30 stocks for about $10. To date, the company has focused on
providing retail investors an alternative to exchange-traded
funds sold by companies like E*Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC) and Charles
Schwab Corp. (SCHW) </p>
<h2>Investment Savings </h2>
<p>With the additional financing, Motif is rolling out the
software to investment advisors, giving them products to offer
clients without management fees attached. </p>
<p>For example, brokers could sell a fund created by Motif,
use one created by someone else that''s available on the site or
establish their own by copying what''s in a particular mutual
fund. </p>
<p>That allows them to save the 2 to 3 percent fees they''re
paying every year to mutual-fund companies, Walia said. They
can either take that as a reward for their business or pass the
savings along to customers. </p>
<p>Motif has 40 employees, including several early executives
from E*Trade. The company has patent-pending technology that
lowers the cost of volume trading, letting it make good
margins at $10 a trade, Walia said. </p>
<h2>Obamacare, Housing </h2>
<p>The Obamacare motif includes shares of hospitals like HCA
Holdings Inc. (HCA), electronic medical-records providers such as
Cerner Corp. (CERN) and generic-drug maker Actavis Inc. (ACT) The fund is
designed for investors looking to benefit from the Affordable
Care Act, which may extend coverage to 30 million previously
uninsured Americans. </p>
<p>There''s also a motif called Ivy League that follows the
investment strategy of David Swensen, chief investment officer
at Yale University. Other motifs focus on biotechnology

Moore and Christine Harper" date="Apr 13, 2013 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-13/goldman-sachs-s-cohn-takes-pay-lead-among-ceo-s-deputies.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs''s Cohn Takes Pay Lead Among CEO''s Deputies</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has started differentiating
among Lloyd C. Blankfein''s top deputies again after four years
of granting lockstep pay awards. </p>
<p>President Gary Cohn, 52, was awarded a $19 million
compensation package, 12 percent more than Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans and John S. Weinberg, the New York-based firm said
in an annual proxy. The disparity is the first since 2007, when
Blankfein''s bonus set the record for a Wall Street chief
executive officer. </p>
<p>Cohn''s pay may fuel speculation about which executive will
succeed Blankfein, 58, who sometimes out-earned his own boss
Henry Paulson. Blankfein, who succeeded Paulson as chairman and
CEO in June 2006, said in a February interview with Bloomberg
Television that he has no immediate plans to depart. </p>
<p>If somebody gets more money, that could be a sign that
they''re in the lead to succeed Blankfein, said Jeanne Branthover, managing director at Boyden Global Executive Search
in New York. If somebody gets less money it''s not a good
thing, because they''ve been equals. </p>
<p>Evans, 55, the vice chairman who oversees the emerging-
markets business, received $17 million, as did Weinberg, 56, a
co-head of investment banking. David A. Viniar, chief financial
officer until the end of January, was awarded $19 million. The
firm didn''t disclose 2012 pay for Harvey M. Schwartz, who
replaced Viniar as CFO. </p>
<h2>Individual Performance </h2>
<p>Differences in pay among the named executive officers, or
NEOs, were primarily to reflect their individual performance,
as well as their roles, the bank said in the filing. No
specific individual performance goals were used by the committee
in making these NEO compensation determinations. </p>
<p>Blankfein, 58, also received a larger bonus than his
deputies for the first time since 2007. None of Goldman Sachs''s
named executives was awarded a bonus for 2008, and each of them
got cash and stock awards of $9 million, $18 million and $10
million over the next three years. </p>
<p>Blankfein''s $21 million award for 2012 was his highest
since 2007, as reported by Bloomberg News in January. It
included $13.3 million in restricted stock and a $5.7 million
cash bonus for 2012 in addition to his $2 million salary,
according to the filing. </p>
<p>That made him the highest-paid CEO among those at the 10
largest U.S. banks, exceeding the $9.75 million for Morgan
Stanley (MS)''s James Gorman and $11.5 million awarded to JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)''s Jamie Dimon. </p>
<h2>Cash Bonuses </h2>
<p>Cohn''s and Viniar''s packages for 2012 each included a $5.15
million cash bonus, while Evans and Weinberg each got a $4.55
million cash award. </p>
<p>Pay is higher for all executives if long-term incentive
plan awards are included. The plan will pay $5 million in cash
bonuses to Blankfein and Cohn, and $4 million to Evans and
Weinberg in three years if the firm meets certain targets. The
same rules apply to last year''s $3 million long-term incentive
and $7 million in 2011, when the plan started. </p>
<p>The cash bonuses shrink or grow depending on whether the
firm achieves a 10 percent average return on equity and 7
percent average increase in book value per share. The board''s
compensation committee, which has been led by former Fannie Mae
CEO James A. Johnson as long as Goldman Sachs has been a public
company, has the power to change the awards. The committee can
give from zero to 150 percent of the amount due, the bank said. </p>
<p>While the Goldman Sachs awards are initially tied to three-
year periods, the board can also opt to extend the measurement
for a further five years. In December, the compensation
committee set the performance period for the 2011 incentive pay
to end in December 2018 instead of December 2013. </p>
<h2>Getting Money </h2>
<p>The board''s ability to change the long-term incentive
measures whenever it wants to, and with respect to any
individual it singles out, makes the plan a joke because you can
be sure the adjustments that are made will be to give an
executive a better chance at getting the money, said Erik
Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan''s law school
and business school. </p>
<p>Top executives received payouts from funds managed by the
firm during the year, including profits, return of money
invested, and their portion of the funds'' management fees, known
as overrides. Those payouts during 2012 totaled $31.2 million
for Blankfein, $25.8 million for Cohn, $22.2 million for Viniar,
$21.3 million for Evans, and $9.6 million for Weinberg,
according to the proxy. </p>
<p>Other recipients of such fund distributions included Vice
Chairman Michael S. Sherwood with $18.7 million; General Counsel
Gregory K. Palm, with $29.7 million; and Chief of Staff John F. W. Rogers, with $9.9 million, the proxy showed. </p>
<h2>Results Improve </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs reported its first revenue gain in three
years in 2012. Return on equity, a measure of how well the bank
reinvests shareholders'' money, rose to 10.7 percent from 3.7
percent in 2011. Still, it remained at less than one-third of
its 2007 level. </p>
<p>The stock rose 41 percent in 2012, the first annual
increase since doubling in 2009. While the shares have rallied
17 percent this year to close yesterday at $149.12, they''re
still 11 percent below their level at the end of 2010. </p>
<p>Johnson, head of the compensation committee, was re-elected
to the board with about 84 percent of the vote at last year''s
shareholder meeting, overcoming opposition from investment firm
Ruane, Cunniff  Goldfarb Inc. </p>
<p>Goldman''s board altered succession planning for top
executives, which it used for Schwartz''s ascension to CFO, lead
director James Schiro wrote in his inaugural letter to
shareholders. The new framework is focused on making sure
potential candidates have experience with the board and with
many of the firm''s businesses. </p>
<p>Our goal is always to be in a position to appoint our
most senior executives from within our firm, the board said in
the annual proxy statement. </p>

<p>Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), the U.S.
producer of metallurgical coal that is the target of a
shareholder action, fell the most in 18 months after unexpected
slowing of economic growth in China, the metal''s biggest user. </p>
<p>Walter tumbled 12 percent to $21.28 at 1:50 p.m. in New
York after the Birmingham, Alabama-based company fell as much as
13 percent, the most since Sept. 21, 2011. Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. (ANR), the country''s second-largest coal miner by
sales, fell as much as 11 percent. </p>
<p>China''s economic growth lost momentum as factory output
weakened last month, according to data from the National Bureau
of Statistics in Beijing. The economy expanded at a 7.7 percent
annual pace in the first quarter, the bureau said today,
compared with 8 percent expected by  analysts'' estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Walter led declines in companies producing metals and
steelmaking ingredients because investors are concerned about
the outcome of a shareholder action at the company, said Daniel Scott, an analyst at Cowen and Co. in New York. </p>
<p>Everything is getting obliterated by the Chinese data,
Scott said in an interview by phone today. Walter has just got
the stigma of uncertainty to it on top of everything else. </p>
<p>Audley Capital Advisors LLC has nominated five directors to
Walter''s board, saying the company''s administrative costs and
debt are too high. Egan-Jones Ratings Co., Institutional
Shareholder Services Inc., and Glass Lewis  Co. LLC have
recommended shareholders vote for the existing directors.
Walter''s annual meeting is scheduled for April 25. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. expects the price of metallurgical coal to
fall 4 percent to $165 a ton in the third quarter from $172 this
quarter, according to an April 12 report. Low-volatility coking
coal traded at $157.50 on March 22, according to data from
Knoxville, Tennessee-based Energy Publishing Inc. </p>
<p>The largest U.S. coal producer is Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
was ending a recommendation to hold a long position in the SP
GSCI Brent Total Return Index amid disappointing oil demand and
refinery maintenance in Europe. </p>
<p>Holding the position, first recommended in August, would
have resulted in a 16 percent loss, the bank said in an e-mailed
report today. Weakness in European demand for refined fuels and
a slowdown in China, are weighing on prices even as global
inventory levels remain tight, Goldman said. </p>
<p>In the tug of war between tight global oil fundamentals
and the negative sentiment created by weak European product
markets and fears of further Chinese slowdown, the latter
currently prevail, Jeff Currie, head of commodities research
in New York, wrote in the report. </p>
<p>The euro-zone economy will shrink 0.3 percent in 2013 as it
struggles to move past its debt crisis, the European Commission
predicted on Feb. 22. Economic expansion unexpectedly eased in
China, the world''s largest energy consumer, according to data
for the first quarter from the Beijing-based National Bureau of
Statistics. </p>
<p>Brent slumped as much as 2.6 percent today to a nine-month
low of $100.41 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. </p>
<p>European margins could suffer further as the European
refinery turnaround season has peaked and more and more
refineries are coming back from maintenance, Currie said.
This could put further downward pressure on Brent prices. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs'' advice to take a long position in the Brent
index on Aug. 21 was a modification of earlier recommendation to
buy West Texas Intermediate crude contracts. That suggestion
would have resulted in a 10.8 percent loss. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), whose trading
loss of more than $6.2 billion last year was fueled by the
adoption of a formula that understated risks, has adopted yet
another model. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said April 12 that it employed a new formula to
judge the risk of its credit derivatives position, at least the
fourth such model it''s used since January 2012. The portfolio
was built by Bruno Iksil, known as the London Whale because his
bets were so big they moved markets. </p>
<p>The bank changed its measurement of value at risk, or VaR,
for the credit derivatives book in the first quarter of this
year to achieve consistency with like products within the
corporate and investment bank, JPMorgan said April 12 in a
supplement. This change had an insignificant impact to
average VaR for fixed income and the investment bank''s trading
and credit portfolio, the New York-based bank said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan had previously changed the VaR model, which
estimates the most amount of money a trading position can lose
on 95 percent of the trading days, when the corporate and
investment bank took over most of the credit book from the chief
investment office last year. That change last year reduced
JPMorgan''s estimated risk by 24 percent to $115 million in the
third quarter. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s switch of risk models in January of last year
may have helped fuel the trading loss at the chief investment
office, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told the Senate
Banking Committee in June. The January 2012 switch and the
timing of the firm''s disclosures are the focus of an inquiry by
the Securities and Exchange Commission as the U.S. examines how
long executives knew about the CIO''s swelling bets and losses. </p>
<p>Separately, U.S. Senator Carl Levin said he plans to
forward results from his panel''s nine-month investigation into
JPMorgan Chase''s record trading loss to the Justice Department
and SEC to review for possible wrongdoing by company executives. </p>
<p>Levin made the remarks in an interview on Bloomberg
Television April 12. </p>
<p>Mark Kornblau, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
comment on Levin''s remarks. </p>
<p>Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, said referrals to the
Justice Department and the SEC are fairly routine following
a review by his panel and, if the staff hasn''t already sent
their report to investigators, they should. </p>
<h2>Compliance Policy </h2>
<h2>Europe Moves Toward Tax-Evasion Clampdown After Six-Nation Push </h2>
<p>The European Union moved closer to agreement on a
coordinated clampdown on tax evasion as a total of nine
countries backed an initiative for automatic sharing of bank
details across borders. </p>
<p>The bloc''s six biggest nations won support from the
Netherlands, Belgium and Romania for their proposal to adopt the
U.S.''s FATCA information-exchange program, EU Tax Commissioner
Algirdas Semeta said in Dublin yesterday. Semeta also said the
27-nation EU is closing in on updates to a savings tax accord as
holdouts Luxembourg and Austria show willingness to compromise. </p>
<p>Governments from the U.K. to Poland are eyeing what the
commission estimates is 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) of lost
tax revenue as many European nations struggle to narrow budget
deficits. Politics is also spurring the initiative, notably in
France, where President Francois Hollande''s popularity has
slumped after his budget minister resigned and admitted having
an offshore bank account following months of denials. </p>
<p>Luxembourg, one of the countries that previously resisted
giving up its banking secrecy rules, dropped its opposition
April 10, though Finance Minister Luc Frieden said April 13 that
he wants Europe to win broader global support for the initiative
within the Group of 20 nations. </p>
<p>The position of Austria, the other EU nation that has
defended banking secrecy, may also be shifting. </p>

<h2>U.S. Antitrust Plea Deals Won''t Name Non-Culpable Employees </h2>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department''s antitrust division said it
will stop publicly naming individuals associated with corporate
antitrust plea agreements who aren''t believed to be culpable in
any alleged wrongdoing, according to a statement. </p>
<p>The names of so-called carved-out employees, which included
those who refused to cooperate with a probe, are currently
included in publicly filed corporate plea deals, Assistant U.S.
Attorney General Bill Baer said April 12 in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>Employees against whom the government is still developing
evidence, or employees with potentially relevant information
who can''t be located, will be omitted from the publicly filed
portion of plea agreements. </p>
<p>In the past, corporate plea agreements have included a
provision offering non-prosecution protection to those employees
who cooperate and whose conduct didn''t warrant prosecution.The
division excluded, or carved out, employees who were believed to
be culpable from such receiving non-prosecution deals. </p>
<p>Baer said the division will continue to exclude from non-
prosecution agreements any employees whose conduct may warrant
prosecution. </p>
<p>Those decisions will be made on an employee-by-employee
basis depending on the evidence, he said. </p>
<p>We will continue to demand the full cooperation of anyone
who seeks to benefit from the non-prosecution protection of a
corporate plea agreement, and will revoke that protection for
anyone who does not fully and truthfully cooperate with division
investigations, Baer said. </p>
<h2>CBRC Orders Banks to Control Loans to LGFVs, Sina.Com Says </h2>
<p>The China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered banks to
control their total outstanding loans to local government
financing vehicles, or LGFVs, Sina.com reported, citing
guidelines dated April 9. </p>
<p>Banks also must cap the proportion of LGFV loans at last
year''s levels to vehicles that have cash-flow coverage ratios of
less than 100 percent or liability-to-asset ratios higher than
80 percent, the report cited the guidelines as saying. </p>
<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>Banks Drop Off ISDAFix Panel as CFTC Probes Rate-Rigging </h2>
<p>Banks are leaving the panel that sets ISDAFix, the
benchmark for the $379 trillion swaps market, as regulators
probe suspected manipulation of the rate. </p>
<p>HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Europe''s largest bank by assets, and
Japan''s Mizuho Financial Group (8411) stopped contributing to the
ISDAFix dollar rate between November and January, and haven''t
been replaced, documents on the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association''s website show. The industry group
didn''t give any reason for the lenders'' departure. </p>
<p>Firms are pulling out of rates such as the London interbank
offered rate, Euribor and ISDAFix on growing concern that they
may face lawsuits, fines and criminal penalties if found to have
engaged in wrongdoing. Without data from a large number of
firms, benchmarks risk becoming unrepresentative and losing the
confidence of the market, said Owen Watkins, a former regulator
at the U.K.''s Financial Services Authority. </p>
<p>ISDAFix is used as a reference for parties looking to
settle interest-rate options and cancel swaps contracts. </p>

<h2>Barclays Received Most U.K. Bank Customer Complaints, FCA Says </h2>
<p>Barclays Plc (BARC) topped the list of the most-complained about
U.K. financial institutions in the second half of last year,
according to data compiled by the markets regulator. </p>
<p>The bank, based in London, received 414,302 complaints, a 6
percent decrease from the first half of 2012, the Financial
Conduct Authority said in an e-mailed statement today. Lloyds
TSB Bank Plc was second with 349,386, a 19 percent decline. </p>
<p>U.K. banks have been buffeted by a series of consumer
scandals in recent years, including improper sales of loan
insurance and some derivatives products. The sales of the loan
insurance, known as PPI, topped the list of complaints, followed
by checking accounts, general insurance products, credit cards,
and savings accounts. </p>
<p>Barclays said in a statement that it is continuing to make
improvements to its customer service and has seen complaints
fall by 184,000 in comparison to 2010. </p>
<p>Our sole focus is on helping our customers and getting it
right so they don''t feel the need to complain in the first
place,  the bank said in a statement. These actions will
make a big difference going forward. </p>
<h2>Google Offer to Settle EU Antitrust Probe Unacceptable to Rivals </h2>
<p>Google Inc. (GOOG)''s offer to settle an antitrust probe with the
European Union by labeling its own services more clearly in Web
search results is a non-starter for competitors such as
Microsoft Corp. </p>
<p>Microsoft, French legal search engine Foundem and at least
10 other companies that filed complaints against Google with the
EU will be able to give feedback on the remedies submitted by
the Mountain View, California-based company to settle the almost
three-year-old investigation. </p>
<p>Google, operator of the world''s largest Internet search
engine, told the Brussels-based EU that it would create more
distinction in searches between its own services and
competitors, a person familiar with the negotiations said last
week. Google also proposed to offer links to rival search
engines, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the details of the offer aren''t public. </p>
<p>The EU is preparing a market test based on Google''s formal
submission, Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for EU Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, said last week while declining to
comment on the specifics of Google''s offer. Al Verney, a
spokesman for Google in Brussels, said that the company
continues to cooperate with the commission. </p>

<h2>Standard Chartered in Talks With Zimbabwe on Black Ownership </h2>
<p>Standard Chartered Plc (STAN), the U.K.''s second-largest bank by
market value, said it''s in talks with Zimbabwe''s government on
plans to increase black ownership of its business in the
southern African nation. </p>
<p>Vicki Robinson, a spokeswoman for the London-based bank,
made the statement in an April 12 e-mailed response to
questions. Standard Chartered has taken the conscious decision
to continue to maintain our long-standing commitment to doing
business in Zimbabwe, she said in the e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Under the country''s law, foreign-owned companies must sell
or cede 51 percent of their operations to black Zimbabweans or
the state-owned National Indigenization and Economic Empowerment
Board. The head of the board, Wilson Gwatiringa, said Standard
Chartered may lose its license if the bank doesn''t comply with
the law, the state-owned Herald newspaper reported April 12. </p>
<p>That came after Harare-based Newsday April 11 reported that
Zimbabwe Central Bank Governor Gideon Gono said there were no
plans to force Standard Chartered to close. Impala Platinum
Holdings Ltd. (IMP) and Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS), the world''s
biggest platinum producers, have agreed to cede 51 percent of
their Zimbabwe operations to black ownership, while Barclays Plc
and Standard Bank Group Ltd. have also submitted plans. </p>
<p>Standard Chartered, which operates in 16 African countries,
said earlier this year that income from Africa rose 15 percent
to $1.59 billion last year. </p>
<h2>BlackBerry Asks Regulators to Probe False'' Returns Report </h2>
<p>BlackBerry (BBRY), the Canadian smartphone maker, said it will ask
securities regulators to investigate a report that its new
phones have high return rates, arguing that the false
information may have been released in a deliberate attempt to
manipulate its stock price. </p>
<p>Detwiler Fenton  Co., a financial-services firm in Boston,
said April 11 that U.S. retailers were seeing a significant
increase in customers returning their Z10 phones because they
don''t find them easy to use. </p>
<p>In several cases, returns are now exceeding sales, a
phenomenon we have never seen before, Detwiler Fenton said.
The report contributed to a 7.8 percent plunge in BlackBerry
shares April 11, marking the stock''s worst one-day drop in
almost two months. </p>
<p>BlackBerry, based in Waterloo, Ontario, responded that
sales are meeting expectations and return rates are in line with
the rest of the industry. It asked both the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Ontario Securities Commission to
review the Detwiler report, saying it was either a gross
misreading of the data or a willful manipulation. </p>
<p>BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd. (BB), is
counting on the new Z10 phone -- and its pending companion
device, the Q10 -- to fuel a turnaround after years of market-
share losses. </p>
<p>Anne Buckley, a spokeswoman for Detwiler Fenton, didn''t

<h2>MT Says Fed Money-Laundering Review Delays Hudson City Deal </h2>
<p>MT Bank Corp. (MTB) said a Federal Reserve review of its
compliance with anti-money-laundering rules has delayed its
planned purchase of Hudson City Bancorp. (HCBK) Both lenders declined
in New York trading. </p>
<p>MT hired an outside consulting firm as part of its effort
to respond to the Fed, the Buffalo, New York-based bank said
April 12 in a statement with Hudson City. </p>
<p>In view of the potential timeframe required to implement
this initiative, demonstrate its efficacy to the satisfaction of
the Federal Reserve and otherwise meet any other regulatory
requirements that may be imposed in connection with these
matters, MT and Hudson City believe that the timeframe for
closing the transaction will be extended substantially, the
companies said in a statement. </p>
<p>The banks postponed until Jan. 31 the date at which either
party can terminate the deal if a combination hasn''t already
been closed, and said there can be no assurances that the
merger will be completed by that date. The prior deadline was
Aug. 27. </p>
<p>MT announced the agreement in August, valued at $3.7
billion at the time, as part of an effort to expand into New
Jersey. Hudson City has said record-low interest rates are
pressuring profits from residential lending. </p>
<p>MT said it will discuss the status of the Hudson City deal
at a conference call scheduled for today to discuss first-
quarter results. </p>
<p>Eric Kollig, a Fed spokesman, declined to comment on the
regulator''s interactions with MT. </p>
<h2>Societe Generale Faces French Regulator Probe, Les Echos Says </h2>
<p>Societe Generale (GLE) faces a probe by Autorite des Marches
Financiers, the French market regulator, Les Echos reported. </p>
<p>An official from the regulator called for an 800,000 euro
($1.05 million) fine and an official warning for the bank, the
newspaper said. </p>
<p>Societe Generale doesn''t have enough employees in its
custodian bank unit to carry out relations with and audits of
fund management companies correctly, the AMF official said,
according to Les Echos. The regulator''s sanctions committee will
decide on the case in a few weeks, according to the
newspaper. </p>
<h2>Courts </h2>
<h2>Ex-Altium Banker Charged With Insider Trading by U.K. Regulator </h2>
<p>A former managing director at Altium Capital Ltd. was
charged in an insider-trading ring and will face trial next year
along with a former Deutsche Bank AG broker and four other men. </p>
<p>Grant Harrison was charged today with one count of
conspiracy to commit insider trading, said Joseph Eyre, a
spokesman for the Financial Conduct Authority. Harrison''s case
was transferred to a higher criminal court for a hearing in
September. </p>
<p>Harrison will be added as a defendant in the case against
Martyn Dodgson, a former managing director at Deutsche Bank, a
lawyer for the regulator said at a hearing last month. The case
is scheduled to go to trial in September 2014 and last as long
as three months. </p>
<p>The charges stem from the FSA''s biggest insider-trading
investigation, known as Operation Tabernula, Latin for little
tavern. The U.K. regulator arrested seven people and raided 16
addresses in London and southeast England in March 2010 as the
FSA sought to crack down on insider trading among bankers and
traders in London''s financial district. </p>
<p>Altium said in a statement last month that the allegations
relate to a period when Harrison worked with a previous
employer. Harrison''s lawyer, Gary Bloxsome, didn''t immediately
respond to a call seeking comment. </p>
<h2>Interviews </h2>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) abandoned an attempt to block first-year bankers from talking with recruiters for outside firms after employees complained, two people with knowledge of the matter said. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley had required investment-banking analysts, a title given to entry-level bankers who typically just graduated college, to swear off interviewing with other firms until Oct. 1, said the people, who requested anonymity because the policy wasn''t public. Morgan Stanley reversed course last week after the analysts, who typically work under two-year contracts, complained they were at a disadvantage to their peers at rival banks, the people said. </p> <p>Wall Street firms, forced to shrink analyst programs amid a revenue slump, are trying to guard the best of their recruits from poaching by rivals such as private-equity funds. Analysts are also under pressure, as they vie for fewer long-term openings at the banks and stiffer competition for admission to top business schools after their contracts end, said Alan Johnson, founder of compensation consultant Johnson Associates Inc. </p> <p>There''s not as many slots as there used to be, and not as many slots turn into first-year associate or third-year analyst promotions, said Richard Lipstein, managing director of New York-based recruiting firm Gilbert Tweed International. </p>

<p>The champagne used to flow at Heartland, the bar in Tokyo''s Roppongi Hills complex that drew bankers from the Japan headquarters of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. upstairs. </p> <p>Every day, there was a party, said Mai Shioya, the 39- year-old manager, who started in May 2008 before the global financial crisis that led to Lehman''s bankruptcy. </p> <p>Bankers in well-cut suits would come in about 5 p.m., hand bartenders corporate credit cards and let their friends charge drinks to the tab until 2 a.m., said Michio Nakamura, 45, who''s been running events and entertainment at Heartland since its opening as part of the famed Roppongi Hills development in 2003. After the financial crisis, many disappeared, cutting revenue by 30 percent, Shioya said. </p> <p>Those customers and that age have gone, she said. </p> <p>The void is being filled by a new group of bar patrons: information-technology workers. While financial firms have cut staff in Japan, technology companies have boosted hiring, and as bankers vacated offices at Roppongi Hills, companies including Google Inc. (GOOG) and Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) moved in. As early as this month, Apple Inc. (AAPL) will also make the complex its home in Japan, two people familiar with the plan said in January. </p> <p>Hiring demand for IT workers is very high, said Taizo Hattori, a director for information technology at Career Incubation Inc., a Tokyo-based recruiting and consulting company. Many IT firms have doubled headcounts. </p> <h2>Vacating Floors </h2> <p>Goldman Sachs, one of the original tenants which has been reducing headcount and moving jobs elsewhere in Asia, is in talks with its landlord to vacate two of the six floors it occupies in the 54-story Mori Tower, part of the $2.2 billion Roppongi Hills complex developed by Mori Building Co. (MBDZ), two people with knowledge of the matter have said. </p> <p>Lehman''s Asian business was bought by Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc., and its Japan operations were transferred to the Otemachi business district in 2010. </p> <p>U.S. and European banks have been eliminating jobs and transferring staff from Japan to Hong Kong and Singapore to reduce expenses. Goldman Sachs led foreign banks in accelerating job cuts at their Japanese brokerages, according to filings with Japan''s Financial Services Agency. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs''s Japanese brokerage unit had 847 employees as of March 31, 2012, down about 30 percent from 1,205 in March 2008, the filings show. Barclays Plc (BARC), whose Japan headquarters is also at Roppongi Hills, was another that reduced brokerage staff, according to the filings. </p> <h2>Visible Changes </h2> <p>The changes are visible at Heartland, located at the street level of the landmark Mori Tower, said Shioya, the manager. Originally opened to promote Heartland brand beer, brewed by Tokyo-based Kirin Holdings Co. (2503), it''s one of several bars and restaurants in Roppongi Hills, which also includes upscale shops, a hotel, apartments, a movie theater and an art museum. </p> <p>People used to be drinking more, she said. Some customers opened seven bottles of champagne for their birthdays. Some would ask us to prepare 100 champagne glasses for celebrations, and they were offering them to bar staff and strangers. </p> <p>With fewer bankers and more patrons from the tech world, the atmosphere has become more laid back, Shioya said. </p> <p>After business declined following the financial crisis, the bar began showing sporting events on its big-screen display to draw customers. Couches where well-dressed men and mini-skirted women once paired up to lounge and drink cocktails were replaced with tables and stools. </p> <h2>Clientele Change </h2> <p>The bankers were often drinking with ladies who came here to meet foreign businessmen, who were looking to marry a wealthy banker and go overseas, Shioya said, adding that now the women who come tend to be office workers looking to practice English. </p> <p>On a recent Friday evening, male patrons in jeans or cargo pants, unshaven, wearing baseball caps or carrying backpacks were as numerous as men in suits. </p> <p>It''s changed a lot, especially the clientele, said Felix Beatty, an information-risk-management specialist from Montreal who was celebrating his 36th birthday by drinking Heartland beer instead of champagne. </p> <p>As their hangout transformed, some of the remaining bankers abandoned it for Rigoletto, a bar and restaurant on the fifth floor, said Beatty, who''s been coming to Heartland since 2004. </p> <p>In April 2009, after overseas financial companies cut about 4,300 jobs, or 16 percent of their Japan workforce in 15 months, Heartland hosted a pink-slip party to help unemployed bankers network and find new jobs. </p> <h2>Google Expansion </h2> <p>Initially occupying 1 1/2 floors at Mori Tower, Google''s offices now take up the 26th, 28th and 30th floors, as well as most of the 27th. The Mountain View, California-based company declined in an e-mail to disclose its number of employees in the building. </p> <p>Lenovo (992), the world''s second-largest maker of personal computers, moved its Japan headquarters to Roppongi Hills in April 2010. Google, operator of the world''s biggest search engine, relocated from Tokyo''s Shibuya district in August the same year. </p> <p>Other information-technology companies in Mori Tower include Baidu Inc. (BIDU), operator of China''s most-popular search engine; Gree Inc. (3632), a Japanese social-networking game site operator; and San Francisco-based Salesforce.com, the biggest maker of online customer-management software. </p> <p>Roppongi Hills is sort of a tech hub, said Joseph Schmidt, a spokesman for Salesforce.com. The site''s central location and gas-operated power generators to keep offices working during earthquake-related power cuts make it second to none for business-continuity planning, he said. </p> <h2>Valuable Proximity </h2> <p>For Baidu, proximity to other information-technology companies is valuable, said Kaiser Kuo, a spokesman for the Beijing-based company. </p> <p>Lenovo, which started out with one floor at Mori Tower, has since expanded to a second, said Angela Lee, a spokeswoman for the Beijing-based company, which now has about 300 employees. </p> <p>Having our main office in Roppongi Hills has brought a positive impact on employees'' motivation and recruiting, Lee said. </p> <p>Apple, based in Cupertino, California, will move to Roppongi Hills from Tokyo''s Shinjuku district as early as this month and will occupy one or two floors, the people familiar with the plan said. Apple didn''t respond to requests for comment. </p> <p>IT firms are attracted because of the business environment, Tomohiro Akita, a spokesman for Mori Building, said of Mori Tower, citing the in-house power generators, hotel and conference space. </p> <h2>Hiring Jump </h2> <p>Hiring at information-technology and communications companies through three of Japan''s biggest recruiting agencies jumped 23 percent from a year earlier to 3,093 people in the six months ended Sept. 30, the Japan Executive Search and Recruitment Association said in a report in November. Financial- services hiring rose 7.5 percent to 830, it said. </p> <p>Demand for information-technology staff is outpacing supply and has been accelerating since early this year, Career Incubation''s Hattori said. </p> <p>Internet-service companies that target consumers are making money and are cash-rich, he said. They can afford to invest in human resources and are especially interested in people who can develop business overseas. </p> <p>Rents for prime office space in Tokyo have fallen more than 40 percent from a peak in the first quarter of 2008, according to property broker Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., prompting more companies to relocate as they seek to upgrade office space. </p> <h2>Falling Rent </h2> <p>Rental value in the Akasaka and Roppongi areas in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 57 percent of the 2008 peak, according to Jones Lang. That''s attracted new tenants, cutting the vacancy rate in the area to 2.7 percent as of September from 3.3 percent the preceding quarter, data from Jones Lang show. </p> <p>Geeks have increased around the area, said Hattori of Career Incubation. Even some manager-level people who earn a lot of money wear jeans and athletic shoes. Probably they don''t have to care about their clothes as they are just happy as long as they can produce something interesting. </p> <p>Technology companies have also transformed the commercial real-estate market in New York, helping offset sluggish demand from financial-services firms. Lower Manhattan office vacancies fell in the first quarter to the lowest since 2008 as technology and creative firms moved in, Cushman  Wakefield said earlier this month. </p> <p>The chances of a resurgence in financial-firm hiring in Tokyo aren''t great, said Tetsuya Sakabe, managing director at Kanae Associates Ltd., an executive-search firm specializing in the industry. </p> <p>There''s no strong demand for bankers in the mergers-and- acquisitions field, he said. And not for debt and equity capital markets, either. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Duane D.

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) jumped the most in
more than four years after reporting first-quarter profit that
topped analysts'' estimates and announcing a deal to sell some
bottling distribution rights in North America. </p>
<p>The shares rose 5.7 percent to $42.37 at the close in New
York for the Atlanta-based company''s largest gain since Feb. 12,
2009. The volume of shares traded was higher than the three-

<p>Net income fell 15 percent to $1.75 billion, or 39 cents a
share, from $2.05 billion, or 45 cents, a year earlier, Coke
said today in a statement. Excluding some items, profit was 46
cents a share, compared with the 44-cent average of 14 analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The results were helped by
higher Latin America sales volume. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has introduced new
package sizes in Latin America and emphasized Coca-Cola branded
soft drinks, Del Valle juices and Powerade. In North America,
where Kent has worked to streamline distribution, the company
said today it will retain manufacturing under the new agreement
while selling and swapping some distribution rights among five
smaller franchise bottlers. </p>
<p>This is a first step in their eventual divestment of much
of the U.S. bottling operations, Thomas Mullarkey, an analyst
for Morningstar Inc. (MORN) in Chicago, said today in a telephone
interview. They don''t want all those capital-intensive
distribution assets sitting on their balance sheet in
perpetuity. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s top mobile-phone executive said its Windows Phone operating system has an opportunity to lure away Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc.

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) fell to a three-

in trading revenue among the largest U.S. banks. </p>
<p>Shares of the company slumped 5.4 percent to $20.31, the

Financials Index. (S5FINL) Bond-trading revenue fell 42 percent in the
first quarter and stock-trading revenue declined 19 percent, New
York-based Morgan Stanley said today in a statement. </p>
<p>The drop in fixed-income revenue was the third in the past
four quarters, and offset the company''s record first-quarter
pretax profit from the brokerage unit. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

<p>Argentina''s international reserves
will drop to $37.5 billion as capital controls erode the
country''s trade balance, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s estimate of a $5.5 billion decline in central
bank funds this year assumes that capital controls will prevent
a pickup in private-sector outflows. Reserves dropped to $39.8
billion yesterday, below $40 billion for the first time since
May 2007. </p>
<p>Capital controls threaten to exert an adverse toll on
expectations of economic performance, JPMorgan analysts
including New York-based Vladimir Werning wrote in an e-mailed
research report. </p>
<p>Argentina''s merchandise trade balance will be $9.6 billion
this year, according to JPMorgan, down from a previous estimate
of $11.6 billion. </p>
<p>JPMorgan cut its 2013 agro bonus forecast, the
estimated increase in agriculture-related exports, to $4.8
billion from $6.7 billion. It projected soy crop output of 45

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the

<p>Compensation at the institutional-securities unit, which

from a year earlier, according to figures posted today on the

<p>The drop was in part driven by lower headcount, the
company said in a statement. While the firm doesn''t report how
many people are employed within the division, its total number
of employees fell 6.6 percent from a year earlier. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has cut pay and jobs, deferred bonuses and
toughened clawback rules as Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 54, seeks to improve returns amid lower trading revenue
and higher capital requirements. The bank deferred all bonuses
for employees getting both total pay exceeding $350,000 and
incentive compensation of at least $50,000, a person briefed on
the matter said in January. </p>
<p>We are benefiting from the headcount reductions, which
obviously reduces base, benefits and above-base comp, Chief
Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 55, said in a telephone interview
today, referring to compensation. We''ve also become more
efficient with location sourcing, which helps improve comp
efficiency. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s Ian Read was the
highest-paid chief executive officer at a large pharmaceutical
company last year, as U.S. top managers remained on average much
better paid than their European counterparts. </p>
<p>New York-based Pfizer increased Read''s remuneration 2.5

pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. was $17.2 million last
year, 85 percent more than the $9.3 million European average,
according to the analyst. </p>
<p>Payments to top managers in Europe, even though lower than

<p>The Bank of Japan (8301) can achieve its
goal of 2 percent inflation within two years and may need to
concern itself with containing prices if it succeeds, according
to Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O''Neill. </p>
<p>If the central bank is truly committed to reaching its
target, then it can, London-based O''Neill said at a Goldman
Sachs seminar in Tokyo today. BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda has
pledged to do whatever it takes to beat deflation and plans
to double the monetary base -- cash in circulation and the money
that financial institutions have on deposit at the central bank
-- within two years in pursuit of that goal. </p>
<p>They''ve set it themselves and they''ve got to keep doing
things to get to what is their target, O''Neill said. If they
do start to get 2 percent inflation in the next two years, how
do they stop it going, at least for a brief while, to quite a
bit more than 2 percent. That to me would be more of a valid
issue than whether they will be able to do it. </p>
<p>The 56-year-old''s confidence in Japan''s central bank runs
counter to skeptics from Bill Gross, who runs the world''s
biggest bond fund, to former BOJ Deputy Governor Kazumasa Iwata.
The Topix Index, Japan''s broadest equity measure, has rallied 55
percent since November on pledges to end deflation while the
two-year rate on overnight-index swaps, used to wager on changes
in the BOJ''s target rate, is set for its biggest monthly jump
since November 2010. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) helped write the
first-in-the-nation rule ordering reduced carbon emissions from
cars and trucks. Its biofuels chief spoke at the ceremony where
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the executive
order in 2007, the same year the oil company pledged to develop
a gasoline replacement from wood. </p>
<p>Now Chevron is leading a lobbying and public relations
campaign to undercut the California mandate aimed at curbing
global warming, two years after the state started phasing it in.
Research on commercially viable climate-friendly products has
come to naught, stymied by the poor economics of coaxing
hydrocarbons from plants'' stubborn cell walls, according to
Chevron officials. </p>
<p>We''ve looked at 100 feedstocks, 50 conversion
technologies, worked to shape this law the best we can, and we
have not come up with a solution to be able to comply, said
Rhonda Zygocki, Chevron''s executive vice president of policy and
planning, in a Feb. 4 talk at the Commonwealth Club in San
Francisco. Rick Zalesky, the Chevron official who celebrated the
order''s signing with Schwarzenegger, was blunt last June when he
declared the low-carbon standard not achievable. </p>
<p>While still promoting its commitment to renewable energy,
the second largest U.S. oil company quietly shelved most of its
biofuels work in 2010, according to internal documents and
former Chevron officials. It decided products with potential
returns of at least 5 percent weren''t enough for a multinational
used to margins triple that, said Paul Bryan, a former vice
president of biofuels technology. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
biggest energy company by market value, booked two tankers to
haul oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast via the Suez Canal in May at
what may be this year''s lowest rates, a shipbroker said. </p>
<p>The very large crude carriers, each able to haul 2 million
barrels of oil, will load in the Persian Gulf on May 7, Athens-
based Optima Shipbrokers Ltd. said in an e-mailed report today.
The ships were chartered at rates of 15.75 and 16 industry-
standard Worldscale points, it said. Those would be the lowest
levels so far in 2013 for the route, according to figures
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Hire costs for tankers hauling Middle East crude to the
Gulf Coast slipped 0.2 percent to 18.3 Worldscale points today,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. That''s down 26
percent from the start of the year. Charter costs on the journey
declined in the third quarter of every year starting in 2007,
according to figures compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The market is very weak, and I think this summer will be
just as bad as the previous two, Dag Kilen, an analyst at
Fearnley Consultants A/S, part of Norway''s second-largest
shipbroker, said by e-mail. Rates could get potentially even
worse if oil prices remain under downward pressure, as it will
tighten OPEC output. </p>
<h2>Return Voyages </h2>
<p>Shipowners will seek to cover fuel costs by securing
charters for return voyages after vessels unload their original
cargoes, Kilen said. Exxon Mobil spokesman Richard Scrase in
Leatherhead, England, declined to comment by phone today. </p>
<p>VLCCs built in 2010 and carrying Middle East oil to the
U.S. were losing $2,140 a week on average as of April 19,
according to figures from Clarkson Plc (CKN), the world''s biggest
shipbroker. The ships were earning $31,227 a year earlier. </p>
<p>Hire costs for VLCCs on the benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-Japan
journey were little changed today at 32.06 Worldscale points,
figures from the Baltic Exchange showed. The ships'' daily losses
widened to $714 from $254 on April 19. </p>
<p>The exchange''s assessments don''t account for owners''
efforts to improve returns by securing cargoes for return
voyages or reducing speed to burn less fuel. The price of fuel,
or bunkers, the industry''s main expense, fell 1.4 percent to
$599.88 a metric ton today, figures compiled by Bloomberg from
25 ports showed. </p>

shipping costs that includes vessels smaller than VLCCs, added

$500 million of commercial-mortgage bonds, capping what probably

than five years. </p>
<p>The lender plans to issue securities linked to 82
properties spanning the U.S. from California to Kentucky,
according to a person familiar with the offering who asked not
to be identified because terms aren''t public. Hotel loans
account for 64.2 percent of the deal, the person said. </p>
<p>Issuance of bonds tied to commercial real estate in April
is poised to surpass the $8.3 billion sold in January, which
marked the highest monthly volume since December 2007, according
to JPMorgan. Volume was $6.9 billion through April 19, the bank
said. Investors are reversing course after pulling back amid the
glut of offerings, debt analysts at New York-based JPMorgan said
in a report last week. </p>
<p>After some weakness to start the month, pricing spreads
have begun to snap back despite the uptick in supply, the
analysts led by Ed Reardon wrote. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc sold
top-ranked securities maturing in about 10 years to yield 81
basis points, or 0.81 percentage point, more than the benchmark
swap rate on April 18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with 85 basis points on similar debt issued by the
lenders on March 6, the data show. </p>
<h2>Risk Demand </h2>
<p>Demand for riskier portions of the deals is building. Wells
Fargo and RBS sold bonds rated BBB-, the lowest investment-grade
ranking, to pay a spread of 310 basis points more than swaps
this month, compared with 375 basis points in March, people
familiar with the transaction said. </p>
<p>Investors are buying the bonds as the Federal Reserve''s
effort to stimulate economic growth by suppressing borrowing
costs pushes investors toward riskier assets. </p>
<p>Insurance companies boosted purchases of lower-ranking
commercial-mortgage debt this year by nine percentage points,
accounting for 33 percent of subordinate debt purchases from new
deals, the JPMorgan analysts said in a separate report on April
12. </p>
<p>Issuance of commercial-mortgage bonds is poised to climb 50
percent to $70 billion in 2013, according to Credit Suisse Group

<p>Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is starting to run low on dollars to pay
the nation''s bondholders. </p>
<p>Central bank reserves fell six percent in the first
quarter, the most for the period in six years, and sank below
$40 billion this month for the first time since 2007. As
investors await a U.S. court ruling on whether the nation must
pay holdout creditors including billionaire Paul Singer from its
2001 default, the extra yield they demand to own Argentine debt
instead of Treasuries rose to 12 percentage points this year.
That''s almost twice the premium similarly rated Belarus and
Ukraine pay, leaving Argentina as the only distressed borrower
among 55 emerging markets tracked by JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>The drain on Argentina''s reserves, which Fernandez has used
for public spending and payments to bondholders since 2010, is
set to accelerate as revenue growth from agricultural exports
slows, JPMorgan estimates. Reserves will tumble at the fastest
rate in a decade by year-end, leaving Argentina with just $37.5
billion. That would only cover 75 percent of the country''s
foreign-currency debt obligations due from 2014, Economy
Ministry data show. </p>
<p>What the market looks at is the country''s ability to pay
in the future, Mariano Tavelli, president of brokerage Tavelli
 Cia., said in a phone interview from Buenos Aires. For now,
we don''t see a genuine stream of dollars coming in that will
replenish the reserves we''re losing. </p>
<h2>Debt Payments </h2>
<p>The government has made about $755 million in debt payments
this year by drawing down central bank reserves. The treasury
gets money from the central bank in exchange for a non-
transferable 10-year note that pays maximum interest of the one-
year London interbank offered rate minus one percentage point.
Libor was at 0.715 percent on April 19. </p>
<p>After 2013, the government''s foreign currency debt
obligations will total $50.3 billion, excluding the $27.9
billion in non-transferable notes sold to the central bank,
according to the latest Economy Ministry data. </p>
<p>While Fernandez has banned most foreign-currency purchases,
the reserve decline is prompting more Argentines to try to buy
dollars as central bank president Mercedes Marco del Pont pumps
pesos into the economy to keep borrowing costs low, said
Tavelli. With a 37 percent increase in the money supply over the
past year, the 304 billion peso ($59 billion) monetary base is
within 2 percent of its record high on Dec. 28. </p>
<h2>Weakening Peso </h2>
<p>Expectations of a steeper decline in the peso, which will
weaken a further 12 percent this year to 5.84 per dollar,
according to the median estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, may tempt exporters to hoard their grain until then,
according to Hernan Yellati, a strategist at BancTrust  Co. in
Miami. Argentines pay as much as 8.9105 pesos per dollar in a
parallel exchange market compared to the official rate of
5.1673. </p>
<p>The government''s revenue from export duties fell in March
for a fourth month, declining 30 percent from a year earlier,
the only tax segment to post a drop. Vladimir Werning, an
economist at JPMorgan in New York, estimates exports will total
$87.1 billion this year, an 8 percent increase from last year on
a better harvest. </p>
<p>In addition to fewer dollars being sold to the central
bank, Argentines withdrew $665 million from their dollar-
denominated savings accounts this year, contributing to the loss
in reserves, according to Werning. Banks deposit foreign
currency that is not loaned to exporters in Argentina''s central
bank, so when savers make withdrawals, the central bank returns
the cash to the bank and reserves decline. </p>
<h2>Investor Attention'' </h2>
<p>The decline in gross international reserves continues to
be a focus of investor attention, Werning wrote in a report.
The time that policymakers have bought with controls has not
been invested to resolve fundamental macro concerns, such as
high inflation and ongoing real exchange rate appreciation. </p>
<p>Prices rose 24.4 percent in March from a year earlier,
opposition lawmakers, citing estimates from economists, said
April 11, as the peso weakened 14.7 percent in the past year. </p>
<p>Inflation and the peso''s decline led Vale SA (VALE5), the world''s
biggest iron-ore producer, to shelve a $5.9 billion potash
project in Argentina last month. The cost to develop the project
almost doubled to $11 billion, while Argentina refused to give
the Rio de Janeiro-based company any tax breaks, Chief Executive
Officer Murilo Ferreira said on March 18. </p>
<h2>No Problem'' </h2>
<p>The nation''s savings are also being squeezed by state-owned
oil company YPF SA (YPFD), which will have to spend an additional $400
million to import fuel to supply service stations after a flood
and fire at its La Plata refinery reduced output. </p>
<p>Still, the government will have enough reserves to pay debt
at least through 2016, according to Luis Celasco, who manages
1.7 billion pesos of Argentina bonds at RJ Delta, a unit of
Raymond James Financial Inc. in Buenos Aires. </p>
<p>I don''t think the drop in reserves below $40 billion is a
trigger for people to sell bonds, Celasco said in a telephone
interview. With the current picture, now that capital flight
has decelerated because of currency controls, there''s no
problem. </p>
<p>The cost to protect $10 million of Argentine debt against
non-payment during five years with credit-default swaps plunged
1,037 basis points, or 10.37 percentage points, this month to
2,072 basis points, data compiled by CMA Ltd. show. </p>
<p>The swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent if a borrower fails
to adhere to its debt agreements. </p>
<h2>Commodity Cycle </h2>
<p>In commodity-dependent Peru, the central bank''s foreign
currency holdings have risen eight percent this year. In Brazil,
the world''s biggest shipper of coffee and orange juice and the
second-biggest exporter of soybeans, reserves have dropped just
0.4 percent to $377 billion. </p>
<p>They''re underperforming relative to what their neighbors
are doing, so you kind of expect as a commodity producer in this
commodity cycle, they should be doing a little bit better,
Gabriel Torres, an analyst at Moody''s Investors Service, said in
a telephone interview from New York. It''s just purely because
of a lack of confidence in the government. </p>

<p>Charles Manby, a senior partner at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., will lead a 100 million-pound ($152
million) fundraising campaign for the Francis Crick Institute,
which will be Europe''s largest biomedical research center. </p>
<p>Manby will be chairman of the 16-member board collecting
the money for Cancer Research UK, which is contributing to the
institute''s 650 million-pound construction cost and its 120
million-pound annual budget. The board includes the chief
executive officers of International Standard Asset Management,
Ted Baker Plc (TED), Ingenious, Newton Investment Management, New York
Times Co. (NYT), and WPP Plc (WPP), Cancer Research UK said today in an e-
mailed statement. </p>
<p>The institute will open in London in 2015. Paul Nurse, a
2001 Nobel Prize winner in physiology or medicine for work on
cell cycle regulation, is leading a four-year effort to build
the facility. At 1 million square feet and with as many as 1,500
employees, including 1,250 scientists, he said the Crick
Institute will become Europe''s biggest science research center
in one building. </p>
<p>The institute will take new approaches in carrying out
biomedical research aimed at speeding up scientific discovery
and the application of those discoveries, Nurse said in the
statement. We need the funds to make this a reality. </p>
<h2>CEO Members </h2>
<p>International Standard Asset Management CEO Stanley Fink,
Ted Baker CEO Ray Kelvin, Ingenious CEO Patrick McKenna, Newton
Investment CEO Helena Morrissey, WPP CEO Martin Sorrell and New
York Times CEO Mark Thompson will work with Manby to raise money
for the institute, according to the cancer charity. </p>
<p>Other members of the Cancer Research UK fundraising board
are Sherry Coutu, an investor who serves on the finance board of
Cambridge University; former HSBC Holdings Plc CEO Michael Geoghegan; David Harding, founder and president of Winton
Capital Management LLC; Richard Hayden, chairman of Haymarket
Financial; Autonomy Corp. co-founder Mike Lynch; Hayat Palumbo,
chairman of the Walbrook Club; Andrew Pisker, co-founder of
Richmond Park Partners LLP and former CEO of Dresdner Kleinwort
Wasserstein; Lee Portnoi, former chairman of TIS Group Ltd; and
Mark Yallop, U.K. group country CEO at UBS AG. </p>
<p>The U.K. government-funded Medical Research Council is
paying 300 million pounds of the Crick''s construction costs, the
Wellcome Trust is providing 120 million pounds and London-based
Cancer Research UK is contributing 160 million pounds. Imperial
College London, King''s College London and University College
London are pitching in 40 million pounds each. The total
includes contingency funds. </p>
<p>The expected 120 million-pound annual budget will come from
the same sources. Cancer Research will fund 40 million pounds to
50 million pounds a year and the Wellcome Trust will give an
undetermined amount, the heads of both groups said. The
remainder will come from the government and the universities. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Barclays
Plc (BARC) were the top firms for providing over-the-counter commodity
derivatives to companies hedging energy and metals exposure,
while investors favored Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), a Greenwich
Associates survey found. </p>
<p>Barclays and JPMorgan, which tied for No. 1 position, had
relationships with 39 percent of the global corporations
surveyed about their OTC dealers to hedge energy exposure, ahead
of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS), the survey found. JPMorgan
also led in metals. Among investors, 59 percent said they had a
relationship with Goldman Sachs, 54 percent named JPMorgan and
47 percent used Barclays. </p>
<p>Banks are rethinking their approach to the commodities
business in light of new capital requirements and regulations,
Andrew Awad, a consultant with Stamford, Connecticut-based
researcher Greenwich Associates, said in a statement today.
The landscape is becoming far more fragmented, as few banks
want to be all things to all people and more find specific
segments. </p>
<p>Commodities revenue at the 10 largest banks slumped 24
percent last year to $6 billion amid low volatility and client
flows as Goldman ranked No. 1, followed by JPMorgan, according
to a Feb. 15 report from analytics company Coalition. Increasing
concerns about regulation and capital sensitivity also led banks
to re-examine commodity strategies, it said. </p>
<p>Fifty-five percent in the Greenwich survey said they used
JPMorgan to hedge their metals exposure, while 34 percent used
Barclays. Thirty-three percent named Citigroup and Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) and 26 percent said they hedged with Societe Generale SA. </p>
<h2>Top Ranking </h2>
<p>JPMorgan led the ranks in energy because of its dominance
in the U.S. and Asia, according to the survey. Barclays tied
with Morgan Stanley for the top position in Europe. </p>
<p>Speculation about investors leaving commodities because of
regulatory changes appears to be overblown, according to
Greenwich Associates. Investment managers will continue to use
OTC markets for index business, while hedge funds are likely to
move to futures over time as regulations are enforced, Awad
said. </p>
<p>Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan
declined to comment for this story. Greenwich Associates
surveyed 276 corporations that hedge their energy exposure and
98 that hedge metals, as well as 68 commodity investors that use
OTC derivatives between September and November. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that
the selloff in copper was overdone and it remains bullish on
the metal at a lower price. </p>
<p>The bank cut its three-month estimate to $7,500 a metric
ton from $8,000, lowered its six-month prediction to $8,000 from
$9,000, and the 12-month forecast fell to $7,000 from $8,000,
Goldman analysts including London-based Max Layton and Hong
Kong-based Roger Yuan said in a report dated today. Copper for
three-month delivery traded at $6,905 today. </p>
<p>The metal has lost 13 percent this year and slumped into a
bear market as Europe struggled with its debt crisis and growth
slowed in China, the biggest metals consumer. Europe and China
account for about 60 percent of world consumption. Inventories
tracked by the London Metal Exchange almost doubled in 2013. </p>
<p>The forecasts have been downgraded to acknowledge the
increasing willingness of the market to price future surplus
ahead of time and the risks to growth in the broader emerging
market, the report said. </p>
<p>While prices have suffered on concerns China''s economy may
slow, the bank said the country''s underlying cyclical growth
is likely stronger than the headline figures suggest. </p>
<p>Copper in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange is being drawn down, it said. The bank estimated bonded
stockpiles at 510,000 tons from 715,000 tons in early March and
noted that futures in Shanghai are in backwardation. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) won approval to
release Iron Man 3 in China on May 3, offering a separate
version aimed at enhancing the film''s appeal in the world''s
second-largest movie market. </p>
<p>The release date for the picture, produced by Disney''s
Marvel unit and Beijing-based DMG Entertainment, was announced
yesterday in an e-mail. Iron Man 3, one of the company''s big
summer films, opens the same the day in the U.S. </p>
<p>The retooled version of Iron Man 3 will highlight
Chinese actors and include additional China footage, according
to the company. Burbank, California-based Disney, along with
other studios, is trying to meet local tastes and satisfy a
censorship board. A simultaneous release in both countries
reduces the risk of piracy cutting into sales in China. </p>
<p>There are very few foreign films that get that
opportunity, said Robert Cain, a film producer and consultant
for studios working in China. It doesn''t allow any time for
piracy to eat into Iron Man 3'' grosses. </p>
<p>The U.S. opening of Iron Man 3 has been clouded by a
dispute between Disney and large U.S. and Canadian cinema
operators over how ticket revenue will be shared. Regal
Entertainment Group, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., Cinemark
Holdings Inc. and Toronto-based Cineplex Inc. aren''t offering
advance sales during negotiations. </p>

<p>General Dynamics Corp. (GD), the maker
of Abrams tanks and Gulfstream business jets, rose the most in
four years after beating analysts'' estimates for first-quarter
profit. </p>
<p>Net income from continuing operations increased 1.2 percent
to $571 million, or $1.62 a share, compared with $564 million,
or $1.57 a share, a year earlier, the Falls Church, Virginia-
based company said today in a statement. Analysts forecast $1.50
a share, the average of 19 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales fell 2.3 percent to $7.4 billion. </p>
<p>General Dynamics rose 6.9 percent to close at $71.73 in New
York trading, the biggest one-day gain since January 2009. </p>
<p>The company is focusing on cost-cutting and increasing
margins after reporting a $2.1 billion fourth-quarter loss that
new Chief Executive Officer Phebe Novakovic attributed to ill-
advised acquisitions and declining defense spending. The company
didn''t alter its 2013 forecast for profit of $6.60 to $6.70 a
share made in January. </p>
<p>General Dynamics'' first-quarter performance reflects our
continued focus on operations, cost improvement and cash
generation, as well as our commitment to meeting our customers''
requirements, Novakovic said in the statement. </p>
<p>Analysts had predicted sales of $7.54 billion, the average
of 16 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Automatic U.S. budget cuts took effect March 1. The across-
the-board reductions were crafted by President Barack Obama and
congressional Republicans as a penalty for failing to agree on a
deficit reduction strategy. They will strip $1.2 trillion from
national security and domestic programs over nine years unless a
compromise is reached. </p>
<p>Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT), the world''s largest defense company,
said yesterday its first-quarter profit beat analysts'' estimates
as sales declined 2 percent compared with a year earlier.
Lockheed cautioned that the automatic budget reductions may push
2013 sales to the low end of its prior forecast. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) plans a special
unveiling related to the Xbox, suggesting that the world''s
biggest software maker use the event to introduce the latest
version of its game console. </p>
<p>The event will be held at Microsoft''s Redmond, Washington,
headquarters, according to the e-mailed invitation. It will also
be shown online, via the Xbox Live service and the Spike TV
network. </p>
<p>The software maker is planning a new version of the console
to maintain its 27-month lead over Sony Corp. (6758) and Nintendo Co.
in a market projected to expand to $70 billion in 2017. It''s
also adding features to the Xbox designed to help it withstand
the shift to games downloaded to computers and mobile devices
from packaged products. </p>
<p>Microsoft will share our vision for Xbox and give you a
real taste of the future, Larry Hryb, the Director of Xbox
Programming who goes by the name Major Nelson, on his official
Xbox blog. He said Microsoft will will continue to discuss its
plans and show its games lineup in May at the E3 show in Los
Angeles. </p>
<p>Microsoft will use an Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) processor
in the next Xbox game console, seeking to cut the cost of
building machines and get developers to create more titles,
people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.
Xbox has led console sales in the U.S. for the last 27 months,
according to market-research firm NPD Group. </p>
<h2>Competitor Consoles </h2>
<p>Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4, the newest version of its
own console, in February and plans to release it in time for the
holiday shopping season. Microsoft had considered holding its
event in April and scrapped that plan, people familiar with the
matter said earlier this month. The company saw little
competitive pressure from Sony''s announcement, the people said. </p>
<p>Nintendo''s Wii U, another competitor, has been selling
below the company''s initial forecasts. In January, the company
said it expected to sell 4 million units in the fiscal year
ending March 31, down from a previous outlook for 5.5 million. </p>
<p>Traditional console makers face competition from cheaper
machines like Ouya Inc.''s online gaming device, and changes in
game play that favor inexpensive titles for mobile devices such
as Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPads and Samsung''s Galaxy Tab. </p>
<p>U.S. retail sales of packaged video games fell 21 percent
last year to $8.9 billion, according to researcher NPD Group,
while revenue from games downloaded to computers and mobile
devices rose 16 percent to $5.9 billion. Globally, the market
including hardware and accessories was $67 billion. </p>

<p>Mobile phones are creating
opportunities for women in emerging markets to advance in
business and society, even as they trail men in adoption of the
devices, a panel of technology and philanthropy executives said. </p>
<p>Information available on handsets is bridging the gender
gap in remote parts of the world, giving women access to health-
care information and professional advice, Nelson Mattos, vice
president of product and engineering for Europe and emerging
markets at Google Inc. (GOOG), said at an event organized by the World
Affairs Council and Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Low-priced feature phones prevalent in emerging markets can
tap into the Web, helping to educate women and allow them to
communicate, he said. More women are getting connected via
mobile phones, though not as quickly as men. A woman is 21
percent less likely to own a handset than a man in low- and
middle-income countries, according to a report by Vital Wave
Consulting. </p>
<p>Mobile technology is creating opportunities for women
that did not exist before, Mattos said. Health care is the
one that has benefited the most, particularly in remote areas. </p>
<p>In one study by the Grameen Foundation in Ghana, women used
phones to find advice on pregnancy and childcare, Mattos said.
Women there incorrectly believed that they should stop feeding
when they felt pain in their breasts, he said. </p>
<p>Imagine the consequences of a two- or three-day old child
who is getting nothing to eat, Mattos said. They actually
managed to break that myth and say, No, it''s exactly the
opposite. You should feed so the pain goes away.'' </p>
<h2>Broader Access </h2>
<p>About 6 billion people in the world have mobile phones,
according to the United Nations. While women are slower to adopt
new technologies including mobile devices, the number of women
who do is expected to grow dramatically in the next few years,
Rodger Voorhies, the director of the Financial Services for the
Poor initiative at the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, said on
the panel. </p>
<p>We have to get the right applications and the right
empowerment strategies, Voorhies said. They''re most
vulnerable when they''re disconnected. They''re most vulnerable
when they''re not known. </p>
<p>Women in Saudi Arabia are signing up for Twitter''s Web-
based short-messaging service to read news and voice their
opinions, said Katie Jacobs Stanton, the company''s vice
president of international market development, who was also on
the panel. </p>
<p>The technology industry is traditionally male-dominated,
yet women in emerging markets are starting to pursue those types
of careers. Women outnumber men in some computer-science classes
in the Middle East because the professions typically allow them
to work in an office or from home, Mattos said. </p>
<p>Women oftentimes are even more isolated than men in low-
income communities, Voorhies said. </p>

<p> Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s rheumatoid arthritis
pill failed to win the backing of European drug regulators, who
said the drug already approved in the U.S. isn''t effective
enough against the condition. </p>
<p>The European Medicines Agency''s Committee for Medicinal
Products for Human Use, or CHMP, recommended that Pfizer''s pill
Xeljanz not be approved for sale, the New York-based drugmaker
said today in a statement. The drug gained marketing clearance
in the U.S. in November. </p>
<p>Pfizer intends to appeal this opinion and immediately
seek a re-examination of the opinion by the CHMP, the company
said. The committee decided the drug didn''t show a favorable
risk versus benefit profile, Pfizer said. </p>
<p>Xeljanz inhibits part of the immune system that can cause
rheumatoid arthritis. The first of a new type of therapies for
the disease, the pill is one of Pfizer''s top new products. If
approved in Europe, it may generate sales of $510 million there
by 2018, according to Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with
International Strategy  Investment Group in New York. The
medicine would compete with AbbVie Inc.''s Humira (ABBV) and Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ)''s Remicade. </p>
<p>Pfizer will appeal, but history teaches that odds are
against them, Schoenebaum said today in a note to clients.
More data might help Pfizer on appeal, which may take six
months, he said. </p>
<h2>Comittee''s View </h2>
<p>The European regulators said the drug didn''t show enough
effectiveness in reducing the disease''s activity in the body or
slowing damage to joints, even though it improved symptoms,
Pfizer said. There were also concerns about side effects

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), one of four U.S.
companies with a top credit rating from Standard  Poor''s and
Moody''s Investors Service, sold $2.67 billion of bonds with a
portion of euro-denominated debt paying a record-low coupon. </p>
<p>The world''s largest software maker issued bonds in euros
for the first time, raising 550 million euros ($715 million)
with 20-year, 2.625 percent notes, the lowest coupon among
similar-maturity, non-financial corporate bonds sold in that
currency, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt pays
55 basis points more than swaps. </p>
<p>In the U.S., the company also sold $450 million of 1
percent, five-year securities that pay 32 basis points more than
Treasuries, $1 billion of 2.375 percent, 10-year notes that
yield an extra 70 basis points and $500 million of 3.75 percent,
30-year bonds that pay a spread of 90. </p>
<p>Proceeds may be used to fund working capital, stock
repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said today in separate filings. </p>
<p>The debt is opportunistic and helps us lower the overall
cost of capital, said Peter Wootton, a spokesman for
Microsoft. The pricing in Europe is very attractive in this
20-year tenor. </p>
<p>The company''s $14.3 billion of outstanding bonds before
today''s sale include $750 million of 2.125 percent notes due
November 2022 that traded at 98.5 cents on the dollar April 23
to yield 2.3 percent, or 60.2 basis points more than Treasuries,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>While average yields on investment-grade corporate debt
have dropped 8 basis points to 2.69 percent since Microsoft last
issued bonds in November, the company''s new dollar securities
were priced with higher coupons than those in the previous
offering, according to Bloomberg and Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. </p>
<p>Microsoft, along with Johnson  Johnson, Exxon Mobil Corp.
and Automatic Data Processing Inc., are rated Aaa by Moody''s and
AAA at SP. Fitch Ratings ranks the company a level lower at
AA+. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest company by market value, said net income rose as
widening chemical margins made up for lower crude production and
prices. </p>
<p>First-quarter profit was $9.5 billion, or $2.12 a share,
compared with $9.45 billion, or $2 a year earlier, the Irving,
Texas-based company said in statement today. Exxon was expected
to report per-share net income of $2.05, based on the average of
19 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson has been
acquiring North American gas and oil fields and expanding
exploration in Russia, Africa and the Gulf of Mexico to stem
production declines that the company has said will extend
through the end of this year. Exxon''s global output will fall 1
percent this year after dropping by 5.9 percent in 2012, the
company said in a March 6 slide presentation to analysts. </p>
<p>Exxon hasn''t turned new discoveries into producing fields
quickly enough to replace shrinking output from assets that have
been pumping oil and gas for decades. </p>
<p>The company''s Kearl oil-sands development in Canada that is
expected to produce 3.2 billion barrels over the next three
decades has been beset by equipment-transport and weather
delays. The project was expected to produce its first batch of
pipeline-ready crude within days, Pius Rolheiser, a
spokesman for Exxon''s Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) unit, said on April 23. </p>
<h2>Share Performance </h2>
<p>Exxon underperformed its biggest U.S. rival, Chevron Corp. (CVX),
and the broader market during the first quarter, advancing 4.1
percent. During that period, Chevron increased 9.9 percent and
the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index rose 10 percent. </p>
<p>Crude demand declined or stagnated during the first three
months of the year in Europe''s largest economies as well as
Japan and South Korea, the Paris-based International Energy
Agency said in a March 13 report. Brent crude futures, the
benchmark for two-thirds of the world''s oil, averaged $112.61 a
barrel during the quarter, down 4.9 percent from $118.45 a year
earlier. </p>
<p>Exxon relies on oil and gas sales outside the U.S. for 71
percent of its operating earnings, more than any major U.S. oil
producer aside from Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO), Paul Cheng, an analyst
at Barclays, said in an April 8 note to clients. Houston-based
Marathon counts on foreign oil and gas sales for 77 percent of
its operating earnings, according to Cheng. </p>
<h2>Gas Futures </h2>
<p>The impact of lower crude prices was partly blunted by
higher gas prices in the U.S., where Exxon is the biggest
producer of the furnace and power-plant fuel. Gas futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange averaged $3.478 per million
British thermal units during the January-to-March period, up 39
percent from the year-earlier period, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Exxon became the pre-eminent U.S. gas supplier in
2010 after its $34.9 billion acquisition of XTO Energy Inc.
vaulted the company past Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) </p>
<p>Exxon''s worldwide gas production will decline by 5 percent
this year, the company told analysts last month. Shares rose 0.2
percent to $89.43 yesterday in New York. </p>

<p>Kai Tschoeke, Morgan Stanley (MS)''s
chief of German and Austrian mergers and acquisitions, is
leaving the New York-based bank after more than 20 years. </p>
<p>Tschoeke, 45, who has been with the firm for his entire
career, will depart this year to pursue other interests,
according to a spokeswoman for the bank, who asked not to be
named in line with company policy. His tasks on the German
management board will be assumed by existing members, she said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley was ranked No. 1 in German MA last year
after advising Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) on the merger of its T-Mobile
USA unit with MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) as well as industrial
gas-maker Linde AG (LIN)''s acquisition of Lincare. The bank is ranked
No. 5 so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Tschoeke''s departure comes amid a shake-up of some of the
top MA bankers in Germany as first-quarter deal volume in
Europe''s largest economy fell to the lowest level since the
second quarter of 2012. Ken Oliver Fritz, the head of investment
banking for Germany at Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), is leaving to
become  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)''s co-head, Lazard said in an e-mailed
statement today. He''s replacing Alexander Doll, who was hired by
Barclays Plc (BARC) in August. </p>
<p>Tschoeke advised Putzmeister Holding AG, Germany''s largest

Industry Co. (600031) in 2002 in the biggest ever Chinese-German takeover
at the time. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) said it settled
suits brought by investors in two structured investment vehicles
called Cheyne and Rhinebridge, </p>
<p>The investors, led by Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) and King
County, Washington, also agreed to drop their claims against
Moody''s Investors Service Inc. and Standard  Poor''s, the
world''s largest provider of credit ratings owned by New York-
based McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP), the investors said in a notice filed in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan today. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs claimed the defendants gave the vehicles
inflated ratings in two separate suits filed in federal court in
Manhattan in 2008 and 2009. The rating companies worked with
Morgan Stanley to structure the notes, and their compensation
was based on the notes receiving the desired ratings, the
plaintiffs claimed. </p>
<p>The investors claimed Morgan Stanley was negligent in
conveying ratings that it should have known were inaccurate. </p>
<p>A trial in the Abu Dhabi case had been scheduled to begin

<p>Spanish and Italian bonds are
poised to extend gains as a recovery in liquidity lures
international investors back to the markets they fled during
Europe''s debt crisis, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. </p>
<p>The periphery''s performance has been very strong this
year and we still expect to see more, said Carl Norrey, the
head of European rates securities at JPMorgan Chase and Co. in
London in an interview on April 22. Lower yields, less
volatility, tighter bid-offer spreads and more turnover breed
confidence. </p>
<p>Spanish bonds have returned 21 percent since European
Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged on July 26 to do
whatever it takes to safeguard the monetary union, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Italy''s bonds gained 16 percent.
The nation''s two-year note yield dropped to a record low on
April 23 as it moved closer to appointing a new government after
inconclusive elections two months ago. </p>
<p>The gap between the yield at which traders say they will
buy and sell Spain''s benchmark 10-year bond narrowed to less
than two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, this week from
more than 12 basis points in June 2012, according to closing-
market data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Average daily trading of Spanish government bonds increased
to 44 billion euros ($57 billion) in February from 36 billion
euros in December, according to data from Spain''s Treasury. The
share of securities held by overseas investors rose to 37.9
percent, from 33.5 percent in August. In 2011 it was more than
50 percent. </p>
<h2>Conviction Trade </h2>
<p>Spain''s 10-year bond yield is headed for an eighth-straight
monthly decline, falling to 4.28 percent at 4:12 p.m. London
time today from 6.86 percent at the end of August. Italy''s 10-
year yield was at 4.07 percent today, from 5.85 percent on Aug.
31. </p>
<p>It feels like the market is caught between respecting
that performance and not having huge conviction to necessarily
go long Italy or Spain, said Norrey, referring to a bet that
the price of the securities will rise. If you have a
resolution to a grand coalition in Italy in coming days, I see
no reason why we can''t end up having Italian yields at 3.50
percent to 3.75 percent in the next two-to-three weeks. </p>
<p>Italy''s prime minister-designate Enrico Letta met
representatives from various political parties yesterday in a
bid to form a government. The country is still without a new
government after elections in February failed to produce a
conclusive result. </p>
<p>Italian government bonds fell for a third day today after a
rally that took the 10-year yield below 4 percent for the first
time since November 2010. </p>
<p>The market has a lot of momentum and every time this year
when there''s been a selloff in peripheral bonds, losses have
been reversed within a week, Norrey said. Over the last few
years, a lot of people have tried to have a maximum short
position in the periphery because they thought the euro zone
would fall apart, he said, referring to bets the bonds would
drop. It hasn''t happened and investors got hurt. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world''s third-
biggest energy company by market value, reported first-quarter
profit that exceeded analysts'' estimates after boosting natural
gas output amid rising prices for the fuel. </p>
<p>Net income declined 4.5 percent to $6.18 billion, or $3.18
a share, from $6.47 billion, or $3.27, a year earlier, the San
Ramon, California-based company said in a statement today. The
per-share result was 8 cents higher than the average of 19
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chevron''s earnings from oil and gas wells outside the U.S.
rose 3.1 percent to $4.78 billion as increased gas output more
than offset lower crude production. In the U.S., the company
raised gas output from new wells in Appalachia''s Marcellus Shale
formation where most of the drilling costs are being borne by
India''s Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) under the terms of a joint-
venture. </p>
<p>Chevron is almost drilling for free out there, so when
you combine that with the prolific nature of the Marcellus, the
returns are high, Allen Good, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. (MORN)
in Chicago, said in a telephone interview today. </p>
<p>Total sales declined by 6.4 percent to $56.8 billion on
slumping oil prices. During the January-to-March period, Brent
crude futures fell 4.9 percent from a year earlier to average
$112.61 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chevron rose 1.3 percent to $120 at 11:13 a.m. in New York. </p>
<h2>Increasing Production </h2>
<p>Chevron is spending $36.7 billion this year on exploration,
gas-export terminals and refinery upgrades from the Indian Ocean
to British Columbia after oil and gas output fell to a four-year
low in 2012. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson
has expanded the company''s onshore North American holdings and
last month said it will use intensive drilling techniques
perfected in U.S. shale formations to unlock crude reserves in
the deep-water Gulf of Mexico. </p>
<p>The company''s worldwide production increased 0.5 percent to
the equivalent of 2.65 million barrels of oil a day during the
first quarter, according to the statement. </p>
<p>During the quarter, Chevron raised U.S. gas output by 7.3
percent as prices that touched a 10-year low in early 2012
surged 39 percent to an average of $3.48 per million British
thermal units during the quarter. </p>
<p>Chevron entered the Marcellus Shale in 2011 with the
acquisition of Atlas Energy Inc. The transaction included a
previously-signed joint venture between Atlas and Reliance that
committed the Indian company to cover most of the drilling costs
in exchange for a stake in each well. </p>
<h2>Outperforming Exxon </h2>
<p>Chevron expects oil and gas production to increase 1.5
percent this year to a daily average equivalent to 2.65 million
barrels a day, the company said in a slide presentation for
analysts on March 13. The outlook assumes an average crude price
of $112 a barrel for 2013. </p>
<p>Chevron shares advanced 9.9 percent during the first
quarter, outperforming bigger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), which
increased 4.1 percent. </p>
<p>Chevron reaps 70 percent of its operating earnings from oil
and gas sales outside the U.S., Paul Cheng, an analyst at
Barclays Plc, said in an April 8 note to clients. Among U.S.-
based international oil producers, only Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) and
Exxon gather a higher proportion of earnings overseas, according
to Cheng. </p>
<p>Exxon is the world''s largest energy company based on market
value, followed by PetroChina Co. (857), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s biggest brokerage,
issued $3.65 billion in four parts and London-based Diageo sold
$3.25 billion in its first issue in almost a year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Offerings rose 22 percent from last
week''s $29.5 billion and were the most since $47.3 billion in
the five days ended March 22. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures fell to 212 basis points
yesterday from 216 basis points on April 19, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index data. Yields decreased to a
record-low 3.41 percent from 3.45 percent. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) issued five-year notes split between a $2.5
billion, 2.125 percent portion yielding 145 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries and a $700 million floating-
rate piece yielding 128 basis points more than the three-month
London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg data show. Libor is a
rate at which banks say they can borrow from each other. </p>
<p>The remaining portions were add-ons to existing debt of the
New York-based bank due February 2016, including $150 million of
1.75 percent notes at a relative yield of 118 basis points and
$300 million of floating-rate debt, Bloomberg data show. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>Diageo, the world''s biggest distiller, issued $750 million
of 0.625 percent, three-year debt at a 35 basis-point spread to
benchmarks, $650 million of 1.125 percent, five-year notes at 55

at 95 and $500 million of 3.875 percent, 30-year debt at 105,

<p>The three largest U.S. cinema
chains reached agreements to show Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s Iron Man
3, settling a revenue-sharing dispute that threatened the
first big film of the summer movie season. </p>
<p>Regal Entertainment Group (RGC), the largest, and No. 2 AMC
Entertainment Holdings Inc. were accepting online orders for the
May 3 opening of Iron Man 3, the companies said yesterday.
The No. 3 chain, Cinemark Holdings Inc. (CNK), also agreed to sell
tickets, according to a Disney spokesman. Terms weren''t
disclosed. </p>
<p>With the accords, Disney''s Marvel unit and the exhibitors
avert a potentially costly dispute. The chains had resisted the
studio''s demand for a bigger share of ticket sales. Iron Man
3 is projected to be one of the biggest movies of the year,
with opening weekend sales of $151 million in the U.S.,
according to Boxoffice.com. The summer season accounts for about
40 percent of annual domestic cinema sales. </p>
<p>We thank our partners at Disney for working with us to
achieve economical terms so we can present our guests with one
of the biggest blockbusters of 2013 and solidly kick off the
summer movie season, AMC said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger has focused on
franchise pictures like Toy Story, Iron Man and Star
Wars, and is using its most popular films to seek better terms
from theaters. </p>
<h2>Negotiating Clout </h2>
<p>The Burbank, California-based company, which also plans to
release Monsters University, The Lone Ranger and
Planes this summer, has spent $15 billion since 2006
purchasing the Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm film studios. </p>
<p>Big budget movies typically command a larger share of the
box-office take than the average for studios, which get about 52
percent of annual ticket revenue after cinema operators deduct a
small percentage for overhead, according to Eric Wold, an
analyst at B. Riley  Co. in San Francisco. </p>
<p>Disney had asked for as much as 65 percent of the revenue,
the Los Angeles Times reported this week. Cinemark spokesman
James Meredith didn''t respond to requests for comment. The other
companies declined to discuss their negotiations in detail. </p>
<p>Iron Man'' is going to be a hit no matter what, but you
don''t want this kind of tension going into the most lucrative
part of the year. Phil Contrino, chief analyst for researcher
Boxoffice.com, said in a telephone interview. It''s a relief. </p>
<h2>Movie''s Open </h2>
<p>Iron Man 2, released in 2010, opened with $128.1
million in U.S. weekend sales, according to Box Office Mojo.
Last year''s top-grossing film, Marvel''s The Avengers,
generated $207.4 million. Contrino said the slate of movies
being released in May could lift results in the second quarter
above last year''s. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, was
little changed at $61.95 at 10:18 a.m. in New York. The shares
had climbed 25 percent this year through yesterday. Regal, based
in Knoxville, Tennessee, slipped 0.1 percent to $17.64.
Cinemark, in Plano, Texas, added less than 1 percent to $29.11.

<p>The bank on April 3 sold HK$4.5 million ($580,000) of
securities tied to The Link (823) Real Estate Investment Trust, Hong
Kong''s biggest REIT, and Wharf Holdings Ltd., the owner of the
Times Square and Harbour City malls, according to an e-mail from
the lender''s staff handling structured products in the city. The
product pays monthly coupons for days when the prices of the two
underlying assets remain in certain ranges, according to the e-

<p>The Link REIT, which owns and manages shopping centers and

<p>(Corrects spelling of company name in 22nd paragraph.) </p> <p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s Windows Azure software and related programs have surpassed $1 billion in annual sales for the first time, a sign of progress in the effort to challenge Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) in cloud computing. </p> <p>The sales milestone for Azure -- which stores business information and programs on remote servers and lets customers access them over the Web -- was reached in the past 12 months, said Curt Anderson, finance chief for Microsoft''s server and tools unit. </p> <p>Microsoft, the largest software maker, is counting on Azure and other Internet-based business programs to bolster growth as a global personal-computer slump erodes demand for Windows software installed on desktop machines. About 20 percent of companies tapping the cloud use Azure, compared with 71 percent usage for Amazon, according to James Staten, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. (FORR) Within a year, Microsoft can command as much as 35 percent, he said. </p> <p>I expect them to double annually from here, Staten said of Microsoft''s Azure revenue. Microsoft probably has more net new growth opportunity sitting in front of them than probably anyone in the market. </p> <p>Microsoft''s $1 billion sales figure includes Azure, as well as software provided to partners to create related Windows cloud services, Anderson said in an interview. Azure customers use the services to run corporate programs, websites and applications from Microsoft''s data centers, rather than spending on their own servers, storage machines and workers to maintain them. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which has been advising Apple Inc. (AAPL) on how to deal with its multibillion- dollar cash pile, and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany''s biggest lender, are in the lead to help the iPhone maker sell bonds for the first time in 17 years. </p> <p>Apple asked the two banks, based in New York and Frankfurt, to arrange phone interviews with fixed-income investors today in advance of a potential deal, according to a person familiar with the offering who asked not to be identified because the terms aren''t set. </p> <p>Apple, the largest U.S. maker of smartphones, has had little need for Wall Street''s services since its 1980 initial public offering and its last bond deal in 1996. Although company co-founder Steve Jobs married a former Goldman Sachs fixed- income strategist, he disliked bankers and preferred doing deals without them, according to a former Apple executive who reported to Jobs. In 2009, Apple hired Adrian Perica, a Goldman Sachs investment banker, to build a mergers-and-acquisitions team. </p> <p>Goldman''s going to be the logical play, but that doesn''t mean the others aren''t going to try, said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York who rates Goldman Sachs''s stock outperform. If you''re one of the big technology players, you''re going to want to win this thing -- it gives you bragging rights. </p> <p>Spokesmen for both banks declined to comment on whether their firms will lead the bond offering. Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment beyond the company''s remarks announcing the cash plan last week. </p> <h2>Stock Buybacks </h2> <p>On April 23, Cupertino, California-based Apple said it would return an additional $55 billion in cash to shareholders to compensate for a stock that''s dropped on signs that the company''s growth is slowing. Although it has $145 billion of cash, Apple said it will use debt to help finance a total capital reward of about $100 billion to shareholders. By borrowing the money, Apple can avoid taxes that would apply should it bring funds back into the U.S. from overseas. More than $102 billion of its cash and investments was offshore at the end of March, the company said last week. </p> <p>Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who became CEO in August 2011 when Jobs resigned, hired Goldman Sachs after last year''s shareholder meeting to help the company improve transparency and governance, including what to do with its growing cash pile, according to people familiar with the decision. The firm has helped advise Apple''s board on ways to return cash to shareholders and respond to hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who began publicly demanding action, a person with knowledge of the plans said in February. </p> <h2>Next Takeover </h2> <p>Cook limits his appearances at Wall Street investor conferences to Goldman Sachs''s annual event, held in February. </p> <p>Deutsche Bank advised Apple on its takeover of Next Computer Inc., which was completed in 1997 and led to Jobs''s return to Apple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company is the top manager of corporate debt issued in the euro region, the data show. </p> <p>Because investment-grade debt offerings typically pay low fees, banks may offer to do the transaction for little or no charge, Hintz said. </p> <p>This is going to be a prestige-per-share, not an earnings-per-share, deal, said Hintz, who worked as Morgan Stanley''s treasurer and as the chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. earlier in his career. We''re really talking about a deal that''s going to be done as close to gratis as you can get. </p> <h2>Apple IPO </h2> <p>While Morgan Stanley was the lead manager of Apple''s 1980 initial public offering, Goldman Sachs was involved in both of Apple''s most recent bond sales in 1994 and 1996. With Apple approaching bankruptcy in June 1996, then-CFO Fred Anderson hired Goldman to lead a $661 million convertible bond offering that provided the liquidity for Apple''s comeback after Jobs rejoined the company as CEO the following August, Anderson said in an interview. </p> <p>Goldman was the preferred banker when I was CFO at Apple during 1996 to 2004, said Anderson, a co-founder of venture capital firm Elevation Partners LP. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs''s investment-banking team, led by David Solomon, John S. Weinberg and Richard Gnodde, has a higher ranking among advisers on takeovers and stock underwriting than on debt underwriting. That''s because debt-sale mandates are often awarded to bigger banks that provide corporate loans and lines of credit. Yet Apple''s cash hoard means it doesn''t need any bank loans, making it easier to compete for the new bond sale. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs ranks first this year among managers of debt sales for technology companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs climbed less than 1 percent to $145.11 at the close in New York. Apple advanced 3.1 percent to $430.12. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Jesse Hamilton" date="Apr 29, 2013  2:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-29/goldman-sachs-and-morgan-stanley-set-foreclosure-accord-payments.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Set Foreclosure Accord Payments</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley (MS) will start sending checks to borrowers foreclosed on by
the banks'' former mortgage-servicing units this week, according
to the Federal Reserve. </p>
<p>The two New York-based banks will pay $247 million to
almost 224,000 borrowers, the Fed said today in a statement. The
checks -- meant to compensate borrowers who may have been
mistreated in foreclosures during 2009 and 2010 that relied on
improper documentation or faulty procedures -- range from $300
to $125,000, depending on the how much harm may have been done. </p>
<p>Mortgage units owned by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
foreclosed on homes of 49 military members eligible for borrower
protections and three homeowners who weren''t in default, the Fed
said. The loans were handled by Goldman Sachs''s Litton Loan
Servicing LP and Morgan Stanley''s Saxon Mortgage Services Inc.,
both of which were sold to Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) </p>
<p>The Wall Street firms were among 13 of the largest U.S.
mortgage servicers who agreed to a $9.3 billion settlement with
federal regulators that called for a total of $3.6 billion in
cash payments to borrowers and that the rest go to help prevent
future foreclosures. All borrowers targeted by foreclosure in
2009 and 2010 are scheduled to get some payment, whether or not
they were harmed by the banks. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is paying higher
yields on new bonds than in a November sale after it beat the
planned return of Apple Inc. (AAPL) to the credit market after an
absence of almost two decades. </p>
<p>The company, one of four U.S.-based businesses with the
highest ratings from Moody''s Investors Service and Standard 
Poor''s, issued $1.95 billion of dollar-denominated debt last
week with a weighted average coupon of 2.41 percent, exceeding
the 2.33 percent for similar bonds it sold five months earlier
even with interest rates at about the same level. The latest
sale came two days after Apple said it would use debt to help
fund a $55 billion addition to a plan to return cash to
shareholders. </p>
<p>Microsoft paid a little more than they otherwise would,
given the looming Apple issuance, said Noel Hebert, the chief
investment officer at Concannon Wealth Management, which
oversees about $250 million of assets from Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania. The higher coupons are likely a fair trade to
get in front of the new Apple paper, which will have to get
digested. </p>
<p>While the world''s largest software maker has a higher
credit rating than Apple, growth at the Redmond, Washington-
based company has stagnated for more than a decade. After
generating enough free cash flow in 1999 to buy Apple twice
over, Microsoft''s $27.5 billion of funds earned in the last 12
months now accounts for about 60 percent of the amount produced
by its Cupertino, California-based competitor. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola HBC AG, the soft-drink
bottler that switched its primary listing to the London Stock
Exchange today, expects profitability to rebound this year as
sugar and oil prices rise at a slower pace than previous years. </p>
<p>Commodity costs will increase at a low single-digit
pace, after climbing 14 percent in 2011 and 6 percent in 2012,
Chief Executive Officer Dimitris Lois said in an interview at
the London bourse. Cost reduction measures such as consolidating
some office processes will also boost margins, helping offset a
slowdown in revenue growth, Lois said. </p>
<p>Rising prices for commodities have presented an additional
challenge for food and drink makers in recent years as they
struggle to contend with weakening consumer demand. Coca-Cola
HBC''s operating margin declined to 6.4 percent of sales in its
2012 fiscal year from 10.8 percent in 2007. Lois said today that
he expects the margin to return to levels seen before the
European financial crisis, without giving a timeframe. European
markets show few signs of stabilization, he also said. </p>
<p>It''s a bit of a challenge, the CEO said. At some
stage this year we''ll be able to look back and say that probably
the worst is behind us, but it''s still a tough year. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola HBC shares traded at 1,737 pence at 4:17 p.m. on
their first day of London trading, giving the company a market
value of about 6.1 billion pounds ($9.5 billion). The bottler
said in October it would move its primary listing from Athens to
London, fleeing the epicenter of Europe''s debt crisis. It also
switched its domicile to Zug, Switzerland. </p>
<h2>Quite Complex'' </h2>
<p>The listing process was innovative and quite complex,
and made the company known to a wider audience who aren''t
particularly knowledgeable about the Coke bottling system,
Lois said. The move will make Coca-Cola HBC eligible for
inclusion in London''s benchmark FTSE 100 Index (UKX) in September. </p>
<p>Cost reduction measures such as consolidating finance and
human resources into one center will reduce expenses by about 65
million euros this year, Chief Financial Officer Michalis Imellos said in the same interview. </p>
<p>Revenue, excluding currency shifts, will grow at a slower
pace than last year''s 2 percent, Lois said, as austerity
measures in the Eurozone weigh on improvements elsewhere. He
declined to comment on whether the volume of products sold would
increase after being unchanged last year. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola HBC operates in countries with lower per-capita
consumption of sparkling drinks than the rest of the Eurozone,
which will help in boosting volume growth, Lois said. </p>
<h2>Russia, Nigeria </h2>
<p>Coca-Cola HBC buys concentrate from Coca-Cola Co. and
blends, bottles and sells the products in European countries
including Greece and Italy. Lois said he''s optimistic about the
emerging markets of Russia and Nigeria this year. Sales of Coca-
Cola in Russia were helped by a government ban on selling beer
at freestanding kiosks, he said. </p>
<p>We still have a lot of consumers to recruit, Lois said,
noting that per-capita consumption in most of its markets for
sparkling beverages is lower than the Eurozone average. He cited
Italy, one of the country''s biggest markets, which has a 20
percent lower per-capita consumption of sparkling beverages than
Serbia, and 40 percent lower consumption than Bulgaria. </p>
<p>The company expects to sell bonds in the next six-to-nine
months, the CEO said, as it seeks to refinance about 1 billion
euros of debt due by 2014. Coca-Cola HBC will sell bonds in
euros and seek an average debt maturity of about 5 years. It''s
not looking to raise money for acquisitions and isn''t interested
in buying Coca-Cola''s German bottling operations, Lois said. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., another bottler of the
bestselling soft drink, said April 25 that it let a right to buy
Coca-Cola''s German bottling operations lapse. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, will analyze over the next eight months whether it
will split itself into brand name and generics businesses, Chief
Financial Officer Frank D''Amelio said. </p>
<p>Pfizer hasn''t made a final decision on whether to break up
the New York-based company and an official divide wouldn''t
happen until at least 2016, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
said today. In the meantime, Pfizer is working to figure out
whether its emerging markets operations would benefit from being
organized more like its business in the U.S., Europe and Japan
where the company has distinct brand and generics units,
D''Amelio said today in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>This is a study year, D''Amelio said. What we don''t
want to do is take the positive out of what the model''s already
generating. </p>
<p>Talk of a possible split has dominated company conference
calls with analysts since Read floated the idea last year. Such
a break up is perhaps the last big lever management has left
to pull, Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., said before Pfizer earlier today announced its first-
quarter earnings. </p>
<p>D''Amelio said feedback hasn''t been unanimous, or final.
If you talk to investors, I think you''ll get mixed comments,
he said. There''s never a subject where I think the investment
community is all-in one way or the other. </p>
<h2>Lipitor Sales </h2>
<p>Pfizer has been working to remake itself after it lost
exclusive sales rights in 2011 to Lipitor, the cholesterol
treatment that was once the world''s top-selling medicine with
almost $13 billion. The company won U.S. marketing approval in
the past six months for two new potential blockbusters, the
rheumatoid arthritis pill Xeljanz and the blood thinner Eliquis. </p>
<p>Earlier today, Pfizer reduced its forecast for 2013 profit
excluding certain items after first-quarter sales missed
analysts'' estimates. Pfizer shares fell 4.5 percent to $29.07 at
the close in New York, their worst one-day loss since August
2011. </p>
<p>Judson Clark, an analyst Edward Jones  Co. who has a buy
rating on the stock, said he''s neutral on the idea of a split. </p>
<p>It''s almost a one-time resetting, Clark said. I can''t
imagine every five or 10 years they''re going to spin off their
drugs that are in life-cycle management. I don''t know if this is
a recurring way to create shareholder value. </p>
<p>The key decision is whether the brand-name and generics
businesses can exist inside Pfizer separately and still create
value, or whether a formal split is necessary, Read said. </p>
<p>The first order of business is to find a way we can
separate them and give the management as much authority and
independence as necessary, Read said today on a conference
call. I believe it''s worth creating that separation
internally, because I believe it creates focus and management
focus and improves the performance of those two businesses. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, reduced its 2013 profit forecast after first-quarter
sales missed analyst estimates. The shares had their worst one-
day loss since August 2011. </p>
<p>Full-year earnings excluding one-time items may be $2.14 to
$2.24 a share as foreign currency rates weigh on results, New
York-based Pfizer said today in a statement. The forecast cuts
by 6 cents the range provided by the company in January. First-
quarter net income surged 53 percent to $2.75 billion, or 38
cents a share, from $1.79 billion, or 24 cents, a year earlier. </p>
<p>Sales for the pneumococcal vaccines Prevnar and the
erectile dysfunction drug Viagra were less than analyst
estimates, leading total revenue to fall about $440 million
short of expectations, at $13.5 billion. </p>
<p>It was clearly not a great quarter, said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with International Strategy  Investment
Group in New York, in a note to clients today. However, it
appears that the company will attribute a large portion of the
miss, but not all, to one-time factors such as U.S. buying
patterns and foreign exchange. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares fell 4.5 percent to $29.07 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 27 percent in the last 12 months. </p>

Edward Dam in 1973, GE said in its complaint filed April 26 in
Albany. </p>
<p>Plaintiff GE has contacted defendant NiMo regarding its
contribution to the presence of hazardous substances at the site
and has sought defendant''s cooperation in and contribution to
the dredging project, GE said. Defendant has failed to
cooperate with, pay for, or contribute in any way to the
dredging project. </p>
<p>National Grid, based in London, acquired Niagara Mohawk in
January 2002 for $8.9 billion. </p>
<h2>GE Singled Out </h2>
<p>We''re going to defend our position, primarily on the
basis that we did not put the PCBs in the Hudson, Steve Brady,
a spokesman for National Grid, said today in a phone interview. </p>
<p>If you go back through time it''s been fairly clear that
the EPA singled out GE alone as being responsible for this,
Brady said, referring to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency. We didn''t purchase, use or place the PCBs in the
Hudson and we really think we need to protect our customers. We
think it''s wrong for them to help pay for the remediation. </p>
<p>Until 1977, GE operated two electrical capacitor
manufacturing plants along the Hudson that caused PCBs to enter
the river, according to its complaint. When it removed the Fort
Edward Dam, Niagra Mohawk removed only about 200 cubic yards of
sludge from behind it, leaving more than 1 million cubic yards
of silt, sludge and sediment contaminated by PCBs, GE said. </p>
<p>The case is General Electric Co. (GE) v. Niagara Mohawk Power
Corp., 1:13-cv-00473, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
New York (Albany). </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is ending its
top-level sponsorship of the Masters Tournament, while United
Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) joins the partner rolls of golf''s first
annual major championship. </p>
<p>Daimler AG''s Mercedes-Benz (DAI), an international sponsor of the
Masters since 2008, will move up to replace Exxon Mobil as one
of three global sponsors of the tournament, joining
International Business Machines Inc. and ATT Inc. </p>
<p>UPS, the world''s largest package-delivery company, will
take over Mercedes-Benz''s previous role and join Rolex as
international sponsors. </p>
<p>Exxon spokesman Alan T. Jeffers said the company was
leaving after nine successful years as it continually
evaluates and modifies our sponsorship and advertising
requirements based on business needs. </p>
<p>Billy Payne, executive director of Augusta National Golf
Club, which stages the tournament each April in Augusta,
Georgia, didn''t disclose a reason for Exxon Mobil''s departure in
a press release announcing the new sponsorships. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil joined the Masters for the 2005 tournament
after the club went without sponsors in 2003 and 2004 to protect
its corporate partners from protests against Augusta National''s
then-all-male membership. </p>
<p>Terms of the latest agreements weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>A Masters sponsorship is among the most exclusive in
sports, as the tournament limits television commercials to four
minutes per hour. As part of the agreements, sponsors are given
access to private hospitality cabins built along the course''s
first and 10th holes. </p>
<p>UPS''s sponsorship comes four days after the Atlanta-based
company and the Teamsters union agreed on a five-year contract
covering 250,000 employees. A two-week Teamsters strike in 1997
cut UPS''s volumes as much as 6 percent and cost about $650
million. </p>

<p>(Corrects worldwide spending total in eighth paragraph.) </p>
<p>Visa Inc. (V), the world''s biggest
payments network, posted a fiscal second-quarter profit that
beat analysts'' estimates as consumer spending on credit and
debit cards climbed. </p>
<p>Net income for the three months ended March 31 fell 1.7
percent to $1.27 billion, or $1.92 a share, from $1.29 billion,
or $1.91, a year earlier, when there were more shares
outstanding, the Foster City, California-based company said
today in a statement. That beat the $1.81 average estimate of 32
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income a year earlier was
helped by a one-time tax-related gain of $208 million. </p>
<p>Visa, led by Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf,
increased dividends and stepped up share repurchases as the firm
gained financial flexibility after joining rival MasterCard Inc. (MA)
in agreeing to a multibillion settlement with merchants over
card swipe fees. Visa also struck a deal in February with
JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. card lender, to let the
bank tailor payment solutions for merchants. </p>
<p>To drive future transaction growth, we continue to invest
in new technologies, channels and capabilities to make Visa
transactions more valuable, accessible and secure, Scharf, 48,
said in the statement. </p>
<p>The payment processor raised its forecast for adjusted
annual earnings per share growth to about 20 percent, from the
high teens projected in February. </p>
<h2>Shares Advance </h2>
<p>Visa climbed 2.1 percent to $169.50 at 4:42 p.m. in
extended trading in New York. The shares climbed 9.5 percent
this year through the close of regular trading, outpacing the
4.2 percent advance for the 70-company Standard  Poor''s 500
Information Technology Index. </p>
<p>MasterCard, the world''s second-largest payments network by
processed transactions, said earlier today that first-quarter
profit increased 12 percent to $766 million. Revenue at the
Purchase, New York-based firm climbed 8.4 percent to $1.91
billion, short of the $1.93 billion estimate of analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. The shares, which touched an all-time high
yesterday, fell 2.5 percent to $539.18, the most since July. </p>
<p>Visa''s total operating revenue climbed 15 percent to $2.96
billion, beating the $2.85 billion estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Worldwide spending on Visa payment cards climbed
8.8 percent to $1.03 trillion, adjusted for currency
fluctuations, according to the statement. Processed transactions
rose 6.2 percent to 13.9 billion. Cross-border volume, a measure
of spending by cardholders outside their home countries,
advanced 10 percent. </p>
<p>Spending on Visa debit cards in the U.S. rose 0.3 percent
to $285 billion, the first increase in a year, according to the
statement. U.S. credit-card purchases climbed 9.1 percent to
$244 billion. </p>
<p>U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
of the nation''s economy, cooled in March after higher payroll
taxes took effect in January. Scharf seeks to bolster Visa''s
growth outside the U.S. as the company has said it hopes to get
more than half of its revenue abroad by 2015. </p>

<p>A New York technology development
company said it sued Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) over allegations the
software maker''s web-conferencing service, Skype, infringed
encryption-related patents. </p>
<p>CopyTele Inc. (COPY) said it filed a complaint today in federal
court in Brooklyn, New York, alleging that Skype infringed two
patents for technology that helps maintain secure Web-based
communications. CopyTele is seeking unspecified damages,
according to a copy of the complaint provided by the firm. The
filing couldn''t be immediately confirmed in court records. </p>
<p>These encryption patents are a prime example of the
enormous, untapped potential at CTI, CopyTele''s Chief
Executive Officer Robert Berman said in a statement. The patents
have tremendous value that was masked under the previous
management, he said. </p>
<p>Jimmy Knodel, a spokesman for Microsoft who works for
Waggener Edstrom Worldwide, declined to comment on the suit. </p>
<p>Berman, formerly the chief operating officer of Acacia
Research Corp. (ACTG), a publicly-traded intellectual property holding
firm, said in an interview today that he was hired by CopyTele
to turn the technology developer into a similar business. </p>
<p>Acacia, based in Newport Beach, California, controls patent
portfolios, licenses them to corporate users and sues companies
that are alleged to have infringed the patents. The company says
it controls rights to about 250 patent portfolios. </p>
<p>In January, CopyTele sued AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) in federal
court in San Francisco, alleging the company stole patented
technologies developed for e-readers. The case is pending. </p>
<p>CopyTele expects to acquire additional patents and file
more lawsuits in the future, Berman said. </p>
<p>Microsoft acquired Skype from an investment group for
$8.5 billion in 2011. </p>

<p>Coda Holdings Inc., parent of the
electric-car maker backed by billionaire Philip Falcone, filed
for bankruptcy and will seek to sell its assets to a group led
by a Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) unit for $25 million. </p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based company, whose Coda Automotive unit
also sought court protection, listed assets of as much as $50
million and debt of as much as $100 million today in the Chapter
11 filing in Wilmington, Delaware. The company said it intends
to sell its assets within 45 days. </p>
<p>Coda''s bankruptcy is at least the third by an electric
vehicle-related company in just over a year. A123 Systems Inc. (AONEQ),
a battery supplier to Fisker Automotive Inc., another
California-based maker of electric cars, filed for bankruptcy in
October. Ener1 Inc., also a maker of batteries for electric
cars, entered bankruptcy in January 2012. </p>
<p>While A123 and an Ener1 unit received U.S. government
funds, Coda didn''t. The company applied for a $334 million loan
in May 2010 and withdrew the request in April 2012. </p>
<p>After two years of uncertainty, we needed to move forward
with our business plan independent of the loan, Matt Sloustcher, a Coda spokesman, said in an e-mail today. </p>
<h2>Production Delays </h2>
<p>Coda was forced to seek bankruptcy protection because of
production delays, insufficient capital to market and sell its
sedan, and slow growth for the electric-vehicle market, which it
blames on the scarcity of charging stations, according to a
declaration by Chief Restructuring Officer John P. Madden. Coda
will focus on its energy-storage business, Chief Executive
Officer Phil Murtaugh said in a statement today. </p>
<p>Sales of the Coda sedan, built off China-based Hafei Motor
Co.''s Saibao platform, fell short of expectations, with fewer
than 100 units sold since entering the market in March 2012,
according to court papers. Complications adapting the sedan to
an electric platform and meeting U.S. regulatory standards
delayed production until a year after originally anticipated in
November 2011. </p>
<p>Closely held Coda, which counted former U.S. Treasury
Secretary Henry Paulson as an investor, pitched its vehicle as a
real world car with better range, battery-pack life and
acceleration than competitors such as Nissan Motor (7201) Co.''s Leaf,
Ford Motor Co. (F)''s Focus EV and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211)''s i-MiEV
hatchbacks. The compact, which cost $37,250 before a $7,500 U.S.
tax credit, averages 88 miles (142 kilometers) per charge and
can travel as far as 125 miles, according to U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency estimates. </p>
<h2>Shrinking Market </h2>
<p>About 87,000 electric and plug-in hybrid cars have been
sold in the U.S., with two years left to achieve President
Barack Obama''s target of 1 million sales for the industry. </p>
<p>While sales of battery-only and plug-in hybrids are rising,
the pace trails optimistic goals set by advocates, including
Nissan and Renault SA (RNO) Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn, who
predicted electric vehicles would be 10 percent of global sales
by 2020. </p>
<p>U.S. sales of rechargeable autos totaled 50,288 last year,
led by General Motors Co. (GM)''s Volt plug-in, up from 17,805 in
2011, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales for the segment
totaled 17,842 in this year''s first quarter.     Electric-only
vehicle sales totaled 13,542 in 2012, a 34 percent increase over
the 10,104 sold in 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>A U.S. congressional committee is investigating the Energy
Department''s loans for alternative-fuel vehicles after the
manufacturers have been plagued by financial problems. </p>
<p>A123, based in Waltham, Massachusetts, used $132 million in
federal grant money to build two plants in Michigan. Fisker
fired three quarters of its work force last month and missed its
first payment on a U.S. government loan. </p>
<h2>Equity Investors </h2>
<p>Coda raised about $344 million in equity investments since
its founding, according to court documents. Investors included
New World Strategic Investment Ltd., Indus Capital and Och-Ziff
Capital Management Group LLC (OZM), Aeris Capital, Angeleno Group LLC,
Falcone''s Harbinger Capital Partners LLC and Riverstone Holdings
LLC, Coda said in 2011. </p>
<p>The company owes about $77.5 million in notes and loans,
according to court papers. Coda owes Hafei, its biggest
unsecured creditor, $2.7 million. Coda and its affiliates
collectively owe about $17 million to their 30 largest unsecured
creditors. </p>
<p>A group led by a Fortress affiliate agreed to provide a $5
million delayed-draw loan to help fund operation through the
sale process, according to court papers. The Fortress unit will
act as the lead bidder at a court-supervised auction and will
buy the company for $25 million if no other competing offers
surface. </p>
<p>The group may bid debt rather than cash. Coda requested a
May 16 hearing to set guidelines to govern the sale process. The
company wants a deadline of May 31 for competing offers, a June
3 auction if other bids are received, and a June 6 hearing to
seek approval of the sale. </p>
<h2>California Assembly </h2>
<p>The Coda sedan''s chassis is built in China through a
partnership with Hafei, with final assembly in Benicia,
California. Lithium-iron-phosphate cells for its 1,000-pound
(454-kilogram) battery pack are from LIO Energy Systems, a joint
venture of Coda and China''s Tianjin Lishen Battery. </p>
<p>Coda said last year that it would produce battery-powered
autos with China''s Great Wall Motor Co. (2333) that would be sold under
the U.S. company''s name starting in 2014. </p>
<p>The case is In re Coda Automotive, 13-bk-11154, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said Julian Salisbury will become head of the global special-situations
group, a unit that invests the firm''s own money and generated as
much as $4 billion a year before the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Salisbury, 41, is replacing Jason Brown, who is retiring,
New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in an internal memo.
Salisbury will move to New York from London, where he has been
head of the European special-situations group. Michael DuVally,
a spokesman for the company, confirmed the contents of the memo. </p>
<p>The Special Situations Group, known as SSG, trades
distressed debt and has made investments in companies from
Japan''s largest golf-course operator to pizza-chain Sbarro Inc.
In 2011, New York-based Goldman Sachs stopped including SSG''s
results within fixed-income trading, and moved it into a new
reporting segment called investing and lending that includes
other proprietary investments. </p>
<p>The bank''s investing and lending division generated $5.89
billion in 2012, almost triple that of a year earlier. The unit
gained $1.85 billion from debt securities and loans, and $2.39
billion from equity securities. The company doesn''t break out
SSG''s results. </p>
<p>Salisbury, a U.K. citizen, was a founding member of the
European SSG unit in 2003 and was named a partner at the firm in
2008, according to the memo, which was sent by Pablo J. Salame
and Isabelle Ealet, co-heads of the securities division. Brown,
who joined Goldman Sachs from Bear Stearns Cos. in 1999 and
became a partner in 2006, had led the group from Hong Kong since
2011. </p>
<h2>Diversified Portfolio </h2>
<p>Jason''s leadership has been instrumental in the design
and execution of a realigned investment approach in GSSG,
resulting in a diversified portfolio that has shown strong
performance in both favorable and challenging market
conditions, Ealet and Salame wrote in a separate memo. </p>
<p>Reuters reported the management changes earlier today. </p>
<p>SSG produced $4.1 billion in 2007, 9 percent of the
company''s total revenue. It generated $3.79 billion in 2006,
according to documents released by a Senate subcommittee in
2011. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has faced questions about whether SSG''s
activities would be crimped by the Volcker rule, which was part
of the Dodd-Frank Act. Rules about how it will be implemented
are still being written. The bank has argued that most of the
unit is a lending business. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold a
majority stake in its reinsurance business to institutions and
high-net worth clients as financial firms adjust to demands by
regulators for more capital. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is keeping a minority stake in the business,
named Global Atlantic Financial Group, the New York-based bank
said today in a statement. The firm didn''t disclose the price of
the private offering or what percentage it retained. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz said in January
that the bank was considering selling a stake in the business
because international regulators are imposing higher capital
requirements. The bank at that time disclosed the unit''s
contribution for the first time, saying revenue climbed 23
percent in 2012 to $1.08 billion. </p>
<p>The division has a global property and casualty reinsurance
business as well as life and annuity reinsurance operations
primarily in the U.S. Goldman Sachs agreed in 2012 to buy Ariel
Holdings Ltd.''s Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance
businesses to expand property and casualty coverage. </p>
<p>The bank said last month that reinsurance revenue was $233
million in the first quarter, up from $211 a year earlier. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM),
cutting costs in the wake of its first quarterly earnings
shortfall in eight years, ordered some U.S. contract workers to
reduce their hours, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>CDI Corp. (CDI), a provider of staffing and outsourcing services,
told employees working on IBM jobs that they should bill for no
more than 36 hours a week in the second quarter, according to
the memo. CDI, based in Philadelphia, cited challenging
economic conditions in explaining the move. </p>
<p>You should understand that this action is being taken by
IBM to retain as many CDI resources as possible for future
work, Eric Gonzalez, a delivery executive, said in the memo.
This action is not a reflection of any dissatisfaction over
the services provided by you or CDI but rather an IBM business
decision. </p>
<p>When it reported earnings on April 18, IBM said it would
spend $1 billion cutting jobs in its own workforce to reduce
expenses. The company, famous for methodically setting and
meeting its goals, jolted shareholders by posting first-quarter
profit of $3 a share, missing the $3.05 predicted by analysts.
The shares tumbled almost 10 percent to $187.83 over the
following two trading days. </p>
<h2>Stock Rebound </h2>
<p>IBM has regained some of that ground over the past 10 days.
The stock climbed 1.4 percent to $202.39 at the close today in
New York, bringing it within $5 of its pre-earnings value. CDI
shares, meanwhile, fell 4.9 percent to $14.04. </p>
<p>Vince Webb, a CDI spokesman, declined to comment on the
memo. IBM, the world''s biggest computer-services provider,
accounts for 20 percent of CDI''s revenue, according to the
contractor''s annual report. </p>
<p>James Sciales, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM,
also declined to comment on the memo. The company relies on
contractors to manage labor costs on information-technology
projects for clients, he said. </p>
<p>IBM told CDI that the change in hours would only be in
effect during the second quarter, according to the memo. The
employees aren''t allowed to work beyond 36 hours unless approved
in writing by IBM management. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) made its
$820 million offer to take Ebix (EBIX) Inc. private as U.S. regulators
intensify their probes of the insurance software maker,
according to people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The all-cash deal amounts to about $20 a share, Atlanta-

news to $20.60 in Nasdaq trading, the biggest one-day gain since
October 2011. The shares dropped 5.1 percent to $19.55 at
12:26 p.m. today in New York. A go-shop provision allows
Ebix to solicit competing bids in the next 45 days. </p>
<p>Should no better offer emerge, New York-based Goldman Sachs

<p>That probe, consisting of interviews with former employees,
has since been upgraded to a formal investigation, according to
a person who was briefed on the matter after the Goldman Sachs

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was able to
avoid paying as much as 20 million pounds ($31 million) in U.K.
taxes as the government fought to shield Chancellor of the
Exchequer George Osborne from political embarrassment, an
advocacy group said at a London trial. </p>
<p>The group, UK Uncut, said Her Majesty''s Revenue  Customs
reached the agreement with Goldman Sachs on the day Osborne
announced a bankers'' code to counter tax avoidance. The HMRC
executive said in an e-mail cited by UK Uncut that he was
concerned the bank might drop out of the code if the deal was
scuttled. </p>
<p>The reputation and standing of officials or of HMRC, and
potential embarrassment to a minister, is not a relevant matter
to take into account when deciding to waive collection of
several million pounds of interest, Ingrid Simler, a lawyer
for UK Uncut, said in filings prepared for a judicial review
that started in London today. </p>
<p>The U.K. government has pledged to clamp down on tax-
avoidance schemes following widespread media and public anger
caused by the amount of corporation tax the likes of Google

yielding at that time. The 1MDB yield was 3.76 percent today,
giving investors who were in at the start a return of 5.7
percent for the six weeks since the debt was issued. U.S.
Treasuries gained 1.43 percent on average during the period,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. </p>
<p>The private placement raised too many red flags, coming
so close to the election date, said Wong Chen, a 44-year-old
corporate lawyer and a parliamentary candidate from the
opposition National Justice Party. They were rushing this out
and they don''t know how to spend it. We don''t know who received
this private placement and who they may sell it on to. </p>
<p>Najib is chairman of the board of advisors of 1MDB and the
March bond sale has given candidates opposing him in the May 5
polls ammunition to criticize the fund, with Wong calling for
more transparency. The accusations are part of a smear campaign
before the voting, according to a government spokesman, who''s
not authorized to be named. Recent opinion polls suggest that
the election will be tight with the opposition alliance having
gained support in recent months, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
said in a report published today. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was warned by
U.S. energy-market authorities that they may take action against
its employees as part of an inquiry into bidding practices, the
New York Times said, citing a document it reviewed. </p>
<p>Enforcement officials at the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission plan to recommend the agency hold traders and
commodities-unit chief Blythe Masters individually liable,
the newspaper reported, citing a 70-page document the agency
sent the New York-based bank in March. Investigators said
Masters falsely denied awareness of problems, the Times said. </p>
<p>The case focuses on eight schemes adopted by traders in
Houston between September 2010 and June 2011, according to the
newspaper. The traders offered energy at prices calculated to
falsely appear attractive, prompting state authorities in
California and Michigan to make about $83 million in
excessive payments to JPMorgan, the Times cited
investigators as saying. </p>
<p>The staff is challenging a bidding strategy that was
transparent and was in full compliance with the applicable
rules, the Times quoted Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for the
bank, as saying. We strongly disagree with the staff''s
conclusions. </p>
<h2>Strongly Dispute'' </h2>
<p>JPMorgan intends to defend itself and the employees, she
told the newspaper. We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or
any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter. </p>

<p>A judge handling a $2 billion lawsuit
against banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and UBS AG (UBSN) brought
by the former Thornburg Mortgage invited their lawyers to file
statements on the possible appointment of a mediator to resolve
the dispute, according to a federal court filing in Baltimore. </p>
<p>The judge, after holding a hearing on the banks'' requests
for dismissal of the suit, gave no deadline for the brief
statements about a mediator although he said quickly
advised in a handwritten note filed in court May 1.  </p>
<p>The trustee for what is now TMST Inc. accused the banks,
including Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc,
of extracting more than $700 million of margin and interest
payments from the former Thornburg by making unjustified
margin calls, speeding its failure. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and ATT Inc. (T) are
among U.S. borrowers selling the most bonds in Europe since the
start of 2008, taking advantage of record-low borrowing costs
that outstrip dollar rates. </p>
<p>American issuers raised 17.2 billion euros ($22.5 billion)
from bond sales this year, nine times the amount for the same
period in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
average yield on investment-grade euro corporate bonds fell to
an unprecedented 1.75 percent yesterday, or 89 basis points
below comparable dollar notes, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes show. That''s the biggest discount since June 2010. </p>
<p>The European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate
to a record 0.5 percent yesterday as it tries to lift the euro-
region out of recession, encouraging companies to take advantage
of cheap funding. In the U.S., where the economy is expanding at
a 2.5 percent annual rate, the Federal Reserve will probably
reduce its monthly bond buying in the fourth quarter as it
begins to scale back its record stimulus, according to
economists in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>U.S. companies will issue where they think they can
borrow cheaply and where there''s significant demand, said
Craig Veysey, the head of fixed income at Sanlam Private
Investments Ltd. in London, part of the Sanlam Group, which
oversees $72 billion of assets. The huge drop in yields we''ve
seen over the last month, in particular in Europe, would have
meant that it''s easy for U.S. issuers to get their deals away. </p>

<p>Malaysia''s opposition coalition led by
Anwar Ibrahim may ask Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to renegotiate
terms on a $3 billion bond placement should it win the election
this weekend. </p>
<p>The U.S. bank arranged the March 19 debt sale by 1Malaysia
Development Bhd., a sovereign-wealth fund known as 1MDB headed
by Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose political opponents have
questioned the timing, cost and pricing of the issue. New York-
based Goldman''s fees exceeded $200 million for arranging the
placement and three other dollar bond sales totaling $6.35
billion by Malaysian issuers in the past two years, according to
a person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>We are really focused on corporate governance and should
we win, we will review all public deals, Rafizi Ramli,
strategic director at Anwar''s People''s Justice Party, said in an
interview in Kuala Lumpur today. The 1MDB transaction has been
shrouded in secrecy. We would go back to the renegotiation table
and see what would have been a fairer deal should there be any
questionable part of the deal mix. </p>
<p>The ruling National Front coalition is facing its fiercest
challenge to date, after retaining power five years ago by the
narrowest margin since Malaysia won independence from the U.K.
in 1957. This is going to be the closest election Malaysia has
had and there''s a possibility the opposition will win, Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at
the National University of Singapore, told Bloomberg TV today. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s decision to pull out
of Bangladesh is fueling debate over whether other manufacturers
should leave the country or stay put to improve workplace
conditions in the South Asian nation. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, removed
Bangladesh in March from a list of countries where it authorizes
partners to produce clothing and merchandise, according to a
letter to licensees released yesterday. Belarus, Ecuador,
Pakistan and Venezuela were also taken off the list, which cut
the number of acceptable nations to 172 from 215, Disney said. </p>
<p>While Disney''s contractors had less than 1 percent of the
company''s production in Bangladesh, marketers with more activity
there will have to decide whether to stay and spend to improve
worker safety or go elsewhere and potentially see the costs of
their products rise even more. They need to make the calculation
as they assess the risk to their brand names. </p>
<p>There is a move afoot for companies to say clearly, We
need to be part of bigger oversight procedures,'' Cory Krupp,
an associate professor at Duke University''s Sanford School of
Public Policy, said in a phone interview. The other way is
just to move to Vietnam or Cambodia where they have better
standards and the government is better at upholding them, and
Bangladesh is going to learn the hard way. </p>

<p>Iron Man 3, the superhero movie
from Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s Marvel division, may earn as much as $170
million in its opening weekend, placing it among the best debuts
ever, box-office tracker Hollywood.com Box-Office said. </p>
<p>That would be the second-best premiere since The
Avengers, also from Marvel, opened with $207.4 million a year
ago. The current No. 2 is Time Warner Inc. (TWX)''s Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hallows - Part 2, which had sales of $169.2
million in 2011. </p>
<p>A big debut for Iron Man 3 would start Hollywood''s
summer on a positive note as domestic ticket sales year to date
lag the year-ago period by 12 percent. With potential
blockbusters including Star Trek and Man of Steel lined
up, the momentum could carry through to September, allowing
studios and theaters to approach 2012''s record $10.8 billion box
office. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s showings in 4,253 theaters generated $68.3
million in receipts, the ninth-biggest single-day gross ever,
Hollywood.com said. The top single-day take was the $90.1
million earned by Warner Bros. Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows - Part 2. </p>
<p>Iron Man 3 has already opened internationally and
generated big numbers which, in turn, has prompted U.S.-based
analysts to raise their estimates for its run in the U.S. and
Canada. The movie has generated $361 million in global ticket
sales, including $15.6 million from late-night screenings at
U.S. theaters May 2, Disney said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. </p>
<p>Iron Man had $38.7 million on its first day in 2008,
and $98.6 million in its opening weekend. Iron Man 2 earned
$51.2 million in its first day in 2010, and $128.1 million for
its debut weekend, Hollywood.com said. </p>
