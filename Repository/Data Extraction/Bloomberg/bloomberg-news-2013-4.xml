&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is developing an
excavation and removal plan for a damaged section of its 96,000-
barrel-a-day Pegasus crude pipeline, which was shut after a leak
was discovered in Arkansas on March 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it collected about 12,000 barrels of oil
and water from the spill, classified as major by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, according to a statement from
the Mayflower Incident Unified Command Joint Information Center.
Local officials recommended 22 homes closest to the leak remain
evacuated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t really update it much beyond yesterday, so
we&#8217;re using 12,000 (barrels of oil and water mixture), hopefully
we can get a newer number tomorrow,&#8221; said Charlie Engelmann, a
spokesman for Exxon, by phone. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been continuing our
cleanup efforts, without a question.&#8221; Engelmann said he
couldn&#8217;t speculate on timing for repairs to the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line shutdown may limit flow of crude from western
Canada and the U.S. Midwest, exacerbating a glut of oil in the
area. Domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate weakened $1.22
today to $14.01 a barrel against Brent, the international
marker, from $12.79 on March 28, the smallest gap since July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-inch Pegasus line runs 940 miles (1,512 kilometers)
from Patoka, Illinois, to Nederland, Texas, and serves
refineries around Port Arthur and Beaumont, close to the
Louisiana line. There are four plants near the city able to
process about 1.4 million barrels a day of crude, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The sites are operated by Exxon,
Valero Energy Corp., Total SA and Motiva Enterprises LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heavy Crude &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line was carrying Wabasca Heavy Crude from western
Canada at the time of the incident, Kimberly Brasington, an
Exxon spokeswoman, said yesterday. Wabasca Heavy is a blend of
heavy oil produced in Alberta by Cenovus Energy, Canadian
Natural Resources and other companies that typically has about
4.15 percent sulfur and a 19-20 API gravity, according to Crude
Quality Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western Canada Select, a blend of heavy bitumen and diluent
that serves as a benchmark for Alberta tar sands formations,
slipped 65 cents a barrel to trade at a $15 discount to WTI at
4:57 p.m. New York time, according to data from Calgary energy
broker Net Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon didn&#8217;t offer a timeline for repairs to the line. The
rupture has been located and Exxon is awaiting regulatory
approval from the Department of Transportation to begin
excavation work and repairs, Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for the
company, said by phone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oiled Ducks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 54 claims have been made, according to the joint
statement, and 10 ducks with oil on them have been recovered for
treatment, the statement showed. Two other ducks were found
dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major spill in Michigan in July 2010 shut an Enbridge
Inc. crude pipeline for two months, and the cleanup still isn&#8217;t
complete. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last month
directed Enbridge to perform more dredging in Michigan&#8217;s
Kalamazoo River as part of a cleanup from a July 2010 rupture of
a 30-inch pipeline that also carried heavy crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon was fined $26,200 in 2010 by the U.S. Department of
Transportation&#8217;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration for failing to regularly inspect each point where
the Pegasus line crosses under a navigable waterway. PHMSA
specifically cited the line&#8217;s crossing under the Mississippi
River between Missouri and Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arkansas spill was estimated at a few thousand barrels,
according to a statement yesterday from the Mayflower Unified
Command Center, which includes Exxon, Faulkner County and the
city of Mayflower, Arkansas, said in a statement yesterday.
Exxon hasn&#8217;t stated the size of the spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen vacuum trucks and 33 storage tanks had been
deployed to the site of the spill to aid clean up efforts,
according to the Unified Command. Exxon has sent 120 workers in
response, and crews were steam-cleaning oil from property today,
according to the joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No oil had reached nearby Lake Conway, and cleanup crews
have deployed 3,600 feet of boom as a precaution, the command
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V)&#8217;s John Partridge, who
retired as president of the world&#8217;s largest payments network in
March, will receive a base salary of $50,000 a month to remain
with the company and work on special projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partridge will also be paid $562,500 in November as a pro-

month, the Foster City, California-based firm said in a filing
today. Partridge, 63, will continue to be eligible for other
benefits given to U.S.-based employees, the filing said. Visa
announced his planned retirement in a December statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partridge was paid a salary of $750,029 in fiscal 2012,
according to the firm&#8217;s most recent proxy statement. He received
$5.58 million in total compensation last year, including $1.47
million in stock, $862,512 in options and a $1.82 million cash
bonus, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He joined the company in 1999 and named president in
October 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Moming Zhou" date="Apr 01, 2013  4:22 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/wti-oil-falls-first-time-in-six-days-as-exxon-shuts-line.html"><headline>WTI Oil Falls as Exxon Shuts Line</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate oil fell for
the first time in six days and widened its discount to Brent on
speculation that the closure of an Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) pipeline
will increase U.S. inventories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI slipped from the highest price in six weeks as Exxon
shut the Pegasus pipeline, which moves oil from Illinois to the
U.S. Gulf Coast, on March 29 after heavy Canadian crude leaked
in Arkansas. Exxon hasn&#8217;t said when it will reopen. Brent gained
as much as 1.2 percent as the euro strengthened against the
dollar for a third day. The European benchmark&#8217;s premium to WTI
widened the most since early February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Inventories are going to grow because they can&#8217;t continue
to push oil through to the refineries,&#8221; said Gene McGillian, an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
&#8220;We have to see how long it will remain offline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI for May delivery dropped 16 cents to settle at $97.07 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose to
$97.23 on March 28, the highest settlement since Feb. 14. The
volume of all futures traded was 10 percent below the 100-day
average for the time of day at 4:19 p.m. The market was closed
March 29 for Good Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent for May settlement advanced $1.06, or 1 percent, to
end the session at $111.08 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Volume was 50 percent below the average
for the time of day. Most European markets and businesses are
closed today for Easter Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pipeline Bottlenecks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent&#8217;s premium to WTI widened to $14.01 a barrel after
settling at $12.79 on March 28, the narrowest level since June
25. The $1.22 increase is the biggest since Feb. 8, when the gap
grew to this year&#8217;s high of $23.18 after Enterprise Product
Partners LP said on Jan. 31 that capacity will be limited until
late 2013 on its Seaway pipeline to the Gulf Coast from Cushing,
Oklahoma, the delivery point for the New York contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil inventories in the central U.S. rose 0.5 percent in the
week ended March 22 to 115.4 million barrels, the Energy
Information Administration, the Energy Department&#8217;s statistical
arm, reported last week. Regional supplies were at the highest
level for this time of year in EIA data going back to 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been making some progress&#8221; in moving inland oil to
the Gulf, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a
New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. Pegasus &#8220;is a
setback. It will probably heighten environmental scrutiny. It
has greater ramifications.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pegasus Pipeline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 96,000 barrel-a-day Pegasus pipeline will need to be
excavated as Exxon determines what caused the breach, and Exxon
is awaiting regulatory approval to begin excavation work and
repairs, Alan Jeffers, a company spokesman in Irving, Texas,
said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pegasus, a 20-inch (51-centimeter) line that runs to
Nederland, Texas, from Patoka, Illinois, serves refineries near
the Beaumont, Texas, area close to the Louisiana border, Jeffers
said. There are four plants near Beaumont able to process about
1.4 million barrels a day of crude, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is categorizing
the incident as a &#8220;major spill&#8221; as it is larger than 250
barrels. It came as TransCanada Corp. (TRP) is proposing to build the
Keystone XL pipeline to link Alberta&#8217;s oil sands with refineries
in the Gulf Coast. Enterprise and Enbridge Inc. (ENB) switched the
direction of the Seaway line last year to move oil from the
Midwest and Canada to Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental groups such as the National Wildlife
Federation pointed to the rupture of the pipeline as a reason
why President Barack Obama should reject Keystone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Manufacturing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures also dropped as U.S. manufacturing expanded less
than forecast in March. The Institute for Supply Management&#8217;s
factory index fell to 51.3 last month from 54.2 the prior month,
the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. The median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 54. Figures higher than
50 signal expansion. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index decreased
0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Losses deepened somewhat in conjunction with equity
market weakness after the ISM manufacturing index showed an
unexpected drop,&#8221; Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI reduced an intraday decline of as much as 1.3 percent
as the euro strengthened against the dollar. The European
currency reached $1.2868, the highest level since March 26. A
stronger euro and weaker dollar increase dollar-denominated
oil&#8217;s appeal as an investment alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in May was 17.4 percent, up from 16.6 percent on March
28. The figures have slipped from 24.7 percent on Feb. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 415,639
contracts at 4:19 p.m. local time. It totaled 385,611 contracts
yesterday, 31 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.72 million contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), the world&#8217;s
biggest maker of construction and mining machines, wants more
visas for engineers and a path to legal status for undocumented
immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have trouble filling highly-skilled positions like
engineers and scientists,&#8221; said Doug Oberhelman, chairman and
chief executive officer of Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar,
according to an e-mailed draft of a speech delivered at the
Illinois Business Immigration Coalition today in Chicago. &#8220;We
also have trouble filling many lower-skilled positions.
Immigrant employees are helping us compete today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caterpillar, which gets two-thirds of its sales outside the
U.S., has seen foreign workers it has trained go work for
competitors overseas because they could not stay in the country,
which is &#8220;unacceptable,&#8221; Oberhelman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reforms should include safe borders, changing visa laws to
better reflect business needs and providing a path to a legal
status for undocumented immigrants with the understanding that
they meet strict conditions, Oberhelman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western Canada Select weakened
against domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate after Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) shut a pipeline carrying crude from Illinois to
refineries along the Gulf Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon shut the 20-inch Pegasus line from Patoka, Illinois,
to Nederland, Texas, on March 29 following a leak of Canadian
heavy crude in central Arkansas. The line can transport 96,000
barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Certainly, the main story is the pipeline spill,&#8221; said
Andrew Lebow, a senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in
New York. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s unknown how long it&#8217;s going to be down
for.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western Canada Select slipped 65 cents a barrel to trade at
a $15 discount to WTI at 1:49 p.m. New York time, according to
data from Calgary energy broker Net Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil produced on the Gulf Coast strengthened as WTI weakened
against Brent by $1.57 a barrel to a discount of $14.36 a barrel
at 2:03 p.m. in New York. When Brent gains versus WTI, it
typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades that compete with
foreign oils priced against the European benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The volumes have been pretty light,&#8221; Lebow said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
Easter Monday in Europe, and maybe that&#8217;s exacerbating some of
this trading we&#8217;re seeing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy Louisiana Sweet&#8217;s premium to WTI widened $1.25 to $18
a barrel at 2:01 p.m. New York time, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet gained $1.25 to a premium of
$17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poseidon&#8217;s premium gained $1.70 to $13.20. Southern Green
Canyon strengthened $1.15 to an $11.15 premium. Mars Blend&#8217;s
premium to WTI rose by $1.25 to $13 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for Thunder Horse, which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
strengthened by $1.30 to $15.30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reduction in Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service&#8217;s estimate of how much taxpayer support financial firms
will receive in a crisis may result in credit ratings cuts for
banks from Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s, which placed &#8220;negative outlooks&#8221; on the holding
company ratings of eight systemically important U.S. lenders in
June, said last week that it expects to update its &#8220;bank
holding company support assumptions&#8221; by year-end. The firms&#8217;
grades are as many as two levels higher because of the potential
of a public backstop, according to Moody&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our base case assumption is that there will be a one
notch reduction across the board,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts led by
Kabir Caprihan said today in a report. &#8220;We also see the
potential for future upgrades in the standalone credit ratings
for Bank of America and Citigroup,&#8221; the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks included in the Moody&#8217;s review are Bank of New
York Mellon Corp., State Street Corp., Wells Fargo, JPMorgan,
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of
America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has made progress
toward reducing the likelihood of future government support as
the agency identifies obstacles to implement its so-called
orderly liquidation authority, which gives the FDIC power to
wind down, split up or sell off companies considered a potential
systemic risk to U.S. financial stability, Moody&#8217;s said in a
March 27 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banks, Industrials &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our base case assumes that Moody&#8217;s will remove some of
the support from all or some of the holding companies under
review, but will not completely remove the ratings uplift from
support across the board,&#8221; the JPMorgan analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in the $5.2 trillion U.S. corporate bond market
are wagering banks are safer relative to industrial companies
even after Moody&#8217;s cut the ratings of 15 of the world&#8217;s largest
banks in June, citing fragile confidence and tighter regulations
that pinched revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders are poised to overtake industrial companies as the
safest borrowers for the first time since the start of the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression, with investors
demanding an extra 156 basis points in yield over benchmarks to
buy bonds of banks, compared with 146 basis points for companies
from Alcoa Inc. to Ford Motor Co., Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 10 basis points, the gap has shrunk from a peak of 365
in March 2009 and may invert as soon as this year based on the
current pace of tightening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank bonds were seen as safer than industrial debt by
investors until September 2007, the month after BNP Paribas SA
marked the start of the credit seizure by halting withdrawals
from investment funds that owned subprime mortgage securities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s Pixar announced
plans to release &#8220;Finding Dory,&#8221; a sequel to its 2003 animated
blockbuster &#8220;Finding Nemo,&#8221; with Ellen DeGeneres returning as
the voice of the forgetful blue tang fish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film is scheduled to reach theaters on Nov. 25, 2015,
Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a statement.
Director Andrew Stanton, who won a best animated picture Oscar
for the original film, will return to helm the sequel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequel, set partly on the California coast, will
include returning characters, such as Nemo and his father
Marlin, as well as new ones, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have waited for this day for a long, long, long, long,

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) are finding ways to profit from Brazil&#8217;s 15-year
ban on municipal bond sales, issuing notes tied to state loans
guaranteed by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks last month sold notes backed by a $1.27 billion
loan to the state of Minas Gerais yielding 4.216 percent. While
the securities were sold at a lower rate than the 5.33 percent
that Credit Suisse charged Minas Gerais in November and let the
state pay back a portion of the principal along with interest
payments, they yield 1.3 times more than similar-maturity
government bonds and carry the same guarantee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street&#8217;s biggest banks are capitalizing on Brazil&#8217;s
decision in August to ease some restrictions on state borrowing
put in place after a $44 billion federal bailout in 1997 by
securitizing the loans they extend as local governments seek to
refinance bailout debt and fund investments. With virtually no
outstanding muni bonds in Brazil, the Minas Gerais notes have
risen 0.32 cent since they were issued at a premium of 109.18
cents on the dollar, according to Cantor Fitzgerald. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s clear that the market likes it,&#8221; Ulisses de Oliveira, a money manager at Galloway Capital Management in Sao
Paulo who helps oversee $400 million of emerging-market debt,
said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Heidi Przybyla" date="Apr 02, 2013 11:40 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-02/capping-low-skilled-worker-visas-central-to-compromise.html"><headline>Capping Low-Skilled Worker Visas Central to Compromise</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, the U.S. certified
about 75,000 low-skilled laborers for guest-worker visas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the first year of a new plan that business and labor
leaders have tentatively approved as part of a Senate proposal
to revise the nation&#8217;s immigration laws, employers would be able
to bring in another 20,000 a year. That would gradually rise to
75,000 -- though never exceed more than 200,000 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Chamber of Commerce wanted to double that number.
In that new &#8220;W-Visa Program&#8221; envisioned to start in April
2015, labor unions have secured caps on the number of foreign,
low-skilled workers allowed in the U.S., particularly in a
construction industry suffering high unemployment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement marked the last major obstacle for a
bipartisan group of eight senators seeking consensus on a
rewrite of U.S. immigration laws, as they prepare to unveil
legislation as soon as next week. Other issues remain, such as
visas for farm workers, as part of a package that would offer a
possible path to citizenship for many of the 11 million
undocumented immigrants already in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers still face a sales job in the Senate, as well
as reconciliation with the Republican-run House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more than the details of a still tentative
agreement among union, business and Senate leaders, observers
say, politics brought the two sides together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Prisoners&#8217; Dilemma&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a prisoners&#8217; dilemma,&#8221; said Chris Newman, legal
director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network in Los
Angeles. &#8220;Both the chamber and organized labor stood to be
accused of the crime of killing comprehensive immigration
reform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chamber backed down on its demand for more visas as the
AFL-CIO maintained that many immigrants, once given legal
working status, may start competing with Americans for higher-
paying jobs in construction, where the unemployment rate is 15.7
percent. Visas for construction work would be capped at 15,000 a
year in the W-Visa plan, which labor says is not a true
temporary worker program like the H2-B visa used by many
seasonal workers because participants could petition for
permanent status after one year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business lobby is concerned that the caps may be too
low to meet the demands of a growing U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2012 Election &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compromise reached March 29 shows how quickly the
immigration debate is advancing after an election in which the
Hispanic vote was so crucial to President Barack Obama&#8217;s re-
election that interest groups are as concerned as the political
parties about standing in the way of a broad new immigration
law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflicts between business and labor over a temporary
worker program helped scuttle a 2007 attempt at an immigration
overhaul. Labor wanted any guest worker program to expire after
five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the chamber has relented on the numbers, the unions
are engaging on an issue they have fought in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unions are opening the door&#8221; to a program they&#8217;ve long
opposed, said Roberto Suro, director of an immigration studies
program at the University of Southern California. &#8220;Once you
start doing temporary workers, where does it stop? If it&#8217;s
successful, the market&#8217;s going to keep wanting more,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Business has had to accept limits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Groundskeeping, Forestry &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among businesses most reliant on lower-skilled guest
workers under a current program known as H-2B visas are
groundskeeping, forestry and landscaping, cleaners and
housekeeping, amusement parks, animal caretakers and meat
trimmers, according to the latest U.S. Department of Labor
report. Groundskeepers accounted for more than 35 percent of
those visas in fiscal year 2011, when the government certified
74,473 guest workers under the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That included companies such as Bio Landscape and
Maintenance Inc. in Houston, certified for 314 guest workers
that year, and Superior Forestry Service of Tilly, Arizona,
certified for 708 under the H-2B program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 74,473 visas approved in 2011 marked a 14 percent
decrease from 2010, according to the Congressional Research
Service. As many as 250,343 had been approved in fiscal 2008 and
254,615 in fiscal 2007, according to a CRS report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas led the nation in H-2B visas certified in 2011,
according to the Labor Department, with 12,344 certified.
Louisiana and Florida ranked second and third. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These non-farm visas are separate from an agricultural
program known as H-2A that remains to be negotiated. And they
are apart from a program of H-1B visas for skilled workers, with
technology firms seeking a near-doubling of those numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visa Numbers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement negotiated by business and labor and
accepted in a conference call with Senator Charles Schumer of
New York, a Democratic member of the eight-senator group, the
new low-skilled worker program would start with 20,000 visas in
the first year, 35,000 in the second, 55,000 in the third and
75,000 in the fourth. In year five, the number would increase or
shrink based on a formula taking into account the unemployment
rate, the number of job openings and other factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bureau of Immigration and Labor Market Research would be
created to monitor labor market and demographic information and
identify labor shortages. It would help set an annual visa cap
not to exceed 200,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a structure we can move forward with,&#8221; Randy
Johnson, senior vice president of labor, immigration and
employee benefits at the Chamber, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wage System &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business lobby secured a basic wage system it had been
seeking. U.S. companies will be able to expand the program to a
number of industries that don&#8217;t typically require four-year
bachelor&#8217;s degrees, including home health-care aides and
industrial equipment repair technicians, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the other hand, in search of a compromise, certain
limitations on the program had to be adopted,&#8221; Johnson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unions were concerned about any visa program that would
give immigrants working illegally in the U.S. something that
troubles labor: job mobility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have labor mobilization for a community
that has not had mobilization until now -- folks will want to
pursue other occupations&#8221; displacing native workers in
occupations with high jobless rates, said Sonia Ramirez,
director of government affairs for the Building and Construction
Trades Department of the AFL-CIO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once people have their status regularized it will be
easier to get a handle on where people are working and where
there are jobs that need to be filled,&#8221; Ramirez said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tracking Patterns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2003 to 2011, there was just one year in which the
estimated number of undocumented immigrants entering the U.S.
was less than 200,000, according to the Mexican Migration
Monitor, a project at USC that tracks illegal immigration
patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 2006 and 2007, amid the height of the U.S. housing
boom, the number was 665,755 and 682,561 respectively. In 2008
the number was 498,445 and has declined to 165,769 as the U.S.
steps up its commitment to border security and deported a record
number of illegal immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visa program is viewed as a measured alternative. It is
&#8220;not big enough to replace the illegal flow,&#8221; said Tamar Jacoby, president at ImmigrationWorks USA, a group of pro-
immigration business coalitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Construction is poised to be the engine bringing the
nation to full economic recovery in the next two to three years
and it&#8217;s not going to get enough workers,&#8221; Jacoby said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor officials say the figures don&#8217;t provide the full
picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even though it looks like the chamber has been talked
down, the reality is that, overall, the number of guest workers
arriving in this country increases,&#8221; said Saket Soni, executive
director of the National Guest Worker Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) fell the most in
more than four months after Bill Shope, an analyst at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., downgraded the shares amid a continuing slump
in personal-computer sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares dropped 5.2 percent to $22.10 at 10:11 a.m. in
New York, and earlier touched $21.90 for the biggest intraday
decline since Nov. 20. Shope downgraded the stock to sell from
neutral and has a $16 target price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before today, Hewlett-Packard had surged 64 percent this
year on optimism that Meg Whitman, the fourth CEO in three
years, could engineer a turnaround. She showed early signs of
progress in February, forecasting fiscal second-quarter profit
that beat estimates as cost cutting and rebounding demand for
enterprise services helped offset waning demand for PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sentiment has moved ahead of reality,&#8221; Shope wrote in a
research report today. He predicted that the shares could fall
31 percent from yesterday&#8217;s closing price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The current restructuring actions will be largely
countered by incremental weakness in PCs, enterprise hardware,
services and printing in fiscal 2013,&#8221; Shope said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global PC shipments may fall 1.3 percent to 345.8 million
units this year, from 350.4 million in 2012, researcher IDC said
last month. Last year, shipments declined 3.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) plans to develop
the world&#8217;s biggest floating liquefied natural gas project off
the coast of Western Australia as costs to build onshore plants
in the country surge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, and partner BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) expect to decide whether to go ahead with the
Scarborough floating LNG venture in 2014 or 2015, with the
project starting production in 2020 or 2021, documents lodged on
the Australian Environment Department&#8217;s website show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy companies from Royal Dutch Shell Plc to Malaysia&#8217;s
Petroliam Nasional Bhd. want to turn natural gas into liquid at
sea. In Australia, Shell is developing the Prelude floating LNG
vessel -- expected to be as long as the Empire State Building
and weigh six times as much as the biggest aircraft carrier --
after companies including Chevron Corp. (CVX) experienced budget
overruns at onshore LNG projects in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A floating LNG facility has the potential to lower costs by
eliminating the need for pipelines to the coast and reduce the
venture&#8217;s &#8220;environmental footprint,&#8221; Jessica Warne, a
Melbourne-based spokeswoman for Exxon, said today by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Plans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exxon project is expected to cost more than Deutsche
Bank AG&#8217;s $12 billion estimate for Prelude, John Hirjee, a
Melbourne-based analyst at the bank, said today by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s plan, which may change, would be to produce about 6
million metric tons to 7 million metric tons of LNG a year,
Warne said. Prelude is expected to produce at least 3.6 million
tons of LNG annually, according to its website. The development
is due to start in about 2017, Shell said in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s floating plant in the Carnarvon Basin off northwest
Australia is expected to be about 495 meters (1,624 feet) long
and 75 meters wide, according to the filing. Prelude, expected
to be the world&#8217;s largest vessel, will be 488 meters long and 74
meters wide, Shell&#8217;s website shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 12 production wells will be drilled in two phases,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hague-based Shell&#8217;s floating LNG venture will cost
$10.8 billion to $12.6 billion, according to figures the oil
company provided when it approved the project in 2011. Exxon&#8217;s
Warne declined to provide a cost estimate for Scarborough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is developing an
excavation and removal plan for a damaged section of its 96,000
barrel-a-day Pegasus crude pipeline, which was shut after a leak
was discovered in Arkansas on March 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said yesterday it collected about 12,000
barrels of oil and water from the spill, classified as major by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, according to a
statement from the Mayflower Incident Unified Command Joint
Information Center. Local officials recommended 22 homes closest
to the leak remain evacuated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t really update it much beyond yesterday, so
we&#8217;re using 12,000 (barrels of oil and water mixture), hopefully
we can get a newer number tomorrow,&#8221; Charlie Engelmann, a

said he couldn&#8217;t speculate on timing for repairs to the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line shutdown may limit flow of crude from western
Canada and the U.S. Midwest, exacerbating a glut of oil in the
area. Domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate weakened $1.22
yesterday to $14.01 a barrel against Brent, the international
marker, from $12.79 on March 28, the smallest gap since July. It
was at $14.07 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-inch Pegasus line runs 940 miles (1,512 kilometers)
from Patoka, Illinois, to Nederland, Texas, and serves
refineries around Port Arthur and Beaumont, close to the
Louisiana line. There are four plants near the city able to
process about 1.4 million barrels a day of crude, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The sites are operated by Exxon,
Valero Energy Corp., Total SA and Motiva Enterprises LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heavy Crude &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line was carrying Wabasca Heavy Crude from western
Canada at the time of the incident, Kimberly Brasington, an
Exxon spokeswoman, said March 31. Wabasca Heavy is a blend of
heavy oil produced in Alberta by Cenovus Energy, Canadian
Natural Resources and other companies that typically has about
4.15 percent sulfur and a 19-20 API gravity, according to Crude
Quality Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western Canada Select, a blend of heavy bitumen and diluent
that serves as a benchmark for Alberta tar sands formations,
slipped 65 cents a barrel to trade at a $15 discount to WTI at
4:57 p.m. New York time yesterday, according to data from
Calgary energy broker Net Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon didn&#8217;t offer a timeline for repairs to the line. The
rupture has been located and Exxon is awaiting regulatory
approval from the Department of Transportation to begin
excavation work and repairs, Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for the
company, said by phone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oiled Ducks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 54 claims have been made, according to the joint
statement, and 10 ducks with oil on them have been recovered for
treatment, the statement showed. Two other ducks were found
dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major spill in Michigan in July 2010 shut an Enbridge
Inc. crude pipeline for two months, and the cleanup still isn&#8217;t
complete. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last month
directed Enbridge to perform more dredging in Michigan&#8217;s
Kalamazoo River as part of a cleanup from a July 2010 rupture of
a 30-inch pipeline that also carried heavy crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon was fined $26,200 in 2010 by the U.S. Department of
Transportation&#8217;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration for failing to regularly inspect each point where
the Pegasus line crosses under a navigable waterway. PHMSA
specifically cited the line&#8217;s crossing under the Mississippi
River between Missouri and Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clean-Up &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arkansas spill was estimated at a few thousand barrels,
according to a statement yesterday from the Mayflower Unified
Command Center, which includes Exxon, Faulkner County and the
city of Mayflower, Arkansas. Exxon hasn&#8217;t stated the size of the
spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen vacuum trucks and 33 storage tanks were deployed to
the site of the spill to aid clean up efforts, according to the
Unified Command. Exxon sent 120 workers in response, and crews
were steam-cleaning oil from property today, according to the
joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No oil had reached nearby Lake Conway and cleanup crews
have deployed 3,600 feet of boom as a precaution, the command
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is halting video-
game development at its recently acquired Lucasfilm division in
an effort to cut costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, will
focus on licensing &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; content rather than developing
games internally, Miles Perkins, a Lucasfilm spokesman, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney acquired Lucasfilm, the business founded by director
George Lucas last year for about $4 billion. LucasArts, the
company&#8217;s video-game unit, was established in 1982 and its
catalog has included titles such as &#8220;Lego Star Wars&#8221; and
&#8220;Star Wars Battlefront,&#8221; according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving from internal development to licensing is designed
to minimize &#8220;risk while achieving a broader portfolio of
quality Star Wars games,&#8221; the company said in a statement. &#8220;As
a result of this change, we&#8217;ve had layoffs across the
organization,&#8221; according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perkins declined to say how many Lucasfilm jobs will be
affected. The company employs more than 1,800 people in San
Francisco and other locations, he said. Lucasfilm is looking for
external partners to complete games currently in development
such as &#8220;Star Wars 1313,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell less than 1
percent to $57.25 at the close in New York. The shares are up 15
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was reported earlier by the website
GameInformer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Drew Armstrong and Meg Tirrell" date="Apr 03, 2013  4:07 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-03/pfizer-to-pay-bind-up-to-210-million-in-nanotechnology-deal.html"><headline>Pfizer Makes Nanomedicines Deal With Bind Therapeutics</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, will pay closely held Bind Therapeutics Inc. as much
as $200 million per potential drug to develop medicines using
its nanotechnology platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies will collaborate on preclinical work and New
York-based Pfizer will have the option to pursue development of
compounds it selects, Bind said in a statement today. The
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company may receive as much as
$50 million in upfront and development payments and is eligible
for $160 million more per compound tied to regulatory and sales
goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is the second this year for Bind, which uses
nanotechnology to selectively reach disease sites in the body in
treating cancer, inflammatory ailments and cardiovascular
disorders without affecting healthy tissue. In January, Amgen
Inc. said it would pay as much as $180.5 million for the right
to develop cancer drugs using Bind&#8217;s technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The pharmaceutical industry is reaching an inflection
point in terms of adopting this as a major strategic technology
for the industry,&#8221; Bind Chief Executive Officer Scott Minick
said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bind&#8217;s technology comes from the laboratories of Robert
Langer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Omid Farokhzad, of Harvard Medical School. Its nanoparticles, which
it calls Accurins, can travel through the body without being
detected or destroyed by the immune system, Minick said.
Carrying potent drugs, the particles home in on specific disease
cells and avoid poisoning healthy ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results Expected &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to partnerships with Pfizer and Thousand Oaks,
California-based Amgen, Bind is developing a slate of potential
drugs in-house. The company&#8217;s leading therapy is BIND-014, which
targets tumors with the cancer drug docetaxel. Bind said last
week it will present results from a first-stage study of the
treatment at the American Association for Cancer Research
meeting on April 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer &#8220;partnered with Bind because these delivery systems
are a unique approach that potentially offer highly precise
targeted therapeutics increasing the window for broader patient
treatment options,&#8221; said Lauren Starr, a spokeswoman for the
drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $29.03 at the close
in New York. The shares have increased 16 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) are among the only top banks in the world
that aren&#8217;t reducing capacity, Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re seeing big international banks, outside of
ourselves and JPMorgan, really taking a pretty substantial step
back from the markets, and we hadn&#8217;t seen that in the entire
history of banking,&#8221; Cohn, 52, told journalists today at
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s office in Sao Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn cited plans by Zurich-based UBS AG and Credit Suisse
Group AG to cut risk-weighted assets, reduce balance sheets and
withdraw from certain markets and regions after suffering losses
during the credit crisis. Deutsche Bank AG plans to reduce
balance-sheet leverage as well, and London-based Barclays Plc is
facing restrictions from the U.K. government, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The only capacity we&#8217;ve ever seen taken out of banks is
banks merging with each other over the last 50 years,&#8221; Cohn
said. &#8220;Now we are actually seeing banks withdraw from
investment banking and the capital-markets business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While competition from major international institutions is
easing, New York-based Goldman Sachs is confronting stronger
local banks in regions including Brazil, Singapore, Japan and
Hong Kong, Cohn said. Goldman Sachs faces the strongest local
competitors in Brazil, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former New York stockbroker
admitted to sharing inside tips about International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s $1.2 billion acquisition of SPSS Inc. that he
picked up from his roommate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Conradt, 35, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit
securities fraud and two counts of securities fraud today in
Manhattan federal court. Conradt was accused of learning about
the deal from his roommate, Trent Martin, a former financial
analyst who was extradited from Hong Kong last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said Martin was tipped by a corporate lawyer,
not identified in court papers, who was working on the IBM deal
in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I understood this information was inside information and
that it was not publically available,&#8221; Conradt told U.S.
District Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr. today. &#8220;I can assure the
court that I will never put myself in this position again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Carter set sentencing for Oct. 3 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin allegedly bought SPSS stock based on the information
and shared the tip with Conradt. Conradt in turn was accused of
telling a friend, David Weishaus, who passed the information to
two other brokers, according to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following his extradition, Martin, an Australian citizen,
pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Martin, 12-cr-00887, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By David McLaughlin" date="Apr 03, 2013  1:38 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-03/jpmorgan-wins-round-in-dexia-sa-mortgage-bond-lawsuit.html"><headline>JPMorgan Wins Round in Dexia SA Mortgage-Bond Lawsuit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, defeated most of a lawsuit brought by Dexia SA over
about $1.6 billion in mortgage-backed securities it bought
before the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan narrowed the
case to five securitization deals from 65 at issue in a
complaint brought by Dexia, according to an order filed today.
Rakoff said he would issue an opinion later explaining his
reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexia, based in Brussels, sued JPMorgan in 2012 along with
the Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual businesses JPMorgan
acquired, accusing the lender of &#8220;egregious fraud&#8221; in the sale
of mortgage bonds. Dexia claimed loans backing securities
purchased between 2005 and 2007 were riskier than promised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexia (DEXB) unit FSA Asset Management LLC said in court papers
that JPMorgan received reports from independent mortgage-loan
underwriters showing that 20 percent to 80 percent of the loans
in samples used for testing didn&#8217;t meet the underwriting
guidelines, including fraudulent home appraisals or missing
documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rather than disclose these known defects to FSAM,
defendants bought and sold massive quantities of defective
loans,&#8221; FSAM said. &#8220;Defendants secretly overrode the
independent loan underwriters&#8217; determinations, creating a final,
sanitized version.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff granted part of JPMorgan&#8217;s motion for a pre-trial
ruling known as summary judgment. The judge dismissed claims
brought by Dexia and said FSAM can pursue claims related to five
securitizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t immediately comment about the decision. A
lawyer for Dexia couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Dexia SA v. Bear Stearns  Co., 12-cv-04761.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s fund
management arm is overweight on Slovenia&#8217;s bonds and may buy
more as it believes the challenges facing the Alpine nation
won&#8217;t force the sovereign into debt restructuring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Slovenian dollar-denominated notes due 2022 fell
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to a one-week low
of 5.9 percent by 4:07 p.m. in Ljubljana, 48 basis points below
last week&#8217;s record high, according to data complied by
Bloomberg. The country&#8217;s bonds tumbled over the last two weeks
on speculation it may be the next euro member to ask for a
bailout after Cyprus&#8217;s emergency tax plans soured sentiment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management may expand its &#8220;modest&#8221;
overweight position in Slovene bonds if the selloff caused by
ripples from Cypriot efforts to obtain aid resumes, according to
Sam Finkelstein, a money manager who helps manage $40 billion in
emerging-market debt at the company. While Slovenia&#8217;s banks are
saddled with bad debts amid a second recession since 2009, the
financial industry is less bloated then in some European Union
peers, he said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very solid investment story and not the same
issues that faced either Greece or Cyprus,&#8221; Finkelstein said by
phone from London today. &#8220;If there is further contagion, we&#8217;d
be looking to buy that dip.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slovenia&#8217;s crisis isn&#8217;t &#8220;insurmountable,&#8221; Bostjan Jazbec,
approved by lawmakers as Slovenia&#8217;s next central bank president
this week, said in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the country faces &#8220;a number of challenges&#8221; and has
a &#8220;weak&#8221; coalition government, its &#8220;banking sector is not
large compared to other EU members and debt-to-GDP is low,&#8221;
Finkelstein said. &#8220;The remedy to their challenges is not a
haircut to the government debt. So I&#8217;m very comfortable with an
investment in Slovenia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
traderMatthew Taylor surrendered to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation at about 8:30 a.m. this morning as part of a
U.S. securities fraud investigation, a person familiar with the
matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor is to appear in Manhattan federal court later today.
He was accused Nov. 8 in a lawsuit by the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission of concealing an $8.3 billion position in
2007 that caused New York-based Goldman Sachs to lose 
$118 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley hired Taylor in March 2008 after Goldman
Sachs fired him three months earlier. Goldman cited &#8220;alleged
conduct related to inappropriately large proprietary futures
positions in a firm trading account,&#8221; in a so-called U-5 form,
according to a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS), which had employed Taylor
before he joined Goldman Sachs in 2005, hired him after a
subprime mortgage-related trading position resulted in a
$9.4 billion writedown in December 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Equity Derivative &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor, who handled client-related equity derivative
trading at Morgan Stanley, left the firm in July, the company
said last year. Taylor&#8217;s departure wasn&#8217;t related to the CFTC
complaint, said a person familiar with the situation who asked
not to be identified because the information was private. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) plans to keep its $3.2
billion-a-year consumer health business because the unit will be
critical to selling prescription drugs that become over-the-
counter products, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit that makes ChapStick lip balm, Advil pain pills
and Centrum vitamins will &#8220;absolutely&#8221; stay within New York-
based Pfizer, Read told investors on a conference call arranged
by Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. last week. Medicines shifting to
nonprescription status will be a growing trend, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a business that has a great store of value for us,&#8221;
Read said on the March 26 call. A recording of the call was
posted online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, has been shrinking
since Read took over in late 2010, cutting expenses and
divesting its animal health and infant nutrition units. The CEO
has talked about splitting the drug business in two, with one
unit focusing on brand-name medicines and another on those that
don&#8217;t have patent protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer does still very much seem to be contemplating this
possibility, but no firm decision has been made yet,&#8221; said Tim Anderson, a Bernstein analyst, said in a note to clients after
the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker&#8217;s shares rose less than 1 percent to close at
$29.16 in New York. The stock had gained 30 percent in the last
12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer business is headed by Amy Schulman, who also
serves as general counsel and ran the infant nutrition business
until it was sold to Nestle SA (NESN) last year for $11.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unlock Value &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I do see the synergies with the branded and the generics
part of the business -- much more so than existed with animal
health or with nutritionals,&#8221; said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst
at New York-based International Strategy  Investment Group Inc.
said in e-mail. Still, &#8220;a separation could unlock a bit of
value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Pfizer chooses to split the company in two, the consumer
unit might be bundled with its generic-drug business, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been trying to expand the consumer line. In
August, the company bought the rights to sell AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)&#8217;s
heartburn pill Nexium over the counter. Pfizer paid $250 million
up front, and will pay royalties once the drug goes on sale,
likely in the U.S. about 2014. The company has also said it may
try and develop a nonprescription version of the cholesterol
pill Lipitor, which was once Pfizer&#8217;s best-selling product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comfortable Fit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It in many ways has a very comfortable fit within our
current platform,&#8221; Schulman said on the investor call. &#8220;It&#8217;s
also an important harbinger of where the market is going.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In emerging markets, prescription drugs will be more
readily available over the counter than they will be in the
U.S., Read predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You could potentially see emerging markets moving faster
on this OTC switch than the very cautious&#8221; U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugmaker Merck  Co. (MRK) is evaluating its consumer unit
because it may not be big enough, Merck CEO Ken Frazier said at
a January investor conference. The Whitehouse Station, New
Jersey-based company got $1.95 billion in sales from the
business last year, with more than a quarter of that coming from
allergy medicine Claritin OTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schulman said that Pfizer&#8217;s business, which is larger than
Merck&#8217;s, has enough depth in the products and geographies in
which it chooses to sell. &#8220;I think we have scale in the areas
in which we compete,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is seeking to
acquire oil blocks in Brazil two years after drilling three dry
wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, will join 70 other
companies, including Australia&#8217;s BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP), the world&#8217;s
largest mining company, and Japanese commodities trader Mitsui 
Co. Ltd. (8031), to register for an oil block auction scheduled for May
14 and 15, according to a copy of the list seen by Bloomberg
News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies that will seek to start producing oil in
Brazil include Cnooc Ltd. (883), Premier Oil Plc (PMO), JX Nippon Oil  Gas
Exploration Corp, Panoro Energy ASA (PEN), Hess Corp. (HES), GDF Suez (GSZ) and
Petroliam Nasional Bhd., according to the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil hasn&#8217;t auctioned oil blocks since 2008. While the
country is home to the world&#8217;s largest oil discoveries this
century after finding the so-called pre-salt reserves under the
Atlantic ocean in 2006, the blocks being auctioned in May are
not part of the same geological formation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blocks that will be made available for the companies
are located off Brazil&#8217;s northeastern and northern coasts, while
the pre-salt finds are off the coasts of the southeast states of
Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Espirito Santo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon quit its only Brazilian block last year after
drilling three dry holes in deep waters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), BP Group Plc and Statoil ASA (STL) are
among companies that already have production operations in
Brazil that are also competing, as are Total SA (FP) and Repsol SA,
according to the list. Nineteen Brazilian companies will seek
blocks, including OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA. (OGXP3) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) may have to face
lawsuits by insurers alleging the company improperly marketed
the epilepsy drug Neurontin after an appeals court found the
cases were improperly denied class-action status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston yesterday found a
lower-court judge erred in refusing to allow so-called &#8220;third-
party payers,&#8221; such as health insurers and union funds, to
combine their Neurontin racketeering claims. The appeals court
also upheld a $142.1 million damage award to Kaiser Foundation
Health Plan Inc. over Pfizer&#8217;s Neurontin marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We reject the argument&#8221; that Kaiser&#8217;s lawyers didn&#8217;t
produce sufficient evidence to uphold the jury verdict, the
court said in a 64-page ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision allows hundreds of U.S. health plans to revive
potential class-action racketeering claims that the world&#8217;s
largest drugmaker engaged in illegal off-label marketing of
Neurontin for bipolar disorders, said Carl Tobias, who teaches
product-liability law at the University of Richmond in Virginia.
&#8220;They are telling the judge to take another look at the class-
certification issue,&#8221; Tobias said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer officials said they are considering appealing the
today&#8217;s rulings in the Neurontin cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;No Basis&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer continues to believe there was no basis in fact or
law&#8221; for the Kaiser verdict, Chris Loder, a spokesman for the
New York-based company, said in an e-mailed statement. The
drugmaker also contends the trial judge correctly ruled the
insurers shouldn&#8217;t be able to proceed as a class with their
claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and its Warner-Lambert unit are accused in the
insurers&#8217; lawsuits of promoting the drug for uses that weren&#8217;t
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to boost
profit. The insurers contend they were duped into covering
Neurontin prescriptions for unapproved ailments, such as bipolar
disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Warner-Lambert subsidiary pleaded guilty in 2004
to criminal charges filed by the U.S. Justice Department and
paid $430 million to resolve allegations over the company&#8217;s
Neurontin marketing. Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert for $120
billion in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurontin&#8217;s sales rose from 15 percent off-label in 1994 to
94 percent in 2002, the government said in court filings. The
drug&#8217;s sales hit $2.3 billion in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Combine Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurers sought to combine claims that Pfizer engaged
in racketeering through its Neurontin marketing. U.S. District
Judge Patti Saris denied that request, ruling the plans couldn&#8217;t
show Pfizer&#8217;s actions caused their damages and therefore weren&#8217;t
entitled to have a class-action case certified, according to
court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court panel, which included retired Supreme
Court Judge David Souter, concluded the plans presented
sufficient evidence to show Pfizer&#8217;s illegal Neurontin marketing
caused the insurers&#8217; damages. The panel sent the case back to
Saris to revive the racketeering claims and to reexamine whether
the cases should be certified as a class action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We express no view as to whether the plaintiffs can, on
remand, meet the requirements&#8221; for having their cases combined,
the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Kaiser case, a federal court jury in Boston
concluded in 2010 Pfizer violated federal racketeering laws
through its Neurontin marketing and it awarded $47.4 million in
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saris later tripled the award under a provision of the
racketeering statutes. The claims were brought by the Kaiser
Foundation plan and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. Both are units
of Oakland, California-based insurer Kaiser Permanente. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are In RE Neurontin Marketing and Sales Practices
Litigation, 11-1806, 11-1904 and 11-2096, United States Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand for temporary U.S. visas for
high-skilled workers resulted in a cap being reached within five
days after the filing period opened April 1 and will trigger a
lottery for the permits, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
Services said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employer-sponsored visa allows 65,000 professionals
with a college degree or equivalent experience to work in the
U.S. for three years with extensions to six years and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took 10 weeks to reach the quota last year and until
Nov. 22 in 2011. An additional 20,000 slots are available for
the first petitions for employees with a master&#8217;s degree or
higher from a U.S. university, and the agency said that limit
was also reached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USCIS will stop accepting employers&#8217; petitions, the agency
said in a release in Washington today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency will use a computer-generated random selection
process for all filings received through April 5. That means
companies will have to wait, possibly for months, to learn if
employees have gained credentials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&#8217;s competition for visas takes place against the
backdrop of a national immigration debate. A bipartisan group of
eight senators is drafting a package on immigration policy which
lawmakers hope to unveil next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The implication is that with immigration reform happening
now, and Congress coming back on Monday, it shows the problem of
the H-1B immigration program,&#8221; said Neil Ruiz, a senior policy
analyst at Washington-based Brookings Institution who studies
issues involving the visas. &#8220;It shows it&#8217;s a catch-all visa.
The challenge for immigration reform right now is to deal with
each piece in legislation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dominate Applications &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies in computer, math and science fields dominate
H-1B visa applications and have spent years pushing for a higher
quota. For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2011, 48.9 percent of
approved petitions for initial employment were in computer-
related occupations, and 11.3 percent went to architecture,
engineering and surveying professionals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced degree petitions that did not make it into the
20,000 exemption will be part of the lottery, the release said.
USCIS is not yet able to announce the exact day of the random
selection process due to the high application volume, according
to the release. The agency is not yet saying how many total
petitions it has received. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More detailed information will be provided next week, USCIS
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitions that are exempt from the cap -- which include
those for governmental research organizations and universities -
- will still be accepted, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Previous Lotteries &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 65,000 cap for H-1B workers has been in place since
2003 with the masters exemption added in 2005. The program went
to a lottery for fiscal years starting October 1, 2007 and 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USCIS said in a press release last month that it
anticipated that the cap could be reached within five days this
year, spurring a lottery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s an underlying demand, and everyone has an
incentive to jump in as quickly as possible,&#8221; said Bruce A.
Morrison, chairman of Morrison Public Affairs Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morrison is a former U.S. representative from Connecticut
who chaired the House immigration subcommittee and was House
author of the Immigration Act of 1990. He now works on behalf of
IEEE-USA, a professional organization for electrical and
electronic engineers, which opposes expanding H-1B. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once people believe that they&#8217;re all going to be used up,
you&#8217;ve got to get your petitions in,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serengeti Asset Management LP, the
New York-based hedge-fund firm started by Jody LaNasa, hired two
of LaNasa&#8217;s former colleagues at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
Leslie Biddle and Daniel Eichner, according to a person familiar
with the appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biddle will work with LaNasa and partner Vivian Lau, both
former Goldman colleagues, on investments in energy, power and
natural resources, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. Eichner was
hired as managing director of business development, marketing
and investor relations, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LaNasa founded Serengeti in 2007, building it into a $1.3
billion firm investing in distressed debt, structured finance
and equities. He was formerly head of the multistrategy
investing desk in the special situations investments group at
Goldman. The firm&#8217;s Serengeti Opportunities Ltd. fund rose 1.4
percent in March and 8.3 percent this year, after gaining 13
percent in 2012, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Beth Grover, a spokeswoman for Serengeti at the
Abernathy MacGregor Group, declined to comment on the
appointments and the returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biddle, who joined Serengeti as partner, will also help run
the firm with LaNasa and Lau, with responsibilities in
investments and business development, the person said. Biddle
was a senior partner at Goldman Sachs, according to the person,
where she was global head of commodity sales and chief financial
officer of metals and mining investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eichner, Lau &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eichner worked for LaNasa before and was an analyst in
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s special situations investments group in 2002 and
2003, the person said. He joined from Garrison Investment Group
LP, where he was responsible for investor relations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lau joined Serengeti in 2008. Before that, she worked at
Goldman Sachs for eight years and co-ran the multistrategy
investment business in the special situations group, the person
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
forecast for U.S. natural gas futures for the remainder of this
year on a &#8220;tightening shift&#8221; in market fundamentals after
temperatures fell last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures in New York will average $4.40 per million British
thermal units for the balance of 2013, Goldman said in a report
e-mailed today. That&#8217;s a 17 percent increase from its previous
forecast of $3.75. Cold weather in the U.S. reduced inventories
to 1.7 trillion cubic feet at the end of last month, from 2.5
trillion a year ago, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the need for more production and less need for
coal-to-gas switching will allow prices to move higher,&#8221; said
Johan Spetz, a commodity analyst at Goldman in New York. &#8220;A
return to growing production is required to balance the market
after this summer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark natural gas futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange climbed 15 percent in March, the most in half a year,
as cold weather increased demand and drained stockpiles in the
U.S. The contract for May delivery was at $3.96 per million
British thermal units, up 0.3 percent, in electronic trading on
Nymex today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman also opened a trading recommendation to buy call
options on gas for November 2013 at $4.20 per million British
thermal units. The bank maintained its forecast for 2014 at
$4.25, citing a possible increase in supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe prices are likely to face resistance above
$4.25 in the near term as coal-to-gas switching is still needed
to balance the market,&#8221; Spetz said. &#8220;Net, we expect U.S.
natural gas production to be flat year-on-year in 2013 before
returning to close to 2 billion cubic feet a day growth in 2014
year-on-year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will use an Advanced
Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) processor in its next Xbox game console as it
seeks to cut the cost of building machines and get developers to
create more titles, people with knowledge of the matter said.
AMD surged the most in almost two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xbox will use an AMD system-on-a-chip that combines
powerful &#8220;Jaguar&#8221; central processing units with graphics
chips, said one of the people, who sought anonymity because the
plans aren&#8217;t public. The shift to the so-called x86 format
ubiquitous in modern personal computers means Microsoft will
drop the Power PC technology designed by International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM), and game discs made for the current Xbox 360
won&#8217;t be compatible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switch is a boon for AMD, which is also providing chips
for Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s coming PlayStation 4, as it seeks a larger
slice of the $67 billion global video-game market to help lessen
its reliance on the shrinking PC industry. Microsoft also stands
to benefit because game developers, who have moved toward making
games for PCs and mobile devices, will find it easier to deliver
those titles for the next Xbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll probably see many more titles because the console
makers are saying the publishers are back in the driver&#8217;s
seat,&#8221; said Richard Doherty, president of technology consulting
firm Envisioneering Group. Developers won&#8217;t have to reinvent
various features, such as &#8220;smoke, shading and reflections for
each machine and can essentially create once and port once, and
be done.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ericsson AB (ERICB) agreed to buy Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Mediaroom business, adding software used by phone companies to deliver television over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mediaroom, based in Mountain View, California, has more than 400 employees globally and will help Ericsson be the largest provider of so-called IPTV technology with a market share of over 25 percent, Ericsson said today in a statement. Ericsson paid less than $200 million, according to a person familiar with the deal who asked not to be identified because the details are confidential. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ericsson, the largest maker of wireless networks, is seeking to cater to carriers that compete with cable, satellite and Web-based providers. The move will also help Stockholm-based Ericsson step up its emphasis on software and services amid accelerating competition in hardware. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mediaroom &#8220;gives us a large installed based to work with and a great opportunity to move into an evolutionary path of IPTV into media distribution,&#8221; Per Borgklint, head of Ericsson&#8217;s Business Unit Support Solutions, said in a phone interview. &#8220;This gives us the bridgehead to grow this business significantly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesmen referred Bloomberg to a blog post by the company in which it said the sale &#8220;is mutually beneficial and strategically aligned for both parties&#8221; and will let the Redmond, Washington-based company &#8220;commit 100 percent of its focus on consumer TV strategy with Xbox,&#8221; its game console. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The global IPTV market is estimated to reach 105 million subscribers in 2015, expanding to $45 billion by that year from $32 billion in 2013, Ericsson said. The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ericsson advanced 0.3 percent to 77.85 kronor in Stockholm today. Microsoft declined less than 1 percent to $28.59 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Oshrat Carmiel" date="Apr 08, 2013  2:04 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-08/jpmorgan-s-dimon-buys-nyc-office-for-2-05-million.html"><headline>JPMorgan&#8217;s Dimon Buys NYC Office for $2.05 Million</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief
executive officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), bought a commercial
co-op unit on the ground floor of his Manhattan apartment
building for $2.05 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, and his wife, Judy, completed the purchase of
the property at 1185 Park Ave. on March 22, according to records
made public today by the New York City Department of Finance.
The couple own a 16th-floor residence in the building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sellers of the commercial co-op were listed as Stephen
Marks and George Ellis, cardiologists whose practice was located
at the address. The unit is one of 11 on the ground floor of the
building, located between 93rd and 94th Streets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re professional offices&#8221; said Jonathan Miller,
president of New York-based appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. &#8220;Most
of the time it&#8217;s a doctor, a psychologist, any type of medical
practice. It&#8217;s not uncommon for it to be a place to write a
book, or just a place to work, or have a private office.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller&#8217;s firm has appraised other ground-floor offices in
the building. He wasn&#8217;t involved in Dimon&#8217;s deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annette Funicello, whose youthful
charm made her the most popular of the original Mouseketeers on
Walt Disney&#8217;s &#8220;The Mickey Mouse Club&#8221; television show, has
died. She was 70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She died today at Mercy Southwest Hospital in Bakersfield,
California, according to a statement from Walt Disney Co. (DIS), based
in Burbank, California. The cause was complications from
multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disease. In 1992
she said she had been diagnosed with the ailment since 1987. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one of the most popular children&#8217;s TV shows of the
1950s, Funicello established herself as the most beloved of the
two dozen young performers known as Mouseketeers. Her Italian-
American ancestry gave her, at 12, dark brunette curls to go
along with a dimpled smile that was at once shy and enticing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picked personally by Walt Disney for the cast, Funicello
became the only Mouseketeer kept on contract after the show&#8217;s
four-season run. She went on to a career in music and film,
including a series of popular beach movies that paired her with
Frankie Avalon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She never was scantily clad in those movies, keeping a
promise to Disney that she wouldn&#8217;t show her navel on screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She&#8217;s the perfect girl next door,&#8221; Avalon once said.
&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t have a mean bone in her body. She&#8217;s the sweetest
girl I know, and nothing&#8217;s ever changed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her 1994 memoir, &#8220;A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,&#8221;
Funicello wrote that the carefully scrubbed innocence of &#8220;The
Mickey Mouse Club&#8221; was &#8220;an honest if exaggerated reflection of
an America that, sadly, has faded into history.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accidental Stardom &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An accidental celebrity, Funicello pronounced her last name
&#8220;Fun-is-sello&#8221; to downplay her heritage, she said, and once
proposed changing it to Turner. Disney instead urged her to
start using the correct pronunciation -- &#8220;Foon-i-chello&#8221; -- in
public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annette Joanne Funicello was born on Oct. 22, 1942, in
Utica, New York, the first child of first-generation Italian-
Americans. Her father, Joe, was a master auto mechanic who met
his future wife, Virginia Albano, at her brother&#8217;s diner, where
she worked as a secretary and hostess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 2, Funicello could sing the words to every top popular
song, with a special affection for Johnny Mercer&#8217;s &#8220;Accentuate
the Positive,&#8221; she recalled in her memoir. Still, when her
parents packed up for California in 1946, when she was 4 and her
brother Joey was nine months, it was to chase not stardom but
warmer weather, she said. Another brother, Michael, was born
after the family settled in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney Auditions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funicello took drum and dance lessons and, at 12, had the
lead role in her dance school&#8217;s performance of &#8220;Swan Lake.&#8221;
Among those in the audience was Disney, who was looking for
child performers for his new show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was invited to audition, then called back twice to try
out for what was, she later learned, the final spot in the cast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two dozen Mouseketeers were divided into three groups.
Funicello was among the eight who performed the show&#8217;s opening
and closing numbers. Other original cast members included Johnny
Crawford, later a bandleader and a star of the TV series &#8220;The
Rifleman;&#8221; Paul Petersen, who would appear on &#8220;The Donna Reed
Show;&#8221; and two sons of actor Mickey Rooney, Tim and Mickey Jr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mouseketeers debuted in a national TV special on July
17, 1955, the day Disneyland opened. The series aired on ABC
from 1955 to 1958. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the show ceased production in 1959, the studio moved
Funicello into singing and film acting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her first recording, &#8220;How Will I Know My Love?&#8221; sold
several hundred thousand copies, and she broke the Top 10 in
1959 with &#8220;Tall Paul,&#8221; which she performed on Dick Clark&#8217;s
&#8220;American Bandstand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Celebrating Innocence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her first film was &#8220;The Shaggy Dog&#8221; (1959), with Fred
MacMurray, followed by &#8220;Babes in Toyland&#8221; (1961). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Beach Party&#8221; (1963) paired Funicello with her longtime
friend, Avalon, in a celebration of youth, sun, surfing and
innocent flirtation. Its success led to sequels including
&#8220;Muscle Beach Party&#8221; (1964) and &#8220;Beach Blanket Bingo&#8221;
(1965). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I knew it would be a lot of fun,&#8221; Funicello wrote of her
first movie. &#8220;But never in a million years did I or anyone else
associated with the film dream it would evolve into such a
timeless gem of pop-culture Americana.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She and Avalon co-hosted a failed TV music-variety show in
1976 called &#8220;Easy Does It.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of her final performances, she and Avalon returned
to the screen in &#8220;Back to the Beach&#8221; (1987), playing parents
visiting their surf-loving daughter in California. She was
diagnosed with MS while making the film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think you only have two choices in this kind of
situation,&#8221; she said in making her diagnosis public in 1992.
&#8220;Either you give in to it or you fight it. I intend to fight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She made few public appearances in subsequent years. To
help in the fight against the disease, she created the Annette
Funicello Research Fund for Neurological Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funicello was married to Jack Gilardi, her manager, from
1965 until their divorce in 1981. They had a daughter, Gina, and
two sons, Jack Jr. and Jason. She married horse trainer Glen
Holt in 1986. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) investors risk
shortening Jamie Dimon&#8217;s tenure as chief executive officer if
they appoint a separate chairman to help lead the bank,
according to Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the board is forced by a shareholder vote to strip
Jamie Dimon of his chairman&#8217;s role, then shareholders may find
that Jamie Dimon decides to move on, maybe not immediately but
within the year,&#8221; Peabody wrote in a note to clients today.
&#8220;If that were to occur, is there someone with Mr. Dimon&#8217;s
talents capable of stepping into the breach?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls for Dimon, 57, to give up the chairmanship have been
building since the bank disclosed risk-control lapses on
derivatives bets last year that fueled more than $6.2 billion in
losses. In March, the New York-based firm&#8217;s board urged
investors to vote against naming a separate chairman at the next
shareholder meeting, saying that Dimon&#8217;s dual role remains the
&#8220;most effective leadership model.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon told investors in February that he wouldn&#8217;t have
agreed to take a previous job, leading Bank One Corp., if the
board hadn&#8217;t given him both roles, Peabody recalled. JPMorgan
acquired Bank One in 2004 to create the company it is today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit is
joining firms from Ares Capital Corp. (ARCC) to Fifth Street Finance
Corp. (FSC) in raising about $2 billion to lend to companies unable to
tap public markets as investors seek to extract high yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Liberty Harbor Capital LLC, which is
organized as a so-called business-development company and
primarily lends to companies earning less than $75 million,
plans to raise money in an initial public offering, according to
a March 29 regulatory filing. Last week, New York-based Ares
Capital, the largest BDC, raised about $290 million by selling
shares, while Garrison Capital Inc. completed its IPO. Fifth
Street Finance said it may raise $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flurry underscores the lengths investors are willing to
go to in order to generate returns as the Federal Reserve keeps
benchmark interest rates near zero for a fifth year. While the
debt the BDCs are buying generate yields of 10 percent or more,
it doesn&#8217;t typically trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banks have largely abandoned the field in direct lending
to the mid-market and it&#8217;s been taken over in the last few years
by BDCs and private funds,&#8221; Nicholas Marshi, the chief
investment officer at Southland Capital Management, said in a
telephone interview from Santa Monica, California. Marshi
manages funds that invest in BDCs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collateralized loan obligations will
raise $3 billion to $5 billion in Europe this year, according to
a forecast from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLO formation in the region will increase global issuance
to as much as $75 billion, JPMorgan analysts led by London-based
Rishad Ahluwalia wrote in an April 5 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread for the AAA rated portion of European CLOs may
be at about 120 basis points by the end of 2013, according to
the research report, which cited the results of a survey from 81
clients. For U.S. deals, the respondents see spreads at 90 basis
points to 100 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo Global Management LLC and Pramerica Investment
Management Ltd. are marketing European CLOs which may price the
top-ranked notes at about 135 basis points more than the euro
interbank offered rate, people with knowledge of the matter
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based Cairn Capital Ltd. sold its 300.5 million-euro
deal in February with the AAA piece at 140 basis points more
than Euribor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) doesn&#8217;t
have to face Capmark Financial Group Inc.&#8217;s $147 million lawsuit
claiming it was improperly influenced by the bank to refinance
$1.5 billion in unsecured debt in a way that improved its
position as a creditor, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan yesterday
ruled that  Capmark, which sued Goldman in 2011, can&#8217;t recover
the money. Horsham, Pennsylvania-based Capmark claimed the sum
was an insider preference paid to Goldman within a year of the
Capmark bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet said Capmark can&#8217;t claim the presence of a Goldman
employee on its board means that the New York-based bank must
return the $147 million because that argument contradicts its
earlier position in the bankruptcy case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs represented to the Delaware bankruptcy court
that the secured credit facility was negotiated at &#8216;arm&#8217;s
length,&#8217;&#8221; Sweet said in a decision made public today.
&#8220;Plaintiffs now assert a claim that requires the secured credit
facility to have been a non-arms-length transaction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capmark, the commercial lender once a part of the former
General Motors Corp., exited bankruptcy in September 2011, co-
owned by lower-ranking creditors, some of whom fought in
bankruptcy court with Goldman Sachs over the refinancing and the
payments to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Capmark&#8217;s Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capmark claimed that while the bank owned part of it in May
2009, a group of Goldman Sachs units used their influence to
persuade Capmark to refinance $1.5 billion in unsecured debt
owed the firm. The refinancing allowed Goldman Sachs to collect
$147 million, including $7 million in cash, based on the new
secured loan, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Shiff, a lawyer for Capmark, didn&#8217;t immediately return
a voice-mail message seeking comment on Sweet&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capmark filed bankruptcy on Oct. 25, 2009, blaming falling
property values and a drop in lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Capmark Financial Group Inc. (CPMK) v. Goldman Sachs
Credit Partners LP, 11-cv-07511, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) failed to
win dismissal of a lawsuit claiming it engaged in fraud and
racketeering in selling $375 million of residential mortgage-
backed securities to Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton in Newark, New Jersey,
ruled today that Prudential, the second-largest U.S. life
insurer, sufficiently pleaded its claims that Goldman
misrepresented its underwriting standards and practices. Goldman
will have other opportunities to seek dismissal of the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prudential, based in Newark, bought securities from Goldman
in 16 deals, according to Wigenton&#8217;s opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, based in New York, asked the judge to dismiss the
complaint, arguing that Prudential didn&#8217;t adequately state its
case for fraud and racketeering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wigenton disagreed, ruling that Prudential &#8220;adequately
pled a cause of action for fraud&#8221; and sufficiently stated its
case that Goldman Sachs violated New Jersey&#8217;s civil anti-
racketeering statute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchases were made from February 2004 to December
2008, according to the opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties have not yet engaged in the pretrial exchange
of evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Scot
Hoffman, a Prudential spokesman, declined to comment on the
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also argued that New York law, not New Jersey
law, applies to the fraud and RICO claims. Wigenton ruled that
&#8220;determining a choice of law at this stage is premature&#8221;
regarding fraud claims. She made a similar ruling with regard to
the Goldman Sachs motion on the racketeering claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Prudential Insurance Co. v. Goldman Sachs 
Company, 2:12-cv-06590, U.S. District Court, District of New
Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the nation&#8217;s
biggest home lender, sold servicing rights to $12.2 billion of
reverse mortgages to Walter Investment Management Corp. (WAC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loans are owned by Fannie Mae, and Wells Fargo will
continue to service other reverse-mortgage loans in its
portfolio, Vickee Adams, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco-
based bank, said in an e-mail. Terms weren&#8217;t disclosed in a
statement today from Tampa, Florida-based Walter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo was ranked as the largest U.S. residential
mortgage servicer at the end of December, with contracts on
$1.87 trillion in unpaid home loans. The bank said in 2011 that
it would stop originating reverse mortgages. Today&#8217;s transaction
won&#8217;t significantly affect  earnings, Adams said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo&#8217;s decision to exit the business was tied to the
possibility that home values would fall, according to its
statement at the time. Prices declined 5.3 percent from the end
of that month through March last year before rebounding 9
percent through January, according to the SP/Case-Shiller index
of data from 20 U.S. cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s transaction, which involves 76,000 loans, will
double the size of Walter&#8217;s serviced book and be completed in
the third quarter, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reverse-mortgage lenders issue loans to homeowners and
accept real estate equity as collateral, allowing borrowers, age
62 or older, to remain in their homes and receive either a lump-
sum payment or a stream of income. Mortgage servicers handle
billing and collections on behalf of lenders or investors that
own the loans and oversee foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change, applying to independent travelers not on an
organized tour, is effective from May 1 and means a visitor can
return within two years without repeating the visa application
proocess, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group representing Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT), Expedia Inc. (EXPE) and Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) filed an antitrust complaint
against Google Inc. (GOOG) over its Android operating system as part of
a campaign to force the European Union to fine or alter the
conduct of the owner of the world&#8217;s largest search engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FairSearch, a group of 17 technology and search companies,
said the EU should investigate Google&#8217;s &#8220;deceptive conduct to
lockout competition&#8221; in the mobile market with a goal to
&#8220;cement its control over consumer Internet data for online
advertising as usage shifts to mobile.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Google is using its Android mobile operating system as a
&#8216;Trojan Horse&#8217; to deceive partners, monopolize the mobile
marketplace, and control consumer data,&#8221; said Thomas Vinje, a
lawyer in Brussels who represents the FairSearch industry group.
&#8220;Failure to act will only embolden Google to repeat its desktop
abuses of dominance as consumers increasingly turn to a mobile
platform dominated by Google&#8217;s Android.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is already investigating Google&#8217;s search business
and the Mountain View, California-based company&#8217;s rivals have
made nearly weekly entreaties to the EU to take some action.
TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP) and Expedia led a group in March that wrote to
EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, and Microsoft days
later sent the EU a study questioning Google&#8217;s search results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to work cooperatively with the European
Commission,&#8221; Al Verney, a Brussels-based spokesman for Google,
said in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for Almunia, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mobile Dominance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to FairSearch, Google&#8217;s Android system was used
as a smartphone operating system in 70 percent of handset units
shipped at the end of 2012. Google also dominates mobile search
advertising with 96 percent of the market, said FairSearch,
citing eMarketer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft already has an antitrust complaint against Google
pending with the Brussels-based commission, alleging the company
promotes its own specialist search services, copies rivals&#8217;
travel and restaurant reviews, and discriminates against rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. ended an investigation into Google&#8217;s search
business in January, saying there was no evidence that the
company&#8217;s actions harmed consumers. The commission, the EU&#8217;s
antitrust regulator, is seeking a deal with Google to end its
more than two-year-old probe into antitrust concerns with the
company&#8217;s search business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Copied Reviews &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia last year asked Google to give him a detailed offer
to address allegations that it copies rivals&#8217; travel and
restaurant reviews, and has agreements with websites and
software developers that stifle competition in the advertising
industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After receiving Google&#8217;s settlement offer in January,
Almunia said he hoped to check it with rivals and customers &#8220;in
the coming months&#8221; and finalize it later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said in an interview with the New York Times
published yesterday that he expects new proposals from Google
this week to help with concerns over its search practices and
any changes the company proposed would be submitted to
competitors for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said the company needed to offer the commission a
solution where choices between Google-branded search results and
those of its competitors were clearly visible within the search
engine both on desktop computers and on mobile devices, the
Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rising stock prices, rebounding profits, restored dividends and a growing economy are signaling to U.S. banks it&#8217;s time for more job cuts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even after the industry posted its best results since 2006, the six largest U.S. banks announced plans in the first three months of this year to eliminate about 21,000 positions, or 1.8 percent of their combined workforce, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the most since 2011&#8217;s third quarter. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), whose 259,000 people produced three straight years of record profit, topped the list with 17,000 reductions scheduled by the end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banks are under pressure to keep profit climbing amid weak revenue growth, and employees are among the biggest expenses after interest costs. The most vulnerable people work in units where demand is waning such as mortgage foreclosures. Their departures would come on top of 320,000 jobs culled from U.S. financial companies in the past five years, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have a better feel for what their business model looks like and they are starting to align headcount,&#8221; said Robert Dicks, a principal at Deloitte  Touche LLP in New York who advises financial firms on staffing. &#8220;We were out of whack for a couple of years, but we&#8217;re balanced right now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks are boosting sales of
structured notes based on derivative bets similar to those that
cost JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) more than $6 billion in the so-called
London Whale loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordea Bank AB (NDA), SEB AB and BNP Paribas SA (BNP) sold more than
$60 million of notes this year tied to portions of credit-
default swap indexes protecting against losses on company debt.
The tranches offer investors varying degrees of risk among a
pool of companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil became known as the London
Whale because of the size of his trades in tranches of the
Markit iTraxx CDX North American Investment Grade index of
swaps. Nordea and SEB&#8217;s structured notes are mainly linked to
portions of the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of investment-grade
companies and the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index, which tracks
mainly junk-rated companies in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sophisticated investors should run far and fast from
this,&#8221; said Janet Tavakoli, founder of Chicago-based consulting
firm Tavakoli Structured Finance Inc. Wealthy individuals, who
are the main buyers of the securities, are unlikely to
understand all the risks they are taking or be appropriately
compensated for them, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuers of the notes generate income by selling default
insurance on portions of the credit indexes that have various
levels of risk and reward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;iTraxx Europe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordea sold $35.5 million of notes tied to the 4 percent to
12 percent tranche of the latest series of the Markit iTraxx
Europe index. That means investors start losing money when
losses on the index reach 4 percent, and that they&#8217;re wiped out
when they exceed 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes pay as much as 5 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The largest Nordic lender also issued
46.1 million Norwegian kroner ($8 million) of securities
yesterday linked to the 10 percent to 100 percent tranche of the
Crossover index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are looking for additional yield through
leverage and these notes are one way of achieving that,&#8221; said
Antti Parviainen, head of investment products for Finland at
Nordea in Helsinki. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in the note linked to the Crossover tranche would
start losing money when eight companies on the index default,
according to Abel Elizalde, European credit derivatives
strategist at Citigroup Inc. in London. His calculations are
based on a 40 percent recovery rate, the amount bondholders
would get back in a default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Significant Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured notes tied to index tranches can have
&#8220;significantly higher&#8221; risks than notes tied to whole indexes
or single companies, said Elizalde. Potential returns on the
securities can also be higher, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norwegian papermaker Norske Skogindustrier ASA (NSG) is the
company in the Crossover index with the highest perceived risk
of failure, with credit-default swap prices signaling an 82
percent chance the company won&#8217;t be able to meet its liabilities
within the next five years, Bloomberg data show. Spanish gaming
company Codere SA has an 78 percent probability of default,
swaps show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global speculative-grade default rate is forecast to
end this year at 2.8 percent, compared with an average of 4.7
percent since 1983, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEB also sold notes tied to tranches of the Markit&#8217;s iTraxx
Europe and Crossover indexes, said Holger Cassens, head of
structured derivatives at SEB&#8217;s German unit in Frankfurt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Capital Protection &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stockholm-based lender issued 5 million euros ($6.5
million) of notes in November that are linked to the 12 percent
to 50 percent tranche of the Crossover index and pay 8.75
percent, Bloomberg data show. Investors&#8217; capital is protected
for up to five credit events, after which their principal will
be reduced by 5 percent for every additional credit event, said
Cassens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also sold $6.2 million of five-year notes on Feb.
12 linked to the 16 percent to 35 percent tranche of the Markit
CDX North American High Yield Index, Bloomberg data show. The
securities were sold via two offerings in dollars and euros with
coupons of 6 percent and 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Demand is rising for these notes because investors get
more attractive yields and they are protected for a few credit
events,&#8221; said Cassens. &#8220;You can&#8217;t predict what will happen in
the future, but so far clients feel comfortable with the
buffer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sold the first structured
notes tied to a credit default-swap index tranche in November
2005, when it issued 15 million euros of 10-year securities tied
to the 3 percent to 6 percent portion of the fourth series of
the Markit iTraxx Europe Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes were unsecured and investors lost their money
when the U.S. bank collapsed in September 2008. Note holders
would be creditors in bankruptcy proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s after-sales
service of its Surface tablet has attracted criticism from
China&#8217;s state-owned radio, following similar reports in the past
month targeting Apple Inc. (AAPL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Surface Pro should follow the nation&#8217;s law requiring
notebook computers to have a one-year repair warranty for the
whole device and a two-year warranty for main parts, as compared
with the company&#8217;s one-year pledge for both, China National
Radio reported yesterday. Joanna Li, a Beijing-based spokeswoman
for Microsoft, said she couldn&#8217;t immediately comment on the
report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criticism by China National Radio may be the opening
shot against the world&#8217;s largest software maker, similar to what
Apple faced in the past month, said Doug Young, author of the
book &#8220;The Party Line: How the Media Dictates Public Opinion in
Modern China.&#8221; After a March 15 report by China Central
Television criticized Apple&#8217;s customer service, the People&#8217;s
Daily published more than a dozen articles on the subject. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It sounds potentially worrisome; it looks a copycat of
the whole Apple thing,&#8221; Young said. China National Radio &#8220;is
trying to jump on the same bandwagon,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most western companies already provide much better after-
sales service than Chinese companies, Young said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) will sponsor Augusta National Golf Club&#8217;s Masters
tournament for the 12th straight year later this week, even as
Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty waits for a public
invitation to join the formerly all-male organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augusta National has historically invited IBM&#8217;s CEOs to
join its ranks, though not necessarily when they first take the
job. Rometty, who became the company&#8217;s first female chief in
2012, found herself at the center of a controversy last year
over the club&#8217;s exclusion of women. Under pressure to change its
rules, the club invited two women to join after the last
tournament was held. Rometty, 55, wasn&#8217;t among them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty, whose company has sponsored the Masters since
2002, will probably receive an invite eventually, said Hayes Roth, chief marketing officer for Landor Associates, a global
branding and design firm. Still, Augusta National may not be in
a hurry to give her a green jacket -- the symbol of membership
in the 80-year-old club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s an equal-rights issue anymore because
they admitted a couple women,&#8221; Roth said. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s Augusta
playing by its own arcane rules, as always, and they have
nothing to gain by playing into the controversy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reached an
agreement with an investor for the second straight year to drop
a proposal from its annual meeting that called for an
independent board chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank instead will give expanded
responsibilities to its lead independent director, James Schiro,
who will set the board&#8217;s agenda and write his own letter to
shareholders in the annual proxy statement, New York-based
Goldman Sachs said. In exchange, shareholder CtW Investment
Group will withdraw a proposal to split the roles of chief
executive officer and chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a constructive engagement with our
shareholders, and believe that the enhancements we have made
further solidify the independence of the board,&#8221; David Wells, a
Goldman Sachs spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal allows CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, who also has
been chairman since he took control in 2006, to avoid a battle
over dual roles that JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Jamie Dimon, 57,
faces. That bank&#8217;s board urged investors to vote against naming
a separate chairman at next month&#8217;s shareholder meeting, saying
Dimon&#8217;s dual role remains the &#8220;most effective leadership
model.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, 54, and Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC)&#8217;s John Stumpf, 59, hold both the CEO and chairman titles.
Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. have different people
in the two roles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dish Network Corp. (DISH) Chairman Charlie Ergen has accumulated a record $10 billion in cash, leaving
investors to speculate whether he&#8217;s setting his sights on a
takeover of T-Mobile USA Inc. or a merger with rival DirecTV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The satellite-TV service tripled its cash balance during
the past year by selling debt, including a $2.3 billion offering
last week, amid a planned wireless expansion that already
prompted a bid for Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) Ergen&#8217;s $16.4 billion company
now has the most money among U.S. television and phone
providers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ergen&#8217;s cash stockpile -- about the same as Exxon Mobil
Corp.&#8217;s -- puts a deal for Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile within
reach, said Guggenheim Partners LLC, which would finally let
Ergen bundle a nationwide wireless-phone network with his pay-TV
system. He may also seek to merge with DirecTV and build a
wireless network using spectrum he already owns, according to
Standard  Poor&#8217;s. Smaller deals, such as snatching MetroPCS
Communications Inc. away from Deutsche Telekom or buying Leap
Wireless International Inc., are other possibilities, according
to Macquarie Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question remains: What are they going to do with this
ample liquidity?&#8221; Tuna Amobi, a New York-based equity analyst

anything, really, knowing Charlie.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in San Francisco slid
against futures as Chevron Corp. (CVX) prepared the crude unit at the
Richmond refinery for startup after an eight-month shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond plant was cleared by
state regulators April 5 to resume service at the No. 4 crude
unit, shut since a fire Aug. 6. The refinery was performing a
&#8220;pre-startup safety review&#8221; of the equipment last week, Nigel Hearne, the refinery&#8217;s manager, said in an April 5 letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco
weakened 1 cent against futures traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange to a premium of 9.5 cents a gallon at 3:59
p.m. New York time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The fuel
gained yesterday to the highest level against futures since Feb.
6 after Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)&#8217;s Martinez refinery was said to
shut units for maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Richmond refinery has been producing fuel at about half
its capacity since the fire damaged a tower at the crude unit.
Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, expects the unit to
restart this quarter, Melissa Ritchie, a company spokeswoman in
Richmond, said by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in Los Angeles climbed 2 cents against futures to a
premium of 7.5 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for Carbob in San Francisco versus the fuel in
Los Angeles narrowed 3 cents to 2 cents a gallon, the smallest
in a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diesel Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend diesel in San Francisco was unchanged
against ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures on the Nymex at a
premium of 7 cents a gallon. Diesel in Los Angeles held at 5
cents a gallon above futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Portland, Oregon, low-sulfur diesel dropped 3 cents to
an 11-cent-a-gallon premium versus ULSD futures. Gasoline there
gained 1.5 cents against gasoline futures to a premium of 5
cents a gallon, the highest level since Feb. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles dropped for the
first time in three days, narrowing by $2.23 to $16.40 a barrel
at 4:07 p.m. New York time. The spread, a rough indicator of
refinery profit margins, hit a one-year low of $3.86 a barrel in
December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s
largest entertainment company, cut 150 jobs from its film studio
as part of a cost review, according to a person with knowledge
of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firings amount to about 2 percent of the unit&#8217;s 7,000
jobs, said the person, who sought anonymity because the number
isn&#8217;t being publicly announced. Burbank, California-based Disney
announced the action in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firings took place across various studio operations.
Disney has been releasing fewer films and selling fewer DVDs.
The cuts are in addition to those made earlier this year in its
interactive businesses, where console-based video games have
lost ground to mobile and Facebook games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As part of an ongoing review to ensure that the studios&#8217;
operational structure and economics align with the demands of
the current marketplace, we have made the difficult decision to
reduce our staffing levels in several divisions of the studio,&#8221;
the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is releasing 10 movies in 2013, down from 38 a
decade ago, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. Sales from
the home-entertainment unit, part of the film studio, fell 9
percent to $2.22 billion last year, on a 12 percent drop in
units, according to the company&#8217;s annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company finished fiscal 2012 with 166,000 employees
overall, up 6.4 percent. Disney earned $5.68 billion on sales of
$42.3 billion in the 12 months ended Sept. 29, a second year of
record profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the company, Disney closed its Junction Point
Studios video-game operation in Austin, Texas, in January and
announced April 3 it was reducing staff at the games unit of
recently acquired Lucasfilm Ltd. to focus on licensing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from interactive games and subscriptions dropped 20
percent to $613 million in the latest fiscal year, reflecting a
29 percent decrease in games for console-based systems such as
Sony Corp.&#8217;s PlayStation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, has been making new
all-time highs in recent days. The stock gained 1.1 percent to
$59.80 at 1:04 p.m. in New York and had advanced 19 percent this
year as of yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yen weakening to 130 per dollar
isn&#8217;t an unreasonable prospect given the Bank of Japan&#8217;s intent
to beat deflation and double the nation&#8217;s monetary base,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Jonathan Beinner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think this is a real change in policy and that it will
be effective in weakening the yen,&#8221; Beinner, Goldman Sachs
Asset Management&#8217;s chief investment officer of global fixed
income, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market
Makers&#8221; with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhl. The yen at 130
&#8220;is not an unreasonable place to be. I&#8217;m not looking for that
in the very near term. But that is a distinct possibility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen last traded at 130 to the dollar in April 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BOJ said April 4 it will double monthly bond buying to
7.5 trillion yen ($76 billion), while suspending a cap on
holdings and ending a three-year maturity limit on purchases.
The government&#8217;s goal of 2 percent inflation is achievable in
two years, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters. Japan is
struggling to pull out of its third recession in the past five
years and 15 years of deflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Japan&#8217;s 10-year government notes tumbled to a
record low of 0.325 percent on April 5 before rebounding. The
yen has dropped 6.8 percent since the BOJ decision, reaching
99.77 per dollar, the weakest since April 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year note yield rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 0.58 percent in New York trading today,
while the yen weakened 0.7 percent to 99.75 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Early Sign &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle Bass, whose Dallas-based hedge-fund firm Hayman
Advisors LP made $500 million in 2007 betting against U.S.
subprime mortgages, said on Bloomberg Television yesterday
Japanese government bondholders&#8217; reaction, with yields sliding
and rebounding, is an early sign of a market collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Beinner also saw some concern for Japanese
government bonds as the BOJ follows the Federal Reserve&#8217;s
strategy of buying bonds to stimulate the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The markets really went haywire,&#8221; Beinner said today.
The Bank of Japan &#8220;means what they say, that they want to get 2
percent inflation. They are trying to out-Fed the Fed. You are
seeing markets just not even know how to handle that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed has purchased more than $2.5 trillion of bonds
since 2008 in its quantitative-easing strategy and is currently
buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt a month.
The central bank has kept its target rate for overnight loans
between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term Treasury yields are well below where models based
on the pace of economic growth would project because of the
amount of debt the Fed has purchased, raising the risk of a
&#8220;bubble&#8221;, Beinner said. Treasury 10-year notes yielded 1.78
percent today, below the 10-year average of 3.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If there is a bubble, it&#8217;s the government-bond market
that&#8217;s a bubble, not the credit market,&#8221; Beinner said. &#8220;Even
though the short-term interest rate is at zero, and obviously
the economy is not booming, yet we think the existence of
quantitative easing and huge purchase by the Fed at the long end
has probably driven rates down 100 to 150 basis points more than
they would be even given the current economic environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said its Surface
Pro tablet and all other products meet or exceed warranty laws
in China, denying a report in state media that its coverage of
the device falls short of local requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent with Chinese law, Surface Pro and its main
components are covered under a two-year warranty, Microsoft said
in an e-mailed response to questions, sent through Graham Norris
at Ogilvy Public Relations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China National Radio on April 8 reported the company had a
one-year pledge for the Surface Pro. That followed a March 15
report by China Central Television that criticized Apple Inc.&#8217;s
customer service, which was followed by more than a dozen
similarly themed articles in the People&#8217;s Daily newspaper in the
past few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We stand behind our products with a manufacturer&#8217;s
warranty, which is additional to our commitment to honor any
statutory obligation as either a manufacturer or retailer, to
repair or replace a faulty product,&#8221; Microsoft said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, began selling
Surface tablets in China in October. The company&#8217;s first global
sale of the device was done in Beijing as it wooed local
consumers frustrated by long waits for Apple devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turn in the gold price cycle is accelerating after a 12-year rally as the recovery in the U.S. economy gains momentum, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which reduced forecasts for the metal through 2014. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank cut its three-month target to $1,530 an ounce from $1,615 and lowered the six- and 12-month predictions to $1,490 and $1,390 from $1,600 and $1,550. Goldman recommended closing a long Comex gold position initiated on Oct. 11, 2010 for a potential gain of $219 an ounce, analysts Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gold dropped 5.8 percent this year on speculation that the Federal Reserve may pare its stimulus amid an economic recovery. The gold price is in bubble territory, Societe Generale SA said in an April 2 report. Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund backed by bullion, declined to about 1,200 metric tons yesterday, the least since June 2011. Deutsche Bank AG cut its 2013 gold outlook yesterday by 12 percent, citing a strengthening dollar and a lack of haven buying. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite resurgence in euro-area risk aversion and disappointing U.S. economic data, gold prices are unchanged over the past month, highlighting how conviction in holding gold is quickly waning,&#8221; the Goldman analysts wrote in the report. &#8220;While higher inflation may be the catalyst for the next gold cycle, this is likely several years away.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gold for June delivery on the Comex in New York fell 0.5 percent to $1,579.30 an ounce as of 8:52 a.m. local time. The metal advanced 1.1 percent in March, the first monthly gain since September, as policy makers wrangled over Cyprus&#8217;s 10 billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Targets Cut &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman cut its 2013 gold estimate to $1,545 an ounce from $1,610, trimmed its 2014 forecast to $1,350 from $1,490, and set year-end targets of $1,450 in 2013 and $1,270 in 2014. Goldman recommended starting a short Comex gold position, targeting $1,450 with a stop at $1,650, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Futures averaged a record $1,671 last year and the 12 straight annual gains in London were the best run in at least nine decades. Bullion will fall to $1,375 by the end of the year as a U.S. recovery leads to rising interest rates, Societe Generale said in the April 2 report. Credit Suisse Group AG cut its 2013 estimate by 9.2 percent to $1,580 a day later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse, Societe Generale, Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) and BNP Paribas SA are among banks predicting lower average prices in 2014 than this year. While Deutsche Bank lowered its 2013 gold forecast to $1,637 yesterday, it still expects prices to average $1,810 next year. Bullion futures climbed to an all- time high of $1,923.70 in September 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;ETP Holdings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holdings in exchange-traded products have shrunk 7.6 percent this year, compared with gains in silver, platinum and palladium, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They were 2,432.3 tons yesterday, compared with an all-time high of 2,632.5 tons in December. Speculators held a net-long gold position of 47,164 contracts in the week ended April 2, down 76 percent from October, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe a sharp rebound in gold prices is unlikely,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;The fall in prices could end up being faster and larger than our forecast, as aggregate speculative net long positions across Comex futures and gold ETFs remain near record highs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Ambereen Choudhury and Elisa Martinuzzi" date="Apr 10, 2013  5:26 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-10/bank-of-america-hires-former-goldman-sachs-banker-luigi-rizzo.html"><headline>Bank of America Hires Former Goldman Sachs Banker Luigi Rizzo</headline><body>

selective hires after freeing payroll by cutting more than 30
employees, said a person with knowledge of the strategy in
March. It has also been overhauling and adding to its
investment-banking team in Europe following the exits of Andrea Orcel as chairman of global banking and markets and Jonathan Moulds, the firm&#8217;s president of Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank last year hired Alex Wilmot-Sitwell from UBS AG (UBSN) as
president of its European division and Diego De Giorgi, chief
operating officer of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment-banking
division, as joint head of global corporate and investment
banking for Europe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Websites critical of a settlement
that Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) reached with retailers over
so-called swipe fees are misleading and must be corrected, a
federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sites contain &#8220;bad information&#8221; that may have caused
some retailers to drop out of the settlement, U.S. District
Judge John Gleeson said today in Brooklyn, New York. He gave the
parties a week to decide on changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to belabor this with you,&#8221; Gleeson told
Jeffrey Shinder, a lawyer representing retail trade associations
that established the sites and have opposed the settlement.
&#8220;I&#8217;m just talking about basic fairness.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites at issue include Merchantsobject.com and home sites
for the trade groups National Community Pharmacists Association,
National Grocers Association and the National Association of
Convenience Stores, among others, according to court filings
submitted by the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sites provide one-sided information encouraging
retailers to object and opt out and don&#8217;t fully explain
consequences of those actions, the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers said.
While opting out allows merchants to pursue their own lawsuits
against the credit card firms, it deprives them of the ability
to receive payments for damages under the settlement, the
lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prominent Placement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Merchantsobject site also fails to give prominent
placement to a link to the official, court-approved source of
information about the deal, paymentcardsettlement.com, the
lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The non-court-approved websites appear to be causing
actual confusion among class members,&#8221; said Bonny E. Sweeney, a
lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, in a declaration filed with the
court. Since the sites went live, dozens of form objections have
been filed by merchants apparently using the sites, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is currently difficult to know whether these class
members intended to opt-out, but did not send the required
letter or whether these class members only meant to object to
the settlement, but picked the &#8217;wrong&#8217; sample document provided
on the various websites,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retail Leaders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s hearing came after the Retail Industry Leaders
Association announced it would opt out and object to the deal,
which may be worth as much as $7.25 billion. The accord,
estimated to be the largest-ever antitrust settlement, would end
a case over claims that the card companies conspired with banks
to fix the fees charged to merchants when customers pay with
plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several retail groups have opposed the settlement since it
was made public in July, alleging that it doesn&#8217;t provide enough
benefit for merchants and gives card companies too much leeway
to raise rates. Retailers including Target Corp. (TGT), Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT), and Home Depot Inc. (HD) have spoken out against the
accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not think the sites were misleading or that they
misled anyone to object or opt-out,&#8221; said Shinder, in an e-
mailed statement following the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do care deeply about the integrity of this process,
and per the court&#8217;s order, will endeavor to work with class
counsel&#8221; to ensure it is &#8220;crystal clear that those who
submitted objections from those sites did so because they
believe the settlement is a bad deal,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyle Beckwith, a government relations representative for
the National Association of Convenience Stores, one of the
groups behind the Merchantsobject site, called the request for
changes &#8220;not a big deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nit-Picking &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is just unbelievable nit-picking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We
are standing between attorneys and their $700 million payday and
they don&#8217;t like it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts have previously ruled that the First Amendment does
not prevent judges from supervising communications with absent
class members about proposed settlements, the plaintiffs said in
court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement covers more than 7 million retailers. If a
sizable percentage chooses to opt out, Visa and MasterCard could
have an option to back out of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gleeson granted preliminary approval to the deal in
November. A hearing on final approval is scheduled for
September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a producer of
metallurgical coal in the U.S. and Canada, advanced in post-
market trading after reporting steelmaking coal sales increased
17 percent during the first quarter from the year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter shares jumped 5.7 percent to $25.50 at 5:26 p.m. in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical coal sales rose to 2.8 million metric tons in
the first quarter, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said in
a statement after the close of regular trading today. Average
first-quarter prices &#8220;are expected to improve slightly,&#8221;
compared with the previous quarter, the company said.  Walter
received $149 a metric ton on average in the fourth quarter, the
company said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment adviser Audley Capital Advisors LLP has
nominated five new members to Walter&#8217;s board, saying the current
board has taken on too much debt and failed to create
shareholder value. Shareholders will vote for directors at the
company&#8217;s annual meeting on April 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is scheduled to report first-quarter results on
May 2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) tumbled the most in
more than a year after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
software maker is struggling with slack personal-computer sales
and its push into consumer devices has failed to gain traction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a note to investors today, Heather Bellini, a New York-
based analyst at Goldman Sachs, recommended that investors sell
the stock. She downgraded the shares from a neutral rating.
Since yesterday, at least two other analysts have also reduced
their ratings on shares of the world&#8217;s largest software company,
based in Redmond, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lackluster corporate demand for Microsoft&#8217;s new Windows 8
operating system helped send PC shipments plummeting 14 percent
worldwide in the first quarter, according to IDC, making it the
worst quarter since the researcher starting tracking sales.
Consumers are also increasingly opting to forgo PCs in favor of
smartphones and tablet machines, markets where Microsoft&#8217;s
offerings are selling poorly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company faces critical secular challenges given the
deteriorating PC demand backdrop,&#8221; Bellini wrote. Financial
results will &#8220;gradually deteriorate unless Microsoft
successfully repositions itself as a more meaningful participant
in the new era of consumer compute.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets and the top investment bank by fees, is
questioning the so-called universal bank model&#8217;s future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-tier investment banks are &#8220;uninvestable at this point
with a risk of spinoff from universal banks,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts
led by London-based Kian Abouhossein wrote in a research note
today. They cited potential rule changes and curbs on capital
and funding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should avoid Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), once the
world&#8217;s most profitable securities firm, and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK),
Germany&#8217;s largest bank, because of pressure on earnings and the
unknown impact of new regulations, according to the report. Both
firms rank among the biggest sales and trading rivals for New
York-based JPMorgan, which isn&#8217;t mentioned in the report. The
bank is scheduled to report first-quarter results tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the analysts favor UBS AG (UBSN) and Credit Suisse Group
AG (CSGN), Switzerland&#8217;s first and second-largest banks, and New York-
based Morgan Stanley, owner of the world&#8217;s biggest brokerage,
because of their restructuring potential and ability to release
capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-banking revenue will continue at 2005 and 2006
levels and will be led by fixed-income, currencies and
commodities, which will account for half of the industry&#8217;s sales
by 2015, JPMorgan&#8217;s analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Retail Industry Leaders
Association said it will opt out of a multibillion-dollar
antitrust settlement with Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) over so-
called swipe fees, calling it a &#8220;bad deal for retailers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade group said in a statement today that it would
forgo damages payouts and object to the agreement, which may be
worth as much as $7.25 billion. The accord, estimated to be the
largest-ever antitrust settlement, would end a case alleging
that the card companies conspired with major banks to fix the
fees charged to merchants when customers pay with plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement &#8220;undermines merchants&#8217; legal rights forever
and fails to restrain the continued growth of swipe fees
increases,&#8221; Deborah White, the Arlington, Virginia-based
association&#8217;s general counsel, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several retail groups have opposed the settlement since it
was made public in July, alleging that it doesn&#8217;t provide enough
benefit for merchants and gives card companies too much leeway
in the future to raise rates. Some large retailers, including
Target Corp. (TGT), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), Home Depot Inc. (HD), have also
spoken out against the accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arguments Today &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge John Gleeson is scheduled to hear
arguments today in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, over
whether a website created by trade groups, Merchantsobject.com,
is misinforming retailers about the settlement. The site
encourages businesses to opt out and object to the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments
Coalition, which represents credit card firms and banks, said
RILA&#8217;s announcement is a &#8220;public relations stunt designed to
distract attention&#8221; from the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gleeson granted preliminary approval to the deal in
November. A hearing on final approval is scheduled for
September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) (MSFT), hurt by a slump in global PC sales, is looking to Israel for innovation from its developers and acquisitions, as well as local startups, according to the company&#8217;s top executive in the country. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are trying to create assets for the company, and we recognize that we are Start-Up Nation and we can provide innovation,&#8221; Yoram Yaacovi, general manager of the Microsoft (MSFT) Israel RD Center, said in an interview in Tel Aviv, referring to the title of a book on the country&#8217;s entrepreneurial culture. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has acquired seven companies and made four strategic investments since 1989 in Israel, where it employs 800 people, including 500 in research and development. These developers are focused on business intelligence for cloud computing, said Yaacovi. Resulting products, such as an Excel tool for the cloud that was integrated into Office 365 BI software, help give companies insight into their data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Business intelligence is an area of double-digit growth&#8221; for the software maker, said Yaacovi. &#8220;We in Israel do all the cloud-based business intelligence for Microsoft. We can envision business intelligence migrating to the cloud and then we will build it in Microsoft.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based software maker is looking for new sources of revenue as falling demand for PCs crimps demand for traditional applications. Global PC shipments fell 14 percent to 76.3 million units in the first quarter, according to Interactive Data Corp. The slump was the steepest since IDC began tracking shipments in 1994. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Technology Advantages &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is important to understand what Microsoft is seeking in Israel,&#8221; said Yaacovi. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a big market and labor isn&#8217;t cheap. What it is looking for is technology advantages and entrepreneurial spirit.&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer describes Israel as Silicon Valley Junior, he added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A system to deliver tailored advertisements to Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search engine and Live Mail was developed in Israel by engineers from YaData, a company Microsoft bought in 2008. Face- recognition technology developed by a small team in Israel is now used in Microsoft&#8217;s Bing, Photo Gallery, and Kinect motion- sensing software, Yaacovi said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft invested more than $700 million in Israeli acquisitions between 2002 and 2009, according to Israel Advanced Technology Industries, a group representing technology companies and related businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Startup Programs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft (MSFT)&#8217;s Israeli purchases include Internet security company Whale Communications, data-organizing specialist Zoomix Data Mastering Ltd. and Gteko, a maker of networking and support software. The company met with more than 600 startups last year in its quest for acquisitions, Yaacovi said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A year ago, Microsoft (MSFT) also began offering a series of four- month &#8220;accelerator&#8221; programs to help startups for the cloud, mobile and online markets. Twenty-three companies have benefited from the courses so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We recognize that we need to be more in touch with startups,&#8221; Yaacovi said. &#8220;We need to speak their language and what better way to bring startups to run on our platform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Startups now on the accelerator program include Screemo, which is developing a cloud-based application to create low-cost advertising campaigns; and WCS Sports, a maker of a system to help owners of sports media rights to give fans personalized video clips and highlight preferred footage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are so many things going on in the accelerator that can be exciting for the future,&#8221; Yaacovi said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Shares Drop &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft stock fell as much as 5 percent in New York after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said personal-computer market-share losses are accelerating and the company&#8217;s push into consumer electronics hasn&#8217;t gained traction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stock was down 4.7 percent at $28.85 as of 9:52 a.m., paring its advance to 8 percent this year, compared with an 11 percent advance for the SP 500 index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft released Windows 8 and the Surface tablet on Oct. 26 to appeal to consumers who are increasingly adopting mobile devices to surf the Internet, access e-mail and store pictures, music, documents and other information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Ilya Arkhipov and Anna Shiryaevskaya" date="Apr 11, 2013  9:49 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-11/rosneft-exxon-weigh-15-billion-lng-plant-to-vie-with-gazprom.html"><headline>Rosneft, Exxon Weigh $15 Billion LNG Plant to Vie With Gazprom</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;OAO Rosneft (ROSN), the world&#8217;s biggest
publicly traded oil producer, is in talks with Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
about building a liquefied natural gas plant to target Asia,
challenging OAO Gazprom (GAZP)&#8217;s weakening export monopoly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LNG project, either on Sakhalin Island or in the
Khabarovsk region on the Pacific coast, may cost $15 billion,
Neil Duffin, Exxon&#8217;s president for development, said today in a
video conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin and
Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putin warned Sechin, a former deputy, to coordinate with
other companies planning LNG projects in the region. OAO
Gazprom&#8217;s monopoly faces a challenge from competitors that want
export rights as they seek to enter the LNG market. Gazprom is
planning a facility in Vladivostok and may expand its own
Sakhalin LNG project, currently Russia&#8217;s only plant for cooling
gas to a liquid for shipment by tanker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;LNG is a magic wand, it is very important for both
Gazprom and Rosneft,&#8221; Valery Nesterov, an oil and gas analyst
at Sberbank Investment Research in Moscow, said by phone.
&#8220;Rosneft can&#8217;t really sit and wait because the window of
opportunity, where there is still uncontracted demand, is
between 2018 and 2022.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putin has ordered the government to consider a &#8220;gradual&#8221;
end to the monopoly on LNG exports as Rosneft and OAO Novatek (NVTK)
are also seeking the right to ship the fuel to markets beyond
the reach of Gazprom&#8217;s pipeline network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Risking Loss&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia, the holder of the world&#8217;s biggest gas reserves,
exports almost all of its gas to Europe through pipelines and
risks losing LNG markets as international competitors increase
capacity, Putin said in February. No final decision has been
made yet on liberalizing Russian LNG exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gazprom&#8217;s export monopoly isn&#8217;t a significant obstacle
for new LNG players,&#8221; Alexander Burgansky, an oil and gas
analyst at Otkritie Capital in Moscow, said by e-mail today.
&#8220;In all likelihood it will be lifted; in case it doesn&#8217;t,
Rosneft could use Gazprom as an export agent for a small fee.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft is discussing construction of a fleet for offshore
projects with STX Group (028670), Sechin said today at the video meeting,
which included Kang Duk Soo, chairman of the South Korean
shipbuilding and shipping group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft may use gas from the Sakhalin-1 project, where it
is working with Exxon, Sechin said earlier today in comments
reported by Interfax and confirmed by Rosneft&#8217;s press service.
Rosneft and Exxon, which are also strategic partners on Russia&#8217;s
Arctic shelf,  plan to complete the study for the LNG plant in
June, Glenn Waller, president of ExxonMobil Russia, said last
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gas Model &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rosneft is copying a business model from international
companies which have gas accounting for 30 percent to 50 percent
of production and reserves,&#8221; Nesterov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gazprom&#8217;s planned Vladivostok LNG plant may start
operations in 2018, while its Sakhalin-2 project is considering
a third production line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novatek, Russia&#8217;s second-biggest gas producer, is
developing the Yamal LNG project in the Russian Arctic with
Total SA. (FP) The plant is set to start producing LNG at the end of
2016. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management, the
investing arm of the largest U.S. bank, is preparing for a
rebound in emerging-market equities in the second half of this
year spurred by improved earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset is buying Korean automaker shares hurt by
investor concern that a weaker yen will limit their ability to
compete against Japanese exporters,Richard Titherington, chief
investment officer and head of emerging markets, said in an
interview yesterday. The company favors consumer discretionary
stocks with &#8220;very low valuations&#8221; and has its biggest
overweight position in China, he said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A strong recovery in the second half&#8221; for emerging
market equities will &#8220;significantly close the gap&#8221; with
developed-nation shares, said Titherington, who manages $47
billion in emerging-market stocks. &#8220;We&#8217;ve entered some of the
Korean auto companies where the share prices have fallen sharply
when the yen has weakened&#8221; on expectation &#8220;that&#8217;s a temporary
headwind,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) has dropped 2.5
percent this year, lagging behind an 8.8 percent surge in the
MSCI World Index (MXWO) of advanced-country stocks, as 58 percent of
developing-nation companies reported worse fourth quarter
earnings than estimated by analysts, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyundai Motor Co. (005380), South Korea&#8217;s biggest automaker,
extended its decline to 8 percent this year as the Japanese yen
reached its weakest level versus the dollar since April 2009
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The yen is around fair value now, so I would expect this
headwind to reverse in the second half of the year,&#8221;
Titherington said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein a $5 million cash bonus to be paid out in three years if he meets certain targets, on top of $21 million in 2012 compensation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The long-term incentive was $3 million last year and $7 million in 2011 when the program began, the New York-based bank said today in a filing. The awards can shrink or grow depending on whether the firm achieves a 10 percent average return on equity and 7 percent average increase in book value per share. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, which already gives a portion of top executives&#8217; pay in restricted stock, have been seeking ways to encourage managers to focus on long-term performance. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s plan gives the board&#8217;s compensation committee, led by former Fannie Mae CEO James A. Johnson, the power to change the awards to so-called named executive officers, or NEOs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our compensation committee may also, in its sole discretion based on its assessment of an individual NEO&#8217;s performance, adjust the amounts that may be paid under this award,&#8221; according to the filing, which says the committee can give from zero to 150 percent of the amount due. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm also granted President Gary D. Cohn a $5 million long-term award this year. Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans and John S. Weinberg got $4 million incentives. Last year, all of the firm&#8217;s executives named in the proxy received $3 million in long-term incentives, down from $7 million for all of the executives in 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Viniar&#8217;s Exception &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the Goldman Sachs awards are initially tied to three-year periods, the board can opt to extend the measurement for another five years. In December, the compensation committee set the performance period for the 2011 incentive pay to end in December 2018 instead of December 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One exception is for David A. Viniar, who retired as chief financial officer at the end of January. He will receive any 2011 incentive pay in January 2014 and any 2012 long-term grant in January 2015, according to today&#8217;s proxy filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board&#8217;s ability to change the long-term incentive measures whenever it wants to, and with respect to any individual it singles out, makes the plan a joke because you can be sure the adjustments that are made will be to give an executive a better chance at getting the money,&#8221; said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan&#8217;s law school and business school. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s top executives also received payouts from funds managed by the firm during the year, including profits, return of money invested, and their portion of the funds&#8217; management fees, known as overrides. Those payouts during 2012 totaled $31.2 million for Blankfein, $25.8 million for Cohn, $22.2 million for Viniar, $21.3 million for Evans, and $9.6 million for Weinberg, according to the proxy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other recipients of such fund distributions included Vice Chairman Michael S. Sherwood with $18.7 million; General Counsel Gregory K. Palm, with $29.7 million; and Chief of Staff John F. W. Rogers, with $9.9 million, the proxy showed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki" date="Apr 12, 2013  4:17 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-12/jpmorgan-profit-increases-33-beats-estimate-on-mortgage-fees.html"><headline>JPMorgan 33% Profit Jump Beats Estimates on Reserve Releases</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s first- quarter profit rose 33 percent to a record on expense reductions and an improvement in consumer credit quality that allowed the bank to boost earnings by reducing loan-loss reserves. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income climbed to $6.53 billion, or $1.59 a share, from $4.92 billion, or $1.19, in the same period a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. Twenty-eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated earnings per share of $1.39 adjusted for a one-time accounting item. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, lifted profit by shrinking expenses 16 percent, as he grappled with a 4 percent reduction in total net revenue. Earnings also were buoyed by a drop in late payments, which helped the consumer bank reduce its loan-loss reserve by $1.2 billion. The shares fell 0.6 percent as some analysts questioned whether JPMorgan can continue posting record earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The reserve releases aren&#8217;t sustainable,&#8221; said Charles Peabody, an analyst with Portales Partners in New York. Profits on interest-bearing investments &#8220;are shrinking still, that&#8217;s not healthy. Mortgage banking is going to get weaker from here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peabody estimates that the reserve releases, a tax-benefit and a one-time accounting adjustment resulted in about 26 cents per share of &#8220;non-quality&#8221; earnings in the quarter, without which JPMorgan would have missed estimates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Carl Levin said he
plans to forward results from his panel&#8217;s nine-month
investigation into JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s record trading loss to
the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission to
review for possible wrongdoing by company executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you say criminal referrals, there will be referrals
to the Justice Department and to the regulators, the Securities
and Exchange Commission,&#8221; Levin, chairman of the Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said today in an
interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Political Capital With Al Hunt.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;ve laid out hundreds of pages of what I consider to
be wrongful practices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee said last month that New York-based JPMorgan,
led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, dodged regulators
and misled investors as losses swelled on a derivatives bet by a
trader known as the London Whale because of the size of his
bets. Managers at JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, manipulated
risk models and pressured traders to overvalue their positions 
in an effort to hide growing losses, according to the 
committee&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, said referrals to the
Justice Department and the SEC are &#8220;fairly routine&#8221; following
a review by his panel and, if staff hasn&#8217;t already sent their
report to investigators, they should. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he wouldn&#8217;t say whether he believed there was
criminal activity at JPMorgan, Levin said, &#8220;I&#8217;m very
disappointed, though, that there has not been action taken
criminally against some of the higher-ups&#8221; on Wall Street,
declining to name individual companies or executives. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore and Christine Harper" date="Apr 12, 2013 12:01 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-12/goldman-sachs-pays-cohn-more-than-evans-in-first-gap-since-2007.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Pays Cohn More Than Evans in First Gap Since 2007</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd C. Blankfein&#8217;s top deputies
are no longer equal in terms of pay at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Gary Cohn, 52, was awarded a $19 million
compensation package, 12 percent more than Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans and John S. Weinberg, according to the New York-
based firm&#8217;s annual proxy filing. The disparity is the first
since 2007, when Blankfein&#8217;s bonus set the record for a Wall
Street chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change may further fuel speculation about which
executive is most likely to succeed Blankfein, 58, who sometimes
out-earned his own boss Henry Paulson. Blankfein, who succeeded
Paulson as Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO in June 2006, said in
a February interview with Bloomberg Television that he has plans
to stay in the top job indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If somebody gets more money that could be a sign&#8221; that
they&#8217;re in the running for the job eventually, said Jeanne Branthover, managing director at Boyden Global Executive Search
in New York. &#8220;A partnership is very big about &#8216;what message are
we giving each partner?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evans, 55, the vice chairman who oversees Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
emerging-markets business, received $17 million, as did
Weinberg, 56, who helps oversee investment banking. David Viniar, who retired as the firm&#8217;s chief financial officer
earlier this year, was awarded $19 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn&#8217;s package for 2012 included a $5.15 million cash
bonus. Evans and Weinberg each got a $4.55 million cash award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance, Roles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differences in pay among the named executive officers, or
NEOs, were &#8220;primarily to reflect their individual performance,
as well as their roles,&#8221; the bank said in the filing. &#8220;No
specific individual performance goals were used by the committee
in making these NEO compensation determinations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein received a larger bonus than his deputies for the
first time since 2007, when he set a Wall Street pay record. All
of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s named executives received no bonus in 2008,
and then got cash and stock awards of $9 million, $18 million
and $10 million over the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein got $21 million for last year, his highest annual
package since 2007, as reported by Bloomberg News in January.
That consisted of $13.3 million in restricted stock and a $5.7
million cash bonus for 2012 in addition to his $2 million
salary, according to today&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made him the highest-paid CEO among those at the 10
largest U.S. banks, exceeding the $9.75 million for Morgan
Stanley (MS)&#8217;s James Gorman and $11.5 million awarded to JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overcoming Opposition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
reported its first revenue gain in three years in 2012, as each
of its four divisions showed an increase last year. The bank&#8217;s
return on equity was 10.7 percent, up from 3.7 percent in 2011
while less than one-third of what the firm earned in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock rose 41 percent in 2012, the first annual
increase since doubling in 2009. While the shares have rallied
16 percent this year, they&#8217;re still 12 percent below their level
at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s compensation committee has been led by
James A. Johnson, a former CEO of Fannie Mae, as long as the
bank has been a public company. Johnson was re-elected to the
board with about 84 percent of the vote at last year&#8217;s
shareholder meeting, overcoming opposition from investment firm
Ruane, Cunniff  Goldfarb Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs cut 900 jobs last year, and compensation
costs rose 6 percent, trailing the 19 percent increase in
revenue. In November, the firm named 70 employees to its so-
called partnership, the fewest in 13 years as a public company,
and said last month that it will start naming managing directors
every two years instead of annually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for plaintiffs in a Visa
Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) antitrust case over interchange fees
asked for final approval of a settlement along with $720 million
in legal fees and $27 million in expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attorneys, representing a class of more than 7 million
merchants, filed papers late yesterday in Brooklyn, New York,
seeking a final blessing for the accord from U.S. District Judge
John Gleeson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, estimated to be the largest ever in an
antitrust case, would provide for about $7.25 billion in cash
payouts, according to a memorandum filed by Robbins Geller
Rudman  Dowd LLP, one of the lead law firms in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the largest-ever cash relief in an antitrust class
action settlement plus unprecedented rules changes that would
enable merchants to recover their costs of credit card
acceptance&#8221; the settlement &#8220;is far more than &#8216;fair, adequate,
and reasonable,&#8217;&#8221; the lawyers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate filing, the lawyer said their request for
attorneys&#8217; fees is reasonable given the complexity of the issues
and the length of time of the eight-year-long case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlement will affect as great a segment of the
United States economy as any previous antitrust class action,&#8221;
lawyers for the plaintiffs said in the filing, noting that about
60 law firms worked on the case. &#8220;Such an extraordinary
settlement could result only from a similarly extraordinary
effort by class counsel and their co-counsel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retailers Opposed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchant trade groups and some large retailers including
Target Corp. (TGT), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), Home Depot Inc. (HD) spoke out
against the accord, claiming it isn&#8217;t large enough and gives
card companies too much leeway to raise fees in the future. The
lawsuit alleged the card companies and some of the country&#8217;s
largest banks conspired to fix prices of fees paid by merchants
when customers pay with plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearing on final approval has been scheduled for
September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and
Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), whose trading
loss of more than $6.2 billion last year was fueled by the
adoption of a formula that understated risks, has adopted yet
another model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said today it employed a new formula to judge the
risk of its credit derivatives position, at least the fourth
such model it&#8217;s used since January 2012. The portfolio was built
by Bruno Iksil, known as the London Whale because his bets were
so big they moved markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank changed its measurement of value at risk, or VaR,
for the credit derivatives book in the first quarter of this
year &#8220;to achieve consistency with like products&#8221; within the
corporate and investment bank, JPMorgan said today in a
supplement. &#8220;This change had an insignificant impact&#8221; to
average VaR for fixed income and the investment bank&#8217;s trading
and credit portfolio, the New York-based bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had previously changed the VaR model, which
estimates the most amount of money a trading position can lose
on 95 percent of the trading days, when the corporate and
investment bank took over most of the credit book from the chief
investment office last year. That change last year reduced
JPMorgan&#8217;s estimated risk by 24 percent to $115 million in the
third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motif Investing Inc., a Web-based
startup that lets investors buy baskets of stocks based on
themes like home improvement and Obamacare, raised $25 million
in a financing round led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darren Cohen, who leads Goldman&#8217;s principal strategic
investments group, is joining Motif&#8217;s board as an observer, the
San Mateo, California-based company said today in a statement.
Existing investors Foundation Capital, Ignition Partners and
Norwest Venture Partners contributed to the round. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2010, Motif is among an increasing number of
startups offering online products for investors that are
designed to lower the cost of trading while avoiding high-
priced, poor-performing mutual funds. Jemstep Inc. and
FutureAdvisor provide asset-allocation advice and help clients
easily make the recommended trades, while Wealthfront Inc.
manages money online by investing in low-fee index funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This space is heating up,&#8221; Hardeep Walia, 40, Motif&#8217;s
chief executive officer, said in an interview. &#8220;If you think
about what we&#8217;ve done in Silicon Valley, we&#8217;ve disrupted so many
businesses, but no one&#8217;s traditionally had luck in financial
services.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motif offers custom-made and user-generated funds of up to
30 stocks for about $10. To date, the company has focused on
providing retail investors an alternative to exchange-traded
funds sold by companies like E*Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC) and Charles
Schwab Corp. (SCHW) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investment Savings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the additional financing, Motif is rolling out the
software to investment advisors, giving them products to offer
clients without management fees attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, brokers could sell a fund created by Motif,
use one created by someone else that&#8217;s available on the site or
establish their own by copying what&#8217;s in a particular mutual
fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That allows them to save the 2 to 3 percent fees they&#8217;re
paying every year to mutual-fund companies,&#8221; Walia said. &#8220;They
can either take that as a reward for their business or pass the
savings along to customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motif has 40 employees, including several early executives
from E*Trade. The company has patent-pending technology that
lowers the cost of volume trading, letting it make &#8220;good
margins&#8221; at $10 a trade, Walia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obamacare, Housing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obamacare motif includes shares of hospitals like HCA
Holdings Inc. (HCA), electronic medical-records providers such as
Cerner Corp. (CERN) and generic-drug maker Actavis Inc. (ACT) The fund is
designed for investors looking to benefit from the Affordable
Care Act, which may extend coverage to 30 million previously
uninsured Americans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s also a motif called Ivy League that follows the
investment strategy of David Swensen, chief investment officer
at Yale University. Other motifs focus on biotechnology
breakthroughs, the natural-gas glut and the housing recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs group leading the investment is part of
the bank&#8217;s securities division and backs financial-technology
startups and market structure-related companies. Previous
investments include the London Metal Exchange and Broadway
Technology LLC, a provider of electronic-trading systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&#8217;s release, Cohen of Goldman Sachs said Motif &#8220;has
taken an innovative approach to traditional investing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s corporate and investment bank set aside 7 percent less money for employee compensation in the first quarter while the division generated 9 percent more revenue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The unit''s $3.38 billion in compensation costs amounted to 34 percent of revenue, excluding accounting adjustments, down from 35 percent a year earlier, according to figures posted today on the New York-based firm&#8217;s website. The pay pool is large enough to give each of the division&#8217;s 51,634 employees $65,383 for the three months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investment banks have faced pressure to cut costs as revenue from trading, advisory and underwriting at the nine largest global firms fell almost 10 percent from 2010 through 2012. Executives have sought to lower compensation-to-revenue ratios while retaining top bankers and traders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We really believe in pay for performance,&#8221; Mike Cavanagh, co-head of JPMorgan&#8217;s corporate and investment bank, told shareholders in February. The bank&#8217;s scale can help it keep that ratio low while offering top employees pay that&#8217;s at least as good as &#8220;anybody else in our industry,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan combined its investment bank with the firm&#8217;s corporate bank and treasury and securities-services units last year, and put Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto in charge of the division. The group has more than twice as many employees as the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. hired Robert Sachs from UBS AG (UBSN) to run a global team that helps hedge funds
raise money from pension plans and other investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs will join as global head of capital introductions and
strategy, reporting to Jon Yalmokas, head of the U.S. prime
brokerage, Stu Hendel, global head of the financing products,
said in a memo to employees obtained by Bloomberg News. He will

&lt;p&gt;John Yiannacopoulos, a spokesman for the Charlotte, North

declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs was global head of capital introductions for the last
four years at UBS and previously worked at New York-based

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Alan Bjerga" date="Apr 13, 2013 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-13/farmworker-accord-on-visas-wages-moves-immigration-bill.html"><headline>Farmworker Accord on Visas, Wages Moves Immigration Bill</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Farm groups agreed on a rolling
visa limit for immigrant farmworkers and minimum wages for
laborers, resolving sticking points on the path toward a broader
rewrite of U.S. immigration law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wages will be set based on labor-market surveys that
distinguish among different farm jobs, and visas for guest
workers will be limited to no more than 337,000 over three
years, according to lobbyists for organizations that resolved
disagreements yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending the discord means growers&#8217; and workers&#8217; groups can
back the legislative effort that will include creating a path to
citizenship for undocumented immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a crucial step as momentum builds toward
introducing a bill to fix&#8221; the immigration system, Senator
Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, said of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growers, including members of the American Farm Bureau
Federation, had sought a higher cap on visas and lower wage
levels than labor organizations such as the United Farmworkers
Union wanted. The broader effort would tighten border security
along with setting up the pathway to legal status for the
nation&#8217;s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement worked out by Senators Dianne Feinstein, a
California Democrat, Bennet and Republicans Marco Rubio of
Florida and Orrin Hatch of Utah also provides &#8220;protections for
U.S. workers,&#8221; Feinstein said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worker Shortage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a shortage of U.S. workers willing and able to
perform farm work,&#8221; the Agriculture Workforce Coalition, a
group of agricultural organizations including the Farm Bureau,
the largest U.S. grower group, said in a statement. &#8220;Securing a
reliable and competent workforce for our nation&#8217;s farms and
ranches is essential to ensuring that American consumers
continue to enjoy abundant and affordable food.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the wage and visa issues, job-advertisement
requirements that farm-owners said were onerous are being
relaxed. Workers will also have the ability to switch employers,
which the farmworkers&#8217; union, the largest for migrant laborers,
indicated was a key protection. U.S. Department of Agriculture
will oversee the program for dispensing three-year guest-worker
visas rather than the Labor Department, a change from current
practice sought by growers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The length of stay will help year-round industries,
including dairy producers, which have chafed at shorter-term
visas under the current H-2A agricultural guest-worker program.
A path to citizenship has also been included, with an expedited
route for workers who agree to remain in farm-related jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Border Protection &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight senators most active in immigration talks also
have agreed on border-protection principles essential to
Republican approval of any plan, according to people familiar
with the talks who asked not to be identified because the
negotiations were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sign that a final legislative proposal is near, the
group of senators canceled a planned meeting April 11, and a
person familiar with the talks said only staff-level work and
bill-drafting remains. The group plans to unveil its proposal
April 16, according to a Senate aide familiar with negotiations.
Both asked not to be identified in speaking about the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, a
Vermont Democrat, said after meeting with members of the group
April 9 that he expects to &#8220;have legislative language to
review&#8221; in time for an April 17 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 25 percent of the U.S. farm workforce, more than
300,000 people, don&#8217;t have valid immigration papers, according
to a 2009 survey by the Pew Hispanic Center. Other studies
suggest the number may be more than 1 million, based on the
seasonality of the work and historical trends. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore and Christine Harper" date="Apr 13, 2013 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-13/goldman-sachs-s-cohn-takes-pay-lead-among-ceo-s-deputies.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Cohn Takes Pay Lead Among CEO''s Deputies</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has started differentiating
among Lloyd C. Blankfein&#8217;s top deputies again after four years
of granting lockstep pay awards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Gary Cohn, 52, was awarded a $19 million
compensation package, 12 percent more than Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans and John S. Weinberg, the New York-based firm said
in an annual proxy. The disparity is the first since 2007, when
Blankfein&#8217;s bonus set the record for a Wall Street chief
executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn&#8217;s pay may fuel speculation about which executive will
succeed Blankfein, 58, who sometimes out-earned his own boss
Henry Paulson. Blankfein, who succeeded Paulson as chairman and
CEO in June 2006, said in a February interview with Bloomberg
Television that he has no immediate plans to depart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If somebody gets more money, that could be a sign&#8221; that
they&#8217;re in the lead to succeed Blankfein, said Jeanne Branthover, managing director at Boyden Global Executive Search
in New York. &#8220;If somebody gets less money it&#8217;s not a good
thing, because they&#8217;ve been equals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evans, 55, the vice chairman who oversees the emerging-
markets business, received $17 million, as did Weinberg, 56, a
co-head of investment banking. David A. Viniar, chief financial
officer until the end of January, was awarded $19 million. The
firm didn&#8217;t disclose 2012 pay for Harvey M. Schwartz, who
replaced Viniar as CFO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Individual Performance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differences in pay among the named executive officers, or
NEOs, were &#8220;primarily to reflect their individual performance,
as well as their roles,&#8221; the bank said in the filing. &#8220;No
specific individual performance goals were used by the committee
in making these NEO compensation determinations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 58, also received a larger bonus than his
deputies for the first time since 2007. None of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
named executives was awarded a bonus for 2008, and each of them
got cash and stock awards of $9 million, $18 million and $10
million over the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein&#8217;s $21 million award for 2012 was his highest
since 2007, as reported by Bloomberg News in January. It
included $13.3 million in restricted stock and a $5.7 million
cash bonus for 2012 in addition to his $2 million salary,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made him the highest-paid CEO among those at the 10
largest U.S. banks, exceeding the $9.75 million for Morgan
Stanley (MS)&#8217;s James Gorman and $11.5 million awarded to JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cash Bonuses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn&#8217;s and Viniar&#8217;s packages for 2012 each included a $5.15
million cash bonus, while Evans and Weinberg each got a $4.55
million cash award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay is higher for all executives if long-term incentive
plan awards are included. The plan will pay $5 million in cash
bonuses to Blankfein and Cohn, and $4 million to Evans and
Weinberg in three years if the firm meets certain targets. The
same rules apply to last year&#8217;s $3 million long-term incentive
and $7 million in 2011, when the plan started. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cash bonuses shrink or grow depending on whether the
firm achieves a 10 percent average return on equity and 7
percent average increase in book value per share. The board&#8217;s
compensation committee, which has been led by former Fannie Mae
CEO James A. Johnson as long as Goldman Sachs has been a public
company, has the power to change the awards. The committee can
give from zero to 150 percent of the amount due, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Goldman Sachs awards are initially tied to three-
year periods, the board can also opt to extend the measurement
for a further five years. In December, the compensation
committee set the performance period for the 2011 incentive pay
to end in December 2018 instead of December 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Money &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board&#8217;s ability to change the long-term incentive
measures whenever it wants to, and with respect to any
individual it singles out, makes the plan a joke because you can
be sure the adjustments that are made will be to give an
executive a better chance at getting the money,&#8221; said Erik
Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan&#8217;s law school
and business school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top executives received payouts from funds managed by the
firm during the year, including profits, return of money
invested, and their portion of the funds&#8217; management fees, known
as overrides. Those payouts during 2012 totaled $31.2 million
for Blankfein, $25.8 million for Cohn, $22.2 million for Viniar,
$21.3 million for Evans, and $9.6 million for Weinberg,
according to the proxy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other recipients of such fund distributions included Vice
Chairman Michael S. Sherwood with $18.7 million; General Counsel
Gregory K. Palm, with $29.7 million; and Chief of Staff John F. W. Rogers, with $9.9 million, the proxy showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results Improve &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reported its first revenue gain in three
years in 2012. Return on equity, a measure of how well the bank
reinvests shareholders&#8217; money, rose to 10.7 percent from 3.7
percent in 2011. Still, it remained at less than one-third of
its 2007 level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock rose 41 percent in 2012, the first annual
increase since doubling in 2009. While the shares have rallied
17 percent this year to close yesterday at $149.12, they&#8217;re
still 11 percent below their level at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson, head of the compensation committee, was re-elected
to the board with about 84 percent of the vote at last year&#8217;s
shareholder meeting, overcoming opposition from investment firm
Ruane, Cunniff  Goldfarb Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s board altered succession planning for top
executives, which it used for Schwartz&#8217;s ascension to CFO, lead
director James Schiro wrote in his inaugural letter to
shareholders. The new framework is focused on making sure
potential candidates have experience with the board and with
many of the firm&#8217;s businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our goal is always to be in a position to appoint our
most senior executives from within our firm,&#8221; the board said in
the annual proxy statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest ally of India&#8217;s Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party said the prime ministerial
candidate of their coalition should have a secular image, a call
that may weaken a bid by the BJP&#8217;s Narendra Modi to lead the
opposition bloc into the next elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Janata Dal (United), which has 20 seats in the 545-
member lower house of parliament and rules the eastern state of
Bihar, also said the BJP should declare its choice for premier
by the end of the year. The comments came today in a resolution
after a meeting of its national executive in New Delhi. Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s term ends in May 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Only a person who can carry with him all the diverse
sections of people can become the leader of the nation,&#8221; said
Nitish Kumar, a Janata Dal (United) leader who is among senior
party figures opposing a Modi candidacy. &#8220;Some people think
they will create a wave and people will accept it,&#8221; he told
party members during the session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The socialist Janata Dal is a part of the BJP-led National
Democratic Alliance. Coalition leaders such as Kumar, chief
minister of Bihar, have expressed concern that the nomination of
Modi may anger Muslims who accuse him of failing to stop riots
that targeted their community in 2002 in Gujarat state, which
Modi governs. More than 1,000 people died in the violence, most
of them Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the Janata Dal would put the BJP at risk of
alienating an ally as it tries to end a decade in opposition.
Other regional parties may rally behind Kumar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Support &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With this, Janata Dal has made it clear that they won&#8217;t
support Modi&#8217;s candidature,&#8221; said N. Bhaskara Rao, chairman of
the New Delhi-based Centre for Media Studies. &#8220;Now, the BJP
will move cautiously.&#8221; Today&#8217;s development is an indication
that in the elections the regional parties will dictate the
terms for any possible alliance, said Rao. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 16 percent of Bihar&#8217;s population is Muslim, more than
the national average of 13 percent. The Janata Dal governs Bihar
with the BJP as its junior partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi was elevated to the BJP&#8217;s highest decision-making body
this month, bolstering his stature amid jockeying to lead the
party into the parliamentary polls. Modi&#8217;s third consecutive
election victory in Gujarat, last year, and his high opinion-
poll ratings have made him a favorite among party members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahul Gandhi, scion of the Nehru-Gandhi family, will take
Singh&#8217;s Indian National Congress into the elections, although
the party has yet to formally declare its choice for prime
minister in the event of a victory by the ruling alliance that
it leads. Gandhi, son of the Congress President Sonia Gandhi and
assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, was appointed as his
party&#8217;s vice president in January. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), the U.S.
producer of metallurgical coal that is the target of a
shareholder action, fell the most in 18 months after unexpected
slowing of economic growth in China, the metal&#8217;s biggest user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter tumbled 12 percent to $21.28 at 1:50 p.m. in New
York after the Birmingham, Alabama-based company fell as much as
13 percent, the most since Sept. 21, 2011. Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. (ANR), the country&#8217;s second-largest coal miner by
sales, fell as much as 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economic growth lost momentum as factory output
weakened last month, according to data from the National Bureau
of Statistics in Beijing. The economy expanded at a 7.7 percent
annual pace in the first quarter, the bureau said today,
compared with 8 percent expected by  analysts&#8217; estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter led declines in companies producing metals and
steelmaking ingredients because investors are concerned about
the outcome of a shareholder action at the company, said Daniel Scott, an analyst at Cowen and Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everything is getting obliterated by the Chinese data,&#8221;
Scott said in an interview by phone today. Walter &#8220;has just got
the stigma of uncertainty to it on top of everything else.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audley Capital Advisors LLC has nominated five directors to
Walter&#8217;s board, saying the company&#8217;s administrative costs and
debt are too high. Egan-Jones Ratings Co., Institutional
Shareholder Services Inc., and Glass Lewis  Co. LLC have
recommended shareholders vote for the existing directors.
Walter&#8217;s annual meeting is scheduled for April 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. expects the price of metallurgical coal to
fall 4 percent to $165 a ton in the third quarter from $172 this
quarter, according to an April 12 report. Low-volatility coking
coal traded at $157.50 on March 22, according to data from
Knoxville, Tennessee-based Energy Publishing Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. coal producer is Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
was ending a recommendation to hold a long position in the SP
GSCI Brent Total Return Index amid disappointing oil demand and
refinery maintenance in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding the position, first recommended in August, would
have resulted in a 16 percent loss, the bank said in an e-mailed
report today. Weakness in European demand for refined fuels and
a slowdown in China, are weighing on prices even as global
inventory levels remain tight, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the tug of war between tight global oil fundamentals
and the negative sentiment created by weak European product
markets and fears of further Chinese slowdown, the latter
currently prevail,&#8221; Jeff Currie, head of commodities research
in New York, wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro-zone economy will shrink 0.3 percent in 2013 as it
struggles to move past its debt crisis, the European Commission
predicted on Feb. 22. Economic expansion unexpectedly eased in
China, the world&#8217;s largest energy consumer, according to data
for the first quarter from the Beijing-based National Bureau of
Statistics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent slumped as much as 2.6 percent today to a nine-month
low of $100.41 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;European margins could suffer further as the European
refinery turnaround season has peaked and more and more
refineries are coming back from maintenance,&#8221; Currie said.
&#8220;This could put further downward pressure on Brent prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217; advice to take a long position in the Brent
index on Aug. 21 was a modification of earlier recommendation to
buy West Texas Intermediate crude contracts. That suggestion
would have resulted in a 10.8 percent loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Carla Main" date="Apr 15, 2013  8:21 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-15/jpmorgan-risk-antitrust-pleas-blackberry-compliance.html"><headline>JPMorgan Risk, Antitrust Pleas, BlackBerry: Compliance</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), whose trading
loss of more than $6.2 billion last year was fueled by the
adoption of a formula that understated risks, has adopted yet
another model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said April 12 that it employed a new formula to
judge the risk of its credit derivatives position, at least the
fourth such model it&#8217;s used since January 2012. The portfolio
was built by Bruno Iksil, known as the London Whale because his
bets were so big they moved markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank changed its measurement of value at risk, or VaR,
for the credit derivatives book in the first quarter of this
year &#8220;to achieve consistency with like products&#8221; within the
corporate and investment bank, JPMorgan said April 12 in a
supplement. &#8220;This change had an insignificant impact&#8221; to
average VaR for fixed income and the investment bank&#8217;s trading
and credit portfolio, the New York-based bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had previously changed the VaR model, which
estimates the most amount of money a trading position can lose
on 95 percent of the trading days, when the corporate and
investment bank took over most of the credit book from the chief
investment office last year. That change last year reduced
JPMorgan&#8217;s estimated risk by 24 percent to $115 million in the
third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s switch of risk models in January of last year
may have helped fuel the trading loss at the chief investment
office, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told the Senate
Banking Committee in June. The January 2012 switch and the
timing of the firm&#8217;s disclosures are the focus of an inquiry by
the Securities and Exchange Commission as the U.S. examines how
long executives knew about the CIO&#8217;s swelling bets and losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, U.S. Senator Carl Levin said he plans to
forward results from his panel&#8217;s nine-month investigation into
JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s record trading loss to the Justice Department
and SEC to review for possible wrongdoing by company executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin made the remarks in an interview on Bloomberg
Television April 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Kornblau, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
comment on Levin&#8217;s remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, said referrals to the
Justice Department and the SEC are &#8220;fairly routine&#8221; following
a review by his panel and, if the staff hasn&#8217;t already sent
their report to investigators, they should. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Europe Moves Toward Tax-Evasion Clampdown After Six-Nation Push &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union moved closer to agreement on a
coordinated clampdown on tax evasion as a total of nine
countries backed an initiative for automatic sharing of bank
details across borders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bloc&#8217;s six biggest nations won support from the
Netherlands, Belgium and Romania for their proposal to adopt the
U.S.&#8217;s FATCA information-exchange program, EU Tax Commissioner
Algirdas Semeta said in Dublin yesterday. Semeta also said the
27-nation EU is closing in on updates to a savings tax accord as
holdouts Luxembourg and Austria show willingness to compromise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments from the U.K. to Poland are eyeing what the
commission estimates is 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) of lost
tax revenue as many European nations struggle to narrow budget
deficits. Politics is also spurring the initiative, notably in
France, where President Francois Hollande&#8217;s popularity has
slumped after his budget minister resigned and admitted having
an offshore bank account following months of denials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luxembourg, one of the countries that previously resisted
giving up its banking secrecy rules, dropped its opposition
April 10, though Finance Minister Luc Frieden said April 13 that
he wants Europe to win broader global support for the initiative
within the Group of 20 nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position of Austria, the other EU nation that has
defended banking secrecy, may also be shifting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Antitrust Plea Deals Won&#8217;t Name Non-Culpable Employees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division said it
will stop publicly naming individuals associated with corporate
antitrust plea agreements who aren&#8217;t believed to be culpable in
any alleged wrongdoing, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The names of so-called carved-out employees, which included
those who refused to cooperate with a probe, are currently
included in publicly filed corporate plea deals, Assistant U.S.
Attorney General Bill Baer said April 12 in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees against whom the government is still developing
evidence, or employees with &#8220;potentially relevant information&#8221;
who can&#8217;t be located, will be omitted from the publicly filed
portion of plea agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, corporate plea agreements have included a
provision offering non-prosecution protection to those employees
who cooperate and whose conduct didn&#8217;t warrant prosecution.&#160;The
division excluded, or carved out, employees who were believed to
be culpable from such receiving non-prosecution deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baer said the division will continue to exclude from non-
prosecution agreements any employees whose conduct may warrant
prosecution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those decisions will be made on an &#8220;employee-by-employee
basis&#8221; depending on the evidence, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will continue to demand the full cooperation of anyone
who seeks to benefit from the non-prosecution protection of a
corporate plea agreement, and will revoke that protection for
anyone who does not fully and truthfully cooperate with division
investigations,&#8221; Baer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CBRC Orders Banks to Control Loans to LGFVs, Sina.Com Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered banks to
control their total outstanding loans to local government
financing vehicles, or LGFVs, Sina.com reported, citing
guidelines dated April 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks also must cap the proportion of LGFV loans at last
year&#8217;s levels to vehicles that have cash-flow coverage ratios of
less than 100 percent or liability-to-asset ratios higher than
80 percent, the report cited the guidelines as saying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Banks Drop Off ISDAFix Panel as CFTC Probes Rate-Rigging &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are leaving the panel that sets ISDAFix, the
benchmark for the $379 trillion swaps market, as regulators
probe suspected manipulation of the rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Europe&#8217;s largest bank by assets, and
Japan&#8217;s Mizuho Financial Group (8411) stopped contributing to the
ISDAFix dollar rate between November and January, and haven&#8217;t
been replaced, documents on the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association&#8217;s website show. The industry group
didn&#8217;t give any reason for the lenders&#8217; departure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firms are pulling out of rates such as the London interbank
offered rate, Euribor and ISDAFix on growing concern that they
may face lawsuits, fines and criminal penalties if found to have
engaged in wrongdoing. Without data from a large number of
firms, benchmarks risk becoming unrepresentative and losing the
confidence of the market, said Owen Watkins, a former regulator
at the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Services Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISDAFix is used as a reference for parties looking to
settle interest-rate options and cancel swaps contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Barclays Received Most U.K. Bank Customer Complaints, FCA Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) topped the list of the most-complained about
U.K. financial institutions in the second half of last year,
according to data compiled by the markets regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, based in London, received 414,302 complaints, a 6
percent decrease from the first half of 2012, the Financial
Conduct Authority said in an e-mailed statement today. Lloyds
TSB Bank Plc was second with 349,386, a 19 percent decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. banks have been buffeted by a series of consumer
scandals in recent years, including improper sales of loan
insurance and some derivatives products. The sales of the loan
insurance, known as PPI, topped the list of complaints, followed
by checking accounts, general insurance products, credit cards,
and savings accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays said in a statement that it is continuing to make
improvements to its customer service and has seen complaints
fall by 184,000 in comparison to 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our sole focus is on helping our customers and getting it
right so they don&#8217;t feel the need to complain in the first
place,&#8221;  the bank said in a statement. &#8220;These actions will
make a big difference going forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Offer to Settle EU Antitrust Probe Unacceptable to Rivals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s offer to settle an antitrust probe with the
European Union by labeling its own services more clearly in Web
search results is a &#8220;non-starter&#8221; for competitors such as
Microsoft Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, French legal search engine Foundem and at least
10 other companies that filed complaints against Google with the
EU will be able to give feedback on the remedies submitted by
the Mountain View, California-based company to settle the almost
three-year-old investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, operator of the world&#8217;s largest Internet search
engine, told the Brussels-based EU that it would create more
distinction in searches between its own services and
competitors, a person familiar with the negotiations said last
week. Google also proposed to offer links to rival search
engines, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the details of the offer aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is preparing a market test based on Google&#8217;s formal
submission, Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for EU Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, said last week while declining to
comment on the specifics of Google&#8217;s offer. Al Verney, a
spokesman for Google in Brussels, said that the company
continues to cooperate with the commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Standard Chartered in Talks With Zimbabwe on Black Ownership &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered Plc (STAN), the U.K.&#8217;s second-largest bank by
market value, said it&#8217;s in talks with Zimbabwe&#8217;s government on
plans to increase black ownership of its business in the
southern African nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vicki Robinson, a spokeswoman for the London-based bank,
made the statement in an April 12 e-mailed response to
questions. &#8220;Standard Chartered has taken the conscious decision
to continue to maintain our long-standing commitment to doing
business in Zimbabwe,&#8221; she said in the e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the country&#8217;s law, foreign-owned companies must sell
or cede 51 percent of their operations to black Zimbabweans or
the state-owned National Indigenization and Economic Empowerment
Board. The head of the board, Wilson Gwatiringa, said Standard
Chartered may lose its license if the bank doesn&#8217;t comply with
the law, the state-owned Herald newspaper reported April 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That came after Harare-based Newsday April 11 reported that
Zimbabwe Central Bank Governor Gideon Gono said there were no
plans to force Standard Chartered to close. Impala Platinum
Holdings Ltd. (IMP) and Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS), the world&#8217;s
biggest platinum producers, have agreed to cede 51 percent of
their Zimbabwe operations to black ownership, while Barclays Plc
and Standard Bank Group Ltd. have also submitted plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered, which operates in 16 African countries,
said earlier this year that income from Africa rose 15 percent
to $1.59 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BlackBerry Asks Regulators to Probe &#8216;False&#8217; Returns Report &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry (BBRY), the Canadian smartphone maker, said it will ask
securities regulators to investigate a report that its new
phones have high return rates, arguing that the &#8220;false&#8221;
information may have been released in a deliberate attempt to
manipulate its stock price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detwiler Fenton  Co., a financial-services firm in Boston,
said April 11 that U.S. retailers were seeing a significant
increase in customers returning their Z10 phones because they
don&#8217;t find them easy to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In several cases, returns are now exceeding sales, a
phenomenon we have never seen before,&#8221; Detwiler Fenton said.
The report contributed to a 7.8 percent plunge in BlackBerry
shares April 11, marking the stock&#8217;s worst one-day drop in
almost two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry, based in Waterloo, Ontario, responded that
sales are meeting expectations and return rates are in line with
the rest of the industry. It asked both the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Ontario Securities Commission to
review the Detwiler report, saying it was either &#8220;a gross
misreading of the data or a willful manipulation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd. (BB), is
counting on the new Z10 phone -- and its pending companion
device, the Q10 -- to fuel a turnaround after years of market-
share losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anne Buckley, a spokeswoman for Detwiler Fenton, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;MT Says Fed Money-Laundering Review Delays Hudson City Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MT Bank Corp. (MTB) said a Federal Reserve review of its
compliance with anti-money-laundering rules has delayed its
planned purchase of Hudson City Bancorp. (HCBK) Both lenders declined
in New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MT hired an outside consulting firm as part of its effort
to respond to the Fed, the Buffalo, New York-based bank said
April 12 in a statement with Hudson City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In view of the potential timeframe required to implement
this initiative, demonstrate its efficacy to the satisfaction of
the Federal Reserve and otherwise meet any other regulatory
requirements that may be imposed in connection with these
matters, MT and Hudson City believe that the timeframe for
closing the transaction will be extended substantially,&#8221; the
companies said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks postponed until Jan. 31 the date at which either
party can terminate the deal if a combination hasn&#8217;t already
been closed, and said &#8220;there can be no assurances that the
merger will be completed by that date.&#8221; The prior deadline was
Aug. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MT announced the agreement in August, valued at $3.7
billion at the time, as part of an effort to expand into New
Jersey. Hudson City has said record-low interest rates are
pressuring profits from residential lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MT said it will discuss the status of the Hudson City deal
at a conference call scheduled for today to discuss first-
quarter results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Kollig, a Fed spokesman, declined to comment on the
regulator&#8217;s interactions with MT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Societe Generale Faces French Regulator Probe, Les Echos Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale (GLE) faces a probe by Autorite des Marches
Financiers, the French market regulator, Les Echos reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An official from the regulator called for an 800,000 euro
($1.05 million) fine and an official warning for the bank, the
newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale doesn&#8217;t have enough employees in its
custodian bank unit to carry out relations with and audits of
fund management companies correctly, the AMF official said,
according to Les Echos. The regulator&#8217;s sanctions committee will
decide on the case in &#8220;a few weeks&#8221;, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Altium Banker Charged With Insider Trading by U.K. Regulator &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former managing director at Altium Capital Ltd. was
charged in an insider-trading ring and will face trial next year
along with a former Deutsche Bank AG broker and four other men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant Harrison was charged today with one count of
conspiracy to commit insider trading, said Joseph Eyre, a
spokesman for the Financial Conduct Authority. Harrison&#8217;s case
was transferred to a higher criminal court for a hearing in
September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison will be added as a defendant in the case against
Martyn Dodgson, a former managing director at Deutsche Bank, a
lawyer for the regulator said at a hearing last month. The case
is scheduled to go to trial in September 2014 and last as long
as three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges stem from the FSA&#8217;s biggest insider-trading
investigation, known as Operation Tabernula, Latin for little
tavern. The U.K. regulator arrested seven people and raided 16
addresses in London and southeast England in March 2010 as the
FSA sought to crack down on insider trading among bankers and
traders in London&#8217;s financial district. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altium said in a statement last month that the allegations
relate to a period when Harrison worked with a previous
employer. Harrison&#8217;s lawyer, Gary Bloxsome, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, Saddam Hussein diverted the flow of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, then drained and burned the marshes of southern Iraq. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reasons were mainly political; the effect was an epic disaster that killed or displaced tens of thousands of people and threatened to erase the very cradle of civilization. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s where writing was invented,&#8221; said Azzam Alwash, 54, a dual citizen of Iraq and the U.S., and a force in the efforts to restore the Mesopotamian marshes. &#8220;It&#8217;s where the first cities were created. It&#8217;s where agriculture started. It&#8217;s where Abraham was born. The myth of creation is from there. It is not only Iraqi heritage, it is a world heritage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shortly after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, Alwash left his Los Angeles home and career in hydraulic engineering to return to Iraq to help save the dessicated marshland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He started Nature Iraq, a nonprofit based in the town of Sulaimani, and consulted with the Madan, or Marsh Arabs. They had already begun punching holes in the walls of the canals built by Hussein, so that the area could seasonally flood again. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alwash will be named today as one of the six 2013 recipients of the Goldman Environmental Prize. Each gets a bronze sculpture and $150,000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sat down recently with Alwash, a handsome man with graying hair, at Bloomberg&#8217;s global headquarters in New York, and asked him what it was like in 2003, three months into the war, to see the marshes after so many years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Physical Disgust &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;A feeling of physical disgust,&#8221; Alwash said. &#8220;It&#8217;s one thing seeing satellite pictures of the dried marshes, another thing seeing it at ground level. You know distance gives it abstractness. It&#8217;s vast, but it doesn&#8217;t give you that visual of what the desert looks like, especially a place that was so unique in your childhood.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He spoke of the horror of Basrah at the time -- the stench, the skeletal dogs and cats on the streets, the lost beauty of the city -- but his natural optimism overwhelmed the bitter memories: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was also this hope in the air, just that everything and anything is possible. So while it was sad seeing your childhood place dead, you come in with this American attitude. It&#8217;s like: Damn it, we&#8217;re going to do it!&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ten years on, the marshes are restored to more than 50 percent of their original size and the Madan are returning. It has been a monumental job under hellacious conditions -- war, terrorism, poverty and tumultuous social and political change. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;American Mistakes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;How do you convert 50 years of socialism into a free market?&#8221; Alwash asked. &#8220;How do you separate church from state? And what was fascinating for me, for the first seven years and even now, I see the Americans making mistake after mistake, but they&#8217;re not listening to people like me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government did help with marsh restoration at first, but after an initial $175,000 in aid, it gave no more, Alwash said. He partly blamed his own conflicts with the U.S. Agency for International Development. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t get along with USAID. It was my attitude. I don&#8217;t like being told what to do and what not to do, and I don&#8217;t like people who tell me it can&#8217;t be done. The experts telling me it can&#8217;t be done were hired by USAID.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Italy provided funding and consultants, and this month a sizable piece of the marshes will become Iraq&#8217;s first national park. Alwash is also involved with a survey of more than 300 biodiversity sites throughout Iraq, looking to further expand protected areas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Oil Income &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s recovery will depend on how it develops its oil fields, many of which are in the south. Alwash has a pragmatic take on the subject. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I might be viewed as a heretic in the environmental movement, but my point of view with respect to Iraq is that the world needs oil and Iraq needs income,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I would rather be inside the tent working with oil companies and with Iraq on responsible development than outside the tent demonstrating without being effective.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next threat to the marshes will probably not be oil, however, but the many dams tapping into the river systems upstream, including one of Turkey&#8217;s largest along the Tigris, set for completion next year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s another thing coming up on the horizon that nobody&#8217;s talking about,&#8221; Alwash said. &#8220;The issue of water: That&#8217;s going to be a problem and that&#8217;s going to be my next challenge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Winners &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other Goldman Environmental Prize winners are: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jonathan Deal, who led a successful campaign against fracking in South Africa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rossano Ercolini, an elementary-school teacher whose public-education campaign about the dangers of incinerators in his small Tuscan town became a national &#8220;Zero Waste&#8217;&#8221; movement in Italy &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aleta Baun, an Indonesian who organized peaceful protests at marble mining sites and helped halt the destruction of forestland on Mutis Mountain on the island of Timor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kimberly Wasserman, who led a campaign to shut down two coal plants in the southwest side of Chicago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nohra Padilla, who organized Colombia&#8217;s &#8220;waste pickers&#8221; to make recycling part of waste management. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Mike Di Paola writes on preservation and the environment for Muse, the arts and culture section of Bloomberg News.

&lt;p&gt;The champagne used to flow at Heartland, the bar in Tokyo&#8217;s Roppongi Hills complex that drew bankers from the Japan headquarters of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. upstairs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every day, there was a party,&#8221; said Mai Shioya, the 39- year-old manager, who started in May 2008 before the global financial crisis that led to Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bankers in well-cut suits would come in about 5 p.m., hand bartenders corporate credit cards and let their friends charge drinks to the tab until 2 a.m., said Michio Nakamura, 45, who&#8217;s been running events and entertainment at Heartland since its opening as part of the famed Roppongi Hills development in 2003. After the financial crisis, many disappeared, cutting revenue by 30 percent, Shioya said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those customers and that age have gone,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The void is being filled by a new group of bar patrons: information-technology workers. While financial firms have cut staff in Japan, technology companies have boosted hiring, and as bankers vacated offices at Roppongi Hills, companies including Google Inc. (GOOG) and Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) moved in. As early as this month, Apple Inc. (AAPL) will also make the complex its home in Japan, two people familiar with the plan said in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hiring demand for IT workers is very high,&#8221; said Taizo Hattori, a director for information technology at Career Incubation Inc., a Tokyo-based recruiting and consulting company. &#8220;Many IT firms have doubled headcounts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vacating Floors &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, one of the original tenants which has been reducing headcount and moving jobs elsewhere in Asia, is in talks with its landlord to vacate two of the six floors it occupies in the 54-story Mori Tower, part of the $2.2 billion Roppongi Hills complex developed by Mori Building Co. (MBDZ), two people with knowledge of the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s Asian business was bought by Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc., and its Japan operations were transferred to the Otemachi business district in 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. and European banks have been eliminating jobs and transferring staff from Japan to Hong Kong and Singapore to reduce expenses. Goldman Sachs led foreign banks in accelerating job cuts at their Japanese brokerages, according to filings with Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Japanese brokerage unit had 847 employees as of March 31, 2012, down about 30 percent from 1,205 in March 2008, the filings show. Barclays Plc (BARC), whose Japan headquarters is also at Roppongi Hills, was another that reduced brokerage staff, according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Visible Changes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The changes are visible at Heartland, located at the street level of the landmark Mori Tower, said Shioya, the manager. Originally opened to promote Heartland brand beer, brewed by Tokyo-based Kirin Holdings Co. (2503), it&#8217;s one of several bars and restaurants in Roppongi Hills, which also includes upscale shops, a hotel, apartments, a movie theater and an art museum. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;People used to be drinking more,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Some customers opened seven bottles of champagne for their birthdays. Some would ask us to prepare 100 champagne glasses for celebrations, and they were offering them to bar staff and strangers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With fewer bankers and more patrons from the tech world, the atmosphere has become more laid back, Shioya said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After business declined following the financial crisis, the bar began showing sporting events on its big-screen display to draw customers. Couches where well-dressed men and mini-skirted women once paired up to lounge and drink cocktails were replaced with tables and stools. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Clientele Change &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bankers were often drinking with ladies who came here to meet foreign businessmen, who were looking to marry a wealthy banker and go overseas,&#8221; Shioya said, adding that now the women who come tend to be office workers looking to practice English. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a recent Friday evening, male patrons in jeans or cargo pants, unshaven, wearing baseball caps or carrying backpacks were as numerous as men in suits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s changed a lot, especially the clientele,&#8221; said Felix Beatty, an information-risk-management specialist from Montreal who was celebrating his 36th birthday by drinking Heartland beer instead of champagne. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As their hangout transformed, some of the remaining bankers abandoned it for Rigoletto, a bar and restaurant on the fifth floor, said Beatty, who&#8217;s been coming to Heartland since 2004. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In April 2009, after overseas financial companies cut about 4,300 jobs, or 16 percent of their Japan workforce in 15 months, Heartland hosted a &#8220;pink-slip party&#8221; to help unemployed bankers network and find new jobs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Google Expansion &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially occupying 1 1/2 floors at Mori Tower, Google&#8217;s offices now take up the 26th, 28th and 30th floors, as well as most of the 27th. The Mountain View, California-based company declined in an e-mail to disclose its number of employees in the building. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenovo (992), the world&#8217;s second-largest maker of personal computers, moved its Japan headquarters to Roppongi Hills in April 2010. Google, operator of the world&#8217;s biggest search engine, relocated from Tokyo&#8217;s Shibuya district in August the same year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other information-technology companies in Mori Tower include Baidu Inc. (BIDU), operator of China&#8217;s most-popular search engine; Gree Inc. (3632), a Japanese social-networking game site operator; and San Francisco-based Salesforce.com, the biggest maker of online customer-management software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Roppongi Hills is sort of a tech hub,&#8221; said Joseph Schmidt, a spokesman for Salesforce.com. The site&#8217;s central location and gas-operated power generators to keep offices working during earthquake-related power cuts make it &#8220;second to none&#8221; for business-continuity planning, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Valuable Proximity &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Baidu, proximity to other information-technology companies is valuable, said Kaiser Kuo, a spokesman for the Beijing-based company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenovo, which started out with one floor at Mori Tower, has since expanded to a second, said Angela Lee, a spokeswoman for the Beijing-based company, which now has about 300 employees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Having our main office in Roppongi Hills has brought a positive impact on employees&#8217; motivation and recruiting,&#8221; Lee said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple, based in Cupertino, California, will move to Roppongi Hills from Tokyo&#8217;s Shinjuku district as early as this month and will occupy one or two floors, the people familiar with the plan said. Apple didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;IT firms are attracted because of the business environment,&#8221; Tomohiro Akita, a spokesman for Mori Building, said of Mori Tower, citing the in-house power generators, hotel and conference space. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hiring Jump &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hiring at information-technology and communications companies through three of Japan&#8217;s biggest recruiting agencies jumped 23 percent from a year earlier to 3,093 people in the six months ended Sept. 30, the Japan Executive Search and Recruitment Association said in a report in November. Financial- services hiring rose 7.5 percent to 830, it said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Demand for information-technology staff is outpacing supply and has been accelerating since early this year, Career Incubation&#8217;s Hattori said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Internet-service companies that target consumers are making money and are cash-rich,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They can afford to invest in human resources and are especially interested in people who can develop business overseas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rents for prime office space in Tokyo have fallen more than 40 percent from a peak in the first quarter of 2008, according to property broker Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., prompting more companies to relocate as they seek to upgrade office space. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Falling Rent &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rental value in the Akasaka and Roppongi areas in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 57 percent of the 2008 peak, according to Jones Lang. That&#8217;s attracted new tenants, cutting the vacancy rate in the area to 2.7 percent as of September from 3.3 percent the preceding quarter, data from Jones Lang show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Geeks have increased around the area,&#8221; said Hattori of Career Incubation. &#8220;Even some manager-level people who earn a lot of money wear jeans and athletic shoes. Probably they don&#8217;t have to care about their clothes as they are just happy as long as they can produce something interesting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Technology companies have also transformed the commercial real-estate market in New York, helping offset sluggish demand from financial-services firms. Lower Manhattan office vacancies fell in the first quarter to the lowest since 2008 as technology and creative firms moved in, Cushman  Wakefield said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chances of a resurgence in financial-firm hiring in Tokyo aren&#8217;t great, said Tetsuya Sakabe, managing director at Kanae Associates Ltd., an executive-search firm specializing in the industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no strong demand for bankers in the mergers-and- acquisitions field,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And not for debt and equity capital markets, either.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Noah Buhayar" date="Apr 16, 2013  4:51 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-16/berkshire-gains-as-buffett-s-coca-cola-stake-rallies.html"><headline>Berkshire Gains as Buffett&#8217;s Coca-Cola Stake Rallies</headline><body>

&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Class A shares rallied $4,000, or 2.6 percent, to
$161,000, a record closing price. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola surged
5.7 percent after posting first-quarter profit that beat
analysts&#8217; estimates and announcing a deal to sell some bottling
distribution rights in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett&#8217;s firm has 400 million Coca-Cola shares, making it
one of the four largest holdings at Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire, along with investments in Wells Fargo  Co., American
Express Co., and International Business Machines Corp.
Berkshire&#8217;s stakes in the companies may increase in the future
as the firms buy back shares, Buffett said in a letter to
investors last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The four companies possess marvelous businesses and are
run by managers who are both talented and shareholder-
oriented,&#8221; Buffett said in the letter. &#8220;Too much of good thing
can be wonderful.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) jumped the most in
more than four years after reporting first-quarter profit that
topped analysts&#8217; estimates and announcing a deal to sell some
bottling distribution rights in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 5.7 percent to $42.37 at the close in New
York for the Atlanta-based company&#8217;s largest gain since Feb. 12,
2009. The volume of shares traded was higher than the three-
month daily average by more than threefold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell 15 percent to $1.75 billion, or 39 cents a
share, from $2.05 billion, or 45 cents, a year earlier, Coke
said today in a statement. Excluding some items, profit was 46
cents a share, compared with the 44-cent average of 14 analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The results were helped by
higher Latin America sales volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has introduced new
package sizes in Latin America and emphasized Coca-Cola branded
soft drinks, Del Valle juices and Powerade. In North America,
where Kent has worked to streamline distribution, the company
said today it will retain manufacturing under the new agreement
while selling and swapping some distribution rights among five
smaller franchise bottlers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a first step in their eventual divestment of much
of the U.S. bottling operations,&#8221; Thomas Mullarkey, an analyst
for Morningstar Inc. (MORN) in Chicago, said today in a telephone
interview. &#8220;They don&#8217;t want all those capital-intensive
distribution assets sitting on their balance sheet in
perpetuity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall Street bank that generates the highest percentage of revenue from trading, dropped as much as 3 percent after revenue from that business fell more than its rivals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares slumped 1.6 percent to $144.10 in New York at 4:15 p.m., the second-largest decline in the 81-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index (S5FINL). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s first-quarter revenue from trading stocks and fixed-income products fell 12 percent to $5.22 billion, excluding accounting charges. That missed some analysts&#8217; estimates, including $5.48 billion from Oppenheimer  Co.&#8217;s Chris Kotowski and $5.25 billion from Credit Suisse Group AG&#8217;s Howard Chen. The revenue decline at New York-based Goldman Sachs was bigger than at Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman&#8217;s trading expertise has less value right now because they can&#8217;t deploy it as they used to,&#8221; Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. who rates the stock outperform, told Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television. &#8220;Trading is going to have a difficult time taking off from this point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fixed-income, currency- and commodity-trading revenue was $3.26 billion, down 9 percent from a year earlier, excluding the accounting charge related to the firm&#8217;s own debt. Revenue from the equities division, overseen by co-Chief Operating Officers R. Martin Chavez, Michael D. Daffey and Paul M. Russo, declined 17 percent from a year earlier to $1.96 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which is releasing
new cloud-computing services today, said it will match
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)&#8217;s lowest prices for competing products as it
seeks to win business in a growing market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is rolling out Windows Azure Infrastructure
Services, which will let customers run existing applications on
servers and storage machines in Microsoft data centers, after
more than nine months of testing. The company also committed to
match market leader Amazon on prices for computing and storage
services, even if Amazon cuts rates, said Steven Martin, general
manager of Windows Azure Business Strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy-one percent of respondents in a Forrester Research
Inc. (FORR) survey said they used Amazon Web Services for cloud
computing, compared with about 10 percent each for Microsoft,
Google Inc. (GOOG) and other vendors. Revenue from public cloud
services, which let customers run applications in an outside
vendor&#8217;s data center and access them via the Internet, jumped 20
percent last year to $109 billion, Gartner Inc. estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, has more than 200,000 customers for its Azure
cloud products, and 1,000 new ones sign up daily, Martin said in
an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 1 percent to $28.97 at the close in New
York. The stock has advanced 8.5 percent this year, compared
with a 10 percent gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $38 trillion U.S. bond market
needs to be improved to allow better access for all investors,
said Securities and Exchange Commission member Elisse Walter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The more I look at it the more concerns about fairness I
have,&#8221; she said today at the start of a series of roundtable
discussions the agency is holding in Washington on fixed-income
markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter sought to assure participants that the agency isn&#8217;t
trying to impose an equity-market structure on bonds with
exchange trading and pre-trade price transparency. The
challenge, she said, is for regulators to understand the
complexity of how debt trades to discover what must be changed.
&#8220;In this arena, I keep having to reassure people that we get
it,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealers have scaled back principal trading in the market
amid pressure to increase capital to meet international
standards and as they face lower profits from more transparency
created by Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, according to a report
today by consulting firm Tabb Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate bond inventories at primary dealers that trade
directly with the Federal Reserve have dropped to $56 billion,
below the average of $69.3 billion since the end of 2009 and
down from a peak of $235 billion in October 2007, Fed data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leaving Footprints &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dealers cannot quote in size and wide enough spread to
justify the capital deployment&#8221; to hold an inventory of bonds,
Will Rhode and Henry Chien wrote in the Tabb report. A system
for creating instantaneous quotes needs to be developed, they
said. &#8220;The challenge is simple: how do you price a bond trade
in real time?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concern for investors is showing large trades to the
entire market on bond trading systems, said Robert Auwaerter,
head of the fixed-income group at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-
based Vanguard Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You leave a footprint in the market that disadvantages
you,&#8221; Auwaerter, a panelist on the first roundtable, said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s better to try to go around quietly to dealers&#8221; because
&#8220;if you advertise it to the world you destroy your bid-price
execution,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the $9.1 trillion U.S. corporate-bond market, about half
of trades are larger than $5 million, said Eric Pitt, a managing
director at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in New York. For those
transactions, investors feel they can get better prices by
talking directly to dealers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bigger Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Would it work to electronify that part of the market?&#8221;
he said during a panel discussion on corporate and asset-backed
securities. &#8220;Is there a problem to be solved?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of new bond deals also has risen as underwriters
give more preference to larger offerings than in the past, said
Neil Schloss, the treasurer at Ford Motor Co. While $500 million
was once considered a large enough bond offering, the company is
now told that debt sales under $1 billion won&#8217;t be
enthusiastically greeted by the market, Schloss said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s more and more demand but less product,&#8221;
JPMorgan&#8217;s Pitt said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s making it hard for some bond investors to buy the
amount of debt they want, said Robert Smith, the chief
investment officer at Austin, Texas-based Sage Advisory Services
Ltd., which manages about $11 billion. If his firm wants $5
million to $10 million of a certain issue, he&#8217;ll tell dealers he
wants $100 million in order to be taken seriously. Then he ends
up with $1 million of securities, &#8220;and that&#8217;s on a good day,&#8221;
Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s a great risk to my business, because one of those
times I&#8217;m going to get $100 million and I don&#8217;t know how to get
around that,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution should be a single place to access all sizes
and types of debt, with exchange-like systems alongside
specialist dealers, Smith said.  &#8220;I want a mall,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), the most profitable U.S. banks, are selling a
combined $3.5 billion of debt and preferred stock after
generating record income in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo issued $1.15 billion of five-year debt that
pays 63 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
offered rate and an additional $850 million of its 1.5 percent
securities due January 2018 that yield 75 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is planning to issue $1.5 billion of perpetual
preferred stock to yield 5.15 percent, according to a person
familiar with that transaction who asked not to be identified,
citing lack of authorization to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo&#8217;s 2018 securities traded at 100.5 cents on the
dollar April 11 to yield 1.4 percent, or 67 basis points more
than Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offerings follow first-quarter earnings that relied on
cost cuts and smaller loan-loss reserves with lending less
lucrative. JPMorgan&#8217;s net income rose 33 percent to $6.53
billion and Wells Fargo&#8217;s profit climbed 22 percent to $5.17
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative borrowing costs have been declining, with the
extra yield investors demand to own bank debt instead of
industrial company obligations narrowing to 8 basis points
yesterday, from 103 a year ago, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s top mobile-phone executive said its Windows Phone operating system has an opportunity to lure away Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) users because it offers a more exciting and smoother experience. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s iOS software is &#8220;boring,&#8221; with icons across the bottom that offer little information or flexibility, said Terry Myerson, vice president of the Windows Phone division, at a conference in New York. Google Inc.&#8217;s Android is &#8220;a mess,&#8221; with too many different versions of the operating software in use, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is seeking to make inroads with Windows Phone to take advantage of rising demand for devices. The Redmond, Washington-based software maker had 2.6 percent of the smartphone operating system market in the fourth quarter, according to research firm IDC, up from 1.5 percent in the same period the prior year. That trailed Android&#8217;s 70 percent, iOS&#8217;s 21 percent and BlackBerry&#8217;s 3.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Myerson didn&#8217;t provide a sales update for the Windows Phone, though he said he was proud of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), the company&#8217;s main phone making partner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said on Nov. 28 that sales jumped four times in the few weeks after the company released Windows Phone 8 at the end of October, compared with the same period in the previous year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Maria Kolesnikova" date="Apr 16, 2013  9:13 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-16/jpmorgan-says-commodity-supercycle-still-has-a-decade-left.html"><headline>JPMorgan Says Commodity Supercycle Still Has a Decade Left</headline><body>

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economy will stay commodity-oriented even amid slower growth, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Raw-material markets in the medium term will still be driven by China,Michael Camacho, chief executive officer of commodities for Europe, Middle East and North Africa, told the FT Global Commodities Summit in Lausanne today. The nation will still buy more raw materials, whether its economy grows at 6 percent or 8 percent a year, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the shale-gas revolution in the U.S. and China&#8217;s transistion to consumer-driven economy, the U.S. will become the &#8220;next big exporter,&#8221; and China will be &#8220;the next big importer&#8221; in the years to come, according to Camacho.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) set aside
$4.34 billion to pay employees in the first quarter, about 1
percent less than a year earlier, as the firm employed 400 fewer
people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compensation expense was equal 43 percent of revenue,
down from 44 percent in the first quarter of 2012, the New York-
based company said today in a statement. The sum, which covers
salaries, benefits and accruals for year-end bonuses, is enough
to give each of the bank&#8217;s 32,000 employees $135,594 for the
first three months of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, are cutting costs and jobs to
improve shareholder returns. The company, led by Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, has trimmed compensation
expenses by more than a third in the five years through 2012,
while revenue fell 26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock climbed 41 percent last year, showing that
shareholders were &#8220;relatively happy&#8221; with the firm&#8217;s
compensation decisions in 2012, President Gary Cohn said in a
Bloomberg Television interview in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ll never get it perfect, but I think we got it
right,&#8221; said Cohn, 52. &#8220;Relative to the competitive landscape
that we operate in, our people got paid relatively fairly,
relative to the contribution they made to the firm and to our
share price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The selloff in gold that cut futures 13 percent over two days was sparked by investor concern that European governments may have to follow Cyprus in selling part of their holdings, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The slump, which drove prices to their lowest level since January 2011 today, was exacerbated as the metal fell below so- called technical-support levels, analysts including Jeff Currie and Damien Courvalin said in a report dated today, entitled &#8220;There Are Weeks When Decades Happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gold has plunged into a bear market as investors reduced holdings in exchange-traded products amid signs the U.S. economy is recovering, paring haven demand. Goldman said April 10 the turn in the gold cycle was quickening and investors should sell the metal. The drop in the past two days was one of the largest corrections in modern history, according to Deutsche Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sharp selloff in gold was triggered by growing fears that the central bank of Cyprus would sell its gold reserves, potentially reflecting a larger monetization of gold reserves across other European central banks,&#8221; the Goldman analysts wrote in the report dated today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bullion for June delivery was 1.3 percent higher at $1,378.50 an ounce on the Comex at 5:33 p.m. in Singapore after losing as much as 2.9 percent to $1,321.50.

&lt;p&gt;AMC Entertainment Inc., the second-

&lt;p&gt;Disney slipped 0.1 percent to $60.68 at the close in New
York, down from yesterday&#8217;s all-time high. The shares have
advanced 22 percent this year, compared with an 8.8 percent gain
for the SP 500 Stock Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A regulation letting hedge funds
advertise for investors could force the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to expand enforcement activity to guard
against fraud, SEC Commissioner Elisse B. Walter said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor-protection concerns caused the SEC to miss a
congressional deadline for finishing the rule called for in last
year&#8217;s Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, Walter said in
testimony at a House Financial Services subcommittee hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would have to expend examination and enforcement
resources that we would not otherwise have to,&#8221; she said in
addressing questions about why commissioners didn&#8217;t accelerate
work on the measure as some SEC staff members suggested. The
agency needed to analyze questions raised by investor advocates,
said Walter, who served as SEC chairman from December until Mary Jo White took the helm this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC issued a proposal to lift the ban on hedge-fund
advertising in August, four months after the JOBS Act became
law. Debate over how to proceed sparked conflict between Mary Schapiro, who stepped down as chairman in December, and
Commissioner Daniel M. Gallagher, who said he was furious that
Schapiro changed her mind about how to proceed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, gained regulatory approval to
run a branch of its commercial bank in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Bank USA received the license on March 21,
according to a filing with Britain&#8217;s Financial Conduct
Authority. The branch will be able to accept deposits, advise on
investments and arrange the safeguarding and administration of
assets, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that the request has been approved,&#8221;
Sophie Bullock, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in London, said
today by e-mail. &#8220;The bank&#8217;s clients are global and it is
important for a number of them to be able to transact with the
bank in London.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) were the largest U.S.
securities firms before they converted to bank holding companies
after the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. Both became subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve
and won access to central bank programs such as the discount
window, which are designed to protect deposit-taking banks.
Goldman Sachs Bank USA was set up as a New York State-chartered
bank in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said yesterday that first-quarter net income
rose 7 percent to $2.26 billion, or $4.29 a share, from $2.11
billion, or $3.92, a year earlier. That was higher than all 24
analysts&#8217; estimates in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial News reported the approval for a commercial-bank
branch earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest

year fixed- and floating-rate bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s $1.25 billion of floating-rate securities yield
45 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
offered rate and its $250 million of 0.8 percent debt yields 59
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds may be rated A2 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service,
according to a person familiar with the transaction, who asked
not to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s $1.65 billion of 3.4 percent notes due June 2015

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in the Gulf Coast
weakened against futures for the first time in six days after
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said a Beaumont refinery fire was in a unit
that was shut for maintenance and didn&#8217;t affect production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blaze yesterday injured 12 contract employees, seven of
whom remained in a hospital in Galveston, Texas, today, Rachael
Moore, a Fairfax, Virginia-based spokeswoman for the company,
said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
in the Gulf widened 1 cent to 13 cents a gallon versus futures
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:51 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reformulated gasoline shrank 3 cents to a premium of 3.5
cents a gallon, while conventional, 87-octane gasoline weakened
3.25 cents to a discount of 9.75 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel on the Gulf remained unchanged
at 1.5 cents a gallon below Nymex futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
Oklahoma, slipped $1.27 to fall to $24.72 a barrel. The same
spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil fell 77 cents to $12.87 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the largest computer-services company, plans to cut as
much as 14 percent of its French workforce, Agence France Presse
reported, citing a union leader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firings will total 1,200 to 1,400 over two years,
Gerard Chameau, a representative of the French Democratic
Confederation of Labor, told the wire service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, is seeking to reduce
expenses as economic weakness in Europe takes a toll on
potential customers. The company is shifting resources to focus
on growing markets such as Africa that have increasing demand
for technology and consulting help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug Shelton, an IBM spokesman, declined to comment. The
company is scheduled to report first-quarter results today after
the close of trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chameau didn&#8217;t immediately reply to an e-mail message from
Bloomberg News seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM slid less than 1 percent to $208.53 at 12:28 p.m. in
New York. The shares had climbed 9.5 percent this year through

&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s international reserves
will drop to $37.5 billion as capital controls erode the
country&#8217;s trade balance, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s estimate of a $5.5 billion decline in central
bank funds this year assumes that capital controls will prevent
a pickup in private-sector outflows. Reserves dropped to $39.8
billion yesterday, below $40 billion for the first time since
May 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Capital controls threaten to exert an adverse toll on
expectations of economic performance,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts
including New York-based Vladimir Werning wrote in an e-mailed
research report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s merchandise trade balance will be $9.6 billion
this year, according to JPMorgan, down from a previous estimate
of $11.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan cut its 2013 &#8220;agro bonus&#8221; forecast, the
estimated increase in agriculture-related exports, to $4.8
billion from $6.7 billion. It projected soy crop output of 45
million tons, down from a prior estimate of 51.5 million tons.
The bank raised its corn output estimate for this year to 25
million tons from 24 million tons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF SA (YPFD), the oil company that the Argentine government
seized in April 2012, was projected to import $600 million worth
of fuel this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Ian Read was the
highest-paid chief executive officer at a large pharmaceutical
company last year, as U.S. top managers remained on average much
better paid than their European counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer increased Read&#8217;s remuneration 2.5
percent to $25.6 million in 2012, while Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB)&#8217;s Lars Rebien Soerensen was the lowest-paid CEO, with $5 million, Sam Fazeli, a London-based analyst for Bloomberg Industries, wrote
in a note today. The median pay of CEOs leading large
pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. was $17.2 million last
year, 85 percent more than the $9.3 million European average,
according to the analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payments to top managers in Europe, even though lower than
in the U.S., remain under scrutiny. A U.K. pension group has
recommended that members vote against London-based AstraZeneca
Plc (AZN)&#8217;s remuneration policy at the company&#8217;s annual general
meeting on April 25 to protest a &#8220;golden hello&#8221; payment and
planned incentives for Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG (NOVN) met similar investor
pressure earlier this year because of its plans to pay outgoing
Chairman Daniel Vasella $77 million as part of a non-compete
agreement. Vasella&#8217;s &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; came to light after
details were leaked to the press, leading to a public outcry in
Switzerland and prompting him to give up the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large-cap pharmaceutical companies paid their CEOs a median
of $13.7 million in 2012, well below the industrials-company
median of $21.9 million, according to Bloomberg Industries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s government and opposition
resolved differences over legislative changes to century-old
laws on buying land for industry and roads, paving the way for
parliamentary approval in the session which resumes next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have reached a broad consensus on the Land Acquisition
Bill,&#8221; Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath told reporters
in New Delhi today after a cross-party meeting. The bill will be
taken for consideration when lawmakers meet from April 22, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill has been fought over both within the ruling
Congress party and since September 2011 in parliament, delaying
ratification of a key plank of the government&#8217;s agenda.
Protests, some of them deadly, over state-backed purchases of
land at below-market rates for factories or highways have
increased in frequency since 2007, triggering calls for greater
compensation for farmers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s government wants to make it
mandatory for companies buying land to win the approval of 80
percent of landholders. For public-private partnership projects,
70 percent of landowners need to give consent, according to the
draft bill approved by the cabinet in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I gave 12 suggestions and the government agreed to almost
all of them,&#8221; Sushma Swaraj, leader of the Bharatiya Janata
Party, told the NDTV 24x7 television channel. &#8220;We have told the
government that when you acquire land, you should give 50
percent of the compensation to the original farmer. And the
government has agreed to that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government wants to rewrite the 1894 colonial-era Land
Acquisition Act that allows the state to seize land at cheap
rates if it believes there&#8217;s a larger public benefit, such as
the creation of jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abuse of the rule led to clashes between farmers and
provincial administrations, and fueled Maoist rebellions in some
mineral-rich states, including Chhattisgarh and Odisha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh&#8217;s government -- and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi -- want to win approval for the legislation as they
prepare for a general election scheduled for May next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Franek Persidski, Estonia&#8217;s consul general in Russia&#8217;s
second-biggest city of St. Petersburg, has returned home, Minna-
Liina Lind, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, said today

&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Japan (8301) can achieve its
goal of 2 percent inflation within two years and may need to
concern itself with containing prices if it succeeds, according
to Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the central bank is truly committed to reaching its
target, then it can, London-based O&#8217;Neill said at a Goldman
Sachs seminar in Tokyo today. BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda has
pledged to do &#8220;whatever it takes&#8221; to beat deflation and plans
to double the monetary base -- cash in circulation and the money
that financial institutions have on deposit at the central bank
-- within two years in pursuit of that goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve set it themselves and they&#8217;ve got to keep doing
things to get to what is their target,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;If they
do start to get 2 percent inflation in the next two years, how
do they stop it going, at least for a brief while, to quite a
bit more than 2 percent. That to me would be more of a valid
issue than whether they will be able to do it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 56-year-old&#8217;s confidence in Japan&#8217;s central bank runs
counter to skeptics from Bill Gross, who runs the world&#8217;s
biggest bond fund, to former BOJ Deputy Governor Kazumasa Iwata.
The Topix Index, Japan&#8217;s broadest equity measure, has rallied 55
percent since November on pledges to end deflation while the
two-year rate on overnight-index swaps, used to wager on changes
in the BOJ&#8217;s target rate, is set for its biggest monthly jump
since November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) helped write the
first-in-the-nation rule ordering reduced carbon emissions from
cars and trucks. Its biofuels chief spoke at the ceremony where
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the executive
order in 2007, the same year the oil company pledged to develop
a gasoline replacement from wood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Chevron is leading a lobbying and public relations
campaign to undercut the California mandate aimed at curbing
global warming, two years after the state started phasing it in.
Research on commercially viable climate-friendly products has
come to naught, stymied by the poor economics of coaxing
hydrocarbons from plants&#8217; stubborn cell walls, according to
Chevron officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve looked at 100 feedstocks, 50 conversion
technologies, worked to shape this law the best we can, and we
have not come up with a solution to be able to comply,&#8221; said
Rhonda Zygocki, Chevron&#8217;s executive vice president of policy and
planning, in a Feb. 4 talk at the Commonwealth Club in San
Francisco. Rick Zalesky, the Chevron official who celebrated the
order&#8217;s signing with Schwarzenegger, was blunt last June when he
declared the low-carbon standard &#8220;not achievable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While still promoting its commitment to renewable energy,
the second largest U.S. oil company quietly shelved most of its
biofuels work in 2010, according to internal documents and
former Chevron officials. It decided products with potential
returns of at least 5 percent weren&#8217;t enough for a multinational
used to margins triple that, said Paul Bryan, a former vice
president of biofuels technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rebounding from a six-week low, as companies from Capital One Financial Corp. to Google Inc. (GOOG) reported earnings that topped analysts&#8217; forecasts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google and Microsoft Corp. gained at least 3.4 percent. Capital One rallied 6.4 percent as income from continuing operations exceeded estimates. International Business Machines Corp., the biggest computer-services provider, tumbled 8.3 percent after quarterly profit missed projections for the first time since 2005. McDonald&#8217;s Corp. slumped 2 percent as it said soft global demand has continued this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 advanced 0.9 percent to 1,555.25 at 4 p.m. in New York, paring its biggest weekly loss since November to 2.1 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 10.37 points, or 0.1 percent, to 14,547.51. About 6.4 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, in line with the three-month average. Options contracts expire today, leading investors to adjust their holdings of some stocks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Earnings are going to continue to come in better than most people think,&#8221; Jeffrey Saut, who helps oversee about $420 billion as chief investment strategist at Raymond James  Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida, said in a phone interview. &#8220;Companies have pretty much guided down and expectations are pretty low in terms of upside surprises.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Moving Average &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell below its 50-day moving average yesterday for the first time this year. That level, currently at around 1,544, is watched by some analysts to gauge the trend of the market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities has fallen 2.4 percent from a record close on April 11, spurring concern over what UBS AG strategist Jonathan Golub called a &#8220;spring break&#8221; in equities. Stocks began short-term declines in April of each of the last three years. Still, the benchmark measure has surged 130 percent from a 12-year low in 2009 as the Federal Reserve embarked on three rounds of bond purchases to stimulate the economy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thirteen SP 500 companies including General Electric Co. posted quarterly earnings today. Of the 103 that have reported so far, 72 percent have exceeded analysts&#8217; predictions, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Profits at SP 500 companies dropped 1.1 percent in the first three months of the year, according to forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. That would mark the first year- over-year decrease since 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8217;Significant Volatility&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This has been the first week in a while where we&#8217;ve seen significant volatility,&#8221; Ben Schwartz, the Chicago-based chief market strategist at broker Lightspeed Financial Inc., said by phone. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of uncertainty right now, especially in the technology sector. The SP 500 and the Nasdaq have traded soft in the last week which is something we haven&#8217;t seen all year. People are tentative with regard to the earnings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), or VIX, briefly erased its loss for the year yesterday. The VIX, which moves in the opposite direction as the SP 500 about 80 percent of the time, has risen 32 percent since reaching a six- year low in March, including a 43 percent jump on April 15 for its biggest one-day gain since August 2011. The gauge retreated 15 percent to 14.97 today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google rose 4.4 percent to $799.87 after the owner of the world&#8217;s most popular search engine posted first-quarter profit, excluding some items, of $11.58 a share, surpassing the average analyst forecast of $10.68 a share as advertisers increased spending on mobile and video promotions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Rallies &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft climbed 3.4 percent to $29.77 as third-quarter profit for the world&#8217;s largest software maker exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates, buoyed by cost controls and sales of business and server software amid weak demand for personal computers running the new Windows 8 operating system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consumer-staples shares, phone companies and health-care companies rose more than 1.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Capital One gained 6.4 percent to $56.17 for the biggest gain in the KBW Bank Index (BKX), which increased 1.5 percent. The eighth-largest U.S. lender by assets reported a first-quarter profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates as lending margins improved. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) increased 3.6 percent to $28.31 for the second-biggest gain in the banking benchmark after earnings exceeded projections. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors bought shares of corporations most tied to economic growth today. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index (CYC) of 30 U.S. equities and the 20-stock Dow Jones Transportation Index rallied at least 1.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Honeywell Earnings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honeywell International Ltd. increased 3.8 percent, the most since July, to $74.18. The maker of cockpit controls and thermostats predicted second-quarter earnings will increase more than analysts estimated, as demand for energy services surges. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PepsiCo Inc. climbed 1.9 percent to $82.77 and foodmaker Mondelez International Inc. jumped 5.3 percent to $31.69. PepsiCo said it held meetings with billionaire Nelson Peltz&#8217;s Trian Fund Management LP as the investor disclosed a $269 million stake and also revealed a holding in Mondelez. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peltz could push for a merger of the companies, the Daily Telegraph of London reported last month, citing unidentified people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) rose 4.7 percent to $106.10 for the biggest gain since October 2009 after the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers boosted its annual earnings forecast amid sales growth in its North American tissues unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mexican Food &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) soared 12 percent to $366.25 for the biggest gain in the SP 500. The Denver-based fast- casual dining chain reported first-quarter sales that topped analysts&#8217; estimates, helped by an acceleration of store openings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM dropped 8.3 percent to $190 after missing profit estimates, hurt by a hardware slump and the failure to sign customers to contracts. The shares dropped the most since April 2005, wiping out gains for the year a month after hitting a record high. IBM, which accounts for 10 percent of the price- weighted Dow average, took 132 points off the 30-stock gauge today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McDonald&#8217;s slumped 2 percent to $99.92. The world&#8217;s largest restaurant chain by sales posted first-quarter profit that was little changed as same-store sales dropped in the U.S. and said soft global demand has continued this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;General Electric lost 4.1 percent to $21.75 after posting first-quarter profit that matched analysts&#8217; estimates as lower sales in the Power  Water business curbed manufacturing growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Europe was weaker than we expected, and in particular the power and water and oil and gas businesses were very soft,&#8221; Nick Heymann, an analyst at William Blair  Co. who has a market-perform rating on the stock, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Fred Pals" date="Apr 19, 2013  3:46 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-19/abp-goldman-sachs-settle-suits-over-mortgage-backed-securities.html"><headline>ABP, Goldman Sachs Settle Suits Over Mortgage-Backed Securities</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reached a settlement in a dispute over
residential mortgage-backed securities purchased by the fund
from 2005 to 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We now are pleased to see that these cases are concluded
satisfactorily one by one,&#8221; Henk Brouwer, chairman of Heerlen,
Netherlands-based ABP, said in a statement today. &#8220;We have full
confidence that all will be completed in due course, evidencing
that all parties involved are looking to the future, leaving
past grievances and practices behind them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABP sued New York-based Goldman Sachs in New York State
Supreme Court in January 2012. The company alleged that it
purchased certain mortgage-backed securities in reliance on
false and misleading statements and that the securities were
riskier than had been represented, backed by mortgage loans
worth significantly less than had been represented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harmen Geers, an ABP spokesman, declined to comment on the
amount of the settlement. Stampa Communications, based in
Amsterdam and representing Goldman Sachs in the Netherlands,
also declined to comment when contacted by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) (IBM), two architects of the U.S. computer industry, are feeling the pain as consumers and businesses flock to mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software company, yesterday reported no growth in Windows sales in its latest quarter, after accounting for upgrades sold in the past. IBM is struggling to boost hardware sales as more companies let employees use their own devices at work. Meanwhile Google Inc. (GOOG), which is expanding beyond its search-engine roots with Android software for smartphones and tablets, is keeping pace with the shift, reporting better-than-projected profits from mobile advertising. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As consumers check e-mail, browse the Web and watch television and movies on the go, PC shipments plummeted 14 percent in the first quarter, the worst decline since researcher IDC began tracking data in 1994. Microsoft and others aren&#8217;t moving fast enough to end their reliance on traditional computing, according to Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS Investment Bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s been a tough start to the year,&#8221; said San Francisco-based Thill. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), which aims to generate 20 percent of sales outside the PC industry by the fourth quarter, forecast second-quarter sales yesterday that may surpass some analysts&#8217; estimates as it diversifies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VirnetX Holding Corp. (VHC) which won a
$200 million settlement from Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) over patents
related to private networks in 2010, filed a new lawsuit today
claiming it&#8217;s entitled to more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VirnetX said Microsoft&#8217;s Skype unit, which allows instant
messaging and Internet calling, is infringing six patents.
Skype, which Microsoft bought in October 2011 for $8.5 billion,
wasn&#8217;t part of that earlier deal, Zephyr Cove, Nevada-based
VirnetX said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although Microsoft previously signed a patent license
with VirnetX, we believe they are infringing our patents in ways
that are outside the scope of the original license,&#8221; Kendall Larsen, the company&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in the
statement. &#8220;We look forward to quickly resolving this matter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint was filed in federal court in Tyler, Texas,
where VirnetX has had mixed luck. One jury in November awarded
VirnetX $368 million in a case against Apple Inc. (AAPL) over some of
the same patents, while a different jury in March decided that
Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) didn&#8217;t infringe the patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft and VirnetX reached the
earlier settlement after Microsoft lost a jury verdict against
VirnetX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every successful technology company sees patent suits
from time to time,&#8221; said David Cuddy, a Microsoft spokesman.
&#8220;We&#8217;re confident in our handling of intellectual property and
look forward to addressing these claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patent Licensing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VirnetX, which relies on patent licensing for its income,
reported $412,000 in revenue last year. The company, whose
shares rise and fall with its litigation, rose 74 cents or 3.9
percent, to $19.55 in New York trading. Its shares are down 33
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, reported
$73.7 billion in sales in the last fiscal year. Microsoft rose
3.6 percent to $30.83. Its stock is up 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new case is VirnetX Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 13-351,
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest software maker, rose the most in a year after activist investor ValueAct Holdings LP amassed about a $1.9 billion stake. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares increased 3.6 percent to $30.83 at the close in New York, the biggest gain since April 20, 2012 and the highest closing price since Sept. 21. The shares have advanced 15 percent this year, compared with a 9.6 percent gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer is working to deliver more software and services over the Internet to bolster sales amid a global PC slump that&#8217;s eroding demand for pre-installed programs. ValueAct, which has a history of investing in companies it believes are fundamentally undervalued, said that Microsoft can succeed in this effort, aided by the Azure cloud-computing platform. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In three to five years, which is our time horizon, we&#8217;ll stop talking about PC cycles and instead talk about Microsoft as the largest cloud-computing company in the world,&#8221; ValueAct CEO Jeffrey Ubben said today at a conference in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Best and Worst Investments of 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in an e-mailed statement that its board and executives &#8220;welcome the perspectives of shareholders.&#8221; The Redmond, Washington-based company also said it&#8217;s committed to &#8220;enhancing value for all shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft would become ValueAct&#8217;s biggest holding, topping its $1.6 billion stake in Motorola Solutions Inc. as of Dec. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ValueAct manages more than $10 billion in assets, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Top 20 &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ubben said ValueAct had almost 60 million shares, valued today at about $1.9 billion. That would put ValueAct among the top 20 biggest investors in Microsoft, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In March, industrial equipment maker Gardner Denver Inc. (GDI) agreed to sell itself to KKR  Co. for about $3.7 billion after ValueAct became Gardner Denver&#8217;s third-biggest shareholder and pressed for a deal. Another shareholder is now suing Gardner Denver saying the deal undervalues the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re value investors who don&#8217;t mind being activists,&#8221; Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners, said in an interview. &#8220;If things aren&#8217;t working out, they would become more active.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ValueAct only plans to engage Microsoft&#8217;s board over time if they&#8217;re unhappy, CNBC reported earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jonathan D.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), whose employees
gave more money to President Barack Obama&#8217;s re-election
committee than those at any other company, was the second-
largest donor to his January inauguration, contributing $2.1
million, according to new Federal Election Commission filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as the two parties gear up to battle for control
of Congress in next year&#8217;s election, the House and Senate
fundraising committees for Democrats brought in more money than
their Republican counterparts during 2013&#8217;s first three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama&#8217;s inaugural committee raised more than $44 million,
much of it from corporations in a reversal of his 2009 policy.
The largest contributor to his 2013 swearing-in festivities was
ATT Inc. (T), which gave $4.6 million. Boeing Co. (BA) and Chevron Corp. (CVX)
each donated $1 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama&#8217;s first inaugural committee raised more than $54
million from individuals only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other corporate donors to this year&#8217;s committee included
Genentech Inc., which gave $750,000; the Coca-Cola Co. (KO), which
contributed $430,000; and Bank of America Corp., which donated
$300,000. Bank of America also contributed $5 million to help
stage the Democratic convention in its home city of Charlotte,
North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall
Street bank that generates the highest percentage of revenue
from trading, may be able to post a higher return on equity than
competitors, according to Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co. analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs could generate ROE, a measure of how well the
bank reinvests shareholder money, of 15 percent to 20 percent,
Hintz said today in a Bloomberg Television interview with Tom Keene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would make the New York-based company an &#8220;outlier&#8221;
among the biggest banks and Wall Street firms, which probably
will generate ROE of about 12 percent to 15 percent, Hintz said.
Banks will continue to trim compensation in an effort to boost
returns, Hintz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s annualized ROE was 12.4 percent in the first
quarter, above the 10.7 percent it reported for all of 2012.
Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said last week that the
firm doesn&#8217;t have enough information about pending regulations
to provide a new target, which was set at a 20 percent return on
tangible equity before the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
biggest energy company by market value, booked two tankers to
haul oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast via the Suez Canal in May at
what may be this year&#8217;s lowest rates, a shipbroker said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very large crude carriers, each able to haul 2 million
barrels of oil, will load in the Persian Gulf on May 7, Athens-
based Optima Shipbrokers Ltd. said in an e-mailed report today.
The ships were chartered at rates of 15.75 and 16 industry-
standard Worldscale points, it said. Those would be the lowest
levels so far in 2013 for the route, according to figures
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hire costs for tankers hauling Middle East crude to the
Gulf Coast slipped 0.2 percent to 18.3 Worldscale points today,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. That&#8217;s down 26
percent from the start of the year. Charter costs on the journey
declined in the third quarter of every year starting in 2007,
according to figures compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is very weak, and I think this summer will be
just as bad as the previous two,&#8221; Dag Kilen, an analyst at
Fearnley Consultants A/S, part of Norway&#8217;s second-largest
shipbroker, said by e-mail. Rates could get &#8220;potentially even
worse if oil prices remain under downward pressure, as it will
tighten OPEC output.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Return Voyages &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipowners will seek to cover fuel costs by securing
charters for return voyages after vessels unload their original
cargoes, Kilen said. Exxon Mobil spokesman Richard Scrase in
Leatherhead, England, declined to comment by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VLCCs built in 2010 and carrying Middle East oil to the
U.S. were losing $2,140 a week on average as of April 19,
according to figures from Clarkson Plc (CKN), the world&#8217;s biggest
shipbroker. The ships were earning $31,227 a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hire costs for VLCCs on the benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-Japan
journey were little changed today at 32.06 Worldscale points,
figures from the Baltic Exchange showed. The ships&#8217; daily losses
widened to $714 from $254 on April 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange&#8217;s assessments don&#8217;t account for owners&#8217;
efforts to improve returns by securing cargoes for return
voyages or reducing speed to burn less fuel. The price of fuel,
or bunkers, the industry&#8217;s main expense, fell 1.4 percent to
$599.88 a metric ton today, figures compiled by Bloomberg from
25 ports showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a broader measure of oil-
shipping costs that includes vessels smaller than VLCCs, added
0.6 percent to 638, according to the exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is marketing
$500 million of commercial-mortgage bonds, capping what probably
will be the busiest month in the $550 billion market in more
than five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender plans to issue securities linked to 82
properties spanning the U.S. from California to Kentucky,
according to a person familiar with the offering who asked not
to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t public. Hotel loans
account for 64.2 percent of the deal, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance of bonds tied to commercial real estate in April
is poised to surpass the $8.3 billion sold in January, which
marked the highest monthly volume since December 2007, according
to JPMorgan. Volume was $6.9 billion through April 19, the bank
said. Investors are reversing course after pulling back amid the
glut of offerings, debt analysts at New York-based JPMorgan said
in a report last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After some weakness to start the month, pricing spreads
have begun to snap back despite the uptick in supply,&#8221; the
analysts led by Ed Reardon wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc sold
top-ranked securities maturing in about 10 years to yield 81
basis points, or 0.81 percentage point, more than the benchmark
swap rate on April 18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with 85 basis points on similar debt issued by the
lenders on March 6, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Risk Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for riskier portions of the deals is building. Wells
Fargo and RBS sold bonds rated BBB-, the lowest investment-grade
ranking, to pay a spread of 310 basis points more than swaps
this month, compared with 375 basis points in March, people
familiar with the transaction said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are buying the bonds as the Federal Reserve&#8217;s
effort to stimulate economic growth by suppressing borrowing
costs pushes investors toward riskier assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance companies boosted purchases of lower-ranking
commercial-mortgage debt this year by nine percentage points,
accounting for 33 percent of subordinate debt purchases from new
deals, the JPMorgan analysts said in a separate report on April
12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance of commercial-mortgage bonds is poised to climb 50
percent to $70 billion in 2013, according to Credit Suisse Group
AG. Banks have arranged about $28.6 billion in sales this year,
Bloomberg data show. A record $232 billion was issued in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is starting to run low on dollars to pay
the nation&#8217;s bondholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central bank reserves fell six percent in the first
quarter, the most for the period in six years, and sank below
$40 billion this month for the first time since 2007. As
investors await a U.S. court ruling on whether the nation must
pay holdout creditors including billionaire Paul Singer from its
2001 default, the extra yield they demand to own Argentine debt
instead of Treasuries rose to 12 percentage points this year.
That&#8217;s almost twice the premium similarly rated Belarus and
Ukraine pay, leaving Argentina as the only distressed borrower
among 55 emerging markets tracked by JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drain on Argentina&#8217;s reserves, which Fernandez has used
for public spending and payments to bondholders since 2010, is
set to accelerate as revenue growth from agricultural exports
slows, JPMorgan estimates. Reserves will tumble at the fastest
rate in a decade by year-end, leaving Argentina with just $37.5
billion. That would only cover 75 percent of the country&#8217;s
foreign-currency debt obligations due from 2014, Economy
Ministry data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What the market looks at is the country&#8217;s ability to pay
in the future,&#8221; Mariano Tavelli, president of brokerage Tavelli
 Cia., said in a phone interview from Buenos Aires. &#8220;For now,
we don&#8217;t see a genuine stream of dollars coming in that will
replenish the reserves we&#8217;re losing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debt Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has made about $755 million in debt payments
this year by drawing down central bank reserves. The treasury
gets money from the central bank in exchange for a non-
transferable 10-year note that pays maximum interest of the one-
year London interbank offered rate minus one percentage point.
Libor was at 0.715 percent on April 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 2013, the government&#8217;s foreign currency debt
obligations will total $50.3 billion, excluding the $27.9
billion in non-transferable notes sold to the central bank,
according to the latest Economy Ministry data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Fernandez has banned most foreign-currency purchases,
the reserve decline is prompting more Argentines to try to buy
dollars as central bank president Mercedes Marco del Pont pumps
pesos into the economy to keep borrowing costs low, said
Tavelli. With a 37 percent increase in the money supply over the
past year, the 304 billion peso ($59 billion) monetary base is
within 2 percent of its record high on Dec. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weakening Peso &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations of a steeper decline in the peso, which will
weaken a further 12 percent this year to 5.84 per dollar,
according to the median estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, may tempt exporters to hoard their grain until then,
according to Hernan Yellati, a strategist at BancTrust  Co. in
Miami. Argentines pay as much as 8.9105 pesos per dollar in a
parallel exchange market compared to the official rate of
5.1673. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s revenue from export duties fell in March
for a fourth month, declining 30 percent from a year earlier,
the only tax segment to post a drop. Vladimir Werning, an
economist at JPMorgan in New York, estimates exports will total
$87.1 billion this year, an 8 percent increase from last year on
a better harvest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to fewer dollars being sold to the central
bank, Argentines withdrew $665 million from their dollar-
denominated savings accounts this year, contributing to the loss
in reserves, according to Werning. Banks deposit foreign
currency that is not loaned to exporters in Argentina&#8217;s central
bank, so when savers make withdrawals, the central bank returns
the cash to the bank and reserves decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Investor Attention&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decline in gross international reserves continues to
be a focus of investor attention,&#8221; Werning wrote in a report.
&#8220;The time that policymakers have bought with controls has not
been invested to resolve fundamental macro concerns, such as
high inflation and ongoing real exchange rate appreciation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices rose 24.4 percent in March from a year earlier,
opposition lawmakers, citing estimates from economists, said
April 11, as the peso weakened 14.7 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation and the peso&#8217;s decline led Vale SA (VALE5), the world&#8217;s
biggest iron-ore producer, to shelve a $5.9 billion potash
project in Argentina last month. The cost to develop the project
almost doubled to $11 billion, while Argentina refused to give
the Rio de Janeiro-based company any tax breaks, Chief Executive
Officer Murilo Ferreira said on March 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;No Problem&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s savings are also being squeezed by state-owned
oil company YPF SA (YPFD), which will have to spend an additional $400
million to import fuel to supply service stations after a flood
and fire at its La Plata refinery reduced output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the government will have enough reserves to pay debt
at least through 2016, according to Luis Celasco, who manages
1.7 billion pesos of Argentina bonds at RJ Delta, a unit of
Raymond James Financial Inc. in Buenos Aires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the drop in reserves below $40 billion is a
trigger for people to sell bonds,&#8221; Celasco said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;With the current picture, now that capital flight
has decelerated because of currency controls, there&#8217;s no
problem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect $10 million of Argentine debt against
non-payment during five years with credit-default swaps plunged
1,037 basis points, or 10.37 percentage points, this month to
2,072 basis points, data compiled by CMA Ltd. show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent if a borrower fails
to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commodity Cycle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In commodity-dependent Peru, the central bank&#8217;s foreign
currency holdings have risen eight percent this year. In Brazil,
the world&#8217;s biggest shipper of coffee and orange juice and the
second-biggest exporter of soybeans, reserves have dropped just
0.4 percent to $377 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re underperforming relative to what their neighbors
are doing, so you kind of expect as a commodity producer in this
commodity cycle, they should be doing a little bit better,&#8221;
Gabriel Torres, an analyst at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, said in
a telephone interview from New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s just purely because
of a lack of confidence in the government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian stocks retreated, erasing
earlier gains, as OAO Gazprom (GAZP) slid after JPMorgan Chase  Co.
cited the natural gas export monopoly&#8217;s dividend plans in a
report downgrading the country&#8217;s equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micex Index (INDEXCF) sank as much as 1 percent and closed down
0.1 percent at 1,336.84 in Moscow, extending last week&#8217;s 3.4
percent drop. Gazprom fell for a sixth day, retreating 0.5
percent to 119.55 rubles as it had its longest losing streak in
more than two months. Russian equities have the cheapest
valuations on an estimated profit basis among 21 emerging
markets tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia was cut to underweight from neutral at JPMorgan,
which said Gazprom&#8217;s proposed dividend cut, falling oil prices
and &#8220;policy stasis&#8221; in President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s government
overshadow low valuations. State-run Gazprom, Russia&#8217;s largest
company by market value, proposed this month reducing its annual
dividend by about 33 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fund manager sentiment towards Russia remains very
brittle,&#8221; Julian Rimmer, a trader of Russian shares at CF
Global Trading in London, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micex Index climbed as much as 1.2 percent earlier,
advancing with European stocks after Group of 20 nations offered
no opposition to Japan&#8217;s policy stimulus, spurring optimism that
the measures will help boost a global recovery. Brent crude
added 0.2 percent to $99.82 a barrel in London. Oil and gas
contribute about 50 percent of Russia&#8217;s state budget revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investor Questions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors point to low valuations on Russian stocks as a
bull case, but they cannot really answer our questions about
what improvements they have seen recently in the policy
environment or the expectations of future improvements,&#8221; Adrian Mowat, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief Asia and emerging-market strategist,
wrote in a report dated April 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Spot Index of commodities fell 0.1 percent to
606.87. The dollar-denominated RTS Index (RTSI$) lost 0.6 percent to
1,329.14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micex trades at 5 times estimated earnings and has lost
9.4 percent this year, compared with 10.6 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index (MXEF), which has slid 4.3 percent in the
period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian Depositary Index (RDXUSD) dropped 0.9 percent to
1,531.91. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in stock futures, rose 4.8 percent to 24.47 today. The
Market Vectors Russia ETF, the largest dedicated Russian
exchange-traded fund, declined 1 percent to 25.52, while the
Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN) declined 0.5 percent to 89.29. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donald R. Mullen Jr., who helped Goldman Sachs Group Inc. profit from the U.S. housing crash, is giving the firm and its clients a way to gain from the recovery. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mullen, 54, has raised almost $1 billion to buy single- family houses to rent since leaving Goldman Sachs last year as head of global credit and mortgages, five years after overseeing the bank&#8217;s bet against the imploding subprime home-loan market. His Fundamental REO LLC has already purchased or is close to acquiring almost 2,500 properties through foreclosure auctions, government agencies and even an Arizona non-profit that promotes affordable-home ownership, property records show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mullen plans to spend as much as $2 billion by 2016, joining private-equity giants including Blackstone Group LP (BX) and Colony Capital LLC seeking to take advantage of home prices 29 percent below the 2006 peak and rising demand for rentals from Americans blocked out of homeownership. Investors, including former bankers and bond traders, are rushing to buy and renovate properties, as well as secure Wall Street funding to turn what&#8217;s been a mom and pop business into an institutional asset class. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street Is My Landlord&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the biggest trade in the real estate space,&#8221; said Justin Berman, a former Goldman Sachs banker who runs Atlanta-based Berman Capital Advisors, a private wealth firm with about $550 million under management. &#8220;They can&#8217;t get their hands on enough homes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles Manby, a senior partner at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., will lead a 100 million-pound ($152
million) fundraising campaign for the Francis Crick Institute,
which will be Europe&#8217;s largest biomedical research center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manby will be chairman of the 16-member board collecting
the money for Cancer Research UK, which is contributing to the
institute&#8217;s 650 million-pound construction cost and its 120
million-pound annual budget. The board includes the chief
executive officers of International Standard Asset Management,
Ted Baker Plc (TED), Ingenious, Newton Investment Management, New York
Times Co. (NYT), and WPP Plc (WPP), Cancer Research UK said today in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institute will open in London in 2015. Paul Nurse, a
2001 Nobel Prize winner in physiology or medicine for work on
cell cycle regulation, is leading a four-year effort to build
the facility. At 1 million square feet and with as many as 1,500
employees, including 1,250 scientists, he said the Crick
Institute will become Europe&#8217;s biggest science research center
in one building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The institute will take new approaches in carrying out
biomedical research aimed at speeding up scientific discovery
and the application of those discoveries,&#8221; Nurse said in the
statement. &#8220;We need the funds to make this a reality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CEO Members &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Standard Asset Management CEO Stanley Fink,
Ted Baker CEO Ray Kelvin, Ingenious CEO Patrick McKenna, Newton
Investment CEO Helena Morrissey, WPP CEO Martin Sorrell and New
York Times CEO Mark Thompson will work with Manby to raise money
for the institute, according to the cancer charity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other members of the Cancer Research UK fundraising board
are Sherry Coutu, an investor who serves on the finance board of
Cambridge University; former HSBC Holdings Plc CEO Michael Geoghegan; David Harding, founder and president of Winton
Capital Management LLC; Richard Hayden, chairman of Haymarket
Financial; Autonomy Corp. co-founder Mike Lynch; Hayat Palumbo,
chairman of the Walbrook Club; Andrew Pisker, co-founder of
Richmond Park Partners LLP and former CEO of Dresdner Kleinwort
Wasserstein; Lee Portnoi, former chairman of TIS Group Ltd; and
Mark Yallop, U.K. group country CEO at UBS AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government-funded Medical Research Council is
paying 300 million pounds of the Crick&#8217;s construction costs, the
Wellcome Trust is providing 120 million pounds and London-based
Cancer Research UK is contributing 160 million pounds. Imperial
College London, King&#8217;s College London and University College
London are pitching in 40 million pounds each. The total
includes contingency funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expected 120 million-pound annual budget will come from
the same sources. Cancer Research will fund 40 million pounds to
50 million pounds a year and the Wellcome Trust will give an
undetermined amount, the heads of both groups said. The
remainder will come from the government and the universities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB), operator of the
world&#8217;s most popular social-networking website, must convince a
Chicago federal court jury that its Timeline feature isn&#8217;t
trampling the trademark rights of the website Timelines.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timelines Inc., the operator of that site, sued Facebook in
September 2011, a week after the social network announced it was
converting user-profile pages previously known as walls to
individual chronologies and calling the new feature
&#8220;Timeline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announcing its new profile design, Facebook founder and
Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg called Timeline &#8220;the
heart&#8221; of a user&#8217;s experience. Facebook has more than a billion
monthly users, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timelines, which has about 94,000 visitors a month, is
scheduled to go to trial today seeking to stop Facebook from
using the word &#8220;timeline,&#8221; contending it has held a federal
trademark on the use of &#8220;timelines&#8221; in the realm of user-created Internet chronologies since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chicago-based company&#8217;s website allows user-members to
create timelines and add events to existing ones including those
for space exploration, sporting events, battles and
assassinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timelines is seeking damages equivalent to Facebook&#8217;s
Timeline-derived ad revenue, plaintiff&#8217;s attorney Douglas
Albritton said in a phone interview this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, counter-sued,
contending &#8220;timeline&#8221; is too generic for federal trademark
protection and arguing that the registrations should be
canceled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiff&#8217;s description of its services reflects the
common understanding of the term &#8216;timeline&#8217; in the English
language,&#8221; defense lawyers said in a January court filing
asking U.S. District Judge John W. Darrah for a ruling it its
favor ending the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darrah on April 1 denied Facebook&#8217;s motion, setting it on
course for today&#8217;s trial in his court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Timelines Inc. v. Facebook Inc., 11-cv-06867,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Patent &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Penguin Offers Changes to Settle EU&#8217;s E-Books Antitrust Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pearson Plc (PSON)&#8217;s Penguin offered to overhaul pricing models
for digital books to settle a European Union antitrust probe
into whether they blocked competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penguin won&#8217;t &#8220;restrict, limit or impede&#8221; e-book
retailers&#8217; discounts or their ability to &#8220;set, alter or reduce
retail prices for e-books&#8221; for two years, according to details
of the proposed changes as published in the EU&#8217;s Official
Journal April 19. Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world&#8217;s biggest technology
company, and four publishers previously offered similar remedies
to allay European concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU said Penguin, together with the four publishers and
Apple, &#8220;may have breached EU antitrust rules that prohibit
cartels and restrictive practices by jointly switching the sale
of e-books from a wholesale model to agency contracts containing
the same key terms,&#8221; the Brussels-based European Commission
said in a statement. The companies &#8220;may have engaged in a
concerted practice with the object of raising retail prices of
e-books&#8221; or blocking lower prices in Europe, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator is giving competitors and
customers until May 19 to comment on the proposed remedies,
which could then become legally binding in a settlement that
would end the investigation without imposing fines or
determining that the companies violated competition rules. The
commission said it will conduct another such market test &#8220;if
substantial changes to the commitments are subsequently made.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penguin said that &#8220;subject to the market test currently
under way, it has reached an agreement with the European
Commission to settle its investigation,&#8221; according to an e-mailed statement on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Penguin&#8217;s position that it has done nothing wrong remains
unchanged and the company continues to believe that the agency
pricing model operates in the best interests of consumers and
authors,&#8221; the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Glaxo Gets OFT Complaint for Paying to Delay Seroxat Copies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) was sent an antitrust complaint by U.K.
regulators who say the company may have colluded with generic-drug makers to keep copies of its Seroxat antidepressant off the
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo, the U.K.&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, may have paid Alpharma
Ltd., Generics (U.K.) Ltd. and a unit of Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (TEVA) to delay the release of cheaper, copycat
versions of the drug, the U.K. Office of Fair Trading said on
its website. Seroxat was one of Glaxo&#8217;s best-selling drugs from
2002 through 2004, when the agreements were in place, the OFT
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The introduction of generic medicines can lead to strong
competition on price, which can drive savings for the NHS, to
the benefit of patients and, ultimately, taxpayers,&#8221; said Ann
Pope, a director at the OFT, referring to the U.K.&#8217;s publicly
funded National Health Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are
focusing on how settlements between companies that make branded
medicines and generics producers might harm consumers. Les
Laboratoires Servier, H. Lundbeck A/S (LUN) and Teva, the world&#8217;s
largest generic-drug maker, were sent statements of objections
last year by the European Union&#8217;s antitrust watchdog over
possible delays for generic drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OFT probe covers matters already examined by the EU
without subsequent sanctions, David Daley, a spokesman for the
London-based company, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo &#8220;supports fair competition and we very strongly
believe that we acted within the law, as the holder of valid
patents for paroxetine, in entering the agreements under
investigation,&#8221; Daley said in an e-mail, referring to the
active ingredient in Seroxat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo and the generic companies were sent so-called
statements of objections, the OFT said. Daley said the company
will need time to review the documents before considering any
further action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Songwriter Settles Suit Against Sony and Alicia Keys &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earl Shuman, who wrote the song &#8220;(Hey There) Lonely Girl&#8221;
has settled a suit filed in December against Sony Music, Alicia
Keys and several other defendants. He claimed that Keys&#8217; latest
hit, &#8220;Girl on Fire,&#8221; sampled several seconds of his song
without authorization or payment. The song, which he co-wrote
with Leon Carr, was a hit in 1969 and 1980. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms of the settlement weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles attorney Philip Kaplan, who represented Shuman,
didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. Sony Music, a division of
Sony Corp. (SNE), declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Shuman v. Sony Entertainment, 2:12-cv-10572,
U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (Los
Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Venture Capital Investments Drop in First Quarter of 2013 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From January through March, according to the National
Venture Capital Association, 863 companies received $5.867
billion in venture capital investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amounts reflect a decline of 12 percent in dollar
amounts and 15 percent in the number of deals from the fourth
quarter of 2012, when $6.7 billion was invested in 1,013 deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVCA said that the life sciences and clean technology
sectors faced the most severe decreases, while there were
&#8220;notable&#8221; increases in the media and entertainment industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lenovo Said to Be in Talks to Buy Parts of IBM Server Unit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd. (992), the Chinese personal-computer maker, is
the most likely bidder for parts of International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s server division, a person familiar with the
matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business, which sells servers running x86 processors,
may fetch $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion depending on what assets
and liabilities are included, said the person, who asked to not
be named because the talks are private. An agreement may still
be several weeks away, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo used the 2005 purchase of IBM&#8217;s PC unit as a
steppingstone to become the world&#8217;s second-largest producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks were previously reported in CRN, a publication
aimed at technology integrators. In response to the story,
Lenovo said it was in &#8220;preliminary&#8221; discussions about a
potential acquisition with a third party, which it didn&#8217;t name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Shafer, a Lenovo spokesman, said in an e-mail he
had no additional comment beyond that statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on his
company&#8217;s earnings call that he wouldn&#8217;t comment on rumors. Ed Barbini, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM, also
declined to comment on the Lenovo talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Maria Kolesnikova" date="Apr 22, 2013  8:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-22/jpmorgan-barclays-seen-topping-otc-commodity-derivatives-market.html"><headline>JPMorgan, Barclays Seen Topping OTC Commodity Derivatives Market</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Barclays
Plc (BARC) were the top firms for providing over-the-counter commodity
derivatives to companies hedging energy and metals exposure,
while investors favored Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), a Greenwich
Associates survey found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays and JPMorgan, which tied for No. 1 position, had
relationships with 39 percent of the global corporations
surveyed about their OTC dealers to hedge energy exposure, ahead
of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS), the survey found. JPMorgan
also led in metals. Among investors, 59 percent said they had a
relationship with Goldman Sachs, 54 percent named JPMorgan and
47 percent used Barclays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banks are rethinking their approach to the commodities
business in light of new capital requirements and regulations,&#8221;
Andrew Awad, a consultant with Stamford, Connecticut-based
researcher Greenwich Associates, said in a statement today.
&#8220;The landscape is becoming far more fragmented, as few banks
want to be all things to all people and more find specific
segments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities revenue at the 10 largest banks slumped 24
percent last year to $6 billion amid low volatility and client
flows as Goldman ranked No. 1, followed by JPMorgan, according
to a Feb. 15 report from analytics company Coalition. Increasing
concerns about regulation and capital sensitivity also led banks
to re-examine commodity strategies, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty-five percent in the Greenwich survey said they used
JPMorgan to hedge their metals exposure, while 34 percent used
Barclays. Thirty-three percent named Citigroup and Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) and 26 percent said they hedged with Societe Generale SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top Ranking &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan led the ranks in energy because of its dominance
in the U.S. and Asia, according to the survey. Barclays tied
with Morgan Stanley for the top position in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation about investors leaving commodities because of
regulatory changes &#8220;appears to be overblown,&#8221; according to
Greenwich Associates. Investment managers will continue to use

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that
the selloff in copper was &#8220;overdone&#8221; and it remains bullish on
the metal at a lower price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank cut its three-month estimate to $7,500 a metric
ton from $8,000, lowered its six-month prediction to $8,000 from
$9,000, and the 12-month forecast fell to $7,000 from $8,000,
Goldman analysts including London-based Max Layton and Hong
Kong-based Roger Yuan said in a report dated today. Copper for
three-month delivery traded at $6,905 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal has lost 13 percent this year and slumped into a
bear market as Europe struggled with its debt crisis and growth
slowed in China, the biggest metals consumer. Europe and China
account for about 60 percent of world consumption. Inventories
tracked by the London Metal Exchange almost doubled in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forecasts have been downgraded &#8220;to acknowledge the
increasing willingness of the market to price future surplus
ahead of time&#8221; and the risks to growth in the broader emerging
market, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While prices have suffered on concerns China&#8217;s economy may
slow, the bank said the country&#8217;s &#8220;underlying cyclical growth
is likely stronger than the headline figures suggest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange is being drawn down, it said. The bank estimated bonded
stockpiles at 510,000 tons from 715,000 tons in early March and
noted that futures in Shanghai are in backwardation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until April 2011, Patrick &#8220;Pete&#8221; Dodd, a former money manager at Liberty Life Insurance Co. in Greenville, South Carolina, invested customer premiums in what he calls a &#8220;squeaky clean&#8221; portfolio: bonds backed by state governments and blue chip corporations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then a company funded by private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) acquired Liberty and inherited its clientele, mostly people approaching retirement who had bought annuities from the company to supplement their Social Security. Now the unit&#8217;s holdings include securities backed by subprime mortgages, time-share vacation homes and a railroad in Kazakhstan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you look at the business model these guys use, where they&#8217;re substantially increasing the risk in the bond portfolio, sooner or later, in my opinion, that has to come home to roost,&#8221; said Dodd, 55, who helped manage $4 billion before the sale to New York-based Apollo&#8217;s Athene Holding Ltd. &#8220;All the upside would go to Athene if it worked out. And the downside would go to the annuity holders if it didn&#8217;t.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms such as Apollo, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Harbinger Group Inc. and Guggenheim Partners LLC are acquiring life insurance companies and shaking up a staid industry with investments in everything from the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team to mortgage-backed securities that cratered during the financial crisis. The newcomers are meeting resistance from some state insurance regulators accustomed to vanilla portfolios, who have warned about exposing policyholders to greater risk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Troubling Role&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;New York State may need to modernize its regulations to deal with the increased presence and &#8220;troubling role&#8221; of private-equity firms in selling annuities, which promise regular payments to policyholders, Benjamin Lawsky, New York state superintendent of financial services, said in a speech last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risk we&#8217;re concerned about at DFS is whether these private-equity firms are more short-term focused, when this is a business that&#8217;s all about the long haul,&#8221; Lawsky said. &#8220;Their focus is on maximizing their immediate financial returns, rather than ensuring that promised retirement benefits are there at the end of the day for policyholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms can be very successful even if some of their ventures fail, he said. &#8220;This type of business model isn&#8217;t necessarily a natural fit for the insurance business, where a failure can put policyholders at very significant risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Address Change &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apollo and Goldman Sachs both shifted the legal addresses of their South Carolina insurers out of state after its regulators limited their investing strategies. For New York-based Goldman Sachs, the move came after it hired the state&#8217;s former insurance director as a lobbyist and appealed for help to the South Carolina governor&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies want to do things, and then when a regulator tries to do their job, then they go find a domicile that will let them do what they want,&#8221; said Scott H. Richardson, who was the South Carolina insurance director when Goldman Sachs left the state for the nation&#8217;s capital in 2009. &#8220;We weren&#8217;t being friendly enough to them, so they went to D.C.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The money managers say their investments are no more dangerous than those of traditional insurers, and that they&#8217;re managing them with a long-term view. In a key measure of financial health known as the risk-based capital ratio, the units far surpass the minimums required by state regulators. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Less Risky&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While some of its investments are unorthodox, &#8220;our portfolio is less risky than traditional life-insurance companies,&#8221; said James R. Belardi, chief executive officer of Apollo&#8217;s Bermuda-based Athene unit. It is &#8220;a reason why people should invest in our company, as opposed to the unsuccessful strategies of traditional life insurance companies, which has been an underperforming sector in the economy for many, many years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Guggenheim&#8217;s insurance units bought part of the Los Angeles Dodgers last year, when Guggenheim CEO Mark Walter led a $2 billion purchase of the baseball team. Its insurance arms invested about $100 million, according to a person close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity because of Major League Baseball confidentiality rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Guggenheim&#8217;s insurance arms invest conservatively, and it plans to own them for a long time, said Michael Sitrick, a spokesman. A money manager based in New York and Chicago, Guggenheim also advises traditional insurers about their investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investing premiums in a baseball team is &#8220;a little odd,&#8221; said Nick Gerhart, the insurance commissioner for Iowa, one of five states that oversee Guggenheim insurers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Apollo&#8217;s Acquisition &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later this year, Gerhart is expected to review Apollo&#8217;s biggest insurance takeover yet -- its $1.8 billion agreement to buy the West Des Moines-based U.S. operation of London-based Aviva Plc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This move from private equity into insurance is relatively a new phenomenon, and I don&#8217;t know how many regulators have even spent time thinking about it,&#8221; said Gerhart. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athene&#8217;s plans to acquire Aviva&#8217;s U.S. operation disturbed Michael Garcia, a retired phone company salesman in the Los Angeles suburbs. Garcia, 61, spent most of his life savings on an Aviva annuity last year, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The new owners, Apollo, are not an insurance company. They&#8217;re a private-equity company. That&#8217;s a big difference,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So obviously my concern is: Are these people going to keep enough reserves? Are they going to play by the rules that insurance companies have to play by?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Don&#8217;t play poker with our money,&#8221; Garcia said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fee Revenue &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;By routing at least some of their insurance units&#8217; investments to funds managed by the parent company, the Wall Street firms can generate fee revenue. Athene, for instance, put about a third of its $15.8 billion of assets into Apollo funds, including collateralized loan obligations and private equity, generating fees for Apollo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harbinger Group tried the same tactic. Controlled by Philip Falcone&#8217;s Harbinger Capital Partners LLC hedge-fund firm, Harbinger Group entered the insurance business in 2011 when it bought an annuity provider in Maryland from London-based Old Mutual Plc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harbinger soon sought to transfer $3 billion of the Maryland firm&#8217;s business to an insurance company it owns in Bermuda, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. About $1 billion would be managed by Falcone&#8217;s hedge fund firm and invested in assets rated non-investment grade, or junk, below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and less than BBB-by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Proposal Rejected &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maryland regulators rejected the proposal last year. The deal may &#8220;adversely affect interests of policyholders,&#8221; wrote Neil Miller, an associate Maryland insurance commissioner. &#8220;There is no assurance that the investment manager will successfully mitigate the risks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harbinger later won approval for a smaller deal involving more traditional assets, which the hedge fund wouldn&#8217;t manage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since it made the original proposal to Maryland, Harbinger Group has changed its strategy, said Phil Gass, a managing director, adding that it owns fewer junk-rated securities than most insurers. Unlike private-equity funds, Harbinger, a publicly traded company, can hold onto acquisitions indefinitely and takes a long-term view, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fixed Annuities &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street-backed insurers primarily sell retirement-savings products known as fixed annuities. Wall Street firms account for 15 percent of the fixed annuity market, up from 4 percent a year ago, Lawsky said in his speech. The planned Aviva acquisition by Apollo, one of the world&#8217;s largest private-equity firms, would make Athene the second-largest U.S. seller of fixed annuities. Athene targets return on equity of 16 percent to 20 percent, according to an Apollo presentation in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lawrence J. Rybka, chief executive officer of ValMark Securities Inc., said his firm won&#8217;t sell the new insurers&#8217; annuities, in part because their financial-strength ratings from A.M. Best Co. aren&#8217;t high enough. His Akron, Ohio-based company&#8217;s liability insurance won&#8217;t pay for his defense if he&#8217;s sued by a client who buys an annuity from a company with less than an A rating that later fails, he said. Unlike the Wall Street-backed firms, most of the country&#8217;s largest insurers, such as MetLife Inc. (MET) and New York Life Insurance Co., have ratings of A or better. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Annuities can tempt insurers to boost profits by investing aggressively, Rybka said. In a typical transaction, a customer hands over her retirement nest egg to an insurance company in exchange for a promised future stream of payments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Long-Term Interests &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The insurer gets to invest the money and keep any earnings beyond what&#8217;s guaranteed to the policyholder. If the bets backfire and the insurance company fails, some losses may be borne by customers and state guarantee funds, Rybka said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The long-term interests of policyholders are not in alignment with the short-term interests of private equity,&#8221; Rybka said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a heads I win, tails you lose game.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the U.S. bank regulatory system is predominantly federal, insurance is regulated by state insurance officials, who play dual and sometimes conflicting roles as economic boosters and consumer watchdogs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;South Carolina is &#8220;among the most business friendly&#8221; states, according to its commerce department website. Still, it balked when Goldman Sachs wanted to dip into policyholders&#8217; premiums for funding in the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New Transactions &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the largest U.S. securities firms, Goldman Sachs set up an insurance unit in Charleston in 2004. It joined dozens of companies recruited by Insurance Director Ernst N. Csiszar to establish subsidiaries known as &#8220;captives&#8221; in the state. Some of them were used to experiment with brand-new types of financial transactions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bermuda was advertising itself as the offshore laboratory of insurance,&#8221; Csiszar said in a recent interview. &#8220;I said O.K., why don&#8217;t we become the onshore laboratory?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Csiszar resigned later that year, replaced by Eleanor Kitzman, founder of an auto insurance company in the state. After then Governor Mark Sanford forced Kitzman out of office in 2007, she took a job in government relations with Goldman Sachs, and became president of the investment bank&#8217;s South Carolina subsidiary. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Reverse Repurchases&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2008, Goldman Sachs sought South Carolina&#8217;s permission to tap the Charleston subsidiary, which had taken on more than $600 million of assets backing customers&#8217; life insurance policies that year, for deals akin to &#8220;reverse repurchases&#8221; -- short-term influxes of cash to fund Goldman Sachs&#8217; trading, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who requested anonymity because the unit&#8217;s investments are confidential. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The evaporation of such funding, in the midst of a financial panic that year, would contribute to the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and the forced sale of Bear Stearns Cos. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;South Carolina rejected Goldman&#8217;s proposal, and also rescinded an earlier approval for a similar plan, said the person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Richardson, South Carolina&#8217;s insurance commissioner at the time, confirmed he rejected a Goldman Sachs proposal. The department had grown stricter since Csiszar&#8217;s tenure, especially after a few of the newly established companies ran into trouble, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;When Ernie first started it, of course, it was new. We were sort of the new kid on the block,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We went out and did some things we probably shouldn&#8217;t have done.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Move to D.C. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Around that time, Goldman Sachs sought help on an insurance matter from the governor&#8217;s office, which refused to intervene, said Scott English, then Sanford&#8217;s chief of staff. A person close to the company said no one in its insurance group recalls the conversation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs soon found another way around the South Carolina roadblock: moving to the District of Columbia. &#8220;It is not surprising we would choose to relocate to the District of Columbia once South Carolina reversed itself,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like South Carolina, the district was advertising itself as a haven for captive insurers such as Goldman Sachs&#8217;s. Thomas Hampton, the Washington commissioner at the time, said Kitzman led talks with him. Hampton said he agreed to allow the investments that South Carolina prohibited, after reviewing them with his staff. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s arrival &#8220;was great,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It not only brought revenue here, but payroll taxes and everything else.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kitzman, now Texas insurance commissioner, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Global Atlantic &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In D.C., Goldman Sachs borrowed a small amount of money from its insurance unit through the same strategy that South Carolina rejected, the firm said in the statement. It said two such trades were secured by assets and never amounted to more than 2 percent of its overall insurance portfolio. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is now shutting down its D.C. insurance operation. The unit is a small part of the firm&#8217;s insurance group, known as Global Atlantic. Apart from the D.C. trades, Global Atlantic has always had a &#8220;traditional&#8221; investing strategy, the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two years after Goldman Sachs exited South Carolina, Apollo&#8217;s insurance unit, Athene, arrived. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Athene Unit &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Founded by billionaires Leon Black, Josh Harris, and Marc Rowan, Apollo decided after the credit crisis in 2008 to buy beaten-down bonds and illiquid mortgage-backed securities at distressed prices through an insurance company, Rowan said on a conference call last year. Investing policyholders&#8217; money alongside its own would magnify returns, employing &#8220;a significant amount of leverage,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Run by Belardi, a Californian who twice competed in Olympic swim trials and had been a top executive at SunAmerica Financial Group Inc., Athene took on its first major deal in October 2010, agreeing to acquire Liberty from Royal Bank of Canada for about $600 million. Founded in 1919 by a salesman named Frank Hipp, Liberty had its roots selling policies to workers in Greenville&#8217;s textile mills. Hipp&#8217;s heirs sold the company to RBC in 2000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Athene agreement was the start of &#8220;rather extensive negotiations&#8221; with South Carolina insurance regulators, according to Thomas W. Cooper, a retired judge who oversaw the months-long approval process. Apollo resubmitted its proposal four times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sufficient Safeguards &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most of the time was spent trying to get the buyer to satisfy the department that there were sufficient safeguards,&#8221; Cooper said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athene eventually agreed in April 2011 to limit Liberty&#8217;s investments in junk-rated securities; to maintain Liberty&#8217;s capital levels, including by contributing more capital if necessary; to submit a quarterly liquidity report; to pay for the department to hire an actuary to monitor the company&#8217;s health; and to appoint three independent directors to the board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athene also said Liberty would &#8220;continue operations in South Carolina.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Less than five months later, Athene switched Liberty&#8217;s legal address to Delaware. Liberty&#8217;s headquarters remains in Greenville, South Carolina, and it does less than 1 percent of its business in Delaware. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athene was in the process of buying a smaller insurer in Delaware, and state officials &#8220;did the right things, we thought, as far as encouraging businesses to be there,&#8221; Belardi said. &#8220;We wanted one regulator. We liked them better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Delaware Transfer &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a condition of the transfer, South Carolina officials insisted that Delaware keep all the conditions that had just been negotiated as part of the Liberty takeover unless it hired an outside expert to affirm they weren&#8217;t necessary. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Delaware did so and dropped some of the conditions, said Nicole Brittingham, an insurance department official. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athene&#8217;s own internal guidelines are &#8220;stricter than any regulator was talking about with us,&#8221; Belardi said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Athene took over Liberty Life, Dodd and the rest of the company&#8217;s investment team were replaced by a group overseen by Belardi in Manhattan Beach, California. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new group replaced Liberty&#8217;s conservative portfolio with more exotic -- though still mostly highly-rated -- securities. Out went most of Liberty&#8217;s state and municipal bonds, and its mortgage securities backed by government-sponsored firms like Fannie Mae. In came mortgage securities without a guarantee. Because they had declined in value when the U.S. housing boom ended, Liberty could buy them at a discount. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mezzanine Loans &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Liberty, which changed its name last year to Athene Annuity  Life Assurance Co., also embraced collateralized debt obligations, complicated products backed by pools of assets like mortgages or high-yield loans. In commercial real estate, it added mezzanine loans from Tucson, Arizona, to Tampa, Florida, which are the first to default if property owners can&#8217;t pay their debts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lower-yielding bonds from the biggest U.S. companies were deemphasized. The new additions included $9 million in securities backed by Wyndham Worldwide Corp. timeshare vacation homes in resorts. Plus: $1.2 million in bonds to modernize a Soviet-era railroad owned by the Kazakhstan government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Whitney McFerron" date="Apr 23, 2013  1:03 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-23/goldman-cuts-commodities-outlook-and-exits-wager-on-lower-gold.html"><headline>Goldman Cuts Commodity Outlook as It Exits Bet on Gold Drop</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its &#8220;near-term&#8221; outlook for commodities and reduced forecasts for oil and coffee amid prospects for weak demand from China to Europe. The bank also exited a bet on lower gold prices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lowered its three- and 12-month return forecasts for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities to 2.5 percent, from 6 percent in three months and 3 percent in 12 months, and cut its near-term outlook on commodities to neutral from overweight, according to the report, dated today. It exited its bet on lower gold prices, with a potential gain of 10 percent, while saying bullion may fall even more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Commodity returns have dropped sharply so far in April as weaker-than-expected macroeconomic data releases in the U.S., Europe and China furthered concerns around global economic growth,&#8221; New York-based analyst Samantha Dart said in the report. &#8220;The negative sentiment in the market has weighed on cyclical commodity prices in particular.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The GSCI index slid as much as 1.1 percent today as a report showed Chinese manufacturing expanded at a slower-than- expected pace, providing more evidence of a pullback in the country&#8217;s economic growth. Commodities, which touched a nine- month low on April 18, are down 6.4 percent this year. Treasuries returned 0.7 percent, according to an index calculated by Bank of America Corp., and the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities gained 6.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latam Airlines SA (LAN), Latin America&#8217;s
worst-performing carrier this year, rose to a four-week high as
JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised its recommendation on the stock from
the equivalent of sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latam advanced 1.7 percent to 10,300 pesos at 12:13 p.m. in
Santiago, the highest price since March 27 on a closing basis.
The benchmark Ipsa index increased 0.4 percent. The airline&#8217;s
American depositary receipts gained 1.2 percent to $21.53. Both
the Chilean shares and ADRs fell 10 percent this year through
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan increased its rating to the equivalent of hold,
saying the stock&#8217;s drop in 2013 gives it room to rise toward the
bank&#8217;s target price, analysts Fernando Abdalla, Jamie Baker and
Carlos Louro wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. They forecast
that the ADR&#8217;s will reach $25 by December. Latam was formed last
year from Lan Airlines SA&#8217;s $3.3 billion takeover of Brazil&#8217;s
Tam SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We still believe that the current valuation premium to
its Latin American peers is a bit excessive due to execution
risks related to the Lan/Tam integration,&#8221; the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latam&#8217;s enterprise value trades at 12.5 times earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and rentals, or
Ebitdar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The ratio is
67 percent higher than the average of five Latin American
airlines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Hannam, the former JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) banker advising mining companies, has joined
corporate-advisory firm Strand Partners Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam, 57, started with Strand Partners this month,
according to the Financial Services Register records. His
private firm Elgin Partners has bought Strand Partners,
according to Financial News, which reported the story earlier.
Hannam declined to comment when contacted by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam, a former JPMorgan chairman of equity-capital
markets, stepped down in April last year to appeal a decision by
the U.K.&#8217;s financial-services regulator to fine him 450,000
pounds ($686,000) for market abuse. He e-mailed a potential
customer in 2008 with details of a bid for his client Heritage
Oil Plc (HOIL), as well as news of an oil find, it said at the time.
Hannam said in a statement then he would appeal and planned to
continue his financial career after the dispute is over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based in London, Hannam was among bankers advising Xstrata
Plc (XTA), the subject of a bid by Glencore International Plc (GLEN) last
year. At JPMorgan, which also served as a broker to Xstrata,
Hannam helped the mining company first sell shares in 2002, and
was involved in many of its subsequent transactions, including

&lt;p&gt;Arabica-coffee futures fell the
most in seven weeks on speculation that ample supply in Brazil,
the world&#8217;s leading producer and exporter, will compensate for
production losses from a fungal disease in Central America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its price forecasts for the
beans favored by Starbucks Corp. (SBUX), citing improving prospects for
the 2013 crop in Brazil, the bank&#8217;s analyst Damien Courvalin,
said today in an e-mailed report. As of March 31, farmers in the
South American country sold 75 percent of the most recent
harvest compared with 86 percent a year earlier, Porto Alegre,
Brazil-based consulting firm Safras  Mercado estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This improving Brazilian production outlook offsets
additional downward revision to Central American production, on
damages from the leaf rust fungus,&#8221; Courvalin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee for delivery in July tumbled 3.2 percent to
$1.385 a pound at 10:57 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
heading for the biggest drop since March 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices will be at $1.45 in three, six and 12 months,
Goldman said. That is down from previous forecasts of $1.55,
$1.65 and $1.75, respectively, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roche Holding AG (ROG) will dissolve its
Applied Science unit as it sees further price pressure and
funding cuts in life-science research and said it&#8217;s ended an
alliance with International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss drugmaker said its polymerase chain reaction
technology and nucleic acid product lines business will become
part of its Molecular Diagnostics unit. The custom biotechnology
portfolio will join the Professional Diagnostics business, while
the company will create a unit to focus solely on sequencing,
the Basel-based drugmaker said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reorganization will affect 110 jobs in Penzberg,
Germany and 60 in Branford, Connecticut, Roche said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roche and IBM agreed in July 2010 to try to make genome
sequencing for medical purposes cheaper and more common. The
drugmaker said today it had ended its partnership with IBM for
the development of a nanopore-based sequencing platform, due to
high technical risks involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roche said its outlook for 2013 remains unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) won approval to
release &#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; in China on May 3, offering a separate
version aimed at enhancing the film&#8217;s appeal in the world&#8217;s
second-largest movie market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release date for the picture, produced by Disney&#8217;s
Marvel unit and Beijing-based DMG Entertainment, was announced
yesterday in an e-mail. &#8220;Iron Man 3,&#8221; one of the company&#8217;s big
summer films, opens the same the day in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retooled version of &#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; will highlight
Chinese actors and include additional China footage, according
to the company. Burbank, California-based Disney, along with
other studios, is trying to meet local tastes and satisfy a
censorship board. A simultaneous release in both countries
reduces the risk of piracy cutting into sales in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are very few foreign films that get that
opportunity,&#8221; said Robert Cain, a film producer and consultant
for studios working in China. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t allow any time for
piracy to eat into &#8216;Iron Man 3&#8217; grosses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. opening of &#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; has been clouded by a
dispute between Disney and large U.S. and Canadian cinema
operators over how ticket revenue will be shared. Regal
Entertainment Group, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., Cinemark
Holdings Inc. and Toronto-based Cineplex Inc. aren&#8217;t offering
advance sales during negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cobalt International Energy Inc. (CIE),
the oil explorer that doubled in value since going public in
2009, is turning into a takeover target for energy companies
attracted to its oil finds from Africa to the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt has been buoyed by offshore crude discoveries that
Global Hunter Securities LLC says could yield a total drilling
potential of as much as 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
That would be equivalent to almost all of the proved reserves of
OPEC member Ecuador, according to data compiled by BP Plc. (BP/)
Larger energy companies such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) may be
drawn by the chance to bolster crude resources, said Capital One
Southcoast Inc. Suitors also may include Chevron Corp., Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) or ConocoPhillips (COP), said Guggenheim Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Houston-based Cobalt has handed investors more than
triple the gains of the Russell 1000 Energy Index since its
initial public offering, the $11 billion explorer still trades
at a 33 percent discount to the value of its underlying assets,
according to data and analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
With analysts projecting Cobalt&#8217;s stock will rise another 43
percent in the next 12 months, Stifel Financial Corp. said now
may be the time for a buyer to make a move on Cobalt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, sold $2 billion of 10-year subordinated
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank issued the 3.375 percent notes due May 2023 to
yield 175 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They may be rated A3 by
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, said a person familiar with the
offering, who asked not to be identified because the terms
weren&#8217;t set at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the offering will be used for general
corporate purposes, including debt repayment, investments in its
units, redemption of securities or funding possible
acquisitions, according to a company filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s $750 million of 6.125 percent subordinated bonds

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) plans a &#8220;special
unveiling&#8221; related to the Xbox, suggesting that the world&#8217;s
biggest software maker use the event to introduce the latest
version of its game console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event will be held at Microsoft&#8217;s Redmond, Washington,
headquarters, according to the e-mailed invitation. It will also
be shown online, via the Xbox Live service and the Spike TV
network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software maker is planning a new version of the console
to maintain its 27-month lead over Sony Corp. (6758) and Nintendo Co.
in a market projected to expand to $70 billion in 2017. It&#8217;s
also adding features to the Xbox designed to help it withstand
the shift to games downloaded to computers and mobile devices
from packaged products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will &#8220;share our vision for Xbox and give you a
real taste of the future,&#8221; Larry Hryb, the Director of Xbox
Programming who goes by the name Major Nelson, on his official
Xbox blog. He said Microsoft will will continue to discuss its
plans and show its games lineup in May at the E3 show in Los
Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will use an Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) processor
in the next Xbox game console, seeking to cut the cost of
building machines and get developers to create more titles,
people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.
Xbox has led console sales in the U.S. for the last 27 months,
according to market-research firm NPD Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Competitor Consoles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4, the newest version of its
own console, in February and plans to release it in time for the
holiday shopping season. Microsoft had considered holding its
event in April and scrapped that plan, people familiar with the
matter said earlier this month. The company saw little
competitive pressure from Sony&#8217;s announcement, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintendo&#8217;s Wii U, another competitor, has been selling
below the company&#8217;s initial forecasts. In January, the company
said it expected to sell 4 million units in the fiscal year
ending March 31, down from a previous outlook for 5.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional console makers face competition from cheaper
machines like Ouya Inc.&#8217;s online gaming device, and changes in
game play that favor inexpensive titles for mobile devices such
as Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPads and Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Tab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. retail sales of packaged video games fell 21 percent
last year to $8.9 billion, according to researcher NPD Group,
while revenue from games downloaded to computers and mobile
devices rose 16 percent to $5.9 billion. Globally, the market
including hardware and accessories was $67 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braskem SA, Latin America&#8217;s largest
petrochemicals maker, rose to a two-year high as Citigroup Inc. (C)
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) recommended buying the stock after the
government cut taxes for the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares gained 3.2 percent to 16.70 reais at 1:38 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the highest since
September 2011. The Ibovespa stock benchmark added 0.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian government temporarily reduced a tax on raw
materials used in the chemical industry to 1 percent from 5.6
percent, effective May 1. The levy will be gradually restored
through 2018, Finance Minister Guido Mantega told reporters in
Brasilia yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change should boost Braskem&#8217;s earnings excluding
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 650 million
reais ($321 million) this year, according to Citigroup, which
raised its recommendation from sell. JPMorgan analysts Caio Carvalhal and Felipe dos Santos lifted their rating from hold,
citing a benefit from the tax stimulus that &#8220;is not fully
priced into Braskem shares, leaving room for further upside,&#8221;
according to a research note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sao Paulo-based company&#8217;s Ebitda fell to 3.5 billion
reais in 2012 from 3.6 billion reais in 2011, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The shares have gained 30 percent this year,
while the Ibovespa declined 9.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mount Kellett Capital Management
LP, the investment firm founded by two former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) executives, plans to raise a new fund matching the $4
billion gathered in 2012 by its last global special-situations
vehicle, according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Kellett Capital Partners Fund III is targeting a
first close in the third quarter, said the people, who asked not
to be identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. The firm
has selected Park Hill Group LLC, the placement agent arm of
Blackstone Group LP, to help raise money, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Kellett, based in New York, will be joining a
competitive fundraising market in which private-equity firms are
vying for a limited pool of investor money. A record 1,949 funds
were seeking $797.1 billion as of the end of last year,
according to data by London-based researcher Preqin Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Gagnier, a spokesman at Sard Verbinnen  Co., declined
to comment on fundraising plans on behalf of Mount Kellett. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Kellett, which manages about $7 billion, makes
opportunistic and special-situations investments globally across
asset classes, industries and geographies, according to the
firm&#8217;s website. Special-situations investments typically involve
companies going through an unusual event such as a spinoff,
financial restructuring or bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s investments include private equity, corporate
debt, secured loans, convertible bonds, preferred and common
shares, real estate and commercial mortgages, according to its
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suntech Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Kellett purchased Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg in
February from hotel operator Accor SA (AC) for 113 million euros
($147 million). As of December, the firm was among the largest
bondholders of Shanghai-based solar manufacturer Suntech Power
Holdings Co. (STP), which entered bankruptcy last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm took more than a year to raise Fund II, which
closed in March 2012. The fund was producing a net internal rate
of return of 0.5 percent and about 70 percent of the money
raised was invested as of Dec. 31, according to a person briefed
on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark McGoldrick and Jason Maynard founded Mount Kellett in
2008. McGoldrick was co-founder and head of the special-
situations group at Goldman Sachs from 1997 to 2007. Maynard was
previously the head of the Asia special-situations business at
Goldman Sachs. Nick Weber, who leads Mount Kellett&#8217;s European
business, also came from Goldman Sachs, where he was co-head of
the European special situations group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese pensions are selling
domestic bonds as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&#8217;s efforts to spur
inflation stoke concern rising interest rates will erode the
value of their holdings, a JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retirement funds held 29 percent of their assets in
Japanese bonds at the end of March, down from about 31 percent
the previous year, a survey by JPMorgan&#8217;s Tokyo-based asset
management unit showed. Alternative asset holdings including
hedge funds increased 2.3 percentage points to 11.8 percent,
according to the survey, which was based on 128 pension plans
overseeing a total 11.7 trillion yen ($117 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese pension funds, which have traditionally invested
mainly in bonds, are seeking other assets to maintain steady
returns and fund retiree benefits in the world&#8217;s most rapidly
aging society. The country&#8217;s public pension fund and insurers
including Nippon Life Insurance Co. plan to cut their JGB
holdings after Abe&#8217;s called for unlimited money printing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Abenomics is changing their attitude toward risk,&#8221; said
Hidenori Suzuki, the head of the strategic advisory group at
JPMorgan Asset Management (Japan) Ltd. in Tokyo. &#8220;It&#8217;s become
clear that pension funds are reducing domestic bond holdings and
adding assets with higher returns such as foreign bonds and
alternative investments, as they become more concerned about
interest rate increases from monetary easing measures.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Currency Hedges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations for action by Abe&#8217;s administration and the BOJ
have led the Topix index of shares to rally 61 percent and the
yen to slump 24 percent against the dollar in the past five
months. The yield on Japan&#8217;s 10-year government bonds will rise
to 0.92 percent by September 2014 from 0.595 percent as
inflation picks up, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pension funds are also planning to raise infrastructure
investments, while increasing foreign exchange hedging, the
survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government Pension Investment Fund, one of the biggest
buyers of JGBs, said in February that it may reduce its holdings
of the bonds and buy more emerging market stocks and alternative
assets on concern Abe&#8217;s policies will reduce its returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nippon Life Insurance, Japan&#8217;s biggest life insurer, said
earlier this week it may buy more foreign debt and cut holdings
of long-term domestic securities if yields in Japan stay low. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raymond James Financial Inc., the
brokerage that posted profits for 100 straight quarters, is
showing investors that simplicity is key to generating gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With headquarters 1,200 miles from Wall Street, the St.
Petersburg, Florida-based company produced the best risk-
adjusted return of nine U.S. brokerages, banks and advisory
firms since 2009, the BLOOMBERG RISKLESS RETURN RANKING shows.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, ranked third as
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley (MS) were among the worst performers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors compare Raymond James, which has a business model
that&#8217;s easy to grasp and shields the balance sheet from risk, to
an asset manager as it mainly relies on fees. Unlike larger
rivals, the brokerage gets most of its sales managing investor
money, earning 64 percent of annual revenue in the last fiscal
year from its private-client group. That gave Raymond James the
stability to weather a financial crisis that caused larger banks
to write off billions of dollars in loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You threw everything but the kitchen sink at the
financial-services industry and this company sailed through
rather successfully,&#8221; said Dan Veru, chief investment officer
at Palisade Capital Management LLC, which owns Raymond James
shares and manages $3.8 billion. &#8220;That largeness that used to
be an advantage, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s such an advantage anymore.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s rheumatoid arthritis
pill failed to win the backing of European drug regulators, who
said the drug already approved in the U.S. isn&#8217;t effective
enough against the condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Medicines Agency&#8217;s Committee for Medicinal
Products for Human Use, or CHMP, recommended that Pfizer&#8217;s pill
Xeljanz not be approved for sale, the New York-based drugmaker
said today in a statement. The drug gained marketing clearance
in the U.S. in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer intends to appeal this opinion and immediately
seek a re-examination of the opinion by the CHMP,&#8221; the company
said. The committee decided the drug didn&#8217;t show a favorable
risk versus benefit profile, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xeljanz inhibits part of the immune system that can cause
rheumatoid arthritis. The first of a new type of therapies for
the disease, the pill is one of Pfizer&#8217;s top new products. If
approved in Europe, it may generate sales of $510 million there
by 2018, according to Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with
International Strategy  Investment Group in New York. The
medicine would compete with AbbVie Inc.&#8217;s Humira (ABBV) and Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ)&#8217;s Remicade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer will appeal, but history teaches that odds are
against them,&#8221; Schoenebaum said today in a note to clients.
More data might help Pfizer on appeal, which may take six
months, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comittee&#8217;s View &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European regulators said the drug didn&#8217;t show enough
effectiveness in reducing the disease&#8217;s activity in the body or
slowing damage to joints, even though it improved symptoms,
Pfizer said. There were also concerns about side effects
including tumors and infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission usually adopts the committee&#8217;s
advice, though it isn&#8217;t required to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares declined 2.4 percent to $29.53 in extended
trading at 5:50 p.m. New York time after the announcement. The
shares closed at $30.26 today and have gained 32 percent in the
past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;

from trading, sold $1.25 billion of five-year, floating-rate
notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds pay 120 basis points more than the quarterly
London interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with a spread of 125 basis points for
$700 million of similar-maturity floating-rate debt that the New
York-based lender issued in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those securities, rated A3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and
A- at Standard  Poor&#8217;s, traded yesterday at 100.6 cents on the
dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow in
dollars from each other, was set at 27.6 basis points today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), one of four U.S.
companies with a top credit rating from Standard  Poor&#8217;s and
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, sold $2.67 billion of bonds with a
portion of euro-denominated debt paying a record-low coupon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker issued bonds in euros
for the first time, raising 550 million euros ($715 million)
with 20-year, 2.625 percent notes, the lowest coupon among
similar-maturity, non-financial corporate bonds sold in that
currency, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt pays
55 basis points more than swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the company also sold $450 million of 1
percent, five-year securities that pay 32 basis points more than
Treasuries, $1 billion of 2.375 percent, 10-year notes that
yield an extra 70 basis points and $500 million of 3.75 percent,
30-year bonds that pay a spread of 90. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds may be used to fund working capital, stock
repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said today in separate filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The debt is opportunistic and helps us lower the overall
cost of capital,&#8221; said Peter Wootton, a spokesman for
Microsoft. The pricing &#8220;in Europe is very attractive in this
20-year tenor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s $14.3 billion of outstanding bonds before
today&#8217;s sale include $750 million of 2.125 percent notes due
November 2022 that traded at 98.5 cents on the dollar April 23
to yield 2.3 percent, or 60.2 basis points more than Treasuries,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While average yields on investment-grade corporate debt
have dropped 8 basis points to 2.69 percent since Microsoft last
issued bonds in November, the company&#8217;s new dollar securities
were priced with higher coupons than those in the previous
offering, according to Bloomberg and Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, along with Johnson  Johnson, Exxon Mobil Corp.
and Automatic Data Processing Inc., are rated Aaa by Moody&#8217;s and
AAA at SP. Fitch Ratings ranks the company a level lower at
AA+. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,
the second-largest U.S. cinema chain, settled a revenue-sharing
dispute with Walt Disney Co. (DIS) over &#8220;Iron Man 3,&#8221; leaving two
big U.S. chains in a stalemate over the first big summer movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are available for showings starting at 9 p.m. on
May 2, Kansas City, Missouri-based AMC Entertainment said today
in an e-mailed statement. Terms of the revenue-sharing agreement
weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We thank our partners at Disney for working with us to
achieve economical terms so we can present our guests with one
of the biggest blockbusters of 2013 and solidly kick off the
summer movie season,&#8221; AMC said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the accord, Disney has reached agreement with one of
the three largest U.S. chains, which have resisted the studio&#8217;s
demand for a bigger share of ticket sales. Discussions are under
way with Regal Entertainment Group (RGC), the No. 1 U.S. chain, and a
deal may be reached today, according to a person with knowledge
of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, which also plans to release &#8220;Monsters
University,&#8221; &#8220;The Lone Ranger&#8221; and &#8220;Planes&#8221; this summer,
has focused on big-budget movies since buying Pixar, Marvel and
Lucasfilm. Such films typically command a larger share of the
box-office take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&#8216;Iron Man&#8217; is going to be a hit no matter what, but you
don&#8217;t want this kind of tension going into the most lucrative
part of the year.&#8221; Phil Contrino, chief analyst for researcher
Boxoffice.com, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a relief.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Movie&#8217;s Open &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinemark Holdings Inc. (CNK), the third-largest U.S. chain,
wasn&#8217;t selling tickets today through the website Fandango. As of
yesterday, Cineplex Inc. (CGX), the largest exhibitor based in Canada,
also wasn&#8217;t selling tickets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrino estimates &#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; will take in $151 million
in its opening weekend, better than 2010&#8217;s &#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221; and
below last year&#8217;s top-grossing film, &#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers,&#8221;
which generated $207.4 million domestically its opening weekend.
Contrino said the slate of movies being released in May could
lift results in the second-quarter above last year&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Roeder, a spokesman for Burbank, California-based
Disney, didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, added
0.1 percent to $62 at the close in New York. The shares have
climbed 25 percent this year. Regal, based in Knoxville,
Tennessee, added 1.4 percent to $17.66. Cinemark, based in
Plano, Texas, added 0.7 percent to $29.10. AMC is owned by
China&#8217;s Dalian Wanda Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summer Season &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer accounted for $4.3 billion, or almost 40 percent of
last year&#8217;s record $10.8 billion in ticket revenue in the U.S.
and Canada, according to the researcher BoxOfficeMojo.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, studios get about 52 percent of ticket revenue
after cinema operators deduct a small percentage for overhead,
according to Eric Wold, an analyst at B. Riley  Co. in San
Francisco. Bigger movies may command more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney has asked for as much as 65 percent of the revenue,
the Los Angeles Times has reported. The newspaper reported the
agreement with AMC earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Inyoung Hwang and Lu Wang" date="Apr 25, 2013  4:38 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-25/u-s-stock-futures-little-changed-before-exxon-earnings.html"><headline>U.S. Stocks Rise Amid Jobless Claims, Earnings Reports</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, extending a rally
in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to a fifth day, as earnings
from United Parcel Services Inc. to Cliffs Natural Resources
Inc. topped estimates and jobless claims fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cliffs Natural soared 15 percent and UPS climbed 2.3
percent. Akamai (AKAM) Technologies Inc. rose 18 percent as revenue and
profit beat estimates. 3M Co. (MMM) slid 2.8 percent as profit trailed
forecasts and the company cut its full-year outlook amid a
slowing global economy. Qualcomm Inc. lost 5.4 percent after
forecasting profit that may miss some analysts&#8217; projections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 (SPX) advanced 0.4 percent to 1,585.16 in New York.
The gauge has risen 2.8 percent since April 18. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average climbed 24.50 points, or 0.2 percent, to
14,700.80 today. Almost 6.8 billion shares traded hands today,
or 6 percent more than the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The majority of companies are continuing to beat
expectations, so that&#8217;s a good sign,&#8221; Peter Jankovskis, who
helps oversee $3 billion as co-chief investment officer of
Lisle, Illinois-based Oakbrook Investments LLC, said by
telephone. &#8220;The jobless claims were better-than-expected, so
that&#8217;s providing some support.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 59 SP 500 companies post earnings today. Of the 237
index members that have published results so far in this
reporting season, 73 percent have exceeded analysts&#8217; earnings
estimates while 56 percent missed on revenue, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit at SP 500 companies dropped 1.1 percent in the
first three months of the year, according to analyst forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg. That would mark the first year-over-year
decrease since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jobless Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications for jobless benefits fell by 16,000 to 339,000
in the week ended April 20, according to Labor Department data
released today in Washington. Economists in a Bloomberg survey
had a median estimate of 350,000 claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.K., the economy grew 0.3 percent in the first
quarter, more than economists forecast, avoiding a triple-dip
recession. Twenty-four of 40 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
expect the European Central Bank to cut its benchmark interest
rate by a quarter percentage point to 0.5 percent next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has surged 134 percent from a 12-year low in
2009 as corporate earnings beat analyst estimates and the
Federal Reserve embarked on three rounds of bond purchases to
spur economic growth. The benchmark gauge is within eight points
of an all-time high of 1,593.37 reached on April 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debate Shifting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central bank policy makers have been voicing support for
extending record stimulus as inflation cools and 11.7 million
Americans remain jobless. That marks a shift from last month&#8217;s
meeting, when the bankers debated the timing of a possible
reduction in bond buying. The Federal Open Market Committee will
meet April 30-May 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is really looking at continued easing by the
Fed,&#8221; Greg Woodard, a portfolio strategist at Manning  Napier
in Fairport, New York, said by phone. His firm had $45.2 billion
under management at the end of 2012. &#8220;They&#8217;re looking for
signals of when the Fed is going to start to reverse that. Our
view is that probably it&#8217;s going to be some time away.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), or
VIX, increased 0.1 percent to 13.62. The CBOE opened for trading
three-and-a-half hours late today after a problem with its
computer systems shut the derivatives market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine out of 10 industries in the SP 500 advanced as phone
and raw-materials companies climbed the most, rising at least 1
percent. Energy companies slumped 0.2 percent as a group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cliffs Natural &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cliffs Natural jumped the most in four years, adding 15
percent to $20.95. The largest U.S. iron-ore producer idled some
mines to reduce operating costs in the first quarter and
adjusted earnings beat analysts&#8217; forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPS climbed 2.3 percent to $85.42. The world&#8217;s largest
package-delivery company posted higher first-quarter earnings
than analysts estimated as deliveries of online purchases
increased. The company handles more than 16 million packages and
envelopes a day worldwide, making it a bellwether for the
economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai, which helps customers deliver online content
faster, had the biggest gain in the SP 500. The stock surged 18
percent to $42.48 after the company reported first-quarter
revenue and profit that topped estimates as Internet traffic
increased more than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An index of homebuilders climbed 2.5 percent as all of its
11 members gained. PulteGroup Inc. jumped 5.6 percent to $20.79.
The largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue reported earnings that
beat analyst estimates as an accelerating housing recovery
fueled sales and led to higher prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dow Chemical &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical (DOW) Co. advanced 5.6 percent to $33.97. The
largest U.S. chemical maker by sales posted first-quarter profit
that beat analysts&#8217; estimates as lower prices for natural gas
increased earnings from plastics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biogen Idec Inc. added 4.8 percent to $216. The fourth-
largest U.S. biotechnology company by market value raised its
full-year forecast as first-quarter net income increased on a
tax benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regeneron (REGN) Pharmaceuticals Inc. advanced 2.9 percent to
$216.75. The maker of the eye medicine Eylea will replace
MetroPCS Communications Inc. in the SP 500 after the close of
trading on April 30, SP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M fell 2.8 percent, the steepest decline since October, to
$104.88. The maker of products ranging from Scotch tape to
dental braces reduced its annual earnings forecast after
quarterly profit trailed estimates for the first time in 1 1/2
years amid a slowing global economy. The company, which made 65
percent of 2012 revenue outside the U.S., gets fewer dollars
when converting sales from countries with weaker currencies into
its results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Qualcomm, Exxon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm (QCOM) lost 5.4 percent to $62.44. The biggest seller of
semiconductors for mobile phones forecast fiscal third-quarter
net income of 80 cents to 88 cents a share as average phone
prices come under pressure. Analysts on average had projected
earnings of 87 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. slipped 1.5 percent to $88.07, halting a
five-day gain of 3.9 percent. The world&#8217;s largest company by
market value said sales fell 12 percent to $108.8 billion in the
first quarter. Widening chemical margins made up for lower crude
production and prices, helping Exxon post an unexpected profit
increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuit (INTU) Inc. slid 11 percent to $57.09. The maker of tax and
financial-planning software cut its full-year earnings forecast.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. downgraded the shares to neutral from
overweight, the equivalent of a buy rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safeway Inc. tumbled 14 percent, the most since 2003, to
$24.32 after the grocer reported first-quarter same-store sales
that were lower than it previously estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zynga Inc. sank 6.5 percent to $3.13. The biggest maker of
online social games forecast second-quarter sales that may fall
short of some analysts&#8217; estimates as revenue from mobile titles
fails to make up for a drop in users playing its games on
Facebook Inc.&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sonja Elmquist" date="Apr 25, 2013  4:03 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-25/walter-says-initial-results-show-investors-elect-its-nominees.html"><headline>Walter Says Initial Results Show Its Nominees Were Elected</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) investors
rejected five nominees to its board proposed by activist
shareholder Audley Capital Advisors LLP, according to
preliminary results from Walter&#8217;s shareholder meeting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that all of Walter&#8217;s nominees were
elected, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said today in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audley had called on the producer of metallurgical coal to
reduce debt and corporate expenses to boost profit. It was the
second attempt by London-based Audley&#8217;s co-founder and Managing
Partner Julian Treger to compel change at Walter, which has
posted two consecutive quarterly losses and seen its shares drop
73 percent in the past year. Walter rose 0.9 percent to $17.98
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our campaign was critically important and highlighted the
issues facing the company, stimulated dialogue with stockholders
and has already resulted in some improvements at Walter,&#8221;
Treger said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, sold bonds in euros for the first time,
joining LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) and Nestle (NESN) SA in
taking advantage of record-low borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft raised 550 million euros ($719 million) from 20-
year notes, according to a person familiar with the transaction.
French luxury goods maker LVMH is marketing its first euro bonds
in two years, while Nestle, the world&#8217;s biggest food company,
sold its first securities in the currency since October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the busiest day in six weeks for issuance in Europe,
as non-financial companies sell 3.9 billion euros of bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average yield
investors demand to hold investment-grade corporate bonds in the
single currency has fallen to a record 1.84 percent, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are desperate for yield and there is not much to
find in the government market so they will jump into corporate
bonds,&#8221; said Thomas Kristiansson, head of credit fixed income
at SEB AB in Stockholm. &#8220;These deals are coming tight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft (MSFT)&#8217;s deal was priced to yield 55 basis points more
than swaps. The Redmond, Washington-based company is also
selling five-, 10- and 30-year bonds denominated in dollars,
according to the person, who asked not to be identified because
the details are private. Its the company&#8217;s first dollar sale
since November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest company by market value, said net income rose as
widening chemical margins made up for lower crude production and
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter profit was $9.5 billion, or $2.12 a share,
compared with $9.45 billion, or $2 a year earlier, the Irving,
Texas-based company said in statement today. Exxon was expected
to report per-share net income of $2.05, based on the average of
19 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson has been
acquiring North American gas and oil fields and expanding
exploration in Russia, Africa and the Gulf of Mexico to stem
production declines that the company has said will extend
through the end of this year. Exxon&#8217;s global output will fall 1
percent this year after dropping by 5.9 percent in 2012, the
company said in a March 6 slide presentation to analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon hasn&#8217;t turned new discoveries into producing fields
quickly enough to replace shrinking output from assets that have
been pumping oil and gas for decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s Kearl oil-sands development in Canada that is
expected to produce 3.2 billion barrels over the next three
decades has been beset by equipment-transport and weather
delays. The project was expected to produce its first batch of
pipeline-ready crude &#8220;within days,&#8221; Pius Rolheiser, a
spokesman for Exxon&#8217;s Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) unit, said on April 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Share Performance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon underperformed its biggest U.S. rival, Chevron Corp. (CVX),
and the broader market during the first quarter, advancing 4.1
percent. During that period, Chevron increased 9.9 percent and
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude demand declined or stagnated during the first three
months of the year in Europe&#8217;s largest economies as well as
Japan and South Korea, the Paris-based International Energy
Agency said in a March 13 report. Brent crude futures, the
benchmark for two-thirds of the world&#8217;s oil, averaged $112.61 a
barrel during the quarter, down 4.9 percent from $118.45 a year
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon relies on oil and gas sales outside the U.S. for 71
percent of its operating earnings, more than any major U.S. oil
producer aside from Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO), Paul Cheng, an analyst
at Barclays, said in an April 8 note to clients. Houston-based
Marathon counts on foreign oil and gas sales for 77 percent of
its operating earnings, according to Cheng. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gas Futures &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of lower crude prices was partly blunted by
higher gas prices in the U.S., where Exxon is the biggest
producer of the furnace and power-plant fuel. Gas futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange averaged $3.478 per million
British thermal units during the January-to-March period, up 39
percent from the year-earlier period, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Exxon became the pre-eminent U.S. gas supplier in
2010 after its $34.9 billion acquisition of XTO Energy Inc.
vaulted the company past Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s worldwide gas production will decline by 5 percent
this year, the company told analysts last month. Shares rose 0.2
percent to $89.43 yesterday in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
executive Fabrice Tourre lost a bid to bar a recorded 2007 phone
call from a July 15 trial of U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission claims that he misled investors in a collateralized
debt obligation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan today
rejected Tourre&#8217;s request to punish the SEC for its delay in
turning over the Jan. 17, 2007, recording of a call between
Goldman Sachs saleswoman Gail Kreitman and an employee of ACA
Management LLC by keeping it out of the trial. The SEC claimed
that Tourre tricked ACA into becoming the portfolio selection
agent for the CDO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Kreitman falsely told ACA, after talking with
Tourre, that the hedge fund Paulson  Co. planned to take a long
equity position in the CDO after helping select the assets
underlying the investment. Tourre knew that Paulson really
planned to take a short position, betting the value of the CDO
would drop, the SEC claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a mistake in my mind, and we are going to move
beyond it,&#8221; Forrest told lawyers for Tourre and the SEC in a
three-hour hearing. &#8220;The Jan. 17 call is going to come in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and Tourre in April 2010. The
investment bank agreed in July 2010 to pay
$550 million to settle the allegations against it. Tourre, 34,
who is studying for a doctorate in economics at the University
of Chicago, was present in the courtroom today. &lt;/p&gt;

(GOOG)&#8217;s Motorola Mobility unit isn&#8217;t entitled to the potentially billions of dollars it sought for its patents on technology used throughout the electronics community, a federal judge ruled in a victory for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft should pay about a half-cent per unit for video- decoding technology and 3 1/2 cents for wireless technology, U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle said in a decision made public yesterday. That equals about $1.8 million a year, Microsoft said, far less than the 2.25 percent of the retail price on Microsoft products Motorola Mobility initially demanded. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ruling marks a rare instance in which a U.S. court has set guidelines on how patent owners should value inventions on industrywide standards developed so devices running on different platforms can work together. Participants in these groups promise to license patents on &#8220;fair, reasonable and non- discriminatory&#8221; terms, an issue that has prompted inquiries by antitrust regulators on three continents involving companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and InterDigital Inc. (IDCC) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are not going to stop participating in standardization because of this -- it&#8217;s too important to the market,&#8221; said Jorge Contreras, an associate law professor at American University in Washington. He said the ruling will help bring some &#8220;disputes to a speedier close, potentially.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Standards Patents &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies meet to develop standards so, for instance, data can be sent to any smartphone no matter the manufacturer, or a video sent from one type of device can be watched on another. Companies that help establish the criteria gain an advantage in having their technology included in standards. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This decision is good for consumers because it ensures patented technology committed to standards remains affordable for everyone,&#8221; David Howard, deputy general counsel for Microsoft, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next step in the case is a trial in August to determine whether, based on the ranges set by Robart, Motorola Mobility met its contractual obligation to license its patents on fair terms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Motorola has licensed its substantial patent portfolio on reasonable rates consistent with those set by others in the industry,&#8221; Matt Kallman, a spokesman for Motorola Mobility, said in a statement after the ruling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the factors that must be considered, Robart decided, is what would be the total rate charged to manufacturers when added to amounts paid to other patent owners on the standard, and whether that would meet the goal of ensuring a standard gets wide acceptance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Public Interest &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;He acknowledges the public interest aspect of these calculations,&#8221; Contreras said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just two companies going to a back room and coming up with whatever they want to.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The judge also considered how valuable the patents are to the standard, and how valuable the standard is to the products involved in the dispute, the professor said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robart said the proper royalty range for the video-decoding technology, used in both the Xbox video-gaming system and Windows operating system, should be no more than 16.4 cents per unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility&#8217;s portfolio &#8220;only constitutes a sliver of the overall technology incorporated&#8221; into the standard, Robart said in his 207-page opinion. For the Wi-Fi portfolio, applicable to the Xbox, the upper rate would be 19.5 cents per unit, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Dispute&#8217;s Origins &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The dispute between Microsoft and Motorola Mobility, then a standalone company, began in 2010, when Redmond, Washington- based Microsoft demanded that Motorola Mobility pay patent royalties on its mobile phones that run on Google&#8217;s Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, which helped establish standards for technologies such as video decoding and Wi-Fi, responded by demanding that Microsoft pay royalties on the Windows operating system and Xbox. It sent letters in October 2010, demanding 2.25 percent on the retail price of the products. Microsoft, which reported $73.7 billion in 2012 revenue, has said the royalties would total more than $4 billion a year, a figure Motorola Mobility disputes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At trial, Robart&#8217;s decision says, Motorola Mobility&#8217;s expert testified that, when possible cross-licensing deals were taken into account, Microsoft would pay $36 million to $54 million in fiscal 2011, or a per unit rate of as much as $4.50 for the Wi-Fi technology in each Xbox. For the video-decoding patent, Motorola Mobility&#8217;s expert said the net payment would cap at no more than $125 million a year, or as much as 63 cents a unit, according to Robart&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Patent Pools &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Motorola Mobility focused on the possible outcome of negotiations between the two companies, Microsoft urged the judge to compare the rate charged by patent pools, in which a large number of companies get together and establish a single licensing rate for everyone. Robart mostly sided with Microsoft on this issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft had argued that, based on the different pools for those two standards patents, the proper royalty rate would be pennies per product, with the royalties on the standard for video compression totaling no more than $521,000 a year. It also contended the rate for wireless technology should be based on what it calls the smallest salable unit, meaning the Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) chips, which cost about $3. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Xbox Demand &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft argued the games -- not wireless technology -- drive demand for the Xbox. Motorola Mobility contended sales of the device fell when Microsoft failed to include Wi-Fi before 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility said it had originally charged licensees a flat rate of $9 per unit, and converted that to the 2.25 percent royalty at the request of companies that said falling phone prices were pushing the rate up. It said Microsoft refused to make a counteroffer, instead filing the breach-of-contract suit on which Robart ruled. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) made similar breach-of-contract allegations against Motorola Mobility in a case in federal court in Wisconsin. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb threw out the case last year after Apple said it wouldn&#8217;t abide by any royalty rate she set. Apple has filed an appeal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google, which bought Motorola Mobility last year, reached an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it wouldn&#8217;t seek to block sales of products that comply with industry standards. European regulators also are investigating Google&#8217;s use of the Motorola Mobility patents in litigation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case suit is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. Motorola Mobility Inc., 10cv1823, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Anchalee Worrachate" date="Apr 26, 2013 11:22 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-26/jpmorgan-sees-spanish-bond-gains-as-liquidity-fuels-rally-1-.html"><headline>JPMorgan Sees Spanish Bond Gains as Liquidity Fuels Rally</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Spanish and Italian bonds are
poised to extend gains as a recovery in liquidity lures
international investors back to the markets they fled during
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The periphery&#8217;s performance has been very strong this
year and we still expect to see more,&#8221; said Carl Norrey, the
head of European rates securities at JPMorgan Chase and Co. in
London in an interview on April 22. &#8220;Lower yields, less
volatility, tighter bid-offer spreads and more turnover breed
confidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish bonds have returned 21 percent since European
Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged on July 26 to do
&#8220;whatever it takes&#8221; to safeguard the monetary union, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Italy&#8217;s bonds gained 16 percent.
The nation&#8217;s two-year note yield dropped to a record low on
April 23 as it moved closer to appointing a new government after
inconclusive elections two months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between the yield at which traders say they will
buy and sell Spain&#8217;s benchmark 10-year bond narrowed to less
than two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, this week from
more than 12 basis points in June 2012, according to closing-
market data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average daily trading of Spanish government bonds increased
to 44 billion euros ($57 billion) in February from 36 billion
euros in December, according to data from Spain&#8217;s Treasury. The
share of securities held by overseas investors rose to 37.9
percent, from 33.5 percent in August. In 2011 it was more than
50 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conviction Trade &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain&#8217;s 10-year bond yield is headed for an eighth-straight
monthly decline, falling to 4.28 percent at 4:12 p.m. London
time today from 6.86 percent at the end of August. Italy&#8217;s 10-
year yield was at 4.07 percent today, from 5.85 percent on Aug.
31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It feels like the market is caught between respecting
that performance and not having huge conviction to necessarily
go long Italy or Spain,&#8221; said Norrey, referring to a bet that
the price of the securities will rise. &#8220;If you have a
resolution to a grand coalition in Italy in coming days, I see
no reason why we can&#8217;t end up having Italian yields at 3.50
percent to 3.75 percent in the next two-to-three weeks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy&#8217;s prime minister-designate Enrico Letta met
representatives from various political parties yesterday in a
bid to form a government. The country is still without a new
government after elections in February failed to produce a
conclusive result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian government bonds fell for a third day today after a
rally that took the 10-year yield below 4 percent for the first
time since November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market has a lot of momentum and every time this year
when there&#8217;s been a selloff in peripheral bonds, losses have
been reversed within a week,&#8221; Norrey said. &#8220;Over the last few
years, a lot of people have tried to have a maximum short
position in the periphery because they thought the euro zone
would fall apart,&#8221; he said, referring to bets the bonds would
drop. &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t happened and investors got hurt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world&#8217;s third-
biggest energy company by market value, reported first-quarter
profit that exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates after boosting natural
gas output amid rising prices for the fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income declined 4.5 percent to $6.18 billion, or $3.18
a share, from $6.47 billion, or $3.27, a year earlier, the San
Ramon, California-based company said in a statement today. The
per-share result was 8 cents higher than the average of 19
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s earnings from oil and gas wells outside the U.S.
rose 3.1 percent to $4.78 billion as increased gas output more
than offset lower crude production. In the U.S., the company
raised gas output from new wells in Appalachia&#8217;s Marcellus Shale
formation where most of the drilling costs are being borne by
India&#8217;s Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) under the terms of a joint-
venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron &#8220;is almost drilling for free out there, so when
you combine that with the prolific nature of the Marcellus, the
returns are high,&#8221; Allen Good, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. (MORN)
in Chicago, said in a telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total sales declined by 6.4 percent to $56.8 billion on
slumping oil prices. During the January-to-March period, Brent
crude futures fell 4.9 percent from a year earlier to average
$112.61 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose 1.3 percent to $120 at 11:13 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Increasing Production &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is spending $36.7 billion this year on exploration,
gas-export terminals and refinery upgrades from the Indian Ocean
to British Columbia after oil and gas output fell to a four-year
low in 2012. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson
has expanded the company&#8217;s onshore North American holdings and
last month said it will use intensive drilling techniques
perfected in U.S. shale formations to unlock crude reserves in
the deep-water Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s worldwide production increased 0.5 percent to
the equivalent of 2.65 million barrels of oil a day during the
first quarter, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the quarter, Chevron raised U.S. gas output by 7.3
percent as prices that touched a 10-year low in early 2012
surged 39 percent to an average of $3.48 per million British
thermal units during the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron entered the Marcellus Shale in 2011 with the
acquisition of Atlas Energy Inc. The transaction included a
previously-signed joint venture between Atlas and Reliance that
committed the Indian company to cover most of the drilling costs
in exchange for a stake in each well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outperforming Exxon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron expects oil and gas production to increase 1.5
percent this year to a daily average equivalent to 2.65 million
barrels a day, the company said in a slide presentation for
analysts on March 13. The outlook assumes an average crude price
of $112 a barrel for 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares advanced 9.9 percent during the first
quarter, outperforming bigger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), which
increased 4.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron reaps 70 percent of its operating earnings from oil
and gas sales outside the U.S., Paul Cheng, an analyst at
Barclays Plc, said in an April 8 note to clients. Among U.S.-
based international oil producers, only Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) and
Exxon gather a higher proportion of earnings overseas, according
to Cheng. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is the world&#8217;s largest energy company based on market
value, followed by PetroChina Co. (857), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three largest U.S. cinema
chains reached agreements to show Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s &#8220;Iron Man
3,&#8221; settling a revenue-sharing dispute that threatened the
first big film of the summer movie season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regal Entertainment Group (RGC), the largest, and No. 2 AMC
Entertainment Holdings Inc. were accepting online orders for the
May 3 opening of &#8220;Iron Man 3,&#8221; the companies said yesterday.
The No. 3 chain, Cinemark Holdings Inc. (CNK), also agreed to sell
tickets, according to a Disney spokesman. Terms weren&#8217;t
disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the accords, Disney&#8217;s Marvel unit and the exhibitors
avert a potentially costly dispute. The chains had resisted the
studio&#8217;s demand for a bigger share of ticket sales. &#8220;Iron Man
3&#8221; is projected to be one of the biggest movies of the year,
with opening weekend sales of $151 million in the U.S.,
according to Boxoffice.com. The summer season accounts for about
40 percent of annual domestic cinema sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We thank our partners at Disney for working with us to
achieve economical terms so we can present our guests with one
of the biggest blockbusters of 2013 and solidly kick off the
summer movie season,&#8221; AMC said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger has focused on
franchise pictures like &#8220;Toy Story,&#8221; &#8220;Iron Man&#8221; and &#8220;Star
Wars,&#8221; and is using its most popular films to seek better terms
from theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Negotiating Clout &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burbank, California-based company, which also plans to
release &#8220;Monsters University,&#8221; &#8220;The Lone Ranger&#8221; and
&#8220;Planes&#8221; this summer, has spent $15 billion since 2006
purchasing the Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm film studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big budget movies typically command a larger share of the
box-office take than the average for studios, which get about 52
percent of annual ticket revenue after cinema operators deduct a
small percentage for overhead, according to Eric Wold, an
analyst at B. Riley  Co. in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney had asked for as much as 65 percent of the revenue,
the Los Angeles Times reported this week. Cinemark spokesman
James Meredith didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment. The other
companies declined to discuss their negotiations in detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&#8216;Iron Man&#8217; is going to be a hit no matter what, but you
don&#8217;t want this kind of tension going into the most lucrative
part of the year.&#8221; Phil Contrino, chief analyst for researcher
Boxoffice.com, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a relief.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Movie&#8217;s Open &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; released in 2010, opened with $128.1
million in U.S. weekend sales, according to Box Office Mojo.
Last year&#8217;s top-grossing film, &#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers,&#8221;
generated $207.4 million. Contrino said the slate of movies
being released in May could lift results in the second quarter
above last year&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, was
little changed at $61.95 at 10:18 a.m. in New York. The shares
had climbed 25 percent this year through yesterday. Regal, based
in Knoxville, Tennessee, slipped 0.1 percent to $17.64.
Cinemark, in Plano, Texas, added less than 1 percent to $29.11.
AMC is owned by China&#8217;s Dalian Wanda Group Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer accounted for $4.3 billion of last year&#8217;s record
$10.8 billion in ticket revenue in the U.S. and Canada,
according to the researcher Box Office Mojo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold the first
structured notes tied to Hong Kong&#8217;s largest property trust in
more than 15 months, as rising rents in the city fuel gains in
real estate investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank on April 3 sold HK$4.5 million ($580,000) of
securities tied to The Link (823) Real Estate Investment Trust, Hong
Kong&#8217;s biggest REIT, and Wharf Holdings Ltd., the owner of the
Times Square and Harbour City malls, according to an e-mail from
the lender&#8217;s staff handling structured products in the city. The
product pays monthly coupons for days when the prices of the two
underlying assets remain in certain ranges, according to the e-
mailed response to queries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Link REIT, which owns and manages shopping centers and
parking spaces, and Wharf (4) both rose to all-time highs this
month. Average Hong Kong rents for prime shopping locations may
rise 8 percent this year, according to property broker CBRE
Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polly Leung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment on why the bank chose to link the notes to
the property investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc had last issued notes tied to the Link
REIT, along with other stocks, in December 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts by Google Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft
Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) to be excluded from U.S. cybersecurity
rules may become moot under a European Commission proposal that
could force them to report attacks and make their products more
secure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-mail providers, search engines, social networking
websites and companies specializing in electronic commerce would
have to comply with cybersecurity requirements to sell products
and services within the 27 countries of the European Union under
a directive proposed Feb. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration exempted products
like Google&#8217;s Gmail, Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone software and
Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system from a February executive
order aimed at improving cybersecurity in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some EU member states may enact stricter standards than
what the EU as a whole requires,&#8221; said Sanford Reback, director
of global business for Bloomberg Government, which released a
study today on the topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some U.S. companies may decide to comply with the
strictest EU standard adopted rather than have the operational
headache of trying to fine-tune their cybersecurity measures for
different markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet companies that successfully fought to be excluded
from Obama&#8217;s cybersecurity order aren&#8217;t giving in without a
fight in Europe. The European directive is &#8220;very challenging,&#8221;
Paul Nicholas, a senior director for Microsoft (MSFT), said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is lobbying European governments and plans to
convene a cybersecurity summit in June to discuss the issue, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Company Lobbying &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you create these types of specific requirements
country by country it tends to discourage people from building
global products and services,&#8221; Nicholas said. &#8220;Over time, that
can erode innovation and it also limits economic opportunities.
It reduces the number of markets that you can participate in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and European governments are advancing
cybersecurity policies to prevent electronic attacks from
disrupting banks, utilities, telecommunications networks and
financial services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet companies lobbied the White House to carve out an
exception for them when developing the executive order. The
Internet Association, a trade group whose members include
Google, Facebook Inc. and Amazon urged the White House and
Congress to &#8220;ensure that all Internet services are not subject
to regulation,&#8221; the group&#8217;s president, Michael Beckerman, said
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Competing Approaches &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission&#8217;s approach &#8220;seems overly
proscriptive,&#8221; said David LeDuc, senior director for public
policy at the Software  Information Industry Association in
Washington, which represents major companies like Oracle Corp. (ORCL),
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These types of policies would be exactly what you would
implement if you were trying to stifle innovation,&#8221; LeDuc said
in a phone interview. &#8220;It makes tons of sense in theory but
it&#8217;s a lot harder than it actually sounds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat of cyberattacks has become a greater concern
than terrorism, James Clapper, the top U.S. intelligence
official, told the House Intelligence Committee during an April
11 hearing. An April 23 hacking attack on the Associated Press&#8217;
Twitter Inc. account that erroneously said there were explosions
at the White House caused the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to
briefly lose $136 billion in market value before recovering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improving Security &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe has had its share of cyber crime, too. The Czech
Republic&#8217;s central bank said its website was temporarily knocked
offline March 6, and the European Commission cited a report that
the London Stock Exchange experienced a serious cyber attack in
2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission proposal includes Internet
companies &#8220;because it is absurd to work to protect critical
Internet infrastructure without obliging such companies to take
responsibility for their wider role in this ecosystem,&#8221; the
commission said in a Feb. 7 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet and technology companies would face security
requirements under the proposed directive because they provide
services and products vital to governments and the economy, and
are often targeted by hackers, the commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeDuc said companies believe the security standards will
constantly change, leading to uncertainty. &#8220;It takes quite
awhile to go through a process and identify what those standards
are,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Negotiations Continue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is watching the process in the European Commission
and hasn&#8217;t taken a formal position on its proposed directive, a
spokeswoman, Samantha Smith, said in an e-mail. Calls to Amazon
weren&#8217;t returned. Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directive will be vetted by European governments in the
coming months, James Lewis, technology program director at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington,
said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The chance for these things to fall off the rails is
always high,&#8221; Lewis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debate over how to improve cybersecurity also continues in
the U.S. Telecommunication companies like Verizon Communications
Inc. (VZ) have questioned why the Obama administration didn&#8217;t include
information technology products and consumer information
services as critical U.S. infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama&#8217;s order &#8220;is not about Netflix, Twitter, Facebook,
and Snapchat,&#8221; White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in
an e-mail at the time. It&#8217;s aimed at power grids,
telecommunications, pipelines and other vital infrastructure
whose incapacitation from a cyber attack would have national
security and economic implications, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If e-mail went away this afternoon, we would all come to
a stop,&#8221; said Marcus Sachs, vice president of national security
policy at Verizon, the second-largest U.S. phone company. &#8220;Hell
yeah, e-mail is critical.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects spelling of company name in 22nd paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Windows Azure software and related programs have surpassed $1 billion in annual sales for the first time, a sign of progress in the effort to challenge Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) in cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sales milestone for Azure -- which stores business information and programs on remote servers and lets customers access them over the Web -- was reached in the past 12 months, said Curt Anderson, finance chief for Microsoft&#8217;s server and tools unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the largest software maker, is counting on Azure and other Internet-based business programs to bolster growth as a global personal-computer slump erodes demand for Windows software installed on desktop machines. About 20 percent of companies tapping the cloud use Azure, compared with 71 percent usage for Amazon, according to James Staten, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. (FORR) Within a year, Microsoft can command as much as 35 percent, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I expect them to double annually from here,&#8221; Staten said of Microsoft&#8217;s Azure revenue. &#8220;Microsoft probably has more net new growth opportunity sitting in front of them than probably anyone in the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s $1 billion sales figure includes Azure, as well as software provided to partners to create related Windows cloud services, Anderson said in an interview. Azure customers use the services to run corporate programs, websites and applications from Microsoft&#8217;s data centers, rather than spending on their own servers, storage machines and workers to maintain them. &lt;/p&gt;

With the latest offering, Microsoft entered a niche known as Infrastructure as a Service, which lets companies move applications to the cloud by renting storage and servers -- instead of older versions of Azure that required customers to write programs from scratch. Close

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in San Francisco
tumbled to the lowest level in more than two weeks as Chevron
Corp. (CVX) started the crude unit at the Richmond refinery, the
largest in Northern California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond plant was feeding oil
into its only crude unit, shut after a fire Aug. 6, last week
and expected to increase production from other equipment in
&#8220;the coming days,&#8221; Jeff Gustavson, Chevron&#8217;s general manager
of investor relations, said in an quarterly earnings conference
call April 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco
dropped 13 cents to a premium of 9.5 cents a gallon against
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:16 p.m.
New York time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s
the lowest level for the fuel in the Bay since April 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)&#8217;s 165,000-barrel-a-day Martinez
refinery near San Francisco was also starting units after
finishing a maintenance turnaround, an April 25 notice filed
with Contra Costa County regulators showed. The plant shut units
in the light-oil processing section earlier this month for
planned repairs, a person familiar with the work said April 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in Los Angeles dropped 5.5 cents to a premium of 5
cents a gallon over Nymex futures, a three-week low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;El Segundo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 279,000-barrel-a-day El Segundo refinery, the largest
in California, has resumed normal rates after a maintenance
turnaround, Pat Yarrington, Chevron&#8217;s chief financial officer,
said in the earnings call April 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco&#8217;s premium to Los Angeles narrowed 7.5 cents
to 4.5 cents a gallon, the smallest spread in three days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles weakened
1.5 cents to a discount of 2.75 cents a gallon against ultra-
low-sulfur diesel futures on the Nymex, the lowest level since
Dec. 14. CARB diesel in San Francisco dropped 1.75 cents to 5.75
cents a gallon below futures, a three-month low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional gasoline in Portland, Oregon, jumped 4 cents
to 15 cents a gallon over Nymex futures, a two-month high. Low-
sulfur diesel there gained 1.75 cents against ULSD futures to a
premium of 2.5 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles narrowed a second
day, shrinking $3.39 to $13.80 a barrel at 4:17 p.m. New York
time. The spread, a rough indicator of refinery margins, is down
53 percent from this year&#8217;s high of $29.09 a barrel on Feb. 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) Chief Executive
Officer Myron Ullman received a $1.75 billion loan commitment
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and has been raising some prices
as he works to stanch the retailer&#8217;s cash drain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-year term loan will be secured by real estate and
an interest in other assets of the retailer, Plano, Texas-based
J.C. Penney said today in a statement. The proceeds will be used
for working capital and to discharge the company&#8217;s 7.125 percent
notes due in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ullman has focused on shoring up the company&#8217;s finances
since replacing Ron Johnson three weeks ago and started by
drawing $850 million from its credit line on April 15. He&#8217;s also
reversing Johnson&#8217;s avoidance of promotions and is raising some
prices more than 50 percent while dropping some back down later
to give the appearance of a discount, according to a study today
from JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loan takes &#8220;liquidity concerns off the table for at
least two or three years,&#8221; Alex Fuhrman, an analyst for Piper
Jaffray Cos. in New York, wrote in a note today. While the
prospects of a default before the company&#8217;s next debt payment in
2015 are now remote, the loan won&#8217;t mitigate the cash
consumption Piper Jaffray expects to reach $1 billion in the
first quarter, Fuhrman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which has been advising Apple Inc. (AAPL) on how to deal with its multibillion- dollar cash pile, and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany&#8217;s biggest lender, are in the lead to help the iPhone maker sell bonds for the first time in 17 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple asked the two banks, based in New York and Frankfurt, to arrange phone interviews with fixed-income investors today in advance of a potential deal, according to a person familiar with the offering who asked not to be identified because the terms aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple, the largest U.S. maker of smartphones, has had little need for Wall Street&#8217;s services since its 1980 initial public offering and its last bond deal in 1996. Although company co-founder Steve Jobs married a former Goldman Sachs fixed- income strategist, he disliked bankers and preferred doing deals without them, according to a former Apple executive who reported to Jobs. In 2009, Apple hired Adrian Perica, a Goldman Sachs investment banker, to build a mergers-and-acquisitions team. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman&#8217;s going to be the logical play, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the others aren&#8217;t going to try,&#8221; said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York who rates Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock outperform. &#8220;If you&#8217;re one of the big technology players, you&#8217;re going to want to win this thing -- it gives you bragging rights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for both banks declined to comment on whether their firms will lead the bond offering. Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment beyond the company&#8217;s remarks announcing the cash plan last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stock Buybacks &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On April 23, Cupertino, California-based Apple said it would return an additional $55 billion in cash to shareholders to compensate for a stock that&#8217;s dropped on signs that the company&#8217;s growth is slowing. Although it has $145 billion of cash, Apple said it will use debt to help finance a total capital reward of about $100 billion to shareholders. By borrowing the money, Apple can avoid taxes that would apply should it bring funds back into the U.S. from overseas. More than $102 billion of its cash and investments was offshore at the end of March, the company said last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who became CEO in August 2011 when Jobs resigned, hired Goldman Sachs after last year&#8217;s shareholder meeting to help the company improve transparency and governance, including what to do with its growing cash pile, according to people familiar with the decision. The firm has helped advise Apple&#8217;s board on ways to return cash to shareholders and respond to hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who began publicly demanding action, a person with knowledge of the plans said in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Next Takeover &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cook limits his appearances at Wall Street investor conferences to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s annual event, held in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank advised Apple on its takeover of Next Computer Inc., which was completed in 1997 and led to Jobs&#8217;s return to Apple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company is the top manager of corporate debt issued in the euro region, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because investment-grade debt offerings typically pay low fees, banks may offer to do the transaction for little or no charge, Hintz said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is going to be a prestige-per-share, not an earnings-per-share, deal,&#8221; said Hintz, who worked as Morgan Stanley&#8217;s treasurer and as the chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. earlier in his career. &#8220;We&#8217;re really talking about a deal that&#8217;s going to be done as close to gratis as you can get.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Apple IPO &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Morgan Stanley was the lead manager of Apple&#8217;s 1980 initial public offering, Goldman Sachs was involved in both of Apple&#8217;s most recent bond sales in 1994 and 1996. With Apple approaching bankruptcy in June 1996, then-CFO Fred Anderson hired Goldman to lead a $661 million convertible bond offering that provided the liquidity for Apple&#8217;s comeback after Jobs rejoined the company as CEO the following August, Anderson said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman was &#8220;the preferred banker when I was CFO at Apple during 1996 to 2004,&#8221; said Anderson, a co-founder of venture capital firm Elevation Partners LP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment-banking team, led by David Solomon, John S. Weinberg and Richard Gnodde, has a higher ranking among advisers on takeovers and stock underwriting than on debt underwriting. That&#8217;s because debt-sale mandates are often awarded to bigger banks that provide corporate loans and lines of credit. Yet Apple&#8217;s cash hoard means it doesn&#8217;t need any bank loans, making it easier to compete for the new bond sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs ranks first this year among managers of debt sales for technology companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs climbed less than 1 percent to $145.11 at the close in New York. Apple advanced 3.1 percent to $430.12. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jesse Hamilton" date="Apr 29, 2013  2:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-29/goldman-sachs-and-morgan-stanley-set-foreclosure-accord-payments.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Set Foreclosure Accord Payments</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley (MS) will start sending checks to borrowers foreclosed on by
the banks&#8217; former mortgage-servicing units this week, according
to the Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two New York-based banks will pay $247 million to
almost 224,000 borrowers, the Fed said today in a statement. The
checks -- meant to compensate borrowers who may have been
mistreated in foreclosures during 2009 and 2010 that relied on
improper documentation or faulty procedures -- range from $300
to $125,000, depending on the how much harm may have been done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage units owned by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
foreclosed on homes of 49 military members eligible for borrower
protections and three homeowners who weren&#8217;t in default, the Fed
said. The loans were handled by Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Litton Loan
Servicing LP and Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Saxon Mortgage Services Inc.,
both of which were sold to Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firms were among 13 of the largest U.S.
mortgage servicers who agreed to a $9.3 billion settlement with
federal regulators that called for a total of $3.6 billion in
cash payments to borrowers and that the rest go to help prevent
future foreclosures. All borrowers targeted by foreclosure in
2009 and 2010 are scheduled to get some payment, whether or not
they were harmed by the banks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is paying higher
yields on new bonds than in a November sale after it beat the
planned return of Apple Inc. (AAPL) to the credit market after an
absence of almost two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, one of four U.S.-based businesses with the
highest ratings from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard 
Poor&#8217;s, issued $1.95 billion of dollar-denominated debt last
week with a weighted average coupon of 2.41 percent, exceeding
the 2.33 percent for similar bonds it sold five months earlier
even with interest rates at about the same level. The latest
sale came two days after Apple said it would use debt to help
fund a $55 billion addition to a plan to return cash to
shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft paid a little more than they otherwise would,
given the looming Apple issuance,&#8221; said Noel Hebert, the chief
investment officer at Concannon Wealth Management, which
oversees about $250 million of assets from Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania. &#8220;The higher coupons are likely a fair trade to
get in front of the new Apple paper, which will have to get
digested.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the world&#8217;s largest software maker has a higher
credit rating than Apple, growth at the Redmond, Washington-
based company has stagnated for more than a decade. After
generating enough free cash flow in 1999 to buy Apple twice
over, Microsoft&#8217;s $27.5 billion of funds earned in the last 12
months now accounts for about 60 percent of the amount produced
by its Cupertino, California-based competitor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC AG, the soft-drink
bottler that switched its primary listing to the London Stock
Exchange today, expects profitability to rebound this year as
sugar and oil prices rise at a slower pace than previous years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity costs will increase at a &#8220;low single-digit&#8221;
pace, after climbing 14 percent in 2011 and 6 percent in 2012,
Chief Executive Officer Dimitris Lois said in an interview at
the London bourse. Cost reduction measures such as consolidating
some office processes will also boost margins, helping offset a
slowdown in revenue growth, Lois said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising prices for commodities have presented an additional
challenge for food and drink makers in recent years as they
struggle to contend with weakening consumer demand. Coca-Cola
HBC&#8217;s operating margin declined to 6.4 percent of sales in its
2012 fiscal year from 10.8 percent in 2007. Lois said today that
he expects the margin to return to levels seen before the
European financial crisis, without giving a timeframe. European
markets show few signs of stabilization, he also said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit of a challenge,&#8221; the CEO said. &#8220;At some
stage this year we&#8217;ll be able to look back and say that probably
the worst is behind us, but it&#8217;s still a tough year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC shares traded at 1,737 pence at 4:17 p.m. on
their first day of London trading, giving the company a market
value of about 6.1 billion pounds ($9.5 billion). The bottler
said in October it would move its primary listing from Athens to
London, fleeing the epicenter of Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. It also
switched its domicile to Zug, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Quite Complex&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The listing process was &#8220;innovative and quite complex,&#8221;
and &#8220;made the company known to a wider audience who aren&#8217;t
particularly knowledgeable about the Coke bottling system,&#8221;
Lois said. The move will make Coca-Cola HBC eligible for
inclusion in London&#8217;s benchmark FTSE 100 Index (UKX) in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost reduction measures such as consolidating finance and
human resources into one center will reduce expenses by about 65
million euros this year, Chief Financial Officer Michalis Imellos said in the same interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue, excluding currency shifts, will grow at a slower
pace than last year&#8217;s 2 percent, Lois said, as austerity
measures in the Eurozone weigh on improvements elsewhere. He
declined to comment on whether the volume of products sold would
increase after being unchanged last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC operates in countries with lower per-capita
consumption of sparkling drinks than the rest of the Eurozone,
which will help in boosting volume growth, Lois said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russia, Nigeria &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC buys concentrate from Coca-Cola Co. and
blends, bottles and sells the products in European countries
including Greece and Italy. Lois said he&#8217;s optimistic about the
emerging markets of Russia and Nigeria this year. Sales of Coca-
Cola in Russia were helped by a government ban on selling beer
at freestanding kiosks, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We still have a lot of consumers to recruit,&#8221; Lois said,
noting that per-capita consumption in most of its markets for
sparkling beverages is lower than the Eurozone average. He cited
Italy, one of the country&#8217;s biggest markets, which has a 20
percent lower per-capita consumption of sparkling beverages than
Serbia, and 40 percent lower consumption than Bulgaria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company expects to sell bonds in the next six-to-nine
months, the CEO said, as it seeks to refinance about 1 billion
euros of debt due by 2014. Coca-Cola HBC will sell bonds in
euros and seek an average debt maturity of about 5 years. It&#8217;s
not looking to raise money for acquisitions and isn&#8217;t interested
in buying Coca-Cola&#8217;s German bottling operations, Lois said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., another bottler of the
bestselling soft drink, said April 25 that it let a right to buy
Coca-Cola&#8217;s German bottling operations lapse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Washington

over $301 million in losses from mortgage loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integer claimed that the banks breached a 2007 mortgage
loan purchase agreement, according to the suit filed April 26 in
New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual securitized more than 4,600 residential
mortgage loans that were eventually sold to Integer, according
to the complaint. The alleged breaches occurred on more than
1,400 loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over 60 mortgage loans were delinquent as of the
applicable cut-off date and/or the date of the closing of the

responsible parties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Croatia, which is set to join the

ConocoPhillips (COP) and General Electric Co. (GE) on investment in oil and
gas exploration in the Adriatic Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are all interested, and they are all waiting for the
government to pass the amended law on gas and oil research,&#8221;
Economy Minister Ivan Vrdoljak said in an interview in Zagreb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas consumption in the former Yugoslav region and Albania
will double by 2020 to 11 billion cubic meters of gas a year,
according to an October 2011 study by state-owned pipeline
operator Plinacro d.o.o. Croatia wants to meet increased demand
across the region and reduce European dependence on Russian gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Adriatic nation needs investment to revive growth after
four years of recession or stagnation. The government is
expected to adopt amended laws on hydrocarbon research by June,
Vrdoljak said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INA Industrija Nafte d.d., Croatia&#8217;s largest refiner
controlled by Hungary&#8217;s Mol Nyrt., so far has had a monopoly on
gas and oil exploration in Croatia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KKR  Co. (KKR) and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) have lined up banks to handle the planned initial public
offering of Kion Group GmbH, the world&#8217;s second-largest maker of
forklifts, said people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) was added to the list of financial
institutions that already includes owners Goldman Sachs and
KKR&#8217;s equity capital markets arm as well as Deutsche Bank AG (DBK),
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
plans are private. The IPO will probably happen before July if
markets remain stable and Wiesbaden, Germany-based Kion may sell
as much as 25 percent of its stock, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forklift maker posted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, amortization and some items of 747 million euros
($977 million) last year. The owners are seeking a valuation of
about 10 times estimated 2013 Ebitda, according to the people.
That would lead to a valuation of at least 7.5 billion euros as
Kion predicts earnings will rise this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kion was part of German industrial-gas maker Linde AG (LIN)
before a 4-billion euro buyout in 2006. Sales increased 8.2
percent to 4.7 billion euros last year even as global demand for
industrial trucks dropped by 3.1 percent, as the company
benefited from orders in China, where Kion is the largest
overseas forklift-maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, KKR and
Goldman Sachs declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chinese Investment  &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa raised $6.8
billion in IPOs this year, about double the figure for the same
period in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
year&#8217;s biggest deal was from Germany, where apartment landlord
LEG Immobilien AG (LEG) raised 1.3 billion euros in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR and Goldman sold 25 percent of Kion to Weichai Power
Co., China&#8217;s biggest maker of heavy-duty trucks, in August to
help trim debt. Kion also sold 70 percent of its hydraulics unit
to the Chinese firm. The moves brought Kion 738 million euros in
investment from Weichai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kion trails Toyota Industries Corp. (6201), an affiliate of Toyota
Motor Corp., in the global forklift market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, will analyze over the next eight months whether it
will split itself into brand name and generics businesses, Chief
Financial Officer Frank D&#8217;Amelio said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer hasn&#8217;t made a final decision on whether to break up
the New York-based company and an official divide wouldn&#8217;t
happen until at least 2016, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
said today. In the meantime, Pfizer is working to figure out
whether its emerging markets operations would benefit from being
organized more like its business in the U.S., Europe and Japan
where the company has distinct brand and generics units,
D&#8217;Amelio said today in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &#8220;is a study year,&#8221; D&#8217;Amelio said. &#8220;What we don&#8217;t
want to do is take the positive out of what the model&#8217;s already
generating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk of a possible split has dominated company conference
calls with analysts since Read floated the idea last year. Such
a break up is &#8220;perhaps the last big lever management has left
to pull,&#8221; Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., said before Pfizer earlier today announced its first-
quarter earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D&#8217;Amelio said feedback hasn&#8217;t been unanimous, or final.
&#8220;If you talk to investors, I think you&#8217;ll get mixed comments,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s never a subject where I think the investment
community is all-in one way or the other.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lipitor Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been working to remake itself after it lost
exclusive sales rights in 2011 to Lipitor, the cholesterol
treatment that was once the world&#8217;s top-selling medicine with
almost $13 billion. The company won U.S. marketing approval in
the past six months for two new potential blockbusters, the
rheumatoid arthritis pill Xeljanz and the blood thinner Eliquis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Pfizer reduced its forecast for 2013 profit
excluding certain items after first-quarter sales missed
analysts&#8217; estimates. Pfizer shares fell 4.5 percent to $29.07 at
the close in New York, their worst one-day loss since August
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judson Clark, an analyst Edward Jones  Co. who has a buy
rating on the stock, said he&#8217;s neutral on the idea of a split. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s almost a one-time resetting,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
imagine every five or 10 years they&#8217;re going to spin off their
drugs that are in life-cycle management. I don&#8217;t know if this is
a recurring way to create shareholder value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key decision is whether the brand-name and generics
businesses can exist inside Pfizer separately and still create
value, or whether a formal split is necessary, Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The first order of business is to find a way we can
separate them and give the management as much authority and
independence as necessary,&#8221; Read said today on a conference
call. &#8220;I believe it&#8217;s worth creating that separation
internally, because I believe it creates focus and management
focus and improves the performance of those two businesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Drew Armstrong" date="Apr 30, 2013  4:18 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-30/pfizer-lowers-2013-forecast-after-sales-miss-analyst-estimates.html"><headline>Pfizer Lowers 2013 Forecast After Sales Miss Estimates</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, reduced its 2013 profit forecast after first-quarter
sales missed analyst estimates. The shares had their worst one-
day loss since August 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full-year earnings excluding one-time items may be $2.14 to
$2.24 a share as foreign currency rates weigh on results, New
York-based Pfizer said today in a statement. The forecast cuts
by 6 cents the range provided by the company in January. First-
quarter net income surged 53 percent to $2.75 billion, or 38
cents a share, from $1.79 billion, or 24 cents, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales for the pneumococcal vaccines Prevnar and the
erectile dysfunction drug Viagra were less than analyst
estimates, leading total revenue to fall about $440 million
short of expectations, at $13.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &#8220;clearly not a great quarter,&#8221; said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with International Strategy  Investment
Group in New York, in a note to clients today. &#8220;However, it
appears that the company will attribute a large portion of the
miss, but not all, to one-time factors such as U.S. buying
patterns and foreign exchange.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 4.5 percent to $29.07 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 27 percent in the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services company, boosted its
dividend 12 percent and approved $5 billion in stock buybacks,
rewarding investors after a disappointing earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dividend of 95 cents a share will be payable on June 10
to shareholders of record on May 10, IBM said today from its
annual meeting in Huntsville, Alabama. With the additional
buyback funds, IBM has $11.2 billion in its repurchase program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty, who took the reins
at IBM in January 2012, is returning more cash to shareholders
after a rare earnings shortfall sent the stock tumbling 8.3
percent in one day. The company&#8217;s first-quarter profit, released
on April 18, missed analysts&#8217; estimates for the first time since
2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 1.7 percent to $202.54 at the close today in New
York. The shares have climbed 5.7 percent this year, compared
with a 12 percent gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York-based company also is making
management changes in the wake of the earnings report. Rod Adkins, the head of IBM&#8217;s hardware division, will become senior
vice president of corporate strategy, a person familiar with the
matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pain Therapeutics Inc. (PTIE) and Durect
Corp. (DRRX), partners with Pfizer Inc. (PFE) on the medicine Remoxy,
increased in New York trading after the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker highlighted the experimental painkiller&#8217;s future on a
conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain Therapeutics surged 26 percent to $4.12 at the close
for the biggest one-day climb since November 2005. Durect rose
26 percent to $1.57 for its largest single-day gain since March
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remoxy is an extended-release oxycodone capsule for pain,
formulated to limit abuse. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
postponed approval of the medicine in June 2011, after a delay
in 2008 when the regulators asked for more laboratory data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For Remoxy, we had a productive meeting with the FDA in
March and the guidance that we got out of that meeting is
certainly helping to inform the next steps,&#8221; John Young, head
of New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s primary care unit, said on a call
today with analysts and investors. &#8220;We believe we have a path
forward and we will publicly communicate further details over
coming quarters.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer gained the drug in its $3.3 billion acquisition of
King Pharmaceuticals in 2011. Austin, Texas-based Pain
Therapeutics and Durect, in Cupertino, California, helped
develop the therapy and would get royalties on sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You get ahead -- good reviews,
promotions -- and at some point you can lean in and have your
head chopped off,&#8221; Barbara J. Krumsiek, chief executive of
Calvert Investments Inc. said in an interview last night at the
Financial Women&#8217;s Association Annual Dinner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a ballroom at the Grand Hyatt, the association honored
Krumsiek as Private Sector Woman of the Year. She shared the
dais with the Visionary Woman of the Year, Betsy West, executive
producer of Storyville Films; the Public Sector Woman of the
Year, Judith Rodin, president of the Rockefeller Foundation; and
Representative Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Women are half of the population, they should be half of
financial services employees, half corporate CEOs and half of
Congress,&#8221; Maloney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women from Goldman Sachs Inc., Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. and BNP Paribas (BNP) SA, to name a few,
filled the tables. BMO Capital Markets Corp. matched $25,000 in
donations made at the event, resulting in $86,000 raised for
educational scholarships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the association&#8217;s scholarships went to Kamellia
Saroop who works at BMO. Saroop was unable to attend &#8220;because
she&#8217;s working,&#8221; said Deirdre Drake, a managing director at the
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association was founded in 1956 by eight women denied
admission to the Young Men&#8217;s Investment Association. Today it
has about 800 members, said Joyce Sullivan, founder and CEO of
SocMediaFin Inc. and a board member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Startling Time &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krumsiek became an association member in 1989, when she was
around 37. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s the most startling time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
accomplish during the meritocracy part of your career, and then
all of a sudden things aren&#8217;t working that used to work. You get
stuck. You realize a career is an obstacle course, not a
ladder.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of her legacies is helping develop an association
curriculum called &#8220;Beyond Competence,&#8221; about managing
difficult bosses and subversive subordinates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics in high circulation in the room last night -- thanks
in part to Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg&#8217;s
book &#8220;Lean In&#8221; -- were mentoring and sponsorship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think mentoring is misunderstood and overrated,&#8221;
Krumsiek said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a two-way street, it&#8217;s about helping each
other. And these relationships can&#8217;t last an entire career.
Sometimes you move past your mentors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for sponsorship: &#8220;If you add value in your company, you
will be sponsored,&#8221; she said. Four out of her seven direct
reports are women, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Working Revolution &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpts from honoree West&#8217;s documentary &#8220;Makers: Women
Who Make America&#8221; gave a sense of the revolution that led women
into the workplace. It featured an interview with Muriel Siebert, the first woman to own a seat on the New York Stock
Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Min Lu, who works in the audit department at Credit Suisse (CSGN),
was moved. &#8220;I see how much we take for granted,&#8221; Lu said
during a &#8220;networking break&#8221; at the dinner. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been leaning
in out of personal motivation. Now I feel I have an obligation
to lean in for the women who fought so hard before me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is ending its
top-level sponsorship of the Masters Tournament, while United
Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) joins the partner rolls of golf&#8217;s first
annual major championship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daimler AG&#8217;s Mercedes-Benz (DAI), an international sponsor of the
Masters since 2008, will move up to replace Exxon Mobil as one
of three global sponsors of the tournament, joining
International Business Machines Inc. and ATT Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPS, the world&#8217;s largest package-delivery company, will
take over Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s previous role and join Rolex as
international sponsors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon spokesman Alan T. Jeffers said the company was
leaving &#8220;after nine successful years&#8221; as it &#8220;continually
evaluates and modifies our sponsorship and advertising
requirements based on business needs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billy Payne, executive director of Augusta National Golf
Club, which stages the tournament each April in Augusta,
Georgia, didn&#8217;t disclose a reason for Exxon Mobil&#8217;s departure in
a press release announcing the new sponsorships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil joined the Masters for the 2005 tournament
after the club went without sponsors in 2003 and 2004 to protect
its corporate partners from protests against Augusta National&#8217;s
then-all-male membership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms of the latest agreements weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Masters sponsorship is among the most exclusive in
sports, as the tournament limits television commercials to four
minutes per hour. As part of the agreements, sponsors are given
access to private hospitality cabins built along the course&#8217;s
first and 10th holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPS&#8217;s sponsorship comes four days after the Atlanta-based
company and the Teamsters union agreed on a five-year contract
covering 250,000 employees. A two-week Teamsters strike in 1997
cut UPS&#8217;s volumes as much as 6 percent and cost about $650
million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects worldwide spending total in eighth paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest
payments network, posted a fiscal second-quarter profit that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates as consumer spending on credit and
debit cards climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended March 31 fell 1.7
percent to $1.27 billion, or $1.92 a share, from $1.29 billion,
or $1.91, a year earlier, when there were more shares
outstanding, the Foster City, California-based company said
today in a statement. That beat the $1.81 average estimate of 32
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income a year earlier was
helped by a one-time tax-related gain of $208 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, led by Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf,
increased dividends and stepped up share repurchases as the firm
gained financial flexibility after joining rival MasterCard Inc. (MA)
in agreeing to a multibillion settlement with merchants over
card swipe fees. Visa also struck a deal in February with
JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. card lender, to let the
bank tailor payment solutions for merchants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To drive future transaction growth, we continue to invest
in new technologies, channels and capabilities to make Visa
transactions more valuable, accessible and secure,&#8221; Scharf, 48,
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payment processor raised its forecast for adjusted
annual earnings per share growth to about 20 percent, from the
&#8220;high teens&#8221; projected in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shares Advance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa climbed 2.1 percent to $169.50 at 4:42 p.m. in
extended trading in New York. The shares climbed 9.5 percent
this year through the close of regular trading, outpacing the
4.2 percent advance for the 70-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Information Technology Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, the world&#8217;s second-largest payments network by
processed transactions, said earlier today that first-quarter
profit increased 12 percent to $766 million. Revenue at the
Purchase, New York-based firm climbed 8.4 percent to $1.91
billion, short of the $1.93 billion estimate of analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. The shares, which touched an all-time high
yesterday, fell 2.5 percent to $539.18, the most since July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa&#8217;s total operating revenue climbed 15 percent to $2.96
billion, beating the $2.85 billion estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Worldwide spending on Visa payment cards climbed
8.8 percent to $1.03 trillion, adjusted for currency
fluctuations, according to the statement. Processed transactions
rose 6.2 percent to 13.9 billion. Cross-border volume, a measure
of spending by cardholders outside their home countries,
advanced 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending on Visa debit cards in the U.S. rose 0.3 percent
to $285 billion, the first increase in a year, according to the
statement. U.S. credit-card purchases climbed 9.1 percent to
$244 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
of the nation&#8217;s economy, cooled in March after higher payroll
taxes took effect in January. Scharf seeks to bolster Visa&#8217;s
growth outside the U.S. as the company has said it hopes to get
more than half of its revenue abroad by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A claim by a group of Ecuadorean
villagers seeking to seize Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s Canadian assets was
stayed by a judge in Ontario at Chevron&#8217;s request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron does not possess any assets in this jurisdiction
at this time,&#8221; Ontario Superior Court Justice David Brown said
in a ruling today on the asset-seizure request filed in Toronto
last year by lawyers for 47 Ecuadorean villagers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A court in the Latin American country in 2011 found Chevron
liable for 28 years of soil and water pollution near oil wells
that ruined the health and livelihoods of Amazon rainforest
dwellers. Since then, Ecuadorean farmers and fishermen have been
trying to collect $19 billion in environmental damages from San
Ramon, California-based Chevron, the world&#8217;s third-largest oil
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parties should take their fight elsewhere to some
jurisdiction where any ultimate recognition of the Ecuadorian
Judgment will have a practical effect,&#8221; Brown said in his
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs are seeking enforcement outside their home
country because Chevron has no refineries, oil wells, storage
terminals or other properties in Ecuador. Lawyers for the Amazon
River basin residents asked the Ontario court for a judgment
equivalent to $18.26 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it was pleased with the judge&#8217;s decision,
according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chevron Fight &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs plan to appeal, Alan Lenczner, principal
lawyer in Toronto for the Ecuadorians, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It cannot be right that a multinational company that
operates entirely through subsidiaries is immune from the
enforcement of a judgment in Canada, particularly where the
subsidiary is 100 percent-owned and provides some of the
billions of dollars that Chevron pays out in dividends each year
and even more billions in share buybacks,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has refused to pay the judgment or entertain the
notion of settlement talks because it maintains the ruling
resulted from bribery and fraud, charges that lawyers and a
spokeswoman for the plaintiffs have rejected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown said the plaintiffs &#8220;have no hope of success&#8221; in
their claim that Chevron&#8217;s Canadian subsidiary should be used to
fulfill the judgment of the Ecuadorean court. In his decision,
the Ontario judge noted Chevron&#8217;s determination to fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron is on record saying: &#8216;We will fight until hell
freezes over and then fight it out on the ice.&#8217; While Ontario
enjoys a bountiful supply of ice for part of each year, Ontario
is not the place for that fight,&#8221; Brown wrote in his ruling.
&#8220;There is nothing in Ontario to fight over.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Toxic Soil &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs have filed similar asset-seizure motions
against Chevron in courts in Brazil and Argentina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2011 judgment by a provincial Ecuadorean court blamed
decades of toxic soil and water contamination on Texaco Inc.,
which Chevron acquired in 2001. Texaco was found to have
discharged into the environment saltwater and other byproducts
of oil drilling. Texaco quit the country and its equipment was
taken over by the Ecuadorean state oil company in 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown stayed the plaintiffs&#8217; claim in Canada, while
allowing them the right to try again if they obtain new evidence
that Chevron possesses assets in the court&#8217;s jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is the world&#8217;s biggest oil company by
market value, followed by PetroChina Company Ltd., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A New York technology development
company said it sued Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) over allegations the
software maker&#8217;s web-conferencing service, Skype, infringed
encryption-related patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CopyTele Inc. (COPY) said it filed a complaint today in federal
court in Brooklyn, New York, alleging that Skype infringed two
patents for technology that helps maintain secure Web-based
communications. CopyTele is seeking unspecified damages,
according to a copy of the complaint provided by the firm. The
filing couldn&#8217;t be immediately confirmed in court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These encryption patents are a prime example of the
enormous, untapped potential at CTI,&#8221; CopyTele&#8217;s Chief
Executive Officer Robert Berman said in a statement. The patents
have &#8220;tremendous value&#8221; that was &#8220;masked&#8221; under the previous
management, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Knodel, a spokesman for Microsoft who works for
Waggener Edstrom Worldwide, declined to comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berman, formerly the chief operating officer of Acacia
Research Corp. (ACTG), a publicly-traded intellectual property holding
firm, said in an interview today that he was hired by CopyTele
to turn the technology developer into a similar business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acacia, based in Newport Beach, California, controls patent
portfolios, licenses them to corporate users and sues companies
that are alleged to have infringed the patents. The company says
it controls rights to about 250 patent portfolios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, CopyTele sued AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) in federal
court in San Francisco, alleging the company stole patented
technologies developed for e-readers. The case is pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CopyTele expects to acquire additional patents and file
more lawsuits in the future, Berman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft acquired Skype from an investment group for
$8.5 billion in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weakening yen has turned Japan&#8217;s annual Golden Week, a string of springtime holidays, into a boon for domestic tourism. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The uptick in the traditional May holiday week points toward one of the best years on record for Japan&#8217;s tourism industry, still recovering from the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011. The yen&#8217;s slide, part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&#8217;s drive to boost economic growth, is luring overseas travelers while tempting Japan&#8217;s holidaymakers to stay home. Tokyo Disneyland expects a record number of visitors this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 22.8 million Japanese, or nearly a fifth of the population, will travel during the holiday period from April 25 to May 5, according an estimate from JTB Corp (JTBZ). That&#8217;s the most since at least 1969, when Japan&#8217;s biggest travel agency began the survey. Some 22.2 million of those will travel domestically and spend about 35,900 yen ($360) per trip, 2.9 percent more than last year, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The exchange rate does affect my plan to travel,&#8221; said Shizue Ohshima, 62, a housewife from the Kanagawa prefecture who is headed to the Noto peninsula about 360 miles (585 kilometers) northwest of Tokyo during Golden Week. Three or four years ago she visited Korea. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I like Korean culture but it will be more expensive if I go now,&#8221; said Ohshima. &#8220;Domestic travel is a lot cheaper.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An 18 percent decline in the yen against the dollar this year shows how it has become cheaper for foreign travelers to visit. Overseas tourists to Japan rose 26 percent in March from a year ago to 857,000, the second highest on record, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. That&#8217;s boosting revenue for businesses from bullet trains to tourist-friendly eateries like the Robot Restaurant in Tokyo&#8217;s Shinjuku nightlife district, where bikini-clad staff stage mock fights with others in android and giant panda costumes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Southeast Asia Visitors &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The general trend for domestic travel this year is more expensive, nearer, and shorter,&#8221; said Mayuko Igarashi, a spokeswoman at Rakuten Travel Inc., an online travel agency. &#8220;Inbound travel from overseas is surging, it&#8217;s double last year&#8217;s as the weakening yen helps attract more visitors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Japanese currency is forecast to weaken to 110 yen to the U.S. dollar in 2014 from an estimated 100 in the second quarter of this year, according to the median of economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Prime Minister Abe, in office since December, has pledged to use monetary easing and fiscal stimulus to lift Japan out of more than a decade of price falls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pandas, Robots &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visitors from Thailand will increase nearly fivefold and tourists from Taiwan will more than double during Golden Week, according to a study from Rakuten. The Thai baht, the Korean won, the Chinese yuan, and the Singapore and Hong Kong dollar have all risen more than 20 percent against the yen during the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okinawa reservations more then tripled while Kyoto bookings for inbound travelers increased 177 percent from the same holiday period last year, according to Rakuten. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Overall, visitors from Asia are notably increasing,&#8221; according to JTB spokeswoman Akiko Mitsuhashi, who said one of the agency&#8217;s top selling tour destinations is a bus trip to Mt. Fuji and hot springs. &#8220;The weakening yen is helping them come over here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oriental Land Co (4661)., the operator of Tokyo Disney Resort, which had a record 27.5 million visitors last fiscal year, is expecting a fresh record of 27.7 million visitors this year, said Umi Ishimura, a spokeswoman. Foreigners make up about 3 percent of the resort&#8217;s customers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Budget Airlines &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the Robot Restaurant, where nightly floorshows feature performers riding giant prehistoric creatures as well as robots and sword-wielding pandas, non-Japanese customers are on the rise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foreign visitors rose from about 10 percent last summer before the yen began to weaken to about 30 percent today, said Yumi Ito, a spokeswoman for Josen Musical, the operator of Robot Restaurant. The venue also boosted advertising during the same period, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Central Japan Railway Co (9022)., operator of Japan&#8217;s busiest bullet trains, said bookings for its high-speed service during Golden Week were up 6 percent compared with a year earlier, at 1.22 million seats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a lot of passengers coming to Tokyo this year,&#8221; said Kenichiro Yakura, a spokesman at for the rail operator. &#8220;Many people want to visit Tokyo Disneyland for its 30th anniversary and see Tokyo Skytree,&#8221; the capital&#8217;s latest landmark tower. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Family Sightseeing &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The start of operations at three low-cost carriers last year is also drawing more people to the skies. Peach Aviation Ltd (AFACZ)., the only one of the three that was flying last May, said reservations for domestic flights nearly doubled to 55,077 seats during Golden Week, as it boosted capacity 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Occupancy rates at the Tokyo&#8217;s Imperial Hotel are higher during Golden Week than a year ago, said spokesman Akitaka Minakata, who attributes the increase to Japanese families in town for sightseeing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foreign guest occupancy rates are still recovering from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;People say the recent trend for travel is more expensive, nearer, and shorter, and that fits my traveling style,&#8221; said Mineko Yamaguchi, 74, a housewife from Urawa, Saitama. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not going anywhere during the Golden Week aside from visiting family graves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore" date="May 01, 2013  3:54 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-01/goldman-names-salisbury-head-of-special-situations-group.html"><headline>Goldman Names Salisbury Head of Special-Situations Group</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said Julian Salisbury will become head of the global special-situations
group, a unit that invests the firm&#8217;s own money and generated as
much as $4 billion a year before the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salisbury, 41, is replacing Jason Brown, who is retiring,
New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in an internal memo.
Salisbury will move to New York from London, where he has been
head of the European special-situations group. Michael DuVally,
a spokesman for the company, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Special Situations Group, known as SSG, trades
distressed debt and has made investments in companies from
Japan&#8217;s largest golf-course operator to pizza-chain Sbarro Inc.
In 2011, New York-based Goldman Sachs stopped including SSG&#8217;s
results within fixed-income trading, and moved it into a new
reporting segment called investing and lending that includes
other proprietary investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s investing and lending division generated $5.89
billion in 2012, almost triple that of a year earlier. The unit
gained $1.85 billion from debt securities and loans, and $2.39
billion from equity securities. The company doesn&#8217;t break out
SSG&#8217;s results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salisbury, a U.K. citizen, was a founding member of the
European SSG unit in 2003 and was named a partner at the firm in
2008, according to the memo, which was sent by Pablo J. Salame
and Isabelle Ealet, co-heads of the securities division. Brown,
who joined Goldman Sachs from Bear Stearns Cos. in 1999 and
became a partner in 2006, had led the group from Hong Kong since
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diversified Portfolio &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jason&#8217;s leadership has been instrumental in the design
and execution of a realigned investment approach in GSSG,
resulting in a diversified portfolio that has shown strong
performance in both favorable and challenging market
conditions,&#8221; Ealet and Salame wrote in a separate memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported the management changes earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSG produced $4.1 billion in 2007, 9 percent of the
company&#8217;s total revenue. It generated $3.79 billion in 2006,
according to documents released by a Senate subcommittee in
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has faced questions about whether SSG&#8217;s
activities would be crimped by the Volcker rule, which was part
of the Dodd-Frank Act. Rules about how it will be implemented
are still being written. The bank has argued that most of the
unit is a lending business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) paid higher interest rates
on a record $17 billion bond sale than Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) did a
week ago as the iPhone maker&#8217;s slowing growth overshadowed
annual cash flow that&#8217;s more than twice the amount of the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Apple matched an unprecedented low coupon of 0.45
percent for corporate three-year debt yesterday, investors
demanded higher yields for the fixed-rate portions of five, 10-and 30-year securities relative to U.S. Treasuries than similar-maturity notes Microsoft issued on April 25. Apple, which gets
more than half of its sales from the iPhone, plans to use the
money to help finance $100 billion in dividends and buybacks
after its shares plunged 44 percent in seven months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apple is probably seen as a marginally higher risk,&#8221;
said Alan Shepard, an analyst and money manager at Madison
Investment Advisors Inc., which oversees about $16 billion in
Madison, Wisconsin, and owns the company&#8217;s debt as well as that
of Microsoft. &#8220;They sell a premium product, but revenues aren&#8217;t
diversified enough.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Apple transformed itself from a near-bankrupt personal-computer also-ran into the world&#8217;s largest technology company,
the Cupertino, California-based maker of iPad computer tablets
and iPod music players has posted annual sales growth that&#8217;s
been about 10 times that of the Windows 8 designer over the past
four years. For bondholders, Morningstar Inc. says competition
from lower-cost mobile devices still makes Apple riskier than
Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ebix Inc. (EBIX) jumped to its highest price
in almost six months and topped a $20-a-share takeover bid from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. that would take the supplier of
insurance software and services private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Ebix rose as much as 14 percent to $21.25, the
highest intraday since Nov. 5, before settling to $20.52 at
10:43 a.m. in New York. Goldman Sachs agreed to pay 18 percent
more than the average daily closing price for the last 30 days,
Atlanta-based Ebix said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement includes a 45-day window where Ebix can
solicit other offers, according to the statement. Ebix said its
special committee of independent directors unanimously supported
the Goldman Sachs bid, which the companies valued at $820
million including assumption of outstanding debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have great respect for Ebix and its strong commitment
to providing customers with the highest quality of software and
e-commerce services in the insurance industry,&#8221; Sumit Rajpal, a
managing director at New York-based Goldman Sachs, said in the
statement. &#8220;We look forward to working with the company and
helping it maximize its growth potential.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebix said in March that 2012 net income fell 1 percent to
$70.6 million as revenue increased 18 percent to $199.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold a
majority stake in its reinsurance business to institutions and
high-net worth clients as financial firms adjust to demands by
regulators for more capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is keeping a minority stake in the business,
named Global Atlantic Financial Group, the New York-based bank
said today in a statement. The firm didn&#8217;t disclose the price of
the private offering or what percentage it retained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz said in January
that the bank was considering selling a stake in the business
because international regulators are imposing higher capital
requirements. The bank at that time disclosed the unit&#8217;s
contribution for the first time, saying revenue climbed 23
percent in 2012 to $1.08 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The division has a global property and casualty reinsurance
business as well as life and annuity reinsurance operations
primarily in the U.S. Goldman Sachs agreed in 2012 to buy Ariel
Holdings Ltd.&#8217;s Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance
businesses to expand property and casualty coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said last month that reinsurance revenue was $233
million in the first quarter, up from $211 a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of reining in spending,
Aney Salas was ready to spring a bit for her kids to have some
fun. So they headed to Knott&#8217;s Berry Farm, a 73-year-old
amusement park near Los Angeles. The draw, other than nine
terrifying roller coasters: annual passes that cost $72 each,
payable in six monthly installments of $12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A payment plan really helps,&#8221; the 31-year-old mother of
four said while shepherding her flock out of the car. &#8220;It makes
it really affordable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Ouimet, chairman and chief executive officer of
Cedar Fair LP (FUN), which owns 16 amusement and water parks including
Knott&#8217;s, expects attendance and sales at the company to exceed
last year&#8217;s records in part due to pricing initiatives such as
the payment plan introduced in February 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knott&#8217;s, operating in the shadow of Disneyland just six
miles away, also offers a discount of as much as 38 percent off
the $60 single-day ticket to people who buy in advance online.
Customers who hate waiting can pay $35 extra to cut to the front
on 12 popular rides such as Montezooma&#8217;s Revenge, which sends
riders &#8220;zooming&#8221; forward and backward through a seven-story
loop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing a barbell economy,&#8221; Ouimet said over the
screams of roller-coaster riders in the park. Some consumers are
willing to pay extra for perks such as cutting lines, while
others require &#8220;a more benefit-oriented&#8221; pitch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s negotiations to sell parts of its server division to
Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) broke down after the two sides couldn&#8217;t agree
on a price, said a person familiar with the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo Chief Financial Officer Wong Wai Ming, who was in
the U.S. this past week for the talks, left for Hong Kong
without an agreement, said the person, who declined to be
identified because negotiations are private. The talks could
resume later, the person said. James Sciales, a spokesman for
IBM, and Jeffrey Shafer, a spokesman for Lenovo, both declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo wanted to pay toward the low end of the $2.5
billion-to-$4.5 billion range that Bloomberg News reported on
April 19, while Armonk, New York-based IBM sought a
substantially higher valuation, the person said, without
providing details. In 2005, Lenovo purchased IBM&#8217;s personal-
computer unit, which helped make the Beijing-based company the
world&#8217;s second-largest PC manufacturer. The servers rely on
similar x86 processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakdown of talks was reported by Fortune on May 1.
Lenovo shares fell 2.7 percent to HK$6.90 yesterday in Hong
Kong. IBM rose 1.4 percent to $202.39 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hardware Trouble &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM was looking to divest a portion of its business with
lower profit as it seeks earnings per share of $20 by 2015,
compared with $15.25 last year. The company has had trouble
selling its hardware products, with a 17 percent drop in the
unit&#8217;s revenue last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM),
cutting costs in the wake of its first quarterly earnings
shortfall in eight years, ordered some U.S. contract workers to
reduce their hours, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDI Corp. (CDI), a provider of staffing and outsourcing services,
told employees working on IBM jobs that they should bill for no
more than 36 hours a week in the second quarter, according to
the memo. CDI, based in Philadelphia, cited &#8220;challenging
economic conditions&#8221; in explaining the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You should understand that this action is being taken by
IBM to retain as many CDI resources as possible for future
work,&#8221; Eric Gonzalez, a delivery executive, said in the memo.
&#8220;This action is not a reflection of any dissatisfaction over
the services provided by you or CDI but rather an IBM business
decision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it reported earnings on April 18, IBM said it would
spend $1 billion cutting jobs in its own workforce to reduce
expenses. The company, famous for methodically setting and
meeting its goals, jolted shareholders by posting first-quarter
profit of $3 a share, missing the $3.05 predicted by analysts.
The shares tumbled almost 10 percent to $187.83 over the
following two trading days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock Rebound &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has regained some of that ground over the past 10 days.
The stock climbed 1.4 percent to $202.39 at the close today in
New York, bringing it within $5 of its pre-earnings value. CDI
shares, meanwhile, fell 4.9 percent to $14.04. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vince Webb, a CDI spokesman, declined to comment on the
memo. IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider,
accounts for 20 percent of CDI&#8217;s revenue, according to the
contractor&#8217;s annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Sciales, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM,
also declined to comment on the memo. The company relies on
contractors to manage labor costs on information-technology

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
obtained a record-low 1.625 percent coupon on seven-year dollar-
denominated debt and tied an all-time low for three-year
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s $1.25 billion of notes due May 2020, which yield 67
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, beat a 1.65
percent rate on $750 million of debt sold last July by
semiconductor maker Texas Instruments Inc., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest computer-services provider also sold $1 billion
of notes due in 2016 at a 0.45 percent coupon, matching a
record-low for that maturity obtained by Apple Inc., Texas
Instruments, Unilever Plc and Walt Disney Co., Bloomberg data
show. The debt pays a relative yield of 25 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds may be rated Aa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service,
according to a person familiar with the transaction, who asked
not to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, last sold debt in February,
issuing $1 billion each of two-year, floating-rate notes and
1.25 percent, five-year securities, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lazard Ltd. (LAZ), the largest independent
merger-advisory firm, hired Larry Slaughter as a managing
director and vice chairman in its investment-banking business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slaughter, 49, was previously co-head of North American
investment banking at New York-based JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the
biggest U.S. lender, and also served as head of European
investment banking corporates in London, Lazard said today in a
statement. He spent 26 years at the bank and focuses on
transactions in industrials and automotives, the advisory firm
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lazard has targeted at least $125 million in expense
reductions, giving the Hamilton, Bermuda-based company
flexibility to hire senior employees, Chief Executive Officer
Ken Jacobs, 54, told investors last week on a conference call.
Slaughter resigned from JPMorgan as part of a long-standing plan
to do something new with his career, the Financial Times
reported in February, citing an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have known and respected Larry for many years,&#8221;
Antonio Weiss, Lazard&#8217;s global head of investment banking, said
in the statement. &#8220;His industry knowledge, sound judgment and
dealmaking skills will be of great value to our clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) made its
$820 million offer to take Ebix (EBIX) Inc. private as U.S. regulators
intensify their probes of the insurance software maker,
according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The all-cash deal amounts to about $20 a share, Atlanta-
based Ebix said yesterday. Its shares jumped 11 percent on the
news to $20.60 in Nasdaq trading, the biggest one-day gain since
October 2011. The shares dropped 5.1 percent to $19.55 at
12:26 p.m. today in New York. A &#8220;go-shop&#8221; provision allows
Ebix to solicit competing bids in the next 45 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should no better offer emerge, New York-based Goldman Sachs
will become the owner of a company whose accounting practices
were already under scrutiny by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission in November, according to four people with direct
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That probe, consisting of interviews with former employees,
has since been upgraded to a formal investigation, according to
a person who was briefed on the matter after the Goldman Sachs
deal was announced and who asked not to be named because the
matter was confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebix is also the subject of an Internal Revenue Service
investigation, according to this person, along with a second
individual with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was able to
avoid paying as much as 20 million pounds ($31 million) in U.K.
taxes as the government fought to shield Chancellor of the
Exchequer George Osborne from political embarrassment, an
advocacy group said at a London trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group, UK Uncut, said Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue  Customs
reached the agreement with Goldman Sachs on the day Osborne
announced a bankers&#8217; code to counter tax avoidance. The HMRC
executive said in an e-mail cited by UK Uncut that he was
concerned the bank might drop out of the code if the deal was
scuttled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The reputation and standing of officials or of HMRC, and
potential embarrassment to a minister, is not a relevant matter
to take into account when deciding to waive collection of
several million pounds of interest,&#8221; Ingrid Simler, a lawyer
for UK Uncut, said in filings prepared for a judicial review
that started in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government has pledged to clamp down on tax-
avoidance schemes following widespread media and public anger
caused by the amount of corporation tax the likes of Google
Inc. (GOOG), Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) pay in the country.
Lawmakers said in a report last week that increased transparency
about companies&#8217; tax affairs would build pressure on
multinational businesses to &#8220;pay a fair share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generac Holdings Inc. (GNRC)&#8217;s $1.15 billion
term loan supporting a dividend and refinancing is being led by
JPMorgan Chase  Co., which will host a lender meeting tomorrow,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction who
asked not to be identified because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generator maker is paying a dividend of as much as $5 a
share, the company said today in a regulatory filing. The new
financing will include a $150 million asset-based revolving
credit line that will be undrawn at closing, Generac said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generac, based in Waukesha, Wisconsin, will incur about
$335 million in debt from the payout, according to the filing.
It has about $801 million outstanding under a term loan due in
May 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt,
obtained last year, began paying interest at 5 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate with a 1.25 percent
minimum on the lending benchmark, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a revolving line of credit, money may be borrowed again
once it&#8217;s repaid; in a term loan it can&#8217;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collapse in the price difference
between the world&#8217;s two most-traded crude oil grades is
fulfilling a prediction Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has held for
more than a year. Bank of America Corp. says it won&#8217;t last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude&#8217;s premium to West Texas Intermediate slumped
more than 50 percent to a 16-month low in the past two months,
falling to less than $10 a barrel for the first time since
January 2012. The differential narrowed to as little as $8.66 a
barrel today, after rising to a record $28.08 in October 2011.
Brent was typically cheaper in the past decade, averaging $1.28
a barrel less than WTI, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread &#8220;has been extremely volatile, moving one way
and then another,&#8221; said Olivier Jakob, managing director at
consultant Petromatrix GmbH in Zug, Switzerland. &#8220;The question
remains of where is the equilibrium price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divide between Brent, a gauge for more than half the
world&#8217;s oil, and WTI, the U.S. benchmark grade, has narrowed as
North Sea supplies resumed following oilfield maintenance, while
a switched pipeline began relieving a glut of crude at America&#8217;s
oil hub at Cushing, Oklahoma. Credit Suisse AG and Barclays Plc
said in 2011 that the Cushing gridlock had made WTI so cheap
relative to Brent, that the U.S. grade was losing its relevance
as a global benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;North Sea &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent has lost 9.6 percent in 2013, trading at $100.45 a
barrel today on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange,
after the restart of North Sea oil fields such as Buzzard and
Elgin-Franklin in March. WTI on the New York Mercantile Exchange
was at $91.45, little changed this year, as projects including
Enterprise Products Partners LP and Enbridge Inc.&#8217;s Seaway
pipeline eroded the glut at Cushing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has said since February 2012 that the gap
would narrow, reiterating April 23 that it would shrink to about
$5 a barrel in the third quarter as refiners in the Midwest
boost operations after seasonal maintenance work and new U.S.
supplies from Texas are redirected away from Cushing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The entire balance at Cushing will shift from a small
surplus into a pretty significant deficit over the next couple
of months,&#8221; Stefan Wieler, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs
in New York, said in a telephone interview on April 30. &#8220;The
bottleneck between Cushing, Oklahoma, and the Gulf Coast is
starting to disappear. There are a number of pipelines that have
been added, reversed or expanded that will make this happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seaway Pipeline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise (EPD) and Enbridge&#8217;s Seaway pipeline transported
302,000 barrels a day from Cushing to the Gulf Coast in the week
to April 26 after flows through the link were reversed last
year, remote-sensing company Genscape Inc. said yesterday.
Magellan Midstream Partners LP&#8217;s Longhorn line, Sunoco Logistics
Partners LP&#8217;s Permian Express, and TransCanada Corp.&#8217;s Keystone
XL project are also set to divert crude from Cushing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Bank of America, the narrowing of the spread is
temporary, with the difference poised to rebound to $21 a barrel
in the third quarter, according to an April 17 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market knows that this is all coming on stream, and
is positioned for that,&#8221; Sabine Schels, a commodity strategist
at Bank of America in London, said in an interview yesterday.
&#8220;Our worry is that that production growth will eventually
outpace the growth in pipeline capacity. And more importantly,
what are refiners going to do with all that crude?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refiners on the Gulf coast aren&#8217;t configured to process the
additional low-density, or &#8220;light,&#8221; crude being produced,
according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Catch On &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By the end of this year, the market will catch on to the
fact that we&#8217;re just going to push the inventories in Cushing
down to the Gulf coast,&#8221; Schels said. &#8220;That should lead to a
wider spread again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of America and Goldman WTI-Brent predictions are
among the most divergent of analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The median forecast for the third quarter is about
$15 a barrel, and $12 for the fourth quarter, according to 36
analyst predictions for WTI and 38 for Brent. Citigroup Inc. and
Standard Chartered Bank Plc predict that the gap will end the
year close to current levels, averaging $10 a barrel in the
fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &#8220;U.S. shale oil production is flourishing,&#8221; putting
downward pressure on WTI prices, &#8220;pipelines are being built,
reversed and expanded to accommodate the growth of local,
abundant crude supply,&#8221; capping the spread, Ed Morse,
Citigroup&#8217;s global head of commodity research in New York, said
in a report on April 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hydraulic Fracturing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude production climbed to 7.33 million barrels a day
in the week ended April 19, the highest level since April 1992,
the Energy Department reported on April 24. Output has expanded
20 percent in the past year as a combination of horizontal
drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, unlocks supplies
from shale formations in North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil&#8217;s so-called forward curve, formed by prices for
successive monthly futures over the next decade, suggests the
Brent-WTI spread may remain closer to Goldman&#8217;s estimate in the
third quarter than to Bank of America&#8217;s. Brent contracts
averaged over the third quarter are trading at a premium of
$7.88 a barrel to the equivalent three-month average for WTI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s what makes a market,&#8221; Marshall Berol, co-portfolio
manager of the Encompass Fund in San Francisco, which has about
$250 million in assets, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;You get
some people on one side of a question and others on the other
side. It&#8217;s a huge market, and a lot of people are playing in it
with big bucks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kion Group GmbH said it&#8217;s considering
an initial public offering this year, the first time the world&#8217;s
second-largest maker of forklifts publicly confirmed plans to
list in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company and its shareholders KKR  Co. (KKR) and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), are &#8220;actively monitoring the capital markets
to decide on the timing of any potential transaction,&#8221; company
spokesman Michael Hauger said in an e-mailed statement today.
Kion hasn&#8217;t yet decided on the final timing, he said, adding
that an IPO would help to &#8220;continue its profitable growth path
and support its future strategic development.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kion was part of German industrial-gas maker Linde AG
before a 4-billion euro buyout in 2006. Sales increased 8.2
percent to 4.7 billion euros last year even as global demand for
industrial trucks dropped by 3.1 percent, as the company
benefited from orders in China, where Kion is the largest
overseas forklift-maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR and Goldman Sachs have already lined up banks to handle
the planned initial public offering of Kion, people with
knowledge of the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) was added to the list of financial
institutions that already includes owners Goldman Sachs and
KKR&#8217;s equity capital markets arm as well as Deutsche Bank AG,
said the people. The IPO will probably happen before July if
markets remain stable and Wiesbaden, Germany-based Kion may sell
as much as 25 percent of its stock, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR and Goldman sold 25 percent of Kion to Weichai Power
Co., China&#8217;s biggest maker of heavy-duty trucks, in August to
help trim debt. Kion also sold 70 percent of its hydraulics unit
to the Chinese firm. The moves brought Kion 738 million euros
($974 million) in investment from Weichai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kion trails Toyota Industries Corp., an affiliate of Toyota
Motor Corp., in the global forklift market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak
is facing calls before a weekend election to justify a $3
billion bond placement by the sovereign-wealth fund he leads,
with opponents saying the deal was unnecessary and mispriced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman (GS) Sachs Group Inc. arranged the March 19 sale of 10-
year debt by 1Malaysia Development Bhd., also known as 1MDB, and
the notes were priced to yield 4.4 percent, 141 basis points
more than sovereign Islamic dollar bonds due July 2021 were
yielding at that time. The 1MDB yield was 3.76 percent today,
giving investors who were in at the start a return of 5.7
percent for the six weeks since the debt was issued. U.S.
Treasuries gained 1.43 percent on average during the period,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The private placement raised too many red flags, coming
so close to the election date,&#8221; said Wong Chen, a 44-year-old
corporate lawyer and a parliamentary candidate from the
opposition National Justice Party. &#8220;They were rushing this out
and they don&#8217;t know how to spend it. We don&#8217;t know who received
this private placement and who they may sell it on to.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Najib is chairman of the board of advisors of 1MDB and the
March bond sale has given candidates opposing him in the May 5
polls ammunition to criticize the fund, with Wong calling for
more transparency. The accusations are part of a smear campaign
before the voting, according to a government spokesman, who&#8217;s
not authorized to be named. Recent opinion polls suggest that
the election will be tight with the opposition alliance having
gained support in recent months, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
said in a report published today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Inc. partner James Covello says that when it comes to race horses, his work on Wall Street has taught him it&#8217;s all about spreading the risk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was still a big leap in purchasing a 40 percent stake in Falling Sky, one of 20 horses scheduled to run in the 139th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs (CHDN) in Louisville, Kentucky, in two days, Covello said. The 3-year-old went for $425,000 at the Ocala Breeders Sales Co. winter sale in January, by far the highest price of the session three years after the colt was purchased for $16,000 at Keeneland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a calculated risk,&#8221; Covello, 40, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;You have to be as analytical as possible in trying to marry the numbers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Falling Sky will go off at 50-1 in the Derby, the first leg of thoroughbred racing&#8217;s Triple Crown. Since Covello and his partners bought the colt, he has won the Sam F. Davis on Feb. 2, come in third at the Tampa Bay Derby on March 9 and fourth in the Arkansas Derby, the longest of his races at 1 1/8 miles, to earn $205,000 so far in 2013. The Kentucky Derby is 1 1/4 miles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Covello, a semiconductor analyst at Goldman Sachs (GS), studies Thoro-Graph, a performance-rating number that is calculated on the basis of time of the race, beaten lengths, ground lost or saved, weight carried, the effect of wind, and a track variant. Falling Sky&#8217;s number is 5, the same as Giacomo, a 50-1 longshot that captured the Derby in 2005 to return $102.60 on a $2 win bet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was warned by
U.S. energy-market authorities that they may take action against
its employees as part of an inquiry into bidding practices, the
New York Times said, citing a document it reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enforcement officials at the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission plan to recommend the agency hold traders and
commodities-unit chief Blythe Masters &#8220;individually liable,&#8221;
the newspaper reported, citing a 70-page document the agency
sent the New York-based bank in March. Investigators said
Masters falsely denied awareness of problems, the Times said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case focuses on eight &#8220;schemes&#8221; adopted by traders in
Houston between September 2010 and June 2011, according to the
newspaper. The traders offered energy at prices &#8220;calculated to
falsely appear attractive,&#8221; prompting state authorities in
California and Michigan to make about $83 million in
&#8220;excessive&#8221; payments to JPMorgan, the Times cited
investigators as saying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The staff is challenging a bidding strategy that was
transparent and was in full compliance with the applicable
rules,&#8221; the Times quoted Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for the

&lt;p&gt;A judge handling a $2 billion lawsuit
against banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and UBS AG (UBSN) brought
by the former Thornburg Mortgage invited their lawyers to file
statements on the possible appointment of a mediator to resolve
the dispute, according to a federal court filing in Baltimore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge, after holding a hearing on the banks&#8217; requests
for dismissal of the suit, gave no deadline for the &#8220;brief
statements&#8221; about a mediator although he said &#8220;quickly
advised&#8221; in a handwritten note filed in court May 1.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee for what is now TMST Inc. accused the banks,
including Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc,
of extracting more than $700 million of margin and interest

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s operating system for mobile devices could become a serious competitor to Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. software in the next year, Acer Inc. (2353) President Jim Wong said today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main thing holding the platform back is a lack of applications -- a failing that Microsoft is working to solve, Wong said in an interview after introducing a new line of Acer products in New York. Acer, the fourth-largest personal-computer maker, sells a range of PCs and tablets with Windows, though it doesn&#8217;t offer any phones with Microsoft software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Windows for now is still a leader in the productivity field,&#8221; he said, referring to Microsoft&#8217;s dominance in PCs and office software. Within the next year, the mobile version of the software is poised to mount a real challenge, he said. &#8220;We have high hopes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the PC industry in decline, Acer has an interest in its partner Microsoft making the transition to mobile devices. Global PC shipments tumbled 14 percent last quarter, the fourth straight period of decreases, according to research firm IDC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, Microsoft hasn&#8217;t made much of a dent in either smartphones or tablets. Windows accounted for less than 4 percent of tablet shipments in the first quarter, compared with 40 percent for Apple&#8217;s iOS and almost 57 percent for Google&#8217;s Android, according to IDC. In smartphones, Microsoft had 2.7 percent of the market at the end of last year. Android and Apple combined controlled more than 90 percent of shipments, IDC said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the New York event, Acer unveiled four computing products, including a 7.9-inch Android mini-tablet and a convertible tablet that pairs with a keyboard. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Katie Linsell" date="May 03, 2013 12:20 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-03/microsoft-at-t-cross-atlantic-for-euro-rates.html"><headline>Microsoft, AT&amp;amp;T Cross Atlantic for Euro Rates</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and ATT Inc. (T) are
among U.S. borrowers selling the most bonds in Europe since the
start of 2008, taking advantage of record-low borrowing costs
that outstrip dollar rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American issuers raised 17.2 billion euros ($22.5 billion)
from bond sales this year, nine times the amount for the same
period in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
average yield on investment-grade euro corporate bonds fell to
an unprecedented 1.75 percent yesterday, or 89 basis points
below comparable dollar notes, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes show. That&#8217;s the biggest discount since June 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate
to a record 0.5 percent yesterday as it tries to lift the euro-
region out of recession, encouraging companies to take advantage
of cheap funding. In the U.S., where the economy is expanding at
a 2.5 percent annual rate, the Federal Reserve will probably
reduce its monthly bond buying in the fourth quarter as it
begins to scale back its record stimulus, according to
economists in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;U.S. companies will issue where they think they can
borrow cheaply and where there&#8217;s significant demand,&#8221; said
Craig Veysey, the head of fixed income at Sanlam Private
Investments Ltd. in London, part of the Sanlam Group, which
oversees $72 billion of assets. &#8220;The huge drop in yields we&#8217;ve
seen over the last month, in particular in Europe, would have
meant that it&#8217;s easy for U.S. issuers to get their deals away.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, who has said he personally owns shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), is backing the bank&#8217;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon as shareholders vote this month on whether to split his roles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m 100 percent for Jamie,&#8221; Buffett told Bloomberg Television&#8217;s Betty Liu yesterday in Omaha, Nebraska. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t think of a better chairman.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Calls for Dimon, 57, to relinquish the chairmanship have mounted since New York-based JPMorgan disclosed risk-control lapses on derivatives bets last year that fueled more than $6.2 billion of losses. In March, the company&#8217;s board urged investors to vote against naming a separate chairman at the May 21 meeting, saying that Dimon&#8217;s dual role remains the &#8220;most effective leadership model.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buffett said in November that Dimon would be the best candidate to lead the U.S. Treasury Department in a financial crisis. President Barack Obama eventually nominated Jacob J. Lew to the post vacated by Timothy F. Geithner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors would risk shortening Dimon&#8217;s tenure if they appoint a separate chairman and their company&#8217;s stock may lose its &#8220;premium valuation,&#8221; Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said last month in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) and Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) led dollar-denominated
bond sales of $43 billion in the busiest week this year for
high-grade technology companies as relative yields narrowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, the largest U.S. maker of smartphones, set a record
for the biggest corporate bond sale ever with its $17 billion
six-part offering on April 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. IBM raised $2.25 billion and Texas Instruments sold
$1 billion, bringing the number of investment-grade technology
issuers in the market to three, the highest this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple kicked off the rush of issuance when it announced on
April 23 that it was planning to raise debt for the first time
in almost two decades to help fund a $100 billion capital reward
for shareholders. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest software
maker, came to market later that week with a $2.67 billion
offering in euros and dollars followed by Texas Instruments, in
their first sales this year, and IBM, which obtained record-low
coupons on its first sale in three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It definitely wakes you up, because if a competitor of
yours is starting to do or change strategies, you&#8217;re going to
take note,&#8221; William Larkin, a fixed-income portfolio manager
who helps oversee $500 million at Cabot Money Management Inc.,
said in a telephone interview from Salem, Massachusetts. &#8220;There
is always a herd mentality, because it&#8217;s how you survive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Herd Mentality&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures narrowed to 208 basis points
as of yesterday from 212 basis points on April 26, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Yields decreased to a
record-low 3.35 percent from 3.38 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offerings increased from $39.4 billion last week and were
the most since $47.3 billion in the five days ended March 22,
Bloomberg data show. Apple&#8217;s offering helped push sales in April
to $148.6 billion, the most ever for the month in data going
back to 1999, and the busiest period since January&#8217;s $171
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fall in Treasury yields &#8220;has encouraged issuers to
maybe think, &#8216;Is this the last opportunity we&#8217;ve got to take
advantage of the low-rate environment?&#8217;&#8221; Jonathan Fine, head of
investment-grade syndicate for the Americas at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. in New York, which helped manage the Apple sale, said
in a telephone interview. &#8220;Demand for well-rated, large-cap
companies is extraordinary right now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year Treasury note&#8217;s yield has dropped to 1.7
percent from 2.06 percent on a closing basis on March 11, the
highest in about a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Participation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orders for the Apple sale totaled $52 billion, according to
a person familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be
identified citing lack of authorization to speak publicly. The
Cupertino, California-based company sold its first bonds since
1996, issuing $3 billion of floating-rate notes and $14 billion
of fixed-rate securities, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The strength of the Apple credit drove participation
globally,&#8221; Matthew Siracuse, a managing director in global risk
syndicate at Deutsche Bank AG,  which also helped run the Apple
deal, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We saw good participation
from both European as well as Asian accounts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering&#8217;s largest portion, $5.5 billion of 2.4
percent, 10-year securities paying a 75 basis-point spread,
traded at 100.247 cents on the dollar to yield 2.37 percent, a
spread of 74.2 basis points, at 8:24 a.m. in New York, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. The floating-rate portion
included bonds due in 2016 and 2018, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;More Defensive&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing a deeper bid for floating-rate notes,&#8221;
Siracuse said. &#8220;There is a subset of the overall market that
believes rates are going to go higher and is being more
defensive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $37.6
billion, compared with $31.2 billion last week and a 2013 weekly
average of $23.4 billion, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on investment-grade debt fell to a record-low 2.647
percent yesterday from 2.66 percent on April 26, according to
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate index. Spreads
were unchanged at 147 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Instruments, the largest maker of analog
semiconductors, issued equal $500 million portions of 1 percent,
five-year notes that pay a relative yield of 55 basis points and
2.25 percent, 10-year bonds with a spread of 85, Bloomberg data
show. Proceeds from the sale will be used to repay debt
including its $500 million of 0.875 percent notes maturing May
15, the Dallas-based company said May 1 in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Coupon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When treasurers get a chance to look back at what we&#8217;re
experiencing today, and the coupons they&#8217;re achieving, they&#8217;ll
say, &#8217;Those were the good old days.&#8217;&#8221; Timothy Cox, executive
director of debt capital markets at Mizuho Securities USA Inc.
in New York, which helped sell the Texas Instruments bonds, said
in a telephone interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re in the middle of it right
now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM obtained a record-low 1.625 percent coupon on $1.25
billion of notes due May 2020, beating a 1.65 percent rate on
$750 million of debt sold last July by Texas Instruments,
Bloomberg data show. The largest computer-services provider also
sold $1 billion of three-year debt at a 0.45 percent coupon,
matching a record-low for that maturity obtained by Apple Inc. (AAPL),
Texas Instruments, Unilever Plc and Walt Disney Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speculative Grade &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offerings of speculative-grade bonds reached at least $6
billion, compared with $7.8 billion last week and a 2013 weekly
average of $8.2 billion, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on junk debt fell to a record-low 6.085 percent
yesterday from 6.16 percent on April 26, according to the Bank
of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield index. Spreads narrowed
15 basis points to 445 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuers planning sales include Seven Generations Energy
Ltd. with a $250 million offering of seven-year notes and ION
Geophysical Corp. with a $175 million deal, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaysia&#8217;s opposition coalition led by
Anwar Ibrahim may ask Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to renegotiate
terms on a $3 billion bond placement should it win the election
this weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank arranged the March 19 debt sale by 1Malaysia
Development Bhd., a sovereign-wealth fund known as 1MDB headed
by Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose political opponents have
questioned the timing, cost and pricing of the issue. New York-
based Goldman&#8217;s fees exceeded $200 million for arranging the
placement and three other dollar bond sales totaling $6.35
billion by Malaysian issuers in the past two years, according to
a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are really focused on corporate governance and should
we win, we will review all public deals,&#8221; Rafizi Ramli,
strategic director at Anwar&#8217;s People&#8217;s Justice Party, said in an
interview in Kuala Lumpur today. &#8220;The 1MDB transaction has been
shrouded in secrecy. We would go back to the renegotiation table
and see what would have been a fairer deal should there be any
questionable part of the deal mix.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling National Front coalition is facing its fiercest
challenge to date, after retaining power five years ago by the
narrowest margin since Malaysia won independence from the U.K.
in 1957. This is going to be the closest election Malaysia has
had and there&#8217;s a possibility the opposition will win, Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at
the National University of Singapore, told Bloomberg TV today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s decision to pull out
of Bangladesh is fueling debate over whether other manufacturers
should leave the country or stay put to improve workplace
conditions in the South Asian nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, removed
Bangladesh in March from a list of countries where it authorizes
partners to produce clothing and merchandise, according to a
letter to licensees released yesterday. Belarus, Ecuador,
Pakistan and Venezuela were also taken off the list, which cut
the number of acceptable nations to 172 from 215, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Disney&#8217;s contractors had less than 1 percent of the
company&#8217;s production in Bangladesh, marketers with more activity
there will have to decide whether to stay and spend to improve
worker safety or go elsewhere and potentially see the costs of
their products rise even more. They need to make the calculation
as they assess the risk to their brand names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a move afoot for companies to say clearly, &#8216;We
need to be part of bigger oversight procedures,&#8217;&#8221; Cory Krupp,
an associate professor at Duke University&#8217;s Sanford School of
Public Policy, said in a phone interview. &#8220;The other way is
just to move to Vietnam or Cambodia where they have better
standards and the government is better at upholding them, and
Bangladesh is going to learn the hard way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iron Man 3,&#8221; the superhero movie
from Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s Marvel division, may earn as much as $170
million in its opening weekend, placing it among the best debuts
ever, box-office tracker Hollywood.com Box-Office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be the second-best premiere since &#8220;The
Avengers,&#8221; also from Marvel, opened with $207.4 million a year
ago. The current No. 2 is Time Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s &#8220;Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hallows - Part 2,&#8221; which had sales of $169.2
million in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big debut for &#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; would start Hollywood&#8217;s
summer on a positive note as domestic ticket sales year to date
lag the year-ago period by 12 percent. With potential
blockbusters including &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; and &#8220;Man of Steel&#8221; lined
up, the momentum could carry through to September, allowing
studios and theaters to approach 2012&#8217;s record $10.8 billion box
office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s showings in 4,253 theaters generated $68.3
million in receipts, the ninth-biggest single-day gross ever,
Hollywood.com said. The top single-day take was the $90.1
million earned by Warner Bros. &#8220;Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows - Part 2.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; has already opened internationally and
generated big numbers which, in turn, has prompted U.S.-based
analysts to raise their estimates for its run in the U.S. and
Canada. The movie has generated $361 million in global ticket
sales, including $15.6 million from late-night screenings at
U.S. theaters May 2, Disney said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iron Man&#8221; had $38.7 million on its first day in 2008,
and $98.6 million in its opening weekend. &#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221; earned
$51.2 million in its first day in 2010, and $128.1 million for
its debut weekend, Hollywood.com said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC, (ADCB) the
third-biggest lender by assets in the United Arab Emirates, was
raised to overweight at JPMorgan Chase  Co. after it cut
exposure to low quality assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ADCB management has commendably turned around the
franchise over the last two-three years by cleaning up the asset
book, prudently managing liquidity while conserving spreads
better versus regional peers and strengthening the capital base
by disposal of non-core assets,&#8221; analysts including Naresh Bilandani wrote in a research report. This has made &#8220;the
business model much simpler -&#8211; simplicity receives a plus from
bank investors in the current regulatory scenario.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADCB said last week it settled lawsuits against Morgan
Stanley, Standard  Poor&#8217;s, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service Inc. and
others over its purchase of Cheyne SIV notes. The bank reported
a 4 percent increase in first-quarter profit to 830 million
dirhams ($226 million), beating analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised the recommendation from neutral and
increased the price estimate to 5.50 dirhams from 5 dirhams. The
stock closed at 4.61 dirhams last week. It has surged 55 percent
this year, outpacing the 30 percent climb for Abu Dhabi&#8217;s ADX
Banks Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also raised the price estimate of First Gulf Bank, (FGB)
its top pick among banks in the Middle East and North Africa, to
18 dirhams from 13.50 dirhams. The overweight recommendation was
maintained. The stock has risen 25 percent this year to 14.55
dirhams last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Bank of Abu Dhabi, the U.A.E.&#8217;s biggest bank by
assets, was cut to neutral from overweight at JPMorgan, saying
the shares are &#8220;trading close to their June 2014 fair value and
the relative valuation of NBAD looking stretched versus peer
regional names.&#8221; The stock gained 31 percent this year to 12.25
dirhams last week. &lt;/p&gt;
