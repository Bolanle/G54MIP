&lt;p&gt;Warburg Pincus LLC and a buyout fund
run by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to acquire a majority
stake in Endurance International Group, a provider of Internet
hosting and online services to small and midsize companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction was for $975 million, said a person briefed
on the deal, who asked not to be named because the information
is private. The size of Warburg Pincus&#8217;s share will itself
represent a majority stake, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms weren&#8217;t disclosed in a statement today from the
companies. Accel-KKR, the Menlo Park, California-based
technology-focused private-equity firm that bought a majority
share of Endurance in 2008, will maintain an interest, as will
the current management of Burlington, Massachusetts-based
Endurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms, which pool investor money to take
over companies by buying out shareholders, are aiming to benefit
from growth in the Internet. KKR  Co. (KKR), Silver Lake Partners and
Technology Crossover Ventures announced in July a deal with Go
Daddy Group Inc. that valued the website registration and
hosting company at $2.25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Endurance is extremely well-positioned as a leader in its
rapidly growing, yet fragmented, market,&#8221; Joe DiSabato,
managing director at New York-based GS Capital Partners, said in
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deal Advisers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse (CS) advised New York-based Warburg Pincus and
provided the debt financing for the transaction. Cleary Gottlieb
Steen  Hamilton LLP was legal counsel to Warburg Pincus, and
Goodwin Proctor LLP was legal counsel to GS Capital Partners.
Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world&#8217;s largest brokerage, advised
Accel-KKR, and Kirkland  Ellis LLP served as legal counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warburg Pincus has raised 13 private-equity funds and
manages more than $30 billion in assets. GS Capital Partners is
the private-equity arm of Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe there is an enormous opportunity to build on
Endurance&#8217;s success,&#8221; Jim Neary, a Warburg Pincus managing
director, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH),
a provider of technology consulting and outsourcing services,
said the U.S. needs to grant more visas to skilled technology
workers from India and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding enough skilled American workers is &#8220;a real
issue,&#8221; said Cognizant Chief Executive Officer Francisco D&#8217;Souza in an interview with Bloomberg Television. &#8220;Businesses
around the world are becoming more tech intensive and for them
to stay on the leading edge competitively, they need the
talent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While unemployment nationwide is at 9 percent, it&#8217;s far
lower -- about 5 percent -- in software engineering and even
lower in electrical engineering because there aren&#8217;t enough
skilled workers, he said. Part of the problem is the visa
program limits the number of foreign workers by country so it&#8217;s
harder to get a visa for Chinese and Indian workers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaneck, New Jersey-based Cognizant has most of its
staffers based in India, but also employs people just to search
for workers in the U.S., D&#8217;Souza said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as customers fret that demand will suffer amid
economic weakness, clients are telling Cognizant "they will
spend about the same, maybe a little bit more, on technology" in
2012, he said in the interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by
Louisiana&#8217;s pension fund for police, which said the bank&#8217;s
$88.3 million settlement with the U.S. Treasury Department
stemmed from a breach of fiduciary duty by its directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, filed today in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan, follows an Aug. 25 announcement that the company
agreed to resolve alleged violations of international sanctions
programs including Cuban assets control and anti-terrorism
regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System,
an investor in JPMorgan that provides retirement benefits for
full-time municipal police officers in Louisiana, accused the
current directors of the New York-based bank, including Chairman
Jamie Dimon, of &#8220;knowingly&#8221; allowing and rewarding violations
of Treasury Department programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The misconduct occurred, unchecked, under the defendants&#8217;
watch because of their complicity in the improprieties alleged
herein,&#8221; the pension fund said in the complaint. &#8220;Because of
its acquiescence in the scheme, JPMC&#8217;s board cannot be
disinterested and independent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury said that JPMorgan, through its correspondent
banks, maintained prohibited financial transactions with
sanctioned entities in countries including Cuba and Iran. The
JPMorgan payment agreed upon by the Office of Foreign Assets
Control, known as OFAC, involves &#8220;egregious&#8221; violations for
five years, according to a Treasury Department statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OFAC enforcement action covers actions from December
2005 to March 2011 involving multiple violations of sanctions
programs, the Treasury Department said. The violations include
processing 1,711 wire transfers totaling $178.5 million from
December 2005 to March 2006 involving Cuban people and a trade
loan of
$2.9 million with a blocked affiliate to the Islamic Republic of
Iran Shipping Lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OFAC said the $88.3 million payment from JPMorgan is based
on the bank&#8217;s cooperation, transaction review and the absence of
an OFAC notice or finding of violation during the five years of
the transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages &#8220;caused by the
individual defendants&#8217; unlawful course of conduct and breaches
of fiduciary duty,&#8221; including costs to the company associated
with the settlement, remedial measures, damage to goodwill and
&#8220;increased regulatory scrutiny.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. Dimon, 653083/2011, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by two
investors who claim the bank was &#8220;at the very center&#8221; of
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors, Stephen and Leyla Hill, claim JPMorgan
should have been aware that Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities LLC was passing all the money he stole from customers
through a JPMorgan account known as the &#8220;703 Account.&#8221; They
seek to represent all investors who had money invested with
Madoff in December 2008, when he was arrested and the fraud
collapsed. He was convicted and sentenced to 150 years in
prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While numerous financial institutions enabled Madoff&#8217;s
fraud, JPMC was at the very center of that fraud, and thoroughly
complicit in it,&#8221; the Hills said in a complaint filed today in
Manhattan federal court. &#8220;JPMC could not perform even cursory
due diligence on Madoff or BLMIS without bumping up against
evidence of Madoff&#8217;s fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit comes a week after a judge dismissed $19 billion
in claims by the trustee liquidating Madoff&#8217;s former firm. On
Nov. 1, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan ruled
that the trustee, Irving Picard, isn&#8217;t the legally appropriate
party to demand common-law damages on behalf of former Madoff
investors such as the Hills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment on
the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: Hill v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 11-07961, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) was accused of fraud
by Moneygram Payment Systems Inc., the electronic cash-transfer
business, in a lawsuit seeking to recover an alleged $140
million in collateralized debt obligation losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank and two of its units, Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Ltd., undertook a &#8220;fraudulent
scheme&#8221; to sell nine mortgage-related CDOs to Moneygram from
2005 to 2007, according to a complaint filed Oct. 26 in state
court in Minneapolis. Citigroup allegedly marketed the CDOs as
investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In reality, however, the CDOs that Citi sold to Moneygram
were &#8216;junk&#8217; on the very day that Citi sold them,&#8221; according to
the complaint. The CDOs weren&#8217;t backed by the promised
overcollateralization of assets, Minneapolis-based Moneygram
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third-biggest U.S. lender, Citigroup last month agreed
to pay $285 million to settle U.S. regulatory claims that it
misled investors about the nature of a $1 billion collateralized
debt offering in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the suit is without merit,&#8221; Danielle Romero-
Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, said in an
e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Moneygram Payment Systems Inc. v. Citigroup
Inc., 27cv11-21348, Hennepin County, Minnesota, District Court
(Minneapolis). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT to Get Updated Sprint Data in T-Mobile Case, Court Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. must be provided by Sprint Nextel Corp (S) with
updated internal documents relevant to its defense against a
U.S. antitrust lawsuit seeking to block its purchase of T-Mobile
USA Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint must turn over all documents requested by ATT that
the company hasn&#8217;t already given the Justice Department,
including data on Sprint&#8217;s recent addition of Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s
iPhone, U.S. Special Master Richard Levie in Washington said in
a ruling Nov. 6. Levie said Sprint must give ATT the data it
seeks by Nov. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ATT is entitled to discover what effect the iPhone and
other events of the past few months have had on Sprint&#8217;s
relevant market share, a part of the government&#8217;s&#8221; case, Levie
said, adding that the documents Sprint gave the Justice
Department are more than six months old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT in a filing last week in U.S. District Court listed 47
areas of interest, including whether Sprint had any plans for a
&#8220;business combination&#8221; with T-Mobile if the ATT transaction
is blocked. ATT says it needs the documents to defend against
the Justice Department&#8217;s suit to stop the $39 billion
transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levie noted in his ruling yesterday that 29 requests had
remained in dispute between the companies. Of those, 11 involved
supplementing information Sprint gave to the Justice Department
to include data from May to the present. Three requests also
seek data from May 2009 to April 2010 regarding Sprint&#8217;s
wireless-plan pricing and &#8220;specialized customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levie also said Sprint must turn over any information given
to the Federal Communications Commission regarding the T-Mobile
deal that hadn&#8217;t been given to the Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT also requested Sprint&#8217;s analysis of the merger and
information on Sprint&#8217;s bids for government contracts over the
past three years, the identities of Sprint&#8217;s business and
government customers, and the number and location of proposed
cell sites that Sprint planned at some point to deploy and
abandoned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint urged Levie to throw out ATT&#8217;s subpoenas, saying
its rival&#8217;s requests are &#8220;overlapping&#8221; and &#8220;burdensome.&#8221;
Levie, who is handling decisions on document exchanges in the
case, told Dallas-based ATT last month to remove from its
request any documents Sprint already provided to the Justice
Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Taylor, a spokesman for Overland Park, Kansas-based
Sprint, declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Balmoris, a spokesman for ATT, didn&#8217;t respond to
an e-mail message seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, who will decide
the case, has scheduled the trial for February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc. (T), 11-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana Won&#8217;t Face Penalties, Dismissal of BP Spill Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana won&#8217;t face penalties and possible dismissal of
its 2010 oil-spill damage claims after complying with a court
order to turn over state records to BP Plc (BP/), a federal judge
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier of New Orleans said Nov.4
in a one-page ruling that Louisiana &#8220;has certified to the
court&#8221; that it has turned over all applicable spill documents
sought by BP for use in the first phase of litigation over the
worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge Sally Shushan last week threatened to
fine the state as much as $2,500 a day if officials didn&#8217;t
produce the documents by Nov. 3. Shushan also said she would
increase the fines and might dismiss all of Louisiana&#8217;s
environmental and economic-damage claims from the spill if the
state missed further deadlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP faces at least 350 lawsuits by coastal businesses and
property owners for damages caused by more than 4.1 million
gallons of crude oil that leaked from its Gulf of Mexico well
last year. Louisiana has sued London-based BP for millions of
dollars in environmental and economic damages and seeks
pollution fines of at least $1 million a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Champion Whistle-Blower&#8217;s Crimes Spur Bid to Revise Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Champion Laboratories Inc. and other oil-filter makers
asked a judge to require more than 50 class-action lawsuits to
be refiled to remove any reference to a former employee who
pleaded guilty to fabricating a document that triggered a U.S.
antitrust probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Champion, Honeywell International Inc. (HON) and other companies
made the request Nov. 1 in federal court in Chicago, after the
Oct. 26 sentencing of William G. Burch to two years in prison.
Burch, 53, pleaded guilty on June 29 in Philadelphia, admitting
he concocted evidence in a 2008 whistle-blower lawsuit claiming
Champion and its competitors fixed prices on automobile
aftermarket filters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burch, who was fired by Champion, admitted he altered a
price-increase letter on Honeywell stationery to create a
&#8220;smoking gun&#8221; that made the case more enticing to a law firm
he hired. He said he lied to Justice Department prosecutors who
opened a grand jury investigation based on his phony claims. The
companies also claim he doctored conversations he recorded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the filter makers urged the judge overseeing
the civil litigation to bar those suing on behalf of direct and
indirect purchasers of filters from &#8220;benefiting from Burch&#8217;s
fraud by using his manipulated tapes and perjured testimony to
support their case,&#8221; according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This court has the inherent power to do much more; courts
have appropriately dismissed cases based on misconduct this
egregious,&#8221; wrote the attorneys, who amplified an earlier
request made in court papers before the Burch sentencing
hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for plaintiffs say they have substantial evidence
independent of Burch to show that the companies engaged in a
price-fixing scheme that began in 1999. In a Sept. 26 court
filing, they urged U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman to allow
the case to proceed so that they can conduct pre-trial
depositions of witnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that based on material independent of Mr.
Burch and certain material that corroborates what he says that
the case should continue,&#8221; said attorney Bernard Persky of
Labaton Sucharow LLP in New York, who represents direct
purchasers. &#8220;We should be allowed to do discovery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is United States v. William G. Burch, 11-
cr-334, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania
(Philadelphia). The civil case is In Re: Aftermarket Filters
Antitrust Litigation, 08-cv-4883, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon Is Said in Talks to Settle Trading Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), the world&#8217;s largest custody
bank, is in early stage talks with federal prosecutors to settle
accusations the bank overcharged customers for foreign-exchange
trading, according to a person briefed on the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks have just begun and it&#8217;s too soon to say whether
they will result in a settlement, and whether any deal could
serve as a model for resolving other lawsuits the bank is
facing, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the discussions are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Attorney in Manhattan filed suit against New York-
based BNY Mellon on Oct. 4, the same day the bank was sued by
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who said the bank
defrauded public pension funds of $2 billion over 10 years.
Attorneys general in Virginia and Florida have filed similar
lawsuits, as have pension funds in Los Angeles and other
California counties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Gerald Hassell, while denying the
accusations, has said he would be &#8220;pragmatic&#8221; in his approach
to resolving them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Heine, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, declined to
comment. Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney,
declined to comment on the talks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liquid Capital&#8217;s Kim Pleads Not Guilty to $6 Million Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Kim, the former hedge-fund manager at Liquid Capital
Management LLC accused of fleeing to Hong Kong while awaiting
trial on fraud charges, pleaded not guilty to running a $6
million Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim, 36, appeared Nov. 4 before Justice Charles Solomon in
New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan and pleaded to counts
in two indictments. One from February charged him with grand
larceny and other crimes for running the Ponzi scheme. Another
charged him with bail-jumping and fleeing to Hong Kong after
being accused in a previous case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim was indicted in 2009 and accused of stealing $430,000
from the Christadora House, an East Village condominium complex
where he lived. He fled before a trial in January using a
fraudulently obtained passport and was returned to the U.S. on
Oct. 12, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those who prey upon unsuspecting investors and attempt to
evade responsibility will be held accountable,&#8221; Manhattan
District Attorney Cyrus Vance said Nov. 4 in a statement about
the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim and his firm are accused of running a Ponzi scheme from
January 2003 to January 2011. Kim told clients they were
investing in safe and stable securities while he generated
losses trading highly speculative futures contracts and diverted
money to himself, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state case is People v. Kim, 2011/86, New York State
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). The CFTC suit is
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Kim, 11-cv-01013,
and the federal criminal case is U.S. v. Kim, 11-cr-00642, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lilly Not Responsible for Zyprexa User&#8217;s Death, Jury Finds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) isn&#8217;t responsible for the death of a
college student who was taking the drugmaker&#8217;s Zyprexa
antipsychotic medication, a jury ruled in the first case to go
to trial over the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in state court in Los Angeles deliberated about 11
hours over two days before clearing Lilly of responsibility for
the 2007 death of Cody Tadai, a 20-year-old community college
student who succumbed to diabetes-related illnesses while taking
Zyprexa for mental illness. His family alleged the company hid
the drug&#8217;s diabetes risks to protect sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased the jury recognized that Lilly met its
duty to warn about the risks of Zyprexa,&#8221; Stefanie Prodouz, a
Lilly spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the first verdict in a Zyprexa case since litigation
over the antipsychotic drug, the drugmaker&#8217;s top seller, began
more than eight years ago. Indianapolis-based Lilly, which lost
patent protection on Zyprexa last month, has paid about $2.9
billion to resolve government and individual claims over its
marketing of the medication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly agreed in 2009 to pay $1.42 billion to settle federal
prosecutors&#8217; allegations that it illegally marketed Zyprexa for
unapproved uses. The drugmaker also agreed to pay more than $260
million to resolve similar state claims. Lilly has agreed to pay
more than $1.2 billion to settle about 31,000 suits by former
users of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prodouz declined to comment Nov. 1 on why the drugmaker
decided to make the Tadai family&#8217;s Zyprexa suit the first to go
to trial. The drug was Lilly&#8217;s top seller last year with more
than $5 billion in sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker still faces about 40 Zyprexa suits that
include claims from about 110 former users of the drug, Lilly
executives said in an Oct. 28 U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randy Tadai, the student&#8217;s father, said the family brought
the case to draw attention to the dangers of the drug. He added
that while he was disappointed with the jury&#8217;s finding, the
family would &#8220;have to accept the decision of the court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lilly is sorry for the family&#8217;s loss, but the facts
didn&#8217;t point to either Zyprexa or Lilly as the cause&#8221; of the
college student&#8217;s death, Prodouz said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cody Tadai v. Eli Lilly  Co., BC 379020,
California Superior Court (Los Angeles County). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Bank to Settle $35 Million Overdraft-Fee Litigation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Bank will settle a lawsuit over its overdraft-fee
policy for $35 million, according to a filing in federal court
in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King ruled in September
that Union Bank would have to defend the civil claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers claimed in more than 30 nationwide lawsuits that
more than 30 banks process checking account debit card
transactions non-sequentially to deplete the accounts and
trigger overdraft fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Federal Reserve imposed rules prohibiting
lenders from automatically charging fees when consumers have
insufficient funds for electronic or debit transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least five suits in other states that weren&#8217;t part of
the multidistrict suit but claimed the same overcharge-fee
practices have settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Weidman, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Union
Bank, declined to comment on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very happy that we could come together with Union
Bank,&#8221; said Aaron S. Podhurst, attorney for the plaintiffs. &#8220;I
think it will be a very fair settlement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation,
09-cv-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
Miami). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA) Begins Settlement Plan for Phone-Hacking Victims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp.&#8217;s U.K. unit started a voluntary settlement
program for thousands of potential victims of phone hacking by
the company&#8217;s News of the World tabloid, which was shuttered in
July as the scandal expanded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victims can apply online for what it called a &#8220;speedy,
cost-effective alternative to litigation,&#8221; London-based News
International said Nov. 4 in a statement. The applications will
be assessed by former judge Charles Gray to ensure fairness, the
company said. The settlement program was first announced in
April and begins taking claims Nov. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It should provide very significant benefits to applicants
such as avoiding the enormous expense of court proceedings,&#8221;
Gray, a Court of Appeal judge who retired in 2008, said in the
statement. &#8220;I look forward to adjudicating awards under the
scheme, at all times safeguarding the fairness of the process
and the rights of applicants.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-year-old scandal swelled in July when it was
revealed the News of the World targeted the mobile phone of
murdered school girl Millie Dowler in 2002, hampering a police
search when she was missing. News Corp. closed the 168-year-old
tabloid and dropped its 7.8 billion-pound ($12.5 billion) bid
for full control of British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY) It was
previously thought the tabloid targeted only celebrities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement plan, which doesn&#8217;t have a preset limit on
how much it can pay out, starts as News Corp. Deputy Chief
Operating Officer James Murdoch prepares to testify for a second
time before Parliament about the scandal on Nov. 10. Former
executives questioned his previous testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London&#8217;s Metropolitan Police notified about 500 potential
victims whose names appear in the notes of the News of the
World&#8217;s former private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. Mulcaire was
jailed for hacking in 2007 along with a reporter. The police
said Nov. 4 the total number of victims could be as high as
5,795. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koh Seah Wee Sentenced to 22 Years Jail for Singapore Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koh Seah Wee was sentenced to 22 years in jail and Lim Chai
Meng to 15 years for their roles in cheating Singapore
government agencies of S$12.5 million ($10 million) in the
city&#8217;s biggest public-sector fraud since 1995. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koh, formerly a deputy director at the Singapore Land
Authority, pleaded guilty to 55 charges including cheating and
conversion of property from criminal proceeds at a hearing in
Singapore on Oct. 28. Lim, who was his subordinate, pleaded
guilty to 49 counts including money laundering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Tay Yong Kwang sentenced the men, who faced a
maximum of 10 years in jail for each cheating charge. Koh was
accused of defrauding the land authority of S$12.2 million and
the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore of S$286,000, and
was charged with 372 counts of cheating and corruption at the
agencies. Lim was charged on 309 counts of defrauding the land
authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravinderpal Singh, Koh&#8217;s lawyer, had urged the court to
consider his voluntary surrender and cooperation as mitigating
factors. About S$8.2 million in assets have been seized from
Koh, who graduated from Australia&#8217;s Queensland University of
Technology with a first class honors degree in electrical
engineering, Singh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors had sought imprisonment of 16 to 20 years for
Lim, while his lawyers, Subhas Anandan and Sunil Sudheesan,
asked Justice Tay to consider a jail term of 10 to 12 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ho Yen Teck, an accomplice in defrauding the land
authority, was sentenced on Jan. 14 to 10 years in jail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Court Filings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Suit Over Role in El Paso Buyout Most Popular Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which was sued by a pension fund
that alleges the New York-based investment bank had a conflict
of interest in its role as adviser in the planned $21 billion
purchase of El Paso Corp. (EP), was the most-read litigation docket
on the Bloomberg Law system last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which owns about 20 percent of Kinder Morgan
Inc., steered El Paso directors to sell at a price below its
full value, earning larger advisory fees than if the company had
completed a planned spinoff, lawyers for the Louisiana Municipal
Police Employees Retirement System said in the complaint.
Goldman Sachs also stands to see its Kinder Morgan investment
increase in value, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The El Paso board impermissibly heeded the advice of its
conflicted financial adviser Goldman Sachs and abandoned a
previously announced spinoff of its exploration and production
business in favor of a low premium sale to competitor Kinder
Morgan,&#8221; lawyers for the retirement system, an investor in El
Paso, said in the complaint filed Oct. 21 in Delaware Chancery
Court in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment on the lawsuit when it was filed except to say that
the bank&#8217;s representatives on Kinder Morgan&#8217;s board recused
themselves from the deal process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. Braniff, CA6960, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On The Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German Top Court to Rule on EFSF Panel By Christmas &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s highest court may rule by Christmas on whether a
special parliamentary body is authorized to clear emergency
issues regarding the euro rescue fund, Focus reported, citing
Andreas Vosskuhle, president of the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Constitutional Court last month placed a
temporary ban on any decisions taken by the nine-member
subcommittee of the country&#8217;s lower house of parliament
affecting the European Financial Stability Facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ban has only stopped the panel &#8220;temporarily&#8221; and the
court wants to take a principal decision by Christmas, the
magazine cited Vosskuhle as saying in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nexon Co., the Asian developer of
online games such as &#8220;Dragon Nest,&#8221; plans to raise as much as
100 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in an initial public offering,
said two people with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nexon hired Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604), Morgan Stanley and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to manage the offering in Japan, the
U.S. and Europe, said the people, who declined to be identified
before an announcement. The game maker will begin the IPO as
soon as this week, and expects to list on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange as early as Dec. 12, they said. The company is valued
at about 600 billion yen, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPO would be the biggest by a Japanese company this
year and the second largest in the technology industry worldwide
in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tokyo-based
Nexon and Gree Inc., whose shares have more than doubled this
year, aim to benefit from the growing popularity of games that
let people in different places play together on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors around the world are happy to inject their
money in areas where they can see growth,&#8221; said Kazumi Tanaka,
an IPO analyst at TC Financial Research Inc. in Tokyo. &#8220;Nexon
may use the money to acquire competitors and to find talented
people to develop the business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nexon has been preparing a Japan listing and is open to
buying more companies after making acquisitions in South Korea,
Chief Executive Officer Choi Seung Woo said last December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quake Recovery &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 31 Japanese companies have announced IPOs this
year, the most since 2008, Bloomberg data show, in a sign that
the equity capital market is beginning to recover from the March
earthquake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nexon has been aggressive in MA, so they may invest more
in that area,&#8221; said Jeong Dae Ho, a Seoul-based analyst at LIG
Investment  Securities Co. &#8220;They may use the proceeds from the
IPO to invest overseas to strengthen global channels and to be
able to directly source content in other countries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nexon, which develops games including &#8220;KartRider&#8221; and
&#8220;MapleStory,&#8221; has operations in South Korea, where it was
founded, as well as the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As we pursue our strategic objectives, we regularly
review our options for accelerating our growth,&#8221; Nexon&#8217;s Seoul
office said in an e-mailed response to questions on the IPO.
&#8220;We have made no decisions or announcements about any specific
financing or other plans and cannot comment on rumors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keiko Sugai, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Nomura, declined
to comment, as did Hiroko Matsumoto, a spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs in Tokyo, and Natsuo Nishio for Morgan Stanley. (MS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rival Gree, which provides a social network as well as
games, has climbed 171 percent on the Tokyo Stock Exchange this
year, increasing its market value to 649 billion yen. It&#8217;s the
fifth-best performer on the benchmark Topix Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS) asked U.S.
regulators to investigate whether Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) seeks to
monopolize the mobile-device market by demanding patent
royalties on electronics running on Google Inc.&#8217;s Android
operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft is embarking on a campaign of asserting trivial
and outmoded patents against manufacturers of Android devices,&#8221;
Barnes  Noble said in an Oct. 17 letter to Gene Kimmelman, the
Justice Department&#8217;s chief counsel for competition policy.
&#8220;Microsoft is attempting to raise its rivals&#8217; costs in order to
drive out competition and to deter innovation in mobile
devices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker accused New York-based
Barnes  Noble of infringing five patents and filed a complaint
with the U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington,
seeking to block imports of the Nook readers. Barnes  Noble
made public four letters and a presentation to the Justice
Department in a filing with the commission yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, contends it owns
patented inventions that are used in the Android operating
system, and has struck licensing deals with companies including
Samsung Electronics Co. and HTC Corp. (2498), two of the biggest makers
of Android phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All modern operating systems include many patented
technologies,&#8221; Microsoft said in a statement. &#8220;Microsoft
has taken licenses to patents for Windows and we make our
patents available on reasonable terms for other operating
systems, like Android. We would be pleased to extend a license
to Barnes  Noble.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost-Boosting &#8216;Tactics&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble cited as examples Microsoft&#8217;s participation
in a group of companies including Apple Inc. (AAPL) to buy the patents
of Novell Inc. and a three-way licensing agreement with Nokia
Oyj (NOK1V) and Mosaid Technologies Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those actions were part of a &#8220;series of tactics designed
by Microsoft to raise its rivals&#8217; costs and prevent Android-
based devices from taking away sales of Microsoft&#8217;s Windows
operating system,&#8221; Peter Barbur, of Cravath Swaine  Moore in
New York, said in the Oct. 17 letter to Kimmelman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without providing figures, Barnes  Noble said Microsoft
was demanding the same amount in patent fees that it would
charge users of its Windows Phone operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble has sought to remake itself as a digital-
content provider. The company sold $880 million worth of Nook
readers in fiscal 2011, and has forecast sales to double this
fiscal year to $1.8 billion, the company said Aug. 30. That
would be 24 percent of the company&#8217;s revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trial on Microsoft&#8217;s patent claims against Barnes  Noble
is scheduled for February in Washington. Laura Young, a
spokeswoman with Microsoft, said the company had no comment on
the Barnes  Noble filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Certain Handheld Electronic
Computing Devices, 337-769, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc., Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and AOL
Inc. (AOL), the three largest Web portals in the U.S., formed a
partnership that lets advertisers buy ad space on the sites
using a single exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement is aimed at making the buying process easier
and boosting demand for display advertising, such as banner ads,
the companies said today in a statement. The new service, which
will be offered through Yahoo and Microsoft initially, should be
available by early 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, Microsoft and AOL are trying to cope with mounting
competition for display advertising from Google Inc. (GOOG) and
Facebook Inc. Facebook will become the No. 1 provider of display
ads in the U.S. this year, overtaking Yahoo, according to
EMarketer Inc. Google should be No. 3, followed by Microsoft and
AOL, the research firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to partner with Microsoft and AOL and
bring to market what we believe will be a more efficient,
effective and more effortless way to access true premium
inventory and formats,&#8221; said Ross Levinsohn, an executive vice
president in charge of the Americas region at Yahoo. &#8220;We&#8217;re now
100 percent focused on controlling our own destiny, working
directly with marketers and agencies and driving better returns
for our advertising partners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the partnership, each company will continue to make
its own decisions and compete with one another, according to the
statement. The service won&#8217;t include all of the companies&#8217; ad
space. The deal will apply to the U.S. and Canada, though
Microsoft will not be part of the Canadian partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft rose 1.3
percent to $27.16 today, while Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo
increased 1.8 percent to $15.97. AOL, located in New York,
climbed 1.9 percent to $15.73. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is struggling to keep up
with surging demand for visas in China and Brazil, as the
growing middle class in the world&#8217;s two biggest emerging markets
flock to American shopping malls and tourist meccas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. plans to boost by 100 people this year its staff
dedicated to processing visas in the two countries after it
issued 35 percent more travel permits in China this year and 44
percent more in Brazil, Ed Ramotowski, managing director for
U.S. visas, said in a conference call with reporters yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a function of the robust economy in Brazil,&#8221; Donald
Jacobson, who oversees visa operations at the U.S. Embassy in
Brasilia, said in the same conference call. &#8220;Their currency is
very strong against the dollar and Brazilians are coming to
America to visit Disney World and do lots of shopping.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote job growth and welcome more visitors from the
increasingly affluent countries, the U.S. hopes it can handle up
to 4 million visa applications in the two countries by 2013,
more than double the current amount, Ramotowski said. Together
the two countries accounted for about 1.8 million of the 7.5
million visas issued last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as the U.S. and Europe try to fight off recession,
growth in emerging markets is proving resilient, boosting the
spending power of consumers in nations like Brazil and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending Splurge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilians spent $16.1 billion on foreign travel in the
year through September, up from $11.5 billion in the first nine
months of 2010, as record-low unemployment and a currency that
hit a 12-year high in July encouraged them to splurge abroad.
Latin America&#8217;s biggest economy expanded 7.5 percent last year,
the fastest in two decades, and will grow 3.8 percent this year,
according to an International Monetary Fund forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth in China, which was 10.4 percent in 2010, is
expected to reach 9.5 percent this year, still about six times
the pace for the U.S. and euro area, according to the IMF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While consular staff in Brazil has doubled since 2005, and
is expected to double again this year to 100, the U.S. has had
to bring in Portuguese-speaking staff on temporary assignments
to handle the flood of visa requests, Jacobson said. In October,
more than 90,000 visas were issued, a 67 percent increase over
the same month a year ago, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 160,000 of the 1 million visas issued last year in
China were to students, who make up the largest foreign national
group at American universities and colleges, Chuck Bennett, who
runs consular operations at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, also
said in the conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of our challenges in meeting demand both in Brazil
and China is just that we don&#8217;t have enough Chinese and
Portuguese speakers,&#8221; Ramotowski said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genting Bhd. (GENT)&#8217;s plan for a $3.8
billion casino-and-hotel complex along Miami&#8217;s Biscayne Bay has
turned into a fight over gambling and jobs pitting the Malaysian
developer against Walt Disney Co. (DIS), local hoteliers, restaurant
owners and betting parlors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida lawmakers will take up bills in January to allow
three casino licenses in Miami-Dade County and Broward County to
the north for companies investing at least $2 billion. Ellyn Bogdanoff, the Fort Lauderdale Republican sponsor of the Senate
measure, said it has only a 50 percent chance of passing.
Governor Rick Scott, also a Republican, said he&#8217;ll consider any
measure that&#8217;s &#8220;fair&#8221; and &#8220;locally decided.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genting, whose 10,000-room Casino de Genting in Malaysia is
the world&#8217;s largest by number of accommodations, began buying
about $500 million of Miami properties even before the bills
were filed. The first was the 14-acre bayfront site of the Miami
Herald newspaper for $236 million in May. Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)
and MGM Resorts International (MGM) said they&#8217;re also looking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So-called destination resorts, such as the 5,200-room
complex Genting proposes, may bring Florida as many as 100,000
jobs, said Jessica Hoppe, the company&#8217;s general counsel. That
may help Scott fulfill a campaign promise to create 700,000
positions over seven years in a state where the unemployment
rate was 10.6 percent in September, 1.5 percentage points higher
than the national average at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Rejections &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida voters rejected casino permits three times since
1978 in statewide referendums. Now, two factors may favor them:
a decision by the First District Court of Appeal on Oct. 6 that
may dispense with a state ballot and a Florida economy that&#8217;s
seen tax revenue decline almost 15 percent since fiscal 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diverting gamblers from the Caribbean, Las Vegas and
Atlantic City, New Jersey, would boost the $63 billion tourist
industry, proponents say. Florida is trying to recover from the
fourth-steepest decline in economic health of any state over the
past five years, according to Bloomberg Economic Evaluation of
States Index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What you&#8217;re talking about is capturing a market of high-
end Venezuelans, South Americans, Latin Americans, Western
Europeans that love coming to Miami,&#8221; Representative Erik Fresen, a Miami Republican who sponsored the House casino bill,
said in an interview in Tallahassee, the capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida isn&#8217;t the only state considering casinos as they
try to close fiscal 2013 deficits. The projected gaps are an
estimated $46 billion, according to a June 17 estimate by the
Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which
advocates for low-income families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States at Work &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts lawmakers are working on bills that would
allow three resort-style casinos. Illinois Governor Pat Quinn
supports elements of a bill for five casinos in his state. In
New York City, Genting&#8217;s casino at the Aqueduct racetrack in
Queens, which opened Oct. 28, estimates it will contribute $350
million a year to the state for education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida already allows gambling at seven casinos run by the
Seminole Tribe and one by the Miccosukee Tribe of American
Indians. It also permits poker at horse and greyhound tracks,
jai-alai frontons and other sites. Slot machines are offered at
five places in Miami-Dade and Broward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition from operators such as Genting will cost
Florida millions in lost revenue from the tribe, say the
Seminoles, whose headquarters is in Hollywood, north of Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deal With State &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tribe agreed in 2010 to pay Florida at least $1 billion
over five years for the exclusive right to offer blackjack and
other so-called house-banked games at some of its casinos. The
deal would be nullified if others are allowed to have them, Gary
Bitner, a spokesman, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Florida Chamber of Commerce, Florida Restaurant and
Lodging Association, anti-gambling groups and existing gaming
operators, more and larger casinos aren&#8217;t the answer to reviving
the state&#8217;s economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you move into an already established tourism market
like Miami, you&#8217;re going to take money out of existing business
and move it into the new big casino,&#8221; Mark Wilson, president of
the state chamber, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1994 study commissioned by the Florida governor&#8217;s office
found that building casinos would cost the existing tourism
industry as much as $2.5 billion as visitors shift spending from
amusement parks, restaurants and hotels to gambling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Heavy Cost&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any benefit to Florida will never outweigh the heavy
cost,&#8221; Carol Dover, president of the restaurant and hotel
association, said in an October statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More gambling is &#8220;inconsistent&#8221; with &#8220;efforts to
diversify Florida&#8217;s economy through research, innovation and
entrepreneurship,&#8221; Marilyn Waters, a spokeswoman for Disney&#8217;s
World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, which contains the world&#8217;s
most-visited theme park, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Casinos are the death knell of any neighborhood,&#8221; said
Tony Goldman, chief executive officer of Goldman Properties,
which owns two restored 1930s-era South Beach hotels across the
bay from Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casino operators may overstate economic benefits of their
projects to get lawmakers&#8217; backing, said Earl Grinols, who
teaches economics at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and who
wrote the book &#8220;Gambling in America: Costs and Benefits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s what happened in Florida after 2004, when voters
allowed slot machines in Miami-Dade and Broward, said Paul
Seago, a board member of the anti-gambling No Casinos lobbying
group. An advertising campaign said the measure could bring $500
million a year in tax revenue. Last fiscal year, slot machines
raised about $125 million for Florida, according to state
economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unequal Tax &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed licenses would impose a 10 percent tax on new
casinos&#8217; revenue. That&#8217;s &#8220;penalizing&#8221; for existing companies,
which must pay 35 percent on slot machine income, said Dan
Adkins, vice president of Mardi Gras Casino Inc. in Hallandale
Beach in Broward County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genting said it will proceed with its Miami plans whether
the casino licenses are approved or defeated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Las Vegas Sands has looked at a site north of downtown
Miami, Andy Abboud, vice president of government relations, said
in a telephone interview. MGM Resorts is &#8220;looking all over the
state,&#8221; said Alan Feldman, a spokesman. Deanna Pettit, a
spokeswoman for Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN), and Gary Thompson, at Caesars
Entertainment Corp., didn&#8217;t comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Florida&#8217;s natural attractions, including its beaches,
are an advantage over other U.S. destinations, said Bogdanoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is probably the only place in the country that will
give Vegas a run for its money,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. state tax revenue grew by about
7 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period of
2010, the smallest increase in more than a year, according to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After recovering following the 18-month recession that
ended in June 2009, state income and sales tax receipts may grow
more slowly, the New York-based company said in a report dated
yesterday. It based its preliminary estimate on collections from
20 states that represent 78 percent of total revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local governments&#8217; property-tax revenue was negative year-
on-year in the three months through June for the third
consecutive quarter, the report said. Localities are considering
property-tax increases to maintain services, according to the
study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The combination of negative property tax trends and
softening in other areas implies that the state and local sector
will continue to be a drag on growth,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of
Government in Albany, New York, said state tax revenue rose 6.8
percent in July and August from the same period in 2010. A jump
in revenue in the three-month period would mark the seventh-
straight quarter of growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and local contribution to gross-domestic-product
growth will remain negative until the second half of 2012, and
those governments may need to reduce spending or raise taxes
more than they project, the Goldman Sachs report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Ltd. creditors
formed a committee including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wilmington
Trust Co. to help seek recoveries from the eighth-largest
bankruptcy in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee was formed yesterday after a meeting in the
Millennium Hilton Hotel in Manhattan that drew dozens of
lawyers, debt traders and creditors. The committee has the power
to sue the company&#8217;s advisers, search for assets overseas and
pursue information from an investigation of the commingling of
customer accounts at the failed brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., Elliott Management Corp. and Caplin
Systems Ltd. are also on the five-member committee, according to
papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan by the U.S.
Trustee. The Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department that
oversees bankruptcies, chose from among the largest unsecured
creditors willing to serve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a small committee in a large case,&#8221; said Scott Peltz, the national leader of RSM McGladrey&#8217;s Financial Advisory
Service in Chicago. &#8220;That&#8217;s perhaps an attempt at trying to
achieve some sort of more orderly process in one that&#8217;s to date
been quite chaotic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global sought bankruptcy protection Oct. 31 after
revealing investments related to $6.3 billion in European
sovereign debt. Its operating unit, MF Global Inc., is being
overseen by a trustee probing possible fraud and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation is also investigating, according to a
person familiar with the matter. Jon Corzine, the former co-
chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), quit as MF
Global&#8217;s CEO on Nov .4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global listed $39.7 billion in debt and $41 billion in
assets and said it has about $26 million in cash. About $593
million of customer funds are unaccounted for, according to a
person with knowledge of regulatory probes into the firm&#8217;s
collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holding company has approached 20 potential parties
seeking a loan to fund operations while it reorganizes, Kenneth Ziman, a lawyer for MF Global&#8217;s bankrupt estate, said at
yesterday&#8217;s creditor meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global is also selling Asian assets. Operating units
overseas, including those in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and
Japan, have entered administration proceedings, or wind-downs,
in those countries, Ziman said. Liquidators are trying to sell
the Asia-Pacific operations as a single unit and received more
than 50 bids, a spokeswoman for KPMG International&#8217;s China
affiliate said Nov. 5 in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankruptcy Loan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies in bankruptcy typically get loans to finance
operations while they reorganize from a lender who wants to
protect its prior investment, or a potential buyer. MF Global
tried and failed to sell itself in the days before its
bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, agent to a $1.2 billion unsecured loan, has
already asked for all of MF Global&#8217;s&#8217;s remaining collateral in
exchange for letting the firm use $8 million in cash collateral
until Nov. 14. The New York-based bank also provided a $300
million secured loan to MF Global&#8217;s brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, in its role on the creditor committee, may have
an interest in keeping money at the brokerage unit to satisfy
its secured debt while other creditors may aim to bring the
broker&#8217;s assets into the holding company&#8217;s bankrupt estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That would have been addressed in the process of picking
the committee,&#8221; Peltz said. &#8220;The U.S. Trustee would talk
about these types of conflicts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Pantaleo, a lawyer for JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call and e-mail for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Providing Liquidity&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers also met yesterday, said David Rosen, 32, an
energy broker who works at the New York Mercantile Exchange, who
organized the meeting. They are seeking representation in the
bankruptcy to recover money lost by members of exchanges who
provided liquidity for MF Global trades, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t think we were just customers,&#8221; said Rosen, who
had more than $100,000 in an MF Global account. &#8220;We&#8217;re the ones
in the pits providing liquidity so everyone around the world can
trade these products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ad-hoc committee or sub-group of MF Global creditors
could form later in the case as more claims emerge, Peltz said.
Wilmington Trust has taken over from Deutsche Bank AG, which
resigned, as trustee to more than $1 billion in unsecured notes.
Other unsecured creditors include Headstrong Services LLC, owed
$3.9 million, New York-based law firm Sullivan  Cromwell LLP,
owed $596,939, and Oracle Corp. (ORCL), owed $302,704. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global&#8217;s $325 million in 6.25 percent notes due 2016,
issued in August, traded at 104 cents on the dollar as of Sept.
7 before dropping to 50 cents on the dollar in the week before
its bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes now may be trading on expectations of lawsuits.
They stood at 38 cents on the dollar at 10:15 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators questioned MF Global&#8217;s use of so-called
repo-to-maturity transactions as early as March, well before the
company issued two tranches of $325 million in debt and
disclosed the $6.3 billion bet on Europe&#8217;s most indebted nations
that prompted regulatory concerns and ultimately its bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Giddens, the trustee overseeing the liquidation of
the company&#8217;s brokerage, on Nov. 4 won court permission to probe
the company&#8217;s directors and officers, lenders and other
investors. That probe will focus on customer recoveries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other regulators including the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission are
investigating as well. MF Global was granted an extension of
Jan. 30 of the usual 14-day window to disclose its full list of
assets and debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is MF Global Holdings Ltd., 11-
bk-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitro SAB&#8217;s defaulted bonds are
rallying to a two-month high, a sign to JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
BCP Securities LLC to sell the securities because the price
overvalues the Mexican glassmaker&#8217;s latest debt-restructuring
offer by almost 50 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s dollar bonds due in 2017 are trading at 74
cents on the dollar, the highest level since Sept. 2, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Jim Harper, director of corporate
research at Greenwich, Connecticut-based BCP, said the
restructuring proposal Vitro unveiled on Oct. 31 is worth &#8220;much
closer to 50&#8221; cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Mexican judge ruled Aug. 12 that $1.9 billion of
intercompany debt can be included in the restructuring, making
Vitro its own biggest creditor and improving the chances the
deal will win approval. Investors will demand higher yields on
Mexican corporate debt on concern Vitro&#8217;s move will set a
precedent followed by other issuers, said Robert Rauch, who
manages $2.2 billion of emerging-market assets at Gramercy
Advisors LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen any justification for these prices in
months,&#8221; Harper said in a telephone interview. &#8220;People are
hopeful that the company will be forced through the courts, or
through diplomatic pressure or through reputational-image
pressure, to improve the deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average yield on Mexican corporate dollar bonds has
increased six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, this year
to 6.1 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. Yields on
emerging-market corporate debt rose 20 basis points during the
same period to 6.05 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Unorthodox&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Representatives Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania and
Jared Polis of Colorado sent a letter to Mexico&#8217;s ambassador to
the U.S. on Oct. 20 criticizing Vitro&#8217;s &#8220;unorthodox&#8221; use of
$1.9 billion of intercompany debt to outweigh the votes of
external creditors in Mexican bankruptcy proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitro halted debt payments in February 2009 after posting
derivative losses of as much as $360 million and as demand for
auto and construction glass plummeted during the U.S. recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some creditors may be buying Vitro&#8217;s bonds to increase
their voting stake in the restructuring, driving up the price of
the securities, said Alvaro Gonzalez, a credit analyst at Miller
Tabak Roberts in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s bond prices &#8220;are a reflection that the
market sees a higher value on the bonds versus what the analysts
estimate,&#8221; Vice President of Finance and Treasury Adrian Meouchi said in a e-mail yesterday. The market &#8220;probably
doesn&#8217;t share&#8221; analysts&#8217; negative views of the restructuring
plan, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Best Effort&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitro said Oct. 31 that the court-appointed arbitrator in
its Mexican bankruptcy proceedings presented a proposal to
external creditors that included $815 million of new bonds
maturing 2019, $95.8 million of mandatory convertible debt and a
consent fee of $32.7 million. The group of Vitro noteholders,
which owns more than 60 percent of the company&#8217;s $1.2 billion of
outstanding senior notes, opposes the proposal and plans to
appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company has made its best effort to try to reach a
consensus through negotiations according to the company&#8217;s real
capacities,&#8221; Claudio del Valle, Vitro&#8217;s chief restructuring
officer, said in a telephone interview from San Pedro Garza
Garcia, Mexico. The bondholders&#8217; strategy &#8220;is to litigate to
obtain additional benefits, and the company isn&#8217;t in a position
to accede to these petitions,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Bit Irrelevant&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Del Valle said Vitro had the support of about 36 percent of
external creditors for its restructuring plan last year and he
expects more bondholders to approve the latest plan. He declined
to comment on the letter sent by U.S. lawmakers and possible
repercussions for other Mexican companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitro&#8217;s intercompany debt, which was created 10 months
after it defaulted, assures the proposal will be approved,
Meouchi said in the same interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We already have the majority when you count intercompany
debt, which is an accepted part of the arbitrator&#8217;s list,&#8221;
Meouchi said. &#8220;So what we get or don&#8217;t get from outside parties
is going to be a bit irrelevant because we&#8217;re going to have a
majority.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of dissenting creditors presented a proposal to
the arbitrator on Oct. 19, spokesman Donald Cutler said in a
telephone interview from New York. It proposed the issuance of
$1.1 billion of new bonds, a cash payment of 10 percent of the
outstanding principal of existing notes and a 61 percent stake
in Vitro&#8217;s common shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitro shares were unchanged yesterday at 11.2 pesos in
Mexico City trading. The stock has fallen 29 percent this year,
compared with 4 percent decline for Mexico&#8217;s benchmark IPC
index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Really Disappointed&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The noteholders were really disappointed in this plan
because it didn&#8217;t give any appropriate consideration to the
terms that they proposed,&#8221; Cutler said. Vitro and the
arbitrator &#8220;didn&#8217;t engage in any sort of negotiation with the
noteholders,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitro&#8217;s Del Valle said he hadn&#8217;t received any
counterproposals from external creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold Mexican government
dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries narrowed 10 basis points
to 205 at 9:18 a.m. in Mexico City, according to JPMorgan&#8217;s EMBI
Global index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso gained 0.3 percent to 13.3764 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on futures contracts for the 28-day TIIE interbank
rate due in December fell four basis points yesterday to 4.66
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Default Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
five years rose three basis points yesterday to 144, according
to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent if
a government or company fails to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Oct. 31 statement, Vitro said creditors have 10
working days to approve the restructuring plan. If approved by
creditors, the arbitrator then has seven more working days to
present the plan to the Mexican judge overseeing the case, Vitro
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Vitro&#8217;s proposal, consenting creditors would likely
get securities and cash with a recovery on current face value of
between 47.6 percent and 60 percent, depending on how many
holders agree, Jacob Steinfeld, an analyst at JPMorgan, said in
a research note on Nov. 7. Non-consenting creditors would
recover less, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Worse&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal is &#8220;actually worse than the company&#8217;s
previous offer,&#8221; Steinfeld said in a note published Nov. 1. He
declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitro previously offered creditors $850 million of new
bonds maturing 2019 and $100 million of debt that would convert
to a 15 percent equity stake if unpaid by maturity. The new
proposal offers a 20 percent equity stake if the convertible
debt isn&#8217;t paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement would represent a recovery value of about 63
cents on the dollar, Miller Tabak Roberts&#8217;s Gonzalez said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitro&#8217;s Meouchi said the company may seek to tap debt
markets after it exits bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Turning the page on this chapter, we don&#8217;t see why we
couldn&#8217;t have access to debt markets, since we&#8217;re a company that
generates cash,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitro has reported net income of 750 million pesos over the
first three quarters of 2011, compared with a loss of 671
million pesos over the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gramercy&#8217;s Rauch said Vitro&#8217;s use of intercompany debt may
cause other Mexican companies to pay a &#8220;Vitro premium.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Very Mad&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If I&#8217;m a CEO of a legitimate Mexican company, I&#8217;d be very
mad right now at Vitro,&#8221; Rauch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation Vitro would grant more concessions to
bondholders may have helped spur the notes&#8217; rally, BCP&#8217;s Harper
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their bonds have been suspended well above any reasonable
level based on the previous terms,&#8221; Harper said. &#8220;They were
priced there in the expectation that there was going to be a
better deal reached, substantially better -- not what was
announced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ICBC, the world&#8217;s largest bank by market value, jumped 28
percent in the month through yesterday&#8217;s close after the Chinese
government started buying shares in state-owned lenders that had
been pummeled by concern that bad loans may increase. Goldman
Sachs, which last month posted its second quarterly loss in 12
years, has made $2.65 billion on its ICBC stake since the fourth
quarter of 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman and most banks globally had a terrible third
quarter, so anything they can do to sort of salvage the year-
end&#8221; will help, John Wadle, head of research on banking at
Mirae Asset Securities (HK) Ltd., said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which relied on trading for 62 percent of
revenue so far this year, recorded losses from that business on
21 days in the third quarter, the most since the fourth quarter
of 2008, according to a quarterly filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of ICBC stock sold is smaller than the 2.4
billion shares Goldman Sachs offered, and the sale was priced at
the low end of the HK$4.88 to HK$5 offering range, according to
a term sheet obtained by Bloomberg News. The KBW Bank Index (BKX)
dropped 5.9 percent yesterday to 38.43, its steepest decline in
two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal was Goldman Sachs&#8217;s third sale of ICBC stock, an
investment it originally made in 2006 before the Chinese bank&#8217;s
initial public offering. Around that time, China allowed foreign
lenders to purchase pre-IPO stakes in state-owned banks after
about a decade spent bailing them out from bad debts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, sold 3.04 billion ICBC
shares at HK$5.74 each in September last year, raising about
$2.25 billion. The Wall Street firm sold an almost $2 billion
stake in ICBC in June 2009, the maximum number of shares it was
free to divest at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICBC President Yang Kaisheng said his bank understands and
respects Goldman Sachs&#8217;s decision to sell its shares. The sale
was to raise funds for internal &#8220;adjustments&#8221; Goldman Sachs is
undertaking, and isn&#8217;t a reflection of the New York-based bank&#8217;s
valuation of ICBC&#8217;s stock, Yang told reporters in Beijing
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Modestly&#8217; Reducing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The value of our holding has appreciated considerably and
we have modestly reduced the size of our investment over time,
but we intend to remain a very significant long-term shareholder
in ICBC,&#8221; said Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs
in New York. Van Praag declined to comment on the size of the
sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs initially bought 4.9 percent of ICBC for
about $2.59 billion, according to a regulatory filing. The bank
booked a third-quarter loss of $1.05 billion on its investment
in ICBC, according to its Oct. 18 earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on the biggest
U.S. banks climbed as yields for Italy, the world&#8217;s third
biggest sovereign borrower, rose to euro era records and stoked
concern that Europe&#8217;s fiscal crisis is accelerating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts linked to the debt of Morgan Stanley jumped 34.1
basis points to 426.8 basis points and those tied to Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America Corp. (BAC) increased 30.4 to
377.4 as of 2:32 p.m. in New York, according to data provider
CMA. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) added 26 to 339 and a gauge of
U.S. corporate credit risk rose by the most since September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders pushed the contracts higher on concern that
Europe&#8217;s burgeoning debt crisis may infect bank balance sheets
worldwide. Yields on Italy&#8217;s $2.2 trillion of debt surged as
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi agreed to step down
after the approval of an austerity plan and a clearinghouse said
it will demand more money to back trades in the bonds, further
squeezing banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a risk of contagion that sits there in the
financial sector,&#8221; Scott MacDonald, head of credit and economic
research at Aladdin Capital Management LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;If we have a big
tumble here with Italy, it&#8217;s going to cause a very steep
recession in Europe and it will have ripples through interbank
markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Italian five-year notes rose above 7 percent for
the first time in the euro era. The yield on Italy&#8217;s 10-year
bond rose to 7.32 percent, and credit-default swaps on Italy&#8217;s
government bonds jumped to 562, CMA data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margins Raised &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LCH Clearnet SA raised the deposit factor charged for
Italian bonds due in seven to 10 years. The deposit requirement
will be raised to 11.65 percent, the French unit of LCH Clearnet
said in a document on its website dated yesterday. That compares
with a charge of 6.65 percent announced on Oct. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearing houses guarantee investors&#8217; trades are completed
by standing in the middle of two counterparties. They raise
margin requirements to protect themselves against losses if one
side of the trade fails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LCH raising margin requirements &#8220;really is not a good
sign,&#8221; according to MacDonald. &#8220;This is something that&#8217;s done
when people feel that the country or the other party at the
other end of the line cannot fund itself, so you&#8217;re beginning to
raise issues of liquidity,&#8221; he said. The drying up of liquidity
in international markets is &#8220;what gets dangerous,&#8221; MacDonald
said. &#8220;That&#8217;s a real problem. That impacts Main Street, and
that&#8217;s what you had in 2008.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Filing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS) said last month it had $2.1
billion of net exposure in the peripheral European countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said today that it had $4.16 billion of gross
funded exposure to governments, financial institutions and
companies in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain as of
Sept. 30, with Italy accounting for more than half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern over bets on European sovereign debt toppled New
York-based MF Global Inc. last month. The futures broker filed
for bankruptcy protection on Oct. 31 after a $6.3 billion bet on
the bonds of some of Europe&#8217;s most indebted nations prompted
regulator concerns and a credit rating downgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global&#8217;s bankruptcy triggered an 18 percent slide in New
York-based Jefferies Group Inc. last week, as investors
speculated that the firm could be hurt by similar risks.
Jefferies has issued six statements this month detailing its
investments in European sovereign debt and said it cut both its
gross holdings in sovereign securities of Portugal, Italy,
Ireland, Greece and Spain by almost 50 percent since last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Index Soars &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s $550 million of 6.875 percent senior unsecured
notes maturing in April 2021 fell 2.25 cents to 85.5 cents on
the dollar to yield 9.2 percent at 2:27 p.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Citigroup Inc. (C) added 27.9 basis
points to 257.9, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. Contracts tied to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s debt
increased 13 to 153.1, and those on Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) added 13
to 153, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 8.4 basis points to a
mid-price of 129.6 basis points as of 2:53 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has increased
from 113.4 basis points on Oct. 27, the lowest level in more
than two months, on concern that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis is
spreading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, had $2.32 billion of &#8220;funded&#8221;
credit exposure to Italy&#8217;s government, financial institutions
and companies as of Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedges that offset those risks result in a net funded
exposure of $700 million, the New York-based company said in a
quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
today. &#8220;Substantially all&#8221; of the hedges are purchased from
investment-grade counterparties based outside of Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian stocks and bonds fell today on concern Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi&#8217;s offer to resign won&#8217;t be enough to
contain the turmoil in a nation with the euro-region&#8217;s second-
biggest debt. Concern that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis would spark bank
losses contributed to a 19 percent tumble in the 843-company
Bloomberg World Financial Index this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said Italy accounted for more than half of
the $4.16 billion of gross funded exposure the firm had to the
five European countries on Sept. 30, and less than half of the
$2.46 billion in net funded exposure to those nations, according
to the filing. The company also has $750 million of unfunded
lending commitments to borrowers in the five countries, the
filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s net funded exposure tied to Italy was
$1.79 billion at the end of September, accounting for most of
the $2.11 billion total from the five countries, the New York-
based firm said in a presentation last month. The nations
represented $5.69 billion in exposure before hedges, with risks
linked to Italy of $4.58 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s &#8220;net current funded exposure&#8221; tied to the
five countries was $7.2 billion at the end of September, more
than three times the exposure to Belgium and France, the New
York-based bank said last week in a filing. Total cross-border
claims linked to Italy were $14.5 billion. The company said the
risk of loss associated with the exposure &#8220;is likely materially
lower&#8221; than the amount disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s exposure to Italy from trading,
lending and securities available for sale was $11.3 billion as
of Sept. 30, the New York-based company said last week in a
filing. Net exposure including hedging and collateral was $5.5
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net exposure to Italy&#8217;s sovereign debt was $2.4 billion at
the end of the third quarter, more than half the $4.5 billion of
net sovereign exposure it had to the five countries. JPMorgan&#8217;s
credit-default swaps on the debt were bought from counterparties
based outside those countries and are either investment grade or
are &#8220;well-supported by collateral arrangements,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s non-U.S. exposure linked to Italy
was $6.54 billion at the end of September, almost 45 percent of
the total linked to the five European countries, the Charlotte,
North Carolina-based lender said Nov. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of that total, $1.5 billion is in sovereign risk, most of
which is hedged by credit-default protection, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley fell 6.6 percent in New York trading at
10:39 a.m., the biggest decline among the largest U.S. banks.
The drop was 5.5 percent at Citigroup, 5.3 percent at Goldman
Sachs, and 4.5 percent at JPMorgan. Bank of America lost 3.3
percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised $1.1

Ltd., according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sold 1.75 billion shares at HK$4.88 each, the

at the low end of the proposed range of HK$4.88 to HK$5 each,
according to a person familiar with the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s a discount of as much as 6 percent to Beijing-based
ICBC&#8217;s closing price in Hong Kong today. Goldman Sachs had

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said its
cross-border risks tied to French banks dropped to $15.1 billion
as of Sept. 30 from $38.5 billion three months earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figures don&#8217;t include offsetting hedges and collateral,
the New York-based bank said today in a 10Q filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount is &#8220;primarily comprised&#8221; of loans to a
clearinghouse that are secured by collateral, Goldman Sachs
said. Cross-border outstandings include cash, receivables, cash
financial instruments and repurchase agreements. They exclude
derivative instruments and commitments, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, raised its estimate of &#8220;reasonably
possible&#8221; losses from legal claims by 30 percent in the third
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate rose to $2.6 billion as of Sept. 30 from $2
billion on June 30, the New York-based company said in its
quarterly filing today with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the SEC told corporate finance chiefs in October 2010 that they
should disclose such costs &#8220;when there is at least a reasonable
possibility&#8221; that they may be incurred, even if the risk is too
low to require reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate, the fourth of its kind made by Goldman Sachs,
is the &#8220;upper end&#8221; of losses in matters where the risk is
&#8220;more than remote but less than likely,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
relied on trading for 62 percent of revenue so far this year,
recorded losses from that business on 21 days in the third
quarter, the most since the fourth quarter of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s traders lost more than $100 million on one of
the days, according to the New York-based company&#8217;s quarterly
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They
produced more than $100 million on nine days out of 64 total
days in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, the filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, last
month reported its second quarterly loss as a public company as
it marked down the value of investments the firm had made with
its own money. The bank, which sustained a 22 percent drop in
client-trading revenue in the first nine months of this year,
has said it plans to cut about 1,000 jobs this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
this week that its traders lost money on 31 days during the
quarter. Traders at JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America
Corp., the two biggest U.S. banks, lost money on 16 days and 20
days respectively, according to company filings last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s traders lost money on 15 days during the
second quarter and on a single day in the first quarter,
according to company reports. Goldman Sachs recorded zero
trading losses in the first quarter of 2010, the only such
perfect quarter in the firm&#8217;s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading losses exceeded Goldman Sachs&#8217;s value-at-risk
limit, a measure of how much the company estimates it could lose
in the securities markets in one day, on one occasion during the
quarter. Average daily value-at-risk was $102 million in the
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, will get a $20 million fee
for advising El Paso Corp. (EP) if the pipeline company completes a
planned $21 billion sale to Kinder Morgan Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the second-largest shareholder of Kinder
Morgan and has two directors on the Houston-based pipeline
company&#8217;s board. Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t take part in negotiations
with Kinder Morgan or express an opinion on the deal price,
Kinder Morgan said today in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had been advising Houston-based El Paso on an
unrelated plan to spin off the company&#8217;s exploration and
production division when Kinder Morgan made an unsolicited
offer, Kinder Morgan said. Goldman Sachs collected $5 million
for that work and would have gotten another $25 million if the
spinoff had been completed, Kinder Morgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s private-equity arm invested alongside
Kinder Morgan Chief Executive Officer Richard Kinder to take his
company private in a 2007 leveraged buyout, and the New York-
based investment bank retains a stake after an initial public
offering this year. Goldman Sachs directors on the Kinder Morgan
board, Henry Cornell and Kenneth Pontarelli, didn&#8217;t take part in
discussions about the El Paso offer, Kinder Morgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) advised El Paso on negotiations with Kinder
Morgan and gave an opinion that the sale price was fair. The
bank may collect a total of $35 million for its advice if the
deal is completed, Kinder Morgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinder Morgan&#8217;s financial advisers, Evercore Partners Inc.
and Barclays Plc (BARC), will get a total of $15 million each if the
acquisition is completed, Kinder Morgan said. &lt;/p&gt;

comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) expects the
bankruptcy of Jefferson County, Alabama, will have &#8220;no material
impact&#8221; on the firm&#8217;s earnings, said Justin Perras, a company
spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county filed for Chapter 9 protection yesterday after
state lawmakers didn&#8217;t back a September agreement with creditors
led by New York-based JPMorgan to refinance $3.14 billion of
sewer-system bonds. Perras commented in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks in Europe are undercutting
regulators&#8217; demands that they boost capital by declaring assets
they hold less risky today than they were yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco Santander SA (SAN), Spain&#8217;s largest lender, and Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA), the second-biggest, say they can
go halfway to adding 13.6 billion euros ($18.8 billion) of
capital by changing how they calculate risk-weightings, the
probability of default lenders assign to loans, mortgages and
derivatives. The practice, known as &#8220;risk-weighted asset
optimization,&#8221; allows banks to boost capital ratios without
cutting lending, selling assets or tapping shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators in Europe, seeking to stem the region&#8217;s
sovereign-debt crisis, ordered banks last month to increase core
capital to 9 percent of risk-weighted assets by the end of June.
Lenders, facing a 106 billion-euro shortfall, are reluctant to
plug the gap by cutting dividends or bonuses and are struggling
to sell assets or raise cash in rights offerings. Politicians
are trying to stop banks from the alternative, cutting back
lending, because it could trigger a recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish banks aren&#8217;t alone in using the practice. Unione di
Banche Italiane SCPA (UBI) said it will change its risk-weighting
model instead of turning to investors for the 1.5 billion euros
regulators say it needs. Commerzbank AG (CBK) said it will do the
same. Britain&#8217;s Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA),
Europe&#8217;s largest bank, both said they cut risk-weighted assets
by changing the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While firms submit their models to national regulators once
a year, they don&#8217;t have to disclose them publicly, and risk-
weightings for the same assets vary among banks, regulators and
analysts say. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said in
September it planned to review how lenders apply weightings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may mean publicly identifying lenders that game the
rules, said a person with knowledge of the committee&#8217;s talks who
declined to be identified because the discussions are private. A
spokesman for the Basel committee declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Ambassadors Back Short-Sale Law Over U.K.&#8217;s Legality Concerns &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National ambassadors to the European Union backed a
proposed short-selling law that paves the way for an optional
ban on naked credit-default swaps tied to sovereign debt. The
support came over U.K. concerns the agreement may be illegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the draft law, traders may be prevented from buying
default swaps on government bonds unless they own the sovereign
debt or own other assets which have prices that move in tandem
with the debt. Countries will have the right to opt out of the
measure if they find it increases their borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deal on the measures was brokered last month in
negotiations between Poland, which holds the rotating presidency
of the EU, and lawmakers in the European Parliament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law, which would also curb so-called naked short
selling of stocks and government bonds, was approved by
ambassadors at a meeting today, Kacper Chmielewski, a spokesman
for Poland&#8217;s EU presidency, said. The European Parliament will
vote on the deal next week, after which nations will make final
decisions on its enactment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Raises &#8216;Reasonably Possible&#8217; Legal-Claim Estimate 30% &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, raised its estimate of &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; losses
from legal claims by 30 percent in the third quarter, according
to a federal filing made by the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate rose to $2.6 billion as of Sept. 30 from $2
billion on June 30, the New York-based company said in its
quarterly filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the SEC told corporate finance chiefs in October 2010 that they
should disclose such costs &#8220;when there is at least a reasonable
possibility&#8221; that they may be incurred, even if the risk is too
low to require reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate, the fourth of its kind made by Goldman Sachs,
is the &#8220;upper end&#8221; of losses in matters where the risk is
&#8220;more than remote but less than likely,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Weighs Killing Internet Rule Enacted Last Year by FCC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate opened debate on whether to kill a U.S. rule
barring Internet-service providers including Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ) from interfering with subscribers&#8217; Web
traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move, facing a veto threat from President Barack Obama,
would reverse a decision by the Democrat-led Federal
Communications Commission. Republicans said that the FCC rule
amounts to regulation of the Internet, while Democrats said that
the regulation will prevent companies from unfairly blocking or
slowing rivals&#8217; Internet offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under debate yesterday was a resolution of disapproval that
would eliminate the FCC&#8217;s rule. It faces a vote today in the
Democrat-led Senate; the Republican-led House passed its version
in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net-neutrality rule, approved last year by the FCC on a
3-2 Democrat-led vote, is to take effect Nov. 20, the FCC said
in a filing Sept. 22. The regulation would bar Internet-service
providers from blocking or slowing online content sent to homes
and businesses, while allowing mobile-phone companies to put
limits on Web traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon has challenged the FCC&#8217;s rule in federal court,
saying the agency lacks authority to regulate how companies
offer Internet service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portuguese Banks Oppose Rules on Recapitalization, Diario Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portuguese banks oppose the government&#8217;s rules for
accessing recapitalization funds that are part of the country&#8217;s
financial aid program, Diario Economico reported, citing a
letter sent by the Portuguese Banking Association to the
European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks disagree with the powers the Portuguese state may
have in the lenders that access those funds and with the
obligations that those banks have to meet, the Portuguese
newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Says It Filed a Record 735 Enforcement Actions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission said it filed a
record 735 enforcement actions in the fiscal year that ended
Sept. 30, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency&#8217;s enforcement division underwent its most
significant reorganization since it was established in the early
1970s, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexia Expects EU to Extend Ban on Coupons on Subordinated Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexia SA (DEXB) expects the European Commission will extend an
existing ban on payment of coupons on the bank&#8217;s subordinated
Tier 1 and Upper Tier 2 bonds for as long as the lender will
make use of government debt guarantees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexia Chief Financial Officer Philippe Rucheton made the
comment on a conference call with analysts yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danish Banks Face Funding Relief as Bail-In Isolation Ends &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danish banks may get better access to funding as the
country&#8217;s bail-in laws look set to spread, ending Denmark&#8217;s
isolation, as global regulators call for stricter resolution
laws for the biggest lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global regulators want the world&#8217;s biggest banks to boost
capital levels, and are urging national legislators to ensure an
orderly resolution of failed banks and shield taxpayers in the
process. The measures will include granting regulators bail-in
powers to force losses on unsecured creditors in bank failures,
imitating a bill introduced in Denmark in October last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Denmark&#8217;s roughly 120 banks have been shut out of
funding markets since the February collapse of Amagerbanken A/S
triggered the European Union&#8217;s first senior creditor losses
within a resolution framework. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Faces German Data-Privacy Fine Over Facial-Recognition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. may be fined by a German data-protection
agency for failing to bring a feature that uses facial-
recognition software to suggest people to tag in photos on its
social-networking site in line with European Union and German
laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook introduced the feature in Europe &#8220;without
informing users or getting the required consent&#8221; it is obliged
to under EU and German law, the Hamburg data-protection
authority said in a statement on its website today. A solution
proposed by Facebook is &#8220;insufficient&#8221; because it would only
apply to new users, the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook representatives in Germany didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the potential fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hamburg regulator is considering &#8220;a fine and an
administrative order&#8221; to ensure the technology will be used in
a way that users&#8217; right to decide will be respected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. SEC Approves Tougher Standards for Reverse Mergers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it
approved new rules of the three major U.S. listing markets that
toughen the standards for companies going public through a
reverse merger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 35 companies based overseas have had trading
halted because of concerns about financial information,
including a number of companies formed by reverse mergers, the
agency said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq, NYSE and NYSE Amex would prohibit a reverse merger
company from applying to list on the exchanges until it has
completed a &#8220;one-year &#8216;seasoning&#8217; period by trading in the U.S.
over-the-counter market or another regulated U.S. or foreign
exchange following the reverse merger,&#8221; the SEC said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another requirement would be to maintain minimum share
pricing &#8220;for a sustained period&#8221; at least 30 of the 60 days of
trading before its listing application, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company would be exempt if it is listing in connection
with certain public offerings or the reverse merger occurred
&#8220;long ago&#8221; and it has since filed &#8220;at least four&#8221; annual
reports with the SEC, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Courts/Administrative Hearings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Regulator Must Explain Case in Wal-Mart Price-Fixing Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain&#8217;s antitrust regulator was ordered to explain how it
will continue fighting appeals of its cigarette price-fixing
fines against Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)
and 10 other manufacturers and retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of Fair Trading, which fined the group a total
of 225 million pounds ($359.3 million) last year, had to explain
no later than yesterday &#8220;whether it continues to contest the
appeals, and if so, on what factual and legal basis,&#8221; the
Competition Appeal Tribunal said in a Nov. 7 order. A hearing on
the future of the case is scheduled for Nov. 11 in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The watchdog claims Bristol, England-based Imperial and
Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914)&#8217;s Gallaher unit agreed with retailers to fix
prices on cigarettes, hand-rolled tobacco, pipe tobacco and
cigars from 2001 to 2003. J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY), the U.K.&#8217;s third-
largest supermarket chain, was a whistleblower in the case and
gave evidence that led to fines against Wal-Mart&#8217;s Asda chain,
Co-Operative Group Ltd. and William Morrison Supermarkets Plc,
among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial appealed its 112.3 million-pound fine as did Asda
and Co-Operative, which were each fined about 14 million pounds.
The challenge was joined by William Morrison, which was
penalized a total of 19.5 million pounds and Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA), fined 3.35 million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OFT spokeswoman Kasia Reardon declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, SEC Defend $285 Million CDO Accord to U.S. Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission defended their $285 million settlement of claims that
the bank misled investors in collateralized debt obligations as
a judge questioned whether the deal is in the public interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who in 2009 rejected a $33
million settlement between the SEC and Bank of America Corp. (BAC),
spent much of an hour-long hearing yesterday asking both sides
why he should approve an accord that doesn&#8217;t require Citigroup
to admit any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff asked New York-based Citigroup and the SEC last
month to address nine questions about the proposed settlement,
including whether the public interest requires a determination
of the truth of Citigroup&#8217;s alleged fraud. At yesterday&#8217;s
hearing, Rakoff questioned the SEC&#8217;s argument that he isn&#8217;t
required to weigh the public&#8217;s interest in considering the
settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge didn&#8217;t say when he will rule on the joint request
to approve the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turner Says Accounting Standards Failed MF Investors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant at the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, talked about the accounting
practices of MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner spoke with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle on
Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collateral Rules May Be Needed in &#8216;Repo&#8217; Market, Turner Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority may impose minimum
collateral requirements in the repurchase agreement market, the
watchdog&#8217;s chairman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re looking very carefully at the short-term lending
market and the repo market,&#8221; Adair Turner, FSA chairman, told a
panel of U.K. lawmakers in London today. &#8220;In particular, at
minimum haircuts, minimum collateral requirements.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC May Let Firms Use Sampling in Measuring Executive-Pay Ratios &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies may be allowed to use sampling rather than
precise calculations to meet requirements for comparing chief
executives&#8217; pay with that of their median employee, a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meredith Cross, director of the SEC&#8217;s Division of
Corporation Finance, made the remarks yesterday at a Practising
Law Institute conference in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re looking for implementation of the statute in a way
that is not unduly burdensome,&#8221; she said, crediting the AFL-CIO
with the idea to help companies meet the Dodd-Frank Act
requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies have complained that doing the math for all
workers could cost millions of dollars for larger employers.
Cross said SEC staff members have heard from statisticians who
think sampling could make the process less expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ratio rule is one of several executive-pay provisions
in Dodd-Frank, the financial-regulation overhaul enacted last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levitt Says SEC Should Reconsider Enforcement Process &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur Levitt, former chairman of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, said the SEC &#8220;should reconsider its
enforcement process in light of repeated offenses by companies
who settle with cease and desist orders.&#8221; Levitt talked with
Bloomberg&#8217;s Ken Prewitt and Tom Keene on Bloomberg Radio&#8217;s
&#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. must provide to Samsung
Electronics Co. its contracts with Australian mobile-phone
carriers as the South Korean company demanded in a patent
dispute with the iPhone maker, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple needs to produce agreements it has with Vodafone
Group Plc (VOD), SingTel Optus Ltd. and Telstra Corp., should the
Cupertino, California-based company fail to agree on an
assertion in Samsung&#8217;s patent lawsuit that the carriers are
contractually obliged to subsidize iPhone sales, Australia
Federal Court Justice Annabelle Bennett ordered yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung sued Apple in Australia, claiming the iPhone 3GS,
iPhone 4 and iPad 2 infringe its patents and is seeking a ban on
the sale of the devices in the country. Bennett ruled the
contracts with the phone operators are relevant to Samsung&#8217;s
case. Apple said it would oppose the disclosure and suggested it
was a speculative effort to find damaging information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will resist any attempts by our friends to push us
into a corner&#8221; on the subsidies, Apple&#8217;s lawyer Andrew Fox told
the judge. &#8220;This is quite clearly a fishing expedition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Samsung lawsuit, filed Sept. 19, was in response to
Apple&#8217;s request for a court order barring the sale of the Galaxy
Tablet 10.1 in Australia, claiming the device infringed Apple&#8217;s
patents. Bennett granted Apple&#8217;s request for an injunction on
Oct. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian dispute is part of a wider battle between
the two companies that spans four continents and began in April
when Apple sued in the U.S., claiming Samsung&#8217;s products
&#8220;slavishly&#8221; copied the designs of iPhones and iPads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Australian suit, Samsung also sought the source code
for the iPhone 4S firmware to support its case that Apple
infringes its patents for wireless transmissions. Apple has
turned over 220 pages of documents relating to the source code,
Fox said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung said the source-code disclosure wasn&#8217;t enough
because a file was missing. The company sought an order for
Apple to produce the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bennett deferred judgment on Samsung&#8217;s request for the
additional source-code material and said she would deal with it
on Nov. 11, if the two sides can&#8217;t reach an agreement in the
meantime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co.
NSD1243/2011. Federal Court of Australia (Sydney). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus Patents Should Be Invalid, U.S. Trade Agency Staff Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus Inc. (RMBS) patents asserted against companies including
Broadcom Corp. (BRCM) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) should be found invalid by the
U.S. International Trade Commission, according to an agency
staff recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendation applies to a complaint filed in December
2010 by Rambus, a Sunnyvale, California-based designer of high-
speed memory chips that wants the companies to pay royalties on
five patents for technology in communications devices and
electronics. The agency has the power to block imports of
products made outside the U.S. that are found to infringe U.S.
patent rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Girdwood, an investigative attorney with the ITC,
listed a total of 66 recommendations yesterday in a filing
posted on the agency&#8217;s website. The filing doesn&#8217;t explain the
reasons for the recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staff acts as a third party in some ITC cases, and the
agency&#8217;s judges aren&#8217;t required to follow the recommendations. A
trial on the case was heard last month, and ITC Judge Theodore
Essex is scheduled to release his findings Jan. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While recommending that the patents be declared invalid,
the ITC staff said it found that that the patents at issue had
been infringed and shouldn&#8217;t be deemed unenforceable because of
document destruction by Rambus. The staff also said that if a
violation of Rambus rights is found, certain products that
infringe the patents should be banned from the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies named in the Rambus complaint include
Asustek Computer Inc. (2357), Garmin Ltd. (GRMN), LSI Corp. (LSI) and Seagate
Technology Plc. (STX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Certain Semiconductor Chips
and Products Containing Same, 337-753, U.S. International Trade
Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, Ranbaxy Sued Over Lipitor Prices by 11 Pharmacies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) were accused by
11 California pharmacies in a lawsuit of agreeing to hold back a
generic version of the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor in the
U.S. and then fixing its price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of an unlawful agreement with generic-maker
Ranbaxy, Pfizer was able to make $18 billion by extending its
time as the exclusive U.S. source of Lipitor, the pharmacies
claimed in a lawsuit filed Nov. 7 in federal court in San
Francisco. In exchange, Pfizer allegedly allowed Ranbaxy to
distribute the generic of Lipitor earlier in foreign markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor sells for more than $4 a day compared with prices
as low as 10 cents day for the generic, the drug stores said in
their complaint. Lipitor&#8217;s purchasers in the U.S. are paying
inflated costs as a result, the pharmacies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor, which generated $10.7 billion in revenue for New
York-based Pfizer last year, loses U.S. patent protection on
Nov. 30. A legal settlement with Pfizer gave New Delhi-based
Ranbaxy six months&#8217; exclusivity to market generic Lipitor, the
world&#8217;s best-selling drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks disgorgement of profits from the
allegedly illegal arrangement and triple damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission reviewed the terms of the 2008 settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer believes this suit has no merit and we are
confident that the Lipitor patent settlement with Ranbaxy is
appropriate,&#8221; Loder said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We view
the suit as nothing more than an attempt to extract money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Caprariello, a spokesman for Ranbaxy, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a voice-mail message Nov. 8 seeking
comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chimes Pharmacy v. Pfizer, 11-5375, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson Eyes Sales From Mobile Industry&#8217;s Top Patents Trove &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson AB, the world&#8217;s largest maker of mobile-phone
networks, aims to increase revenue from its more than 27,000
patents as devices from toys to energy meters get wireless
access, its chief executive officer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stockholm-based company, which helped develop the
global system for mobile communications that enables handsets to
latch onto networks from London to Jakarta, holds the industry&#8217;s
largest portfolio of wireless communication patents. Generating
more revenue from rights would help smooth out fluctuations in
network orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intellectual property covers &#8220;basically everything in
the telecom industry,&#8221; including the world&#8217;s largest collection
of WiFi patents, company President Hans Erik Vestberg said in an
interview. Revenue from patents more than doubled to 4.6 billion
kronor ($704 million) last year from 2 billion kronor in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we are going to get 50 billion connected devices in
2020 it&#8217;s not only going to be handsets,&#8221; Vestberg said
yesterday. &#8220;It&#8217;s not going to be practical for us to make
bilateral negotiations with all the manufacturers. We need new
business models and we need to work in groups.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson plans to get royalties from intellectual property
in areas it hasn&#8217;t monetized before, such as Web searches and
optical transmissions, Vestberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has relied on bilateral agreements and industry
standards consortia to establish cross-licensing and fair
royalty rates among handset and infrastructure vendors. Going
through chipmakers may be the most efficient way to secure
royalties from a broader range of products, Vestberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Ericsson joined a group of companies including
Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. to buy more than
6,000 patents from Nortel Networks Corp. for $4.5 billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month later, Google Inc. (GOOG) agreed to buy Motorola Mobility
Holdings Inc. for $12.5 billion, gaining mobile patents and
expanding in the hardware business. Helena Nordman-Knutson, a
Stockholm-based analyst at Pareto Oehman, estimates that
Ericsson&#8217;s patents could be valued at as much as $15.5 billion,
based on the price Google paid for Motorola&#8217;s intellectual
property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson, which sold its first telephone in 1878, last
month agreed to divest its stake in its handset venture Sony
Ericsson Mobile Communications AB to partner Sony. The sale will
permit Ericsson to concentrate on selling infrastructure gear as
well as network and customer management services to phone
companies and others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British Legion Says Poppies with Teardrops Infringe Trademarks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Royal British Legion, which raised funds through its
annual poppy sale to aid active military and veterans in the
U.K., has told a charity fundraiser that her sale of crystal
teardrops for the poppies is a trademark violation, the BBC
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worker created 4,000 tears -- to be applied to the
poppies Britons wear in the days leading up to the Nov. 13
Remembrance Sunday observance -- and received an endorsement
from the wife of Prince Charles in her efforts to raise funds
for the Legion and other charities, according to the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Legion told the BBC that the only lawful use of the
poppy is to raise funds through its annual Poppy Appeal and that
any other use was unlicensed infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the worker sent some of her teardrop-adorned poppies
to Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, and received a note saying
the duchess would wear the poppies with pride, the Prince of
Wales&#8217; office told the BBC that the duchess wouldn&#8217;t comment on
any private correspondence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie Taymor Sues &#8216;Spider-Man&#8217; Producers for Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie Taymor, the theatrical director best known for her
transformation of the Walt Disney Co. &#8220;Lion King&#8221; film to a
staged musical version, is suing the producers of the musical
based on Spiderman comics for copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her complaint filed Nov. 8 in federal court in
Manhattan, Taymor claims she wasn&#8217;t adequately compensated for
her work on the &#8220;Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark&#8221; musical, and
that revisions were made to her work without her consent after
she was fired from the production in March 2011. The &#8220;book&#8221;
presently used for the Broadway production infringes her work
and copies wholesale Taymor&#8217;s contribution, she said in her
pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her complaint, Taymor said the production, now playing
in the Foxwood Theater in Manhattan, regularly grosses
$1.4 million or more per week, with ticket prices averaging more
than $100 per seat and the theater at an average 90 percent
capacity for eight performances per week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also claimed that &#8220;Spider-Man&#8221; merchandise, including
a souvenir program, uses her work without authorization.
Producers&#8217; failure to pay her what was due by contract rescinds
their license to the work, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is asking the court for money damages of at least
$1 million, and an award for profits she says are related to the
alleged infringement. She also seeks a court order barring the
unauthorized use of her content, and a declaration that the use
of her name of likeness in a &#8220;making of&#8221; promotional film
violates her right of privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producers told Entertainment Weekly that Taymor had
been adequately compensated and that the court system would
provide a resolution to the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taymor is represented by Charles T. Spada and Matthew Gage
Coogan of Lankler Siffert  Wohl LLP of New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Julie Taymor v. 8 Legged Productions LLLC,
1:11-cv-08002-RJH, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Releasing Patch Against Industrial Espionage Virus &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest software company, is
releasing a software patch aimed at defeating an industrial
espionage virus, the U.K.&#8217;s Telegraph newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus is said to be related to Stuxnet, which disrupted
the Iranian nuclear program, according to the Telegraph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new virus, known as Duqu, can &#8220;install programs, view,
change or delete data; or create new accounts with full user
rights,&#8221; Microsoft said and the Telegraph reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus was intended to steal proprietary information,

&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Lenovo Group
Ltd. (992), Dell Inc. (DELL) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are among companies that may
be hurt this quarter and in 2012 as flooding in Thailand strains
personal-computer supplies and raises prices, IDC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PC shipments will decline between 2.2 percent and 3.4
percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, down from a
prior forecast for 5.1 percent growth, IDC said today in a
report. In the first quarter, shipments may drop by 1.8 percent
to 13.4 percent. IDC had projected a gain of 8.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising waters have swamped industrial parks in Thailand
where companies like Western Digital Corp. (WDC) and Toshiba Corp.
make about a quarter of the world&#8217;s disk drives. The PC
industry, already weighed down by concerns about a weak economy
and the surging popularity of tablets, would usually be in
&#8220;peak production&#8221; ahead of holiday demand right now, IDC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of these plants are still under water, and it&#8217;s
unclear how much damage they will find when the water recedes,&#8221;
Loren Loverde, an analyst at IDC, said in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s
also unclear how quickly the cleanup can begin and how much time
it will take to bring in replacement parts to rebuild.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flood has caused drive prices to increase by $10 to
$25, Seagate Technology Plc (STX) Chief Executive Officer Steve Luczo
said in an interview. That could rise further, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re thinking of buying someone a laptop for
Christmas, I&#8217;d buy it now,&#8221; Luczo said. Seagate&#8217;s plants
haven&#8217;t been flooded, though the company has seen its supply
chain disrupted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDC&#8217;s reduced forecast comes a day after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) cut its own forecast for PC shipments for the fourth
quarter and next year. PC shipments will decline 3 percent this
quarter compared with a year earlier, down from a previous
estimate for an increase of 3.1 percent, Goldman analysts said
in a note yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter shipments will drop 8.5 percent, compared
with an earlier projection for an increase of 4 percent. For all
of 2012, shipments will rise 3.3 percent, Goldman Sachs said,
down from a previous forecast for an increase of 4.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Goldman Sachs also pared its estimates for
Microsoft&#8217;s profit and sales. All server, storage and PC sellers
may experience some higher costs as a result of the hard-drive
shortages, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard was the world&#8217;s
biggest PC seller in the third quarter, according to IDC,
followed by Lenovo and Dell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher-Profit Products &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller computer makers will bear the brunt of the
disruption in Thailand, as larger manufacturers will get first
crack at the available drives, IDC&#8217;s Loverde said. Even so,
Hewlett-Packard and the bigger vendors still will see supply
constrained and are likely to funnel the drives they have into
higher-profit products, such as server computers and pricey
laptops, and away from cheaper netbooks and mini-notebooks, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter, total PC shipments rose less than
forecast, dragged down by disappointing back-to-school sales, a
sluggish economy and a shift to tablets and smartphones.
Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC said global sales rose 3.6
percent, below the 4.5 percent growth it had predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer memory-chip maker Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) said
last month that the disaster may trim computer shipments in the
first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends
buying the euro after developments in Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt
crisis this week. Morgan Stanley said its time to sell the 17-
nation currency against the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 17-nation currency gained today, rising 1.1 percent to
$1.3749, as former European Central Bank Vice President Lucas
Papademos was sworn in as prime minster of Greece and Italy&#8217;s
Senate approved an austerity bill, paving the way for a new
administration that may be led by former European Union
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. Italian bonds gained,
pushing yields down from euro-era records above 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergency of the new governments helps reduce &#8220;near-
term political uncertainty&#8221; and suggests &#8220;that euro-zone fiscal
tensions could continue to decline, at least for a period of
time,&#8221; wrote Thomas Stolper, Goldman&#8217;s London-based chief
foreign-exchange strategist, in a client note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should target $1.40 and should exit the trade if
the euro falls to $1.35, according to the Goldman note. In a
video webcast today, Stolper reiterated a 12-month forecast of
$1.48 for the euro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley said the shared currency may fall to $1.30,
according to analysts led by Hans Redeker, the firm&#8217;s head of
foreign-exchange strategy in London. &#8220;Political uncertainties&#8221;
and Italian bond yields that remain above 6 percent leave the
firm &#8220;fundamentally bearish&#8221; on the euro &#8220;as Italy runs the risk
of being too big to save,&#8221; the firm said in a client note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders should sell the euro, targeting $1.3050, and end
the bet if it rises to $1.3950, Morgan Stanley recommended in a
note yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Patricia Kuo and Stephen Morris" date="Nov 11, 2011 11:47 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-11/jpmorgan-grabs-europe-loan-share-as-french-banks-pull-back-credit-markets.html"><headline>JPMorgan Grabs Europe Loan Share as French Waver: Credit Markets</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks led by JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) are boosting their share of loan
underwriting in Europe to the highest since 2007 as French
lenders&#8217; dominance ebbs amid the region&#8217;s expanding debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street banks captured 10 percent of the $860
billion of loans arranged this year, up from 8 percent in 2010.
BNP Paribas SA, Credit Agricole SA (ACA) and Societe Generale SA have
15 percent of the market, the least since 2006 and down from
16.5 percent a year ago, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole remain the top two
lenders. Societe Generale slipped back to its No. 6 ranking of
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trend of U.S. banks taking market share from the
French banks has started and will probably continue as U.S.
lenders are in a better situation now having addressed their
problems from 2007 and 2008, whereas French banks are facing the
need to adapt,&#8221; said Elisabeth Grandin, a director in Standard
 Poor&#8217;s European financial services group in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup and JPMorgan were hired by Danone (BN) to help
coordinate the biggest yogurt maker&#8217;s 2 billion-euro ($2.72
billion) credit line in July, according to Bloomberg data. BNP
Paribas, Credit Agricole and Societe Generale were among the
leaders of Danone&#8217;s last loan in December 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar Funding &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French lenders are pulling back as the cost for European
banks to fund in dollars increases. The cost to banks of
converting euro payments into greenbacks as measured by three-
month cross-currency swap dropped to 113 basis points below the
euro interbank offered rate today, from 27.6 at the end of June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the difficulty in getting dollar funding forces them
to pull away from some deals, clearly this will be opportunities
for others to step up,&#8221; said Ashu Khullar, London-based co-head
of Europe, Middle East and Africa loan structuring and
syndication at Citigroup. &#8220;European banks have been very active
in trade, commodities and pre-export financings which tend to be
largely based in dollars.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, Amgen Inc. (AMGN) and Peabody Energy
Inc. led $38.2 billion of corporate bond sales this week, the
most in more than five months, as economists lowering the odds
of a U.S. recession overshadowed Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. Empresas
ICA SAB, Mexico&#8217;s largest construction company, plans to sell
more bonds linked to revenue from infrastructure projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures traders are scaling back bets for the speed at which
the Federal Reserve will eventually lift its target rate for
overnight loans as U.S. employers remain slow to add workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amgen Offering &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amgen, the world&#8217;s largest biotechnology firm, issued $6
billion of debt in the biggest bond offering since March,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. St. Louis-based Peabody
Energy, the U.S. coal producer, sold $3.1 billion of notes to
finance its acquisition of MacArthur Coal Ltd., the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance climbed 38 percent from last week with borrowers
from Israel&#8217;s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. to Encana
Corp., Canada&#8217;s biggest natural-gas producer, selling corporate
debt as yields fell. Sales reached $20.7 billion on Nov. 7, the
busiest day since May 27, after European Central Bank executive
board member Juergen Stark predicted the region&#8217;s debt crisis
will be under control within two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy will grow by 2.2 percent next year,
according to the median forecast of 63 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. That&#8217;s up from 2.0 percent in last month&#8217;s poll. The
chance of renewed recession fell to 25 percent from 30 percent,
economists in the survey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICA Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICA sold 7.1 billion pesos ($525 million) of securities on
Sept. 29 that are backed by receivables from a contract to build
and operate prisons for Mexico&#8217;s government. The bonds, which
mature in 21 years, are rated AAA on a local scale by Standard 
Poor&#8217;s. That&#8217;s 12 levels higher than ICA&#8217;s own BB- rating by the
credit-rating service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICA may use a similar structure to sell debt for water-
treatment plants because it offers &#8220;pretty good terms,&#8221; Chief
Operating Officer Alonso Quintana said Nov. 9 in an interview in
Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implied yields on Eurodollar futures that expire in
December 2014 have slid 45 basis points, or 0.45 percentage
point, since Oct. 12 as traders price-in a slower pace of Fed
monetary policy tightening. The Fed has held its target rate for
overnight loans in a zero to 0.25 percent range since December
2008 and pledged in August to hold its key rate steady at least
mid-2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said this month the pace of
growth remains &#8220;frustratingly slow&#8221; though concern dimmed that
the U.S. economy risks sliding into another recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe Ratings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurodollar contracts, the world&#8217;s most actively traded
futures, are based on predictions for the three-month dollar
London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and are used to
speculate on changes in central-bank policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission may scale back plans to require
periodic changes in the firms that rate a company&#8217;s credit on
concerns there aren&#8217;t enough of them for the proposal to work,
said a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission, the 27-nation EU&#8217;s executive arm, had
considered requiring companies to change the ratings firm they
use every three years to ensure that assessments remain
impartial, with a four-year period before a firm can be rehired.
The measure may now be scaled back, including a possible
extension of the three-year deadline for companies that hire
multiple ratings firms, said the person, who couldn&#8217;t be named
because the discussions are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays&#8217; High-Yield Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays is forecasting that speculative-grade borrowers
will sell in 2012 between $180 billion and $200 billion of junk
bonds and $150 billion to $175 billion of leveraged loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we expect primary markets to be open in 2012, the
pace of issuance should be somewhat slower than in 2010 and
2011, as the low all-in yield environment of early 2011 pulled
forward some refinancing activity that otherwise may have
occurred next year,&#8221; credit strategists led by Bradley Rogoff
said yesterday in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From January through July of this year, companies sold
$184.6 billion in notes, a 50 percent increase from 2010,
according to Barclays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 index
fell for the second straight session yesterday, declining 0.03
cent to 91.9 cents on the dollar. The measure, which tracks the
100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien leveraged loans, has
climbed from 86.96 on Oct. 5, which was the lowest since
December 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loan Ratings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and lower than BBB- by SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In emerging markets, relative yields rose 3 basis points to
395 basis points, or 3.95 percentage points, according to
JPMorgan&#8217;s EMBI Global index. The measure has ranged from 259 on
Jan. 5 to 496 on Oct. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate borrowers in Europe refinanced a record $454
billion of loans this year, up 52 percent from a year earlier,
to benefit from lower borrowing costs in the first half of 2011,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest margins have increased since July, with the
average paid by investment-grade borrowers in Europe at 91.6
basis points more than benchmark rates, up from 84.4 basis
points during the first six months of 2011. The interest margin
for leveraged buyouts increased to 434 basis points from 419.8,
the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital Constraints &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banks that are less affected by dollar funding problems
and balance sheet reductions are unlikely to start pricing very
aggressively because everyone has capital constraints,&#8221; said
Jon Abando, executive director of EMEA loan capital markets at
JPMorgan in London. &#8220;If some banks are priced out of deals then
borrowers have a reduced number of banks which can participate
in a transaction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. lenders are closing in on France&#8217;s two biggest banks
after their share of the market tumbled to as low as 5.8 percent
following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, U.S. firms held 28 percent of the market,
according to Bloomberg data. Tighter regulations and the
sovereign debt crisis will lead the two biggest French lenders
to cut at least 300 billion euros from their balance sheets by
2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas (BNP) and Societe Generale announced their plans to
scale back in September. Rather than tap the market for capital,
the two lenders are seeking to free up a combined 10 billion
euros through asset cuts and disposals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost Dominance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas lost its dominance in dollar-denominated loans
this year, falling to No. 2 after being supplanted by New York-
based JPMorgan, according to Bloomberg data. Paris-based BNP
Paribas, which helped arrange a $2.5 billion credit line in
April for SABMiller Plc, was absent from the brewer&#8217;s $12.5
billion loan from August to take over Foster&#8217;s Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashling Cashmore, a spokeswoman for BNP Paribas in London,
declined to comment, as did Charline Coue, a spokeswoman for
Credit Agricole and a spokesman in London for Societe Generale. (GLE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are aware of the short-term funding issues some
European banks are facing, which has made them less willing to
lend, especially in dollars,&#8221; Jan-Maarten Mulder, the global
head of corporate finance and treasury at Amsterdam-based
Trafigura Beheer BV, said in an interview. &#8220;There is relatively
more pressure on French banks recently.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trafigura, the third-largest independent oil trader, may
switch some of its dollar funding into euros and seek more
letters of credit which have no capital requirements for
lenders, Mulder said. The firm has sought to diversify into the
U.S. and Asian market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Entrants &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are seeing some U.S. banks like Citigroup move into
our industry as they try to&#8221; bolster their franchise, Mulder
said. &#8220;We welcome new entrants into the market but even though
some traditional trade finance banks are going through difficult
times, they will remain dominant lenders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar-denominated deals account for 27 percent of the
market this year compared with 33 percent last year, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup is one of the managers of a $870 million term
loan last month to OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil producer controlled
by Russia&#8217;s natural-gas export monopoly, which didn&#8217;t have a
U.S. bank arranging its $1.5 billion pre-export financing last
year, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In light of the market dislocation, there will be a
reshuffling of league table rankings in the next couple of years
as European banks try to identify who their key clients are and
rationalize their lending,&#8221; said Citigroup&#8217;s Khullar. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
been proactive in providing capital to our key clients in the
past 18 months after we addressed our issues from the last
crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balance Sheet &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas is shrinking its balance sheet after total
assets jumped 34 percent to 2.24 trillion euros in the three
years to June 2010, equal to the size of Bank of America Corp.
and Morgan Stanley combined. Total assets fell to 1.93 trillion
euros in June, about the same size as France&#8217;s economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French financial firms top the list of Greek creditors with
about $57 billion in overall exposure to private and public debt
at the end of March, according to the Bank for International
Settlements based in Basel, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan hired David Shaw from Barclays Capital in June for
the EMEA acquisition and leveraged finance group. Simon Rankin,
joined from Deutsche Bank to help run the newly formed emerging
market team within the group, according to Kate Haywood, a
London-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yusuf Alireza, who was promoted to
co-president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s operations in the
Asia-Pacific region outside Japan in January, is leaving after
19 years with the company, according to an internal memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Ryan will remain as president of the business,
according to the memo from Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, and
Vice Chairman J. Michael Evans. Goldman Sachs spokesman Edward
Naylor confirmed the contents of the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alireza, 41, is the most senior departure from Goldman
Sachs in the region since Ravi Sinha, former co-head of
investment banking for Asia ex-Japan, stepped down in April 2010.
Alireza was among four Asia-based members of the firm&#8217;s global
management committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s net revenue from Asia shrank to $7.1
billion last year from $8.3 billion in 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s net revenue from the
region more than doubled last year, to $4.3 billion. At 18
percent, Asia still accounted for a greater share of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s overall revenue than at Morgan Stanley, which got 14
percent of its total from the region last year, the data shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alireza has no plan to join a rival company, said a person
with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified.
Goldman promoted him along with Ryan in January, with Alireza
overseeing trading operations and Ryan focusing on advisory
services such as arranging mergers and managing stock sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quarterly Loss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alireza joined the firm&#8217;s fixed-income research group in
New York in 1992 and had held positions in fixed-income sales
and hedge fund sales, rising to become a partner in 2004,
according to the memo. He moved to Hong Kong in 2008 to run the
securities division in the Asia-Pacific region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, last month reported its
second quarterly loss in 12 years as a public company as the
firm lost money on investments. Still, revenue from trading
stocks and bonds rose 16 percent from the second quarter and the
backlog of investment-banking assignments climbed, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckley Ratchford, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s head of global bank loan
trading and distressed investing, and Blake W. Mather, who runs
bank loan sales at the firm, are leaving at the end of this year,
according to internal memos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. (BMY)&#8217;s experimental drug apixaban wasn&#8217;t safer or more effective
than a standard treatment in stopping blood clots in the legs
and lungs of patients after hospitalization, a study found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial, reported today at the American Heart Association
meeting in Orlando, Florida, is the second to show new
anticoagulants don&#8217;t provide a benefit in severely ill patients
more than Sanofi&#8217;s injected drug Lovenox, the current standard.
Johnson  Johnson and Bayer AG (BAYN)&#8217;s Xarelto failed to beat the
standard therapy in a trial reported last April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potentially deadly clots occurred in 2.7 percent of
those given apixaban, also known by the brand name Eliquis,
compared with 3.1 percent of those given Lovenox, the results
showed. The difference wasn&#8217;t statistically significant,
researchers said. While the drugs&#8217; benefits increased over time,
both also triggered more major bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve made great headway in preventing deep vein
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in surgical patients and
hospitalized medical patients,&#8221; said lead author Samuel
Goldhaber, director of the venous thromboembolism research group
at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical
School, in a statement. &#8220;Where we have failed to make progress
is the after-hospital discharge medical patient.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 Million Patients &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about 8 million U.S. patients a year that are at
moderate to high risk of venous thromboembolism, Goldhaber said.
About 1 percent of patients develop symptoms from the clots
after they are released from the hospital, and they are most
common in the following three months, said Mary Cushman,
director of the thrombosis program at the University of Vermont. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, and Bristol-Myers
are both based in New York. The companies are evaluating the
results and haven&#8217;t decided what their next steps will be, said
MacKay Jimeson, a Pfizer spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the apixaban study and earlier trial of
Xarelto, made by New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ), and Bayer, of Leverkusen, Germany, were looking to see
if longer treatment with the new pills could cut death rates and
prevent complications from leg clots that occur in as many as
600,000 Americans each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitalized patients, such as those with pneumonia or
heart failure, are at high risk for the clots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chance of success in the study was slim given the
difficulty of treating such sick patients, especially after the
Xarelto setback, said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink
Swann  Co. in Boston, in a Nov. 4 note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atrial Fibrillation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apixaban is in development to prevent stroke in patients
with atrial fibrillation, an erratic heartbeat that occurs in 2
million Americans a year. If approved, it will compete against
Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH&#8217;s Pradaxa in a market
estimated to top $10 billion in annual sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts predict apixaban may take the lead after a study
presented in August found it reduced deaths and bleeding rates
more than warfarin, a form of rat poison used to treat the
condition for more than five decades, unlike its rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Afib is clearly the primary indication for apixaban,&#8221;
said Marc Goodman, an analyst at UBS AG in New York, in a note
after the results were released. While the drug was forecast to
generate about $100 million in 2015 for medically ill patients,
the results should have &#8220;no meaningful impact&#8221; on the
companies&#8217; shares or the drug&#8217;s eventual sales, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitalized Patients &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hospitalized patients, the risk of the dangerous clots
were lower with apixaban as the trial progressed and patients
stopped getting Lovenox, which was given for longer than
patients now get it in routine care, Goldhaber said. That raises
the possibility that another study may find a benefit, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no question this is a tremendous opportunity to
design and carry out a new trial,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;I
have been in this field for 30 years, and I have no doubt that
it is going to happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bleeding occurred in 7.73 percent of patients on apixaban,
up from 6.81 percent of those given Lovenox. Major bleeding was
2.5-fold higher in patients given apixban, occurring in 0.47
percent of those given the experimental drug versus 0.19 percent
of those on Lovenox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased risk of major bleeding poses a problem since
few patients released from the hospital will ultimately develop
symptoms from the clots, which the drug was designed to prevent,
said Cushman from the University of Vermont. Cushman, who wasn&#8217;t
involved in the trial, reviewed the findings at a press
conference at the heart meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by Pfizer and Bristol-Myers and
published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Johnson 
Johnson, maker of Xarelto with Germany&#8217;s Bayer, is based in New
Brunswick, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great Atlantic  Pacific Tea Co. (GAP),
the bankrupt supermarket company known as AP, proposed a plan
to exit court protection based on financing from an investor
group that includes Ron Burkle&#8217;s Yucaipa Cos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP won court approval today of the $490 million financing
commitment and filed its proposal to pay creditors and complete
its restructuring with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White
Plains, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capital provided by the investment agreement, which
allows AP to consider better offers as it works to complete its
bankruptcy case, are necessary for AP to be viable, Ray
Schrock, a lawyer for the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Without this capital infusion there is no viable
reorganization,&#8221; Schrock told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain at a court hearing. &#8220;It&#8217;s absolutely critical.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP, based in Montvale, New Jersey, operates more than 300
stores under several banners, including AP, Pathmark and Food
Emporium. As of Sept. 10, it reported total assets of
$2.34 billion and liabilities of $3.58 billion, according to
court documents. AP filed for bankruptcy last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP announced Nov. 3 that Yucaipa, Mount Kellett Capital
Management, and investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs Asset
Management had agreed to provide $490 million in debt and equity
funding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Offers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drain approved the financing commitment today, saying AP
was locking in financing now while keeping the ability to
consider other offers that may come along. AP will return to
court for approval of the bankruptcy plan. It has said it
expects to emerge from bankruptcy early next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both noteholder investors and Yucaipa are well
established and well-regarded investors,&#8221; Drain said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the financing plan, the investors will purchase new
notes and shares and will receive all the equity in the
reorganized company, according to court papers. Secured
creditors will be paid in full and a $40 million cash pool will
be available for general unsecured creditors, according to the
court filing. The company provided percentage recoveries only
for some classes of creditors. Recoveries for others were left
blank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re The Great Atlantic  Pacific Tea Co. (GAPTQ)
Inc., 10-24549, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (White Plains). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) took stakes in CVS Caremark Corp., Intel Corp. (INTC) and Visa
Inc. (V) as investment manager Todd Combs builds his portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett&#8217;s firm also had holdings of DirecTV (DTV) and General
Dynamics Corp. (GD), the maker of Gulfstream business jets and Abrams
tanks, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire said today in a
regulatory filing today listing U.S. equity holdings as of Sept.
30. Berkshire reported an increase in its Dollar General Corp.
stake and a decline in its holding of Johnson  Johnson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett and Combs drew down Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire&#8217;s cash hoard in the three months ended Sept. 30 as
U.S. stocks headed for their biggest quarterly decline since
2008. Buffett, 81, said earlier today that he bought more than
$10 billion of stock in International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
this year, with most of the purchases made in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;American companies look very cheap compared to investment
alternatives,&#8221; Buffett said today in a CNBC interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire invested $23.9 billion in the third quarter as
Buffett, the chief executive officer, acquired Lubrizol Corp.,
took a preferred stake in Bank of America Corp. and broadened
the stock portfolio. Buffett has accumulated the biggest stakes
in Coca-Cola Co. and Wells Fargo  Co. in his more than four
decades running Berkshire. Combs, 40, is assembling a group of
stock picks of his own after being hired by Berkshire last year
to take smaller stakes than Buffett. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire held 5.66 million shares of CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS),
the largest U.S. provider of prescription drugs, valued at $190
million as of Sept. 30. The 2.29 million-share holding of Visa,
the world&#8217;s biggest payments network, was valued at about $196
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stakes in satellite television provider DirecTV,
chipmaker Intel and General Dynamics were all valued at between
$170 million and $200 million as of Sept. 30, according to the
filing. Shares of each of Berkshire&#8217;s new holdings have advanced
this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

third quarter while exiting positions in BP Plc (BP/) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlight also built new positions in Marvell Technology
Group Ltd. (MRVL), CBS Corp. (CBS), Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) and Compuware Corp. (CPWR) as
well as the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners exchange-traded
fund, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing today showed.
The hedge fund sold shares of Aeropostale Inc. (ARO) and Amdocs Ltd. (DOX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based hedge fund increased the proportion of
its equity investments in technology companies and financial
stocks by 7.1 percent and 5.9 percent, respectively, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. It cut health-care and energy stock
weightings by 11.1 percent and 3.7 percent, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einhorn&#8217;s funds have posted negative returns in 2011.
Greenlight Capital LP fell 1.2 percent in the third quarter and
6.2 percent this year, according to a letter to investors dated
Nov. 7. The investor, whose fund can bet on rising and falling
prices, is best known for shorting Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
before it collapsed in September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil has risen
to a premium over Light Louisiana Sweet since Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
shut a portion of its Southwest Pipeline System from South Bend
to Sunset, Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line was shut &#8220;indefinitely&#8221; Oct. 31, according to an
Oct. 21 bulletin sent to shippers obtained by Bloomberg News.
The pipeline helps carry Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil, according to
the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12-inch pipeline carries oil from South Bend to Krotz
Springs, Patricia Errico, an Exxon spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail. Exxon made alternative arrangements available for
customers before the closure, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon shut the pipeline after a special permit application
seeking to &#8220;modify repair criteria&#8221; on the segment was
rejected, according to the spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ) shut its 83,000-barrel-a-day Krotz
Springs refinery for upgrades that will improve the capacity of
the plant&#8217;s fluid catalytic cracking unit and its ability to
handle different grades of crude, the company said in a Nov. 3.
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alon said it expects to finish work during the first half
of this month and that throughput will exceed 62,000 barrels a
day in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy Louisiana Sweet has climbed to a premium of $1.65 a
barrel over Light Louisiana Sweet from a discount of 70 cents on
Oct. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)&#8217;s Warren Buffett, who spent more than $10 billion on International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) stock, paid near-record prices for the
shares, recalling his winning 1988 investment in Coca-Cola Co. (KO) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire began buying IBM shares this year after Buffett
read the Armonk, New York-based company&#8217;s annual report and saw
the firm &#8220;through a different lens,&#8221; the billionaire told CNBC
today in an interview. IBM had doubled in New York trading in
the 27 months prior to the Feb. 22 release of its yearly 10-K
filing. Coca-Cola had doubled in the four years through the end
of 1987, and has risen more than 10-fold since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think he looked at Coke through a different lens back
in 1988,&#8221; said Jeff Matthews, a Berkshire shareholder and
author of &#8220;Secrets in Plain Sight: Business and Investing
Secrets of Warren Buffett.&#8221; In IBM, &#8220;he sees a business that
supports the world&#8217;s IT infrastructure and has a lot of room to
grow over the next couple decades.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, 81, acquired IBM shares as the stock&#8217;s increase
this year prompted at least five analysts to remove their buy
recommendations. IBM has risen 28 percent in 2011, the biggest
gainer in the 30-company Dow Jones Industrial Average. (INDU) It is one
of six firms in the index whose stock is recommended for
purchase by less than half of the research shops that cover it,
according to data tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM becomes Berkshire&#8217;s second-biggest holding behind a
stake in Atlanta-based Coca-Cola valued at about $13.5 billion.
Buffett, Berkshire&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer,
invested about $1 billion in the world&#8217;s biggest soft-drink
maker by the end of 1989 and made purchases of almost $300
million in 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;A Behemoth&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When he started to accumulate the Coca-Cola stock it was
like, &#8216;Boy, this is very unlike Buffett because of the
valuation,&#8217;&#8221; said David Rolfe, chief investment officer of
Berkshire investor Wedgewood Partners Inc. IBM &#8220;is a behemoth,
compared to even where Coke was back then. But it is certainly a
company that can grow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM climbed to a record on Oct. 14. Buffett said he
acquired most of the stake in the three months ended Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has 16 analyst ratings equivalent to hold, compared
with 15 buy recommendations. Coca-Cola, which is also in the
Dow, had 17 buy ratings compared with 4 hold calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is focused on services businesses as it enters its
101st year, and the firm has targeted expansion in Brazil, India
and China. Coca-Cola, the world&#8217;s biggest soft-drink maker, has
boosted per-share earnings eightfold since 1989 by buying back
stock and expanding in regions including China and the Pacific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s Strategy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett highlighted IBM&#8217;s opportunities to expand outside
the U.S. and the company&#8217;s track record of executing its
strategy. The $220 billion company is targeting operating
earnings of at least $20 a share by 2015, from a projection of
$13.35 for this year. IBM spent more than $100 billion on
dividends and buybacks since 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are thinking about the shareholders,&#8221; Buffett said
in the televised CNBC interview. &#8220;They treat their stock with
reverence, which I find is unusual among big companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM appointed Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty last month as its
first female CEO. She takes over from Sam Palmisano, who
increased earnings by steering the company toward software and
services and disposing of some hardware businesses such as PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett drew down Berkshire&#8217;s cash and invested $23.9
billion in the third quarter. That included $6.9 billion of
equities, $5 billion for preferred shares and warrants in Bank
of America Corp. and the acquisition of Lubrizol Corp. for about
$9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is trading at about 14 times earnings, compared with
Coca-Cola&#8217;s 18 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ability to go out there and find distressed
investments becomes a lot more difficult when you got to put $10
billion to work,&#8221; said Tom Lewandowski, an analyst with Edward
Jones  Co. The IBM investment is &#8220;a growth play, it&#8217;s an
emerging-markets play.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

London-based hedge fund founded by Crispin Odey, bought shares
of Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in
the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odey purchased 8.58 million shares valued at $206.9 million
of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo between July and September,
according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The hedge fund bought 3.71 million shares
of Citigroup valued at $95.1 million and 2.06 million shares of
JPMorgan valued at $62.2 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
slumped 19 percent this year as investors question whether
lenders will be hurt by slowing economic growth and Europe&#8217;s
sovereign-debt crisis. JPMorgan Chase has declined 24 percent
and Citigroup has fallen 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odey, 52, has previously profited from buying banks after
other investors sold their shares because of concerns of falling
revenues. One hedge fund he manages, Odey European Inc., rose 32
percent in 2009 after he purchased shares of lenders including
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Barclays Plc, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Odey European fund declined 14 percent in 2011 as of
Oct. 28. Odey didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone call seeking
comment after regular business hours. Odey Asset Management
oversees $7 billion, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon promoted Lauren Tyler to general auditor and
appointed her to the largest U.S. lender&#8217;s company-wide
executive committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tyler, who ran JPMorgan&#8217;s investor relations department,
will report directly to Dimon and the board&#8217;s audit committee,
which is run by Laban Jackson, Dimon said in a memo sent to
employees today. Tyler previously served as a managing director
at the New York-based firm&#8217;s investment bank, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She is a proven and trusted leader, and she is highly
respected by her colleagues around the world and by my partners
on the operating committee,&#8221; Dimon said. Her appointment is
effective immediately and a successor is being sought, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tyler has been in charge of the company&#8217;s relationships
with investors and research analysts over the last two and half
years and was named the best investor relations professional
among the largest banks by Institutional Investor magazine
earlier this year, he said. She&#8217;s replacing Martha Gallo, who
took the job as head of global compliance and regulatory
management, Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackson, a holdover from Bank One Corp. before it merged
with JPMorgan Chase in 2004, is chairman and CEO of Clear Creek
Properties, a real-estate development company in Lexington,
Kentucky. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, who said he was
unable to predict the prospects for Apple Inc. and Facebook
Inc., is betting more than $10 billion that International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) is a different kind of technology firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett previously focused the stock portfolio at his
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) on consumer brands like Coca-Cola Inc.
and financial firms like Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), saying he was able
to understand their business plans. The strategy meant he missed
the rally in technology companies like Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM)
and Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) and then their subsequent slumps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett invested $10.5 billion to $10.7 billion in IBM,
betting on the company&#8217;s ability to maintain its market
dominance in computer services and expand outside the U.S.
Armonk, New York-based IBM gained 19 percent in the first nine
months of the year as global stock markets plunged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re a tech company, but they will not have the
wild swings that we&#8217;ve seen throughout history, like a RIM or a
Nokia where they catapult up but then the technology shifts
against them and they plummet,&#8221; said Louis Miscioscia, a Collins
Stewart LLC analyst in Boston with a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before making the investment, Berkshire surveyed its own
information-technology departments to see how they worked with
suppliers and found many tended to stick with IBM, Buffett said
today on CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I probably read the annual report of IBM every year for 50
years,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that there&#8217;s any company that I
can think of, big company, that&#8217;s done a better job of laying
out where they&#8217;re going to go and then having gone there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bricks, Paint &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Buffett said he would prolong his aversion to
electronics makers such as Apple, saying he&#8217;s unable to evaluate
their future. He also said investors should be wary of social-
networking websites, saying it is &#8220;extremely difficult&#8221; to
determine their value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, which sold its personal-computer business more than
six years ago, is now focused mostly on services and software
for corporate customers. The company&#8217;s financial forecasts and a
five-year earnings plan distinguish it from technology companies
whose performance hinges on the success of products for
consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett has shunned technology investments in favor of
industrial, financial and consumer-goods holdings in his four
decades at Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire. He stayed out of the
dot-com boom and bust, saying in a letter accompanying
Berkshire&#8217;s 2000 annual report: &#8220;We have embraced the 21st
century by entering such cutting-edge industries as brick,
carpet and paint. Try to control your excitement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil, China Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider,
targets operating earnings of at least $20 a share by 2015, up
from $13.35 the company projects for this year. Software will
make up half of total profit in 2015, IBM forecasts. Analytics
software, which helps businesses predict trends, is expected to
draw $16 billion in sales by 2015, while cloud computing will
draw $7 billion, IBM predicts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett said his holding of about 64 million shares was
acquired mostly in the third quarter. That means his company
paid about $167.19 on average. IBM rose 0.2 percent to $187.80
at 12:46 p.m. New York time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett cited IBM&#8217;s gains in emerging markets and dominance
in the information-technology services market as reasons to
invest. Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil, India and
China, will make up at least 30 percent of revenue by 2015, IBM
has said, up from 21 percent in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As you go around the world there&#8217;s a fair amount of
presumption in many places that if you&#8217;re with IBM that you
stick with them, and that if you haven&#8217;t been with anybody or
are developing things that you certainly give them a fair shot
at the business,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betting on Rometty &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is also investing in products such as analytics
software. The company has said it will generate $100 billion in
cash flow between from 2010 to 2015 and return 70 percent of
that to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, IBM appointed Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty, 54,
as the first female CEO in the company&#8217;s 100-year history. She
is taking over from Sam Palmisano, who increased earnings by
steering the company toward software and services, and disposing
some hardware businesses such as PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She&#8217;s explained these plans they have for the next five
years. I have no reason to be anything other than positive,&#8221;
Buffett said. &#8220;And they&#8217;re batting 1,000 in the last two CEO&#8217;s
they&#8217;ve come up with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Fay, an IBM spokesman, referred to Buffett&#8217;s comments
on the company&#8217;s growth plans and said IBM didn&#8217;t immediately
have anything to add. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lubrizol, Tesco &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett drew down Berkshire&#8217;s cash hoard in the three
months ended Sept. 30 as U.S. stocks headed for their biggest
quarterly decline since 2008. The chief executive officer
invested $23.9 billion in the period as he acquired Lubrizol
Corp., took a preferred stake in Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and
broadened the stock portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett spent $11.4 billion on equities in the nine months
ended September, compared with $3.9 billion a year earlier. The
stock purchases this year are in addition to the $5 billion
Berkshire spent on Bank of America preferred stock and warrants
and the takeover of Lubrizol for about $9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire had $68.1 billion in stocks at the end of
September. That includes investments of non-U.S. companies,
including Germany&#8217;s Munich Re and the U.K.&#8217;s Tesco Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett also said another technology giant, Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT), is &#8220;attractive,&#8221; adding he doesn&#8217;t invest in it because
of his relationship with the software maker&#8217;s co-founder and
fellow philanthropist Bill Gates. Buffett has pledged the bulk
of his wealth to the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft is off bounds to us because of my friendship
with Bill,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Billion a Month &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire&#8217;s investable funds were boosted this year as
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and General Electric Co. returned
financing that Buffett extended during the 2008 credit crunch.
Cash was also bolstered by earnings at units from the Burlington
Northern Santa Fe railroad to the Geico car insurer. The third-
quarter investments reduced Berkshire cash hoard to $34.8
billion as of Sept. 30 from $47.9 billion three months earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The guy has a billion-plus coming in to Omaha&#8221; every
month, said David Rolfe, chief investment officer of Berkshire
investor Wedgewood Partners Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, which fell 14 percent in
the third quarter, has advanced 12 percent since Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the stock is cheap, we will buy it,&#8221; Buffett said in
a Sept. 30 interview with Bloomberg Television. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) Chief Executive
Officer Rex Tillerson is playing catch-up with a former rival,
ex-BP Plc (BP/) CEO Tony Hayward, in a race to tap oil riches in Iraq&#8217;s
Kurdish region that dwarf the deep-water Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest company by market value, signed a
contract to drill for crude in the Kurdish-controlled north of
the country on Oct. 18, Ashti Hawrami, the natural resources
minister for the Kurdistan Regional Government, said yesterday
during an oil conference in Erbil, Iraq. Hayward&#8217;s Vallares Plc
has a six-week head start with its $2.1 billion agreement in
September to acquire Turkey-based Genel Energy Plc, the biggest
oil producer in Kurdistan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home to about 40 percent of the Iraqi nation&#8217;s 115 billion
barrels of reserves, Kurdistan has attracted keen interest from
small and midsized foreign explorers since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 opened the region for the first time in decades.
The biggest international producers such as Exxon had steered
clear of Kurdistan to avoid getting in the middle of a long-
standing dispute between Iraq and Kurdish leaders over how to
divide oil revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s central government said it&#8217;s settled the dispute with
an agreement that would open the door to international oil
companies operating in the Kurdish region without penalty from
Iraq, according to a Nov. 12 report by Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty, the U.S. government-funded news outlet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding Production &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson has been expanding Exxon&#8217;s holdings from the
Russian Arctic to the Texas-Mexico border to reverse a production
shortfall that saw third-quarter output drop the most in three
years. The company&#8217;s willingness to sign a contract with Kurdish
authorities may presage a flood of investment and acquisitions
not only in the northern region but all over Iraq as perceptions
of political and security risks diminish, said Gianna Bern,
president of Brookshire Advisory  Research Inc., a Chicago-based
risk-management adviser to the energy industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iraq is open for business,&#8221; Bern said. &#8220;If Exxon can
advance its efforts in Iraq, then opportunities for all the major
oil companies to invest are going to increase significantly over
the next several years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurdish authorities have offered international oil producers
more profitable terms than those given by Iraq&#8217;s central
government. In Kurdistan, foreign explorers are granted a share
of the oil pumped from each well. That&#8217;s a richer prospect than
the service contracts with Iraq&#8217;s government for developing
southern oilfields, which give foreign companies pre-set fees of
as little as $1.90 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions with Iraq &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of oil explorers focusing on Kurdish fields surged
today. Petroceltic International Plc (PCI) rose 8 percent in London
after earlier jumping 13 percent. Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP)
advanced as much as 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon riled some members of the Iraqi government by signing
its exploration contract with Kurdish leaders before the oil-
sharing agreement with Iraq had been completed. After Exxon&#8217;s
contract was reported Nov. 11, Abdul-Mahdy al-Ameedi, head of
licensing at the Iraqi central government&#8217;s Oil Ministry,
threatened to cancel the company&#8217;s existing contracts to extract
oil in Iraq&#8217;s southern fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day later, Adal Barwari, Prime Minister Nouri Kamil al- Maliki&#8217;s adviser on Kurdish affairs, told Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty that the central government and the Kurds reached
&#8220;mutually acceptable&#8221; solutions to long-standing disagreements
over oil, territory and Kurdish armed forces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon,
declined to comment yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayward&#8217;s Kurdish Plan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayward, forced out of London-based BP last year after the
Deepwater Horizon disaster that killed 11 rig workers and spilled
more than 4 million barrels of crude in the Gulf, plans to spend
about $725 million to develop Genel&#8217;s six Kurdish fields. An
equal amount will be devoted to buying up some of the 41
companies drilling for crude and natural gas in the Kurdish
region, Hayward said during a Sept. 8 meeting with reporters in
Istanbul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will be participating in the inevitable consolidation
among the 41 companies in the Kurdish region,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We
want to have the dominant position in the region by building a
bigger company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vallares, a so-called blank-check company founded by Hayward,
financier Nathaniel Rothschild and banker Julian Metherell, said
in a Nov. 3 statement that it plans to change its name to Genel
Energy Plc, pending approval by shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurdistan holds as much as 45 billion barrels in crude
reserves, Hawrami said in September. That&#8217;s more than double the
20.4 billion barrels of crude the U.S. Energy Department
estimates lay beneath the sea floor in the deep-water Gulf of
Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexploited &#8216;Vast&#8217; Reserves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraqi oil production surged to a 9-year high of 2.73 million
barrels a day in September, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Output fell 2.7 percent to 2.655 million barrels a day
last month after attacks on pipelines in the southern part of the
country disrupted transport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iraq may be one of the few places left where vast oil
reserves have barely been exploited,&#8221; the U.S. Energy
Department&#8217;s Energy Information Administration said in a 2010
report on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson, a University of Texas-trained engineer, is
spending $37 billion this year to drill wells, construct gas-
export terminals and expand oil refineries as he seeks new
sources of growth for Exxon. In the past year-and-a-half,
Tillerson signed a $3.2 billion deal with Russia&#8217;s OAO Rosneft to
explore the Black Sea and Kara Sea for crude, and devoted another
$40 billion to acqusitions in gas-rich U.S. shale formations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Binding Contract&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Exxon has been mum about its plans for Kurdistan,
refusing even to confirm the existence of an agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a binding contract,&#8221; Hawrami told reporters
yesterday at the Kurdistan-Iraq Oil and Gas Conference in the
regional capital city Erbil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement entitles Exxon to explore six blocks,
including Al Qush, Bashiqa, Tirman, Betwata, Qurna-Hanjeer and an
area along the border with Iran, he said. Hawrami didn&#8217;t disclose
any details about how much Exxon has pledged to spend on seismic
mapping, exploratory drilling or training local residents to work
in the oilfields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iraq is considered a frontier region in the oil
industry,&#8221; said Brookshire Advisory&#8217;s Bern, a former BP crude
trader and author of &#8220;Investing in Energy: A Primer on the
Economics of the Energy Industry.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s still a risky place to
operate but if Exxon can advance its efforts there, it&#8217;ll be a
pretty significant feather in its cap.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) acquired a 5.5 percent stake in International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider,
as the billionaire chairman accelerated stock purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holding of about 64 million shares was acquired mostly
in the third quarter and cost $10.5 billion to $10.7 billion,
Buffett told CNBC in an interview today. At $10.7 billion, his
company would have paid an average of about $167.19 a share, 
compared with IBM&#8217;s Nov. 11 close of $187.38. IBM advanced 0.8
percent to $188.85 at 10:10 a.m. in New York. Berkshire slipped 
1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have laid out a road map and followed it extremely
well,&#8221; Buffett said of Armonk, New York-based IBM. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
done an incredible job.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, 81, drew down Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire&#8217;s
cash hoard in the three months ended Sept. 30 as U.S. stocks
headed for their biggest quarterly decline since 2008. The chief
executive officer invested $23.9 billion in the period as he
acquired Lubrizol Corp., took a preferred stake in Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) and broadened the stock portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is investing in areas such as emerging markets and
analytics software to boost earnings. The company has said it
will generate $100 billion in cash flow from 2010 to 2015 and
return 70 percent of that to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett said he was betting on IBM&#8217;s ability to help
clients&#8217; information-technology departments outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;More Comfortable&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re in some country around the world and
you&#8217;re developing your IT department, you&#8217;re probably going to
feel more comfortable with IBM than with many companies,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve done a terrific job of developing that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, IBM named Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty the first
female CEO in the company&#8217;s 100-year history. She is taking over
from Sam Palmisano, who increased earnings by steering the
company toward software and services, and disposing some
hardware businesses such as personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM targets operating earnings of at least $20 a share by
2015, up from $13.35 the company projects for this year.
Software will make up half of total profit in 2015, IBM
forecasts. Analytics software, which helps businesses predict
trends, is expected to draw $16 billion in sales by 2015, while
cloud computing will draw $7 billion, IBM predicts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Going to Panic &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett &#8220;had the funds and the opportunity to purchase
shares at an attractive price,&#8221; said David Kass, a professor at
the University of Maryland&#8217;s Robert H. Smith School of Business.
&#8220;He&#8217;s not going to panic when there is some temporary economic
problems which could cause the stock markets to plunge for some
period of time. He just sees that as a buying opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Fay, an IBM spokesman, referred to Buffett&#8217;s comments
on the company&#8217;s growth plans and said IBM didn&#8217;t immediately
have anything to add. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, which fell 14 percent in
the third quarter, has advanced about 11 percent since Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett spent $11.4 billion on equity securities in the
nine months ended in September, compared with $3.9 billion in
same period last year and $3.2 billion in the first three
quarters of 2009. The stock purchases this year are in addition
to the $5 billion Berkshire spent on Bank of America preferred
stock and warrants and the takeover of Lubrizol for about $9
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett said his company increased its stake in Wells Fargo
 Co. (WFC) in the last quarter. Berkshire has previously disclosed
new stakes this year in MasterCard Inc., the world&#8217;s second-
biggest payments network, and retailer Dollar General Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett&#8217;s firm had requested permission to omit information
from regulatory filings that listed U.S. equity holdings as
of March 31 and June 30. Regulators sometimes let companies
withhold data to limit copycat investing while building or
cutting a position. Berkshire hasn&#8217;t filed its third-quarter
stocks statement as of 10:20 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the stock is cheap, we will buy it,&#8221; Buffett said in
a Sept. 30 interview with Bloomberg Television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire&#8217;s investable funds were boosted this year as
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and General Electric Co. returned
financing that Buffett extended during the 2008 credit crunch.
Cash was also bolstered by earnings at units from the Burlington
Northern Santa Fe railroad to the Geico car insurer. The third-
quarter investments reduced Berkshire cash hoard to $34.8
billion as of Sept. 30 from $47.9 billion three months earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance, Railroads &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The guy has a billion plus coming in to Omaha&#8221; every
month, said David Rolfe, chief investment officer of Berkshire
investor Wedgewood Partners Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire, which posted profit of $13 billion last year,
reported a 24 percent decline in third-quarter net income as
Buffett&#8217;s equity derivative bets pressured results. Insurance
units reported a $1.7 billion pretax underwriting gain, while
net earnings at the railroad rose 8.5 percent to $766 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire had $68.1 billion in stocks at the end of
September. That includes investments of non-U.S. companies,
including the biggest shareholding of Germany&#8217;s Munich Re and a
stake in the U.K.&#8217;s Tesco Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, in preparation for his eventual retirement, hired
money manager Todd Combs last year and instructed him to focus
on equities. Combs was assigned to oversee as much as $3 billion
and can make trades without consulting Buffett. Berkshire said
hedge fund manager Ted Weschler will join the company next year
and take charge of a portion of the portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, chairman and chief
executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A), said his company
has bought about 64 million shares of IBM Corp. this year,
mostly in the third quarter, at a cost of about $10.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has set out a &#8220;road map&#8221; for 2015 and has done an
&#8220;incredible job,&#8221; Buffett said today in an interview on CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company owns about 5.5 percent of IBM, Buffett said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its
forecast for commodity gains in the next year to 15 percent
after correctly predicting the climb in prices since the
beginning of last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index will be led by gains
in industrial metals in the next year, Jeffrey Currie, a Goldman
analyst in London, wrote in a report today. The bank, which
lowered its commodities forecast from 20 percent last month,
says copper will gain 22 percent and London oil 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman correctly advised investors to sell oil and
copper in April and turned more bullish the following month
before prices rebounded. It lowered its commodities outlook
after the GSCI Enhanced gauge jumped 15 percent since Oct. 4.
Raw materials have gained as European leaders attempted to
contain the region&#8217;s debt crisis and the Federal Reserve
signaled more stimulus may be available to spur growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Notwithstanding the continuing European crisis, we
maintain our view that global growth will provide enough support
to demand to drive key commodity prices higher over the next 12
months,&#8221; Currie wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winners, Losers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy commodities will climb almost 19 percent in the next
12 months, and industrial metals will advance 26 percent,
Goldman said. Precious metals will increase 5 percent, livestock
will rise almost 11 percent and agriculture will drop 5.1
percent. Copper will be at $9,500 a metric ton in London in a
year and London oil will be at $125 a barrel, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman held its price forecasts for industrial metals and
raised its estimates from an Oct. 4 report for New York and
London oil, gasoline, gold and live cattle. It cut its outlook
for wheat, soybeans, cotton and sugar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s inability to contain a regional debt crisis that
started in Greece more than two years ago led to a surge in
Italian bond yields as investors bet on which nation may need
aid next. Mario Monti, a former European Union competition
commissioner, was offered Italy&#8217;s prime minister post. George
Papandreou resigned last week as Greek prime minister to make
way for a coalition led by Lucas Papademos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whirlpool vs Rocks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commodity markets continue to navigate between a
potential European whirlpool on one side and rocks on the other
side, which the market will likely run up against should demand
not falter and supply constraints force price spikes to balance
the market,&#8221; Curry wrote. &#8220;We continue to emphasize that
concerns about being pulled under by the whirlpool have pushed
key commodity prices too low relative to current fundamental
balances.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities as measured by the GSCI Enhanced index are up
3.7 percent in 2011, heading for their weakest performance since
2008. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting economic
growth of 4 percent in 2012, unchanged from this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman forecast that gold will be at $1,930 an ounce in 12
months, compared with $1,776.90 by 6:28 a.m. in New York. Silver
will be 6.1 percent lower at $32.20 an ounce and wheat will fall
8.3 percent to $5.90 a bushel in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank, is preparing for a faster global economic
rebound than most forecasters expect, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that we can conclude that this slowdown is
secular rather than cyclical change,&#8221; Blankfein, 57, said today
at an investor conference in New York hosted by Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit. &#8220;The world will snap back and it
will be a surprise and it will be faster than people think. I
don&#8217;t know when that will be and we will gear ourselves
accordingly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which was the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history before converting to a bank in 2008,
last month reported its second quarterly loss in 12 years as a
publicly traded company. The stock dropped 41 percent this year
through yesterday to $99.29, below the company&#8217;s $120.41
tangible book value per share at the end of September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, while noting that the firm is cutting costs and
adapting to changing regulation and slower economic growth, said
he is wary of overreacting by assuming the world has permanently
changed. He reminded investors that Goldman Sachs reported
record earnings in 2009 following a quarterly loss in 2008, in
part because competitors pulled away from making markets for
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re managing our costs, obviously, but we&#8217;re not
thinking necessarily that there&#8217;s such a radical, structural
change,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to be in shape for the upturn.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volcker Rule &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said he expects Goldman Sachs&#8217;s clients and other
&#8220;end-users&#8221; of investment-banking services to inform
regulators of their concerns about the Volcker rule, which
limits banks from trading on their own behalf and from investing
in private-equity and hedge funds. Clients are concerned the
regulations could reduce market liquidity and make trading more
expensive, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As people weigh the costs to themselves, I think the
intensity will rise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think user groups will chime
in and make their interests known. In fact I&#8217;m sure of it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People familiar with the situation said last week that
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were considering holding some
of the loan promises they make to clients at the original cost
instead of at the market cost. Asked to comment on a newspaper
report on the deliberations, Blankfein reiterated the firm&#8217;s
belief in the importance of mark-to-market accounting. He said
the firm had had a debate on how to mark unfunded loan
commitments to market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark to Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From time to time we evaluate how we are marking certain
kinds of things,&#8221; Blankfein added. &#8220;Somebody picked up on
something, eavesdropped on a partial conversation or something
and were, I guess, tapping into a conversation we were having
specifically about how -- how, not will -- how you mark unfunded
commitments that tend not to be drawn down just when they&#8217;re in
the money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein has spoken at the annual Bank of America Merrill
Lynch Banking and Financial Services Conference every year
beginning in 2006, when he was named chairman and CEO. Guy Moszkowski, the Bank of America analyst who covers Goldman
Sachs, cut his recommendation on the stock to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;buy&#8221; in March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tudor Investment Corp., the hedge
fund founded by Paul Tudor Jones, cut its stakes in Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) in the third quarter, while
purchasing options that will pay off if an index tracking U.S.
technology companies declines in value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tudor sold 1 million shares of Microsoft to reduce its
stake to 160,300 shares valued at $3.99 million in the three
months ended Sept. 30, according to a filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Tudor, based in Greenwich,
Connecticut, reduced its Apple holdings by 78 percent to 5,600
shares and cut shares of Google by 38 percent to 33,711 shares,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options traders have become the most bearish on technology
companies since May 2010 amid concern the global economy is
slowing and that floods in Thailand will disrupt supplies ahead
of the holiday shopping season. Three-month puts to sell the
Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund cost 11.29 points more than
calls to buy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter, Tudor bought put options tied to 12.3
million shares of the Powershares QQQ Nasdaq 100, according to
the SEC filing. The notional value of the trade is $643 million,
according to the filing. The Powershares QQQ is an exchange-
traded fund designed to track the performance of the 100 largest
companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, the world&#8217;s largest technology company by market
value, fell 3.9 percent last week on investor concerns that
demand for iPads and iPhones is slowing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, who bought a
railroad in his biggest acquisition, turned to a century-old
technology company in the third quarter to help guard his
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) against economic slumps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett spent more than $10 billion buying International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) stock, his biggest investment in the
period. The stake gives Berkshire 5.5 percent of a company that
has moved from competition with Apple Inc. and Dell Inc. to
focus on providing business clients with software and services.
IBM sold its personal-computer business in 2005 and has beaten
the Dow Jones Industrial Average each year since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM has a very resilient strategy and is well-enough
diversified to perform regardless of the backdrop,&#8221; said Brad Zelnick, an analyst with Macquarie Capital USA in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, 81, has built Berkshire to withstand recessions
and market declines by seeking firms with lasting competitive
advantages, or what he calls &#8220;moats.&#8221; Berkshire&#8217;s Burlington
Northern Santa Fe railroad, bought in 2010 for $26.5 billion,
has a network of 32,000 miles that clients rely on in good
markets and bad. The company&#8217;s Geico car-insurance unit invests
in its brand to help withstand competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;His investment style has always been to minimize the
downside,&#8221; said Meyer Shields, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus
 Co. The IBM stake &#8220;is very consistent&#8221; with that approach,
said Shields, who has a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on Berkshire shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock Performance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM was little changed yesterday and has advanced about 28
percent this year, the biggest gain in the Dow average.
Berkshire, which isn&#8217;t part of the index, has slipped 5.4
percent since Dec. 31. In 2008, the Dow average slid 34 percent,
while Armonk, New York-based IBM declined 22 percent and Omaha,
Nebraska-based Berkshire fell 32 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our defense has been better than our offense,&#8221; Buffett,
Berkshire&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, said last year
in his annual letter to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett&#8217;s firm also took stakes in CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS),
Intel Corp. (INTC), Visa Inc. (V), DirecTV (DTV) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD),
Berkshire said yesterday in a filing listing U.S. equity
holdings as of Sept. 30. The IBM stake of about 64 million
shares was disclosed by Buffett earlier in an interview on CNBC.
Berkshire&#8217;s other new stakes were valued at between $174 million
and $200 million each as of Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IBM holding is Berkshire&#8217;s second-largest by market
value behind a Coca-Cola Co. (KO) stake of $13.6 billion as of
yesterday. Buffett spent about $1.3 billion building the Coca-
Cola stake in the 1980s and early 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett&#8217;s stake in Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) had a cost of about $8
billion, according to Berkshire&#8217;s 2010 annual report. The IBM
stake was valued at about $12 billion yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They do have some of the characteristics Buffett likes,&#8221;
Tom Lewandowski, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co., said of
IBM. &#8220;But a little out of character in the fact that it is
technology and he has generally had an aversion to that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM may benefit in a downturn from increased business with
clients that turn to the company for services to help reduce
costs, said David Rolfe, chief investment officer of Berkshire
investor Wedgewood Partners Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a recession, businesses are cutting their budgets and
they&#8217;re looking to optimize sourcing things,&#8221; Rolfe said.
&#8220;That lends that stickiness if you will of business services in
a downturn.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, which reported $16 billion of losses in the early
1990s, had an increase in per-share profit for more than 25
straight quarters as CEO Sam Palmisano transformed the company
and repurchased stock. IBM sold its PC unit, which Palmisano
called &#8220;commoditized,&#8221; to Lenovo Group Ltd. in 2005. The
company has spent more than $25 billion in its remaining
businesses to become the biggest computer-services provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM is the technology company with the least amount of
technology risk,&#8221; Zelnick said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A benchmark gauge of U.S. credit-
default swaps rose to the highest level in five weeks as Fitch
Ratings said further contagion from Europe&#8217;s debt crisis would
pose a risk to American banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, added 2.3 basis points to a mid-
price of 134.6 basis points at 5:01 p.m. in New York, the
highest level since Oct. 11, according to index administrator
Markit Group Ltd. Credit default swaps on U.S. banks rose, led
by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders pushed the swaps index higher for a third day as
Fitch said that while U.S. lenders have &#8220;manageable direct
exposures&#8221; to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain,
further turmoil poses a &#8220;serious risk&#8221; to U.S. banks&#8217;
creditworthiness. The credit gauge has climbed from a two-month
low of 113.4 basis points on Oct. 27 even as economic data
signals the U.S. economy may avoid recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market remains pretty fixated on Europe and all the
ups and downs from policy makers,&#8221; George Bory, chief corporate
credit strategist for UBS AG, said in a telephone interview from
London. &#8220;The renewed weakness in bond markets has put a little
bit more pressure on credit markets overall, which really limits
the ability for people to take risk going into the end of the
year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on Morgan Stanley increased 24.6 basis points to
459.6 basis points, while those on Goldman Sachs added 18 to
367.9, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. Bank of America Corp. added 17.8
basis points to 402.8, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has increased
even as some U.S. economic reports have signaled consumers are
spending at a faster rate than analysts expected. U.S. retail
sales rose 0.5 percent in October, according to Commerce
Department figures yesterday, exceeding the median forecast of
81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News for a rise of 0.3
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Domestic economic data has continued to improve over the
period, providing a favorable fundamental backdrop,&#8221; Anthony Valeri, a market strategist with LPL Financial in San Diego,
which oversees $330 billion, said in a note to clients.
&#8220;European headlines are likely to keep prices volatile over the
near term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on Lowe&#8217;s Cos. climbed as it sold $1 billion of
debt a day after its credit grade was lowered by Standard 
Poor&#8217;s. The second-largest U.S. home-improvement retailer sold
10- and 30-year bonds with proceeds to be used for stock
buybacks, capital expenditures, acquisitions or working capital,
according to a regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on the Mooresville, North Carolina-
based company climbed 3.5 basis points to 106.8 basis points,
according to CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

a bacterial infection that causes pneumonia won the backing of a
U.S. advisory panel today for use in adults 50 and older, a
population that may add almost $2 billion to sales in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration at a meeting
today in Silver Spring, Maryland voted 14-1 that the shot was
safe and effective for adults in producing an immune response
against the pneumococcal bacteria. The FDA doesn&#8217;t have to
follow the panel&#8217;s recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA is expected to decide on approval of Prevnar 13 in
adults 50 and older by Jan. 2. The agency is weighing approval
on the condition that Pfizer studies the vaccine further to
prove it protects against pneumococcal pneumonia. Pfizer started
an 85,000-subject trial in the Netherlands to confirm the
vaccine&#8217;s effectiveness in staving off the infection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very optimistic that this trial is going to show
the data that you want to see,&#8221; Marion Gruber, the FDA&#8217;s acting
director of vaccine research and review, said during the panel
meeting. She said the agency expects results from the study in
2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevnar 13, approved in the U.S. last year for children six
weeks to 5 years old, generated $2.82 billion the first nine
months of 2011, according to the New York-based drugmaker&#8217;s
regulatory filings. The vaccine may generate $5.9 billion by
2015, with adult use contributing $1.8 billion, said Catherine Arnold, an analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG in New York, in
an Oct. 21 investment note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff Report &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An FDA staff report released Nov. 14 determined the vaccine
was safe and effective in adults who received Merck  Co.&#8217;s
older vaccine approved almost 30 years ago and in those never
immunized. The report found no major side effects, though
limitations included the size of the safety database, which may
be too small to detect some rare adverse events, the report
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDA considers the protection of adults from pneumococcal
pneumonia a &#8220;meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing
treatments,&#8221; according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pneumococcal pneumonia accounts for 175,000
hospitalizations each year in the U.S. and more than 6,000
deaths, according to the National Foundation for Infectious
Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck&#8217;s Pneumovax &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer conducted clinical studies that showed the vaccine
likely will be associated with better protection than Whitehouse
Station, New Jersey-based Merck&#8217;s Pneumovax 23 against
pneumococcal pneumonia, Emilio Emini, Pfizer&#8217;s chief scientific
officer for vaccine research, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer hasn&#8217;t determined how long the shot will last and is
studying a five-year duration as part of the Netherlands trial,
said Peter Paradiso, of Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine development unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck&#8217;s Pneumovax 23 brought in $276 million in sales in
the first nine months of this year, according to company
filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance coverage for Prevnar 13 will depend on whether
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s vaccines panel
recommends Prevnar 13 for those 50 and older. The 2010 health
law requires coverage of vaccines recommended by the panel
without a co-payment or deductible cost to patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck&#8217;s vaccine is recommended for people ages 65 and older
and for people 2 years and older at high risk for pneumonia,
such as those with sickle cell disease, HIV infection and other
conditions that compromise the immune system, according to the
CDC. It is also recommended for adults 19 to 64 years old who
smoke, have asthma or live in nursing homes or long-term care
facilities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multinational companies including
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL) are urging Congress to make
passing a measure to allow a tax break on their offshore profits
a greater priority than a comprehensive tax-code overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to boost the economy by encouraging
repatriation of more than $1 trillion in earnings held by U.S.
corporations overseas should, in the short run, trump the longer
process of revamping the tax code, the WIN America Coalition
said in a letter congressional leaders released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we support congressional efforts to enact
comprehensive tax reform that makes our domestic tax code more
efficient for U.S. companies to compete in the growing global
market, we believe in the short term, Congress has an enormous
opportunity to immediately inject significant private-sector
investment into the U.S. economy,&#8221; said the letter, signed by
Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, Oracle Co-
President Safra Catz, and the CEOs of 13 other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter called on Congress to authorize the return of
overseas income at &#8220;a more efficient tax rate than is currently
available.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document didn&#8217;t specify a tax rate the companies were
seeking. Several pieces of repatriation legislation propose
allowing companies to return offshore profits at 5.25 percent,
the same rate in effect during a so-called tax holiday on
foreign income in 2004. The top corporate tax rate is currently
35 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2004 Holiday &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opponents of a tax holiday, including Democratic Senator
Carl Levin of Michigan, have complained that companies used
revenue from the 2004 tax holiday to buy back stock and then cut
jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the current U.S. worldwide tax system, multinational
companies with headquarters in the U.S. owe taxes on profits
they earn outside of the country. They get tax credits for
payments to other governments and can defer the residual U.S.
tax until they bring the money home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp has
proposed shifting to a so-called territorial system, which would
shield 95 percent of corporate profits earned offshore from U.S.
taxation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WIN America coalition has been lobbying Congress for
the tax holiday for months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration has said that a tax holiday should
be considered in the context of a broader tax overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The congressional supercommittee is considering changes to
the tax code as it considers fashioning the framework of debt-
cutting plan by a Nov. 23 deadline. Failure to enact a debt-
reduction plan this year would trigger $1.2 trillion in
automatic spending cuts beginning in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is preparing to
halt units at its Antwerp oil refinery in Belgium on Nov. 18,
Johan Scharpe, a company spokesman, said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery will be fully shut by Nov. 23, the date
workers plan to strike, he said today. The plant has a crude
processing capacity of about 307,000 barrels a day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulators should consider allowing
smaller companies to pay broker-dealers to make markets in their
shares as a way to spur trading and encourage initial offerings,
NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) executives said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a change in regulations would increase the ability of
investors to buy and sell stock by boosting market makers&#8217;
economic incentives, Joseph Mecane, co-head of U.S. listings and
cash execution at NYSE Euronext, said at a subcommittee meeting
of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees almost
4,500 brokers, banned the practice in 1997, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. policy makers, regulators and exchanges are seeking
ways to improve trading in smaller companies in order to
encourage more of them to go public. Rules adopted in the last
decade have driven up costs for companies that want to sell
shares and shifted trading incentives toward higher-
capitalization stocks, according to a report last month by the
IPO Task Force, a group of private securities professionals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE Arca, a venue run by NYSE Euronext (NYX), will propose rules
to the Securities and Exchange Commission for a pilot program in
which issuers pay market makers to supply liquidity in exchange-
traded funds, Mecane said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq OMX also plans to propose liquidity payment programs
by issuers in its new BX Venture Market, which caters to smaller
companies, and for &#8220;less-followed ETFs,&#8221; Eric Noll, executive
vice president for transaction services, said yesterday. The ETF
proposal will be sent to the SEC this week and the BX Venture
proposal by the end of the year, Noll said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Proposes Tougher Regulation on Credit-Ratings Companies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union proposed tougher regulations to rein in
credit-ratings companies while opting to postpone plans to ban
credit ratings on countries negotiating international bailouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Financial Services Commissioner Michel Barnier said
yesterday&#8217;s proposals would force companies to rotate credit
ratings firms they use to bolster competition. He said more work
was needed on plans to ban some sovereign ratings as well as
temporarily prohibit mergers and acquisitions by the largest
ratings firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnier said in a statement yesterday that credit rating
agencies should follow stricter rules and be more transparent
about their ratings &#8220;and be held accountable&#8221; for mistakes. He
wants to see &#8220;increased competition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the price and accuracy of credit ratings would
improve with greater competition among providers, the U.K.&#8217;s
Financial Services Authority said in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Regulator Aims for November Deadline on Capital Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Banking Authority will publish additional data
on how much capital banks need to raise by the end of November,
the watchdog&#8217;s chairman said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EBA is &#8220;collecting the information from the
supervisors and the September data and we are now putting
together all this information,&#8221; Andrea Enria, EBA chairman,
told reporters in Frankfurt. The regulator will also give
clarity on the use of so-called contingent-capital in reaching
capital targets, Enria said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s banks will need to raise 106 billion euros ($143
billion) in fresh capital under tougher rules being introduced
in response to the euro area&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis, the
European Banking Authority said last month. The extra reserves
are needed to meet a temporary requirement for lenders to hold 9
percent in core reserves, after sovereign-debt writedowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported yesterday that banks would get the
information Nov. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chase Must Reimburse Customers $1.9 Million on Finra Order &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ordered
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to reimburse customers more than $1.9
million for losses incurred from recommending unsuitable
investments and fined the firm $1.7 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokers with Chase Investment Services Corp. made almost
260 unsuitable recommendations to customers to purchase unit
investment trusts with significant holdings in high-yield bonds,
resulting in losses of about $1.4 million. The firm&#8217;s brokers
also recommended the purchase of floating-rate loan funds, which
may be illiquid or subject to significant credit risk, to
conservative customers, resulting in losses of almost $500,000,
according to a statement yesterday by Finra, the Washington-
based self regulator for the securities industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan neither admitted to nor denied the charges,
according to the release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelle Ong, a Finra spokeswoman, declined to comment
beyond the release. Tom Kelly, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment on the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. SFO Said to Start Probe of Japan&#8217;s Olympus Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. prosecutors are opening a formal investigation into
Olympus Corp. after the company said it hid losses from
investors, a person familiar with the probe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s Serious Fraud Office, which prosecutes white-
collar crime, is working with the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Department of Justice, according to the
person, who declined to be identified because they weren&#8217;t
authorized to speak about the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm Quizzed Again by EU Regulators Over Antitrust Complaint &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), the biggest maker of chips for mobile
phones, was asked for information by European Union regulators
investigating an antitrust complaint, two years after the EU
dropped an investigation of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission asked Qualcomm last month to supply
&#8220;additional documents and information&#8221; related to a complaint
filed last year by Icera Inc., a maker of wireless chips, the
company said in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Diego-based Qualcomm said in the filing that it
continues to &#8220;cooperate fully with the commission&#8217;s preliminary
investigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), a maker of graphics chips, earlier this year
bought closely held Icera for $367 million to add radio
processors needed in phones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia declined to immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Banks Threaten to Review Hungarian Units on Loan Law &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven western European banks active in Hungary told the
European Union that they&#8217;ll review the viability of their units
because of losses imposed by the government, according to two
people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter dated yesterday to Michel Barnier, the EU&#8217;s
financial services commissioner, banks headquartered in Austria,
Italy, Belgium and Germany urged the European Commission to
&#8220;take urgent and immediate action&#8221; against Hungary&#8217;s law
forcing them to take losses on foreign-currency mortgages,
according to the two people, who have seen the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was signed by the chief executive officers of UniCredit
SpA (UCG), Erste Group Bank AG (EBS), Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) and
its parent RZB, KBC Groep NV (KBC), Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) and
Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS) as well as the chief financial
officer of Bayerische Landesbank, according to the people, who
declined to be identified because the letter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter pointed out the &#8220;potential losses imposed by
the Hungarian government&#8221; on the banks&#8217; Hungarian units, noting
that the resulting stress &#8220;contributes to the current
instability of the European banking market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-CEO Agrees to Return $2.8 Million in SEC Clawback Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former chief executive officer will return $2.8 million
in bonus pay and stock profits to resolve U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission claims stemming from a clawback provision in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maynard L. Jenkins, who ran CSK Auto Corp. from 1997 to
2007, was subjected to sanctions even though he wasn&#8217;t
personally accused of wrongdoing when the agency sued the
company for filing false financial statements from 2002 to 2004,
the SEC said yesterday in a statement. The case marks the SEC&#8217;s
first clawback against an individual who wasn&#8217;t alleged to have
otherwise violated the securities laws, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;CEOs should know that they can be deprived of bonuses or
stock profits they received while accounting fraud was occurring
on their watch,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami said
in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarbanes-Oxley, enacted in 2002 to combat corporate fraud
after accounting scandals at Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc.,
gives the SEC authority to seize payouts to CEOs and chief
financial officers at companies that restate earnings &#8220;as a
result of misconduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC previously sued four former CSK Auto executives for
accounting fraud, and separately charged the company for filing
false statements, the agency said. The Justice Department
brought a criminal indictment against the same executives, who
pleaded guilty to various charges. CSK agreed to pay a $20.9
million penalty under a non-prosecution agreement with the
Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement calling for Jenkins to return the money to
O&#8217;Reilly Automotive Inc. (ORLY), which acquired CSK in 2008, is subject
to court approval, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC makes no allegation of wrongdoing by Mr. Jenkins
and concedes he had no involvement in or knowledge of the
wrongdoing of others at the company,&#8221; John Spiegel, a Munger,
Tolles  Olson LLP law partner who represented Jenkins, said in
an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR Block Antitrust Loss Is Win for U.S. Ahead of ATT Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR Block Inc. (HRB)&#8217;s decision to abandon its acquisition of the
maker of TaxAct products is a victory for the U.S. Justice
Department as it prepares for a trial to stop ATT Inc. (T)&#8217;s
purchase of T-Mobile USA Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR Block, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said yesterday it ended its proposed $287.5 million
purchase of closely held 2SS Holdings Inc. The decision followed
U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell&#8217;s Oct. 31 ruling that the
merger violates antitrust laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a complete victory for the Justice Department and
one that ATT has to notice,&#8221; said Jeffrey S. Jacobovitz, an
antitrust litigator with McCarthy, Sweeney  Harkaway PC in
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said company documents, testimony and other
evidence showed that TaxAct&#8217;s competition &#8220;constrained&#8221; HR
Block&#8217;s prices, and combining the companies would probably cause
prices to rise &#8220;to the detriment of the American taxpayer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HR Block case marked the first time in seven years the
Justice Department has gone to trial since failing in 2004 to
stop Oracle Corp. (ORCL)&#8217;s $8.4 billion purchase of PeopleSoft Inc.,
according to department data. The government&#8217;s case against ATT
is scheduled for a trial of four to six weeks beginning Feb. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company doesn&#8217;t expect any termination penalties, it
said in the SEC filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wayne Watts, ATT&#8217;s general counsel, said in a statement
that the HR Block case &#8220;has nothing in common&#8221; with ATT&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It involves a different industry, a different market, and
a different competitive landscape,&#8221; Watts said. &#8220;The hyper-
competitive wireless industry and the enormous network
efficiencies and consumer benefits that result from our merger
distinguish our case from any other.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HR Block case is U.S. v. HR Block, 1:11-cv-00948, and
the ATT case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glencore Awaits Antitrust Approval Before Optimum Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glencore International Plc, the world&#8217;s biggest publicly
traded commodities supplier, will wait for antitrust approval
for past transactions before making a mandatory offer for South
Africa&#8217;s Optimum Coal Holdings (OPT) Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimum, the country&#8217;s fourth-largest coal exporter, said
Glencore and businessman Cyril Ramaphosa will bid at least 38
rand a share to acquire the stake it doesn&#8217;t already own in the
company. The offer isn&#8217;t expected before the end of the first
quarter of 2012, Optimum said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investor group has also concluded a conditional
agreement to buy Mercuria Energy Asset Management BV&#8217;s shares,
Optimum said. Mercuria holds a 15 percent stake in Optimum and
has a marketing agreement with the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glencore Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg, who led
the company to a $10 billion initial public offering in May,
said in August the commodities trader is &#8220;aggressively&#8221;
seeking mergers and acquisitions as market valuations slide.
Buying Optimum would expand Glencore&#8217;s South African energy-coal
production. The assets include the country&#8217;s third-largest
opencast mine, bought from BHP Billiton Ltd. in June 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otkritie Says Banker Embezzled $18 Million &#8216;Golden Hellos&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otkritie Financial Corp., a Russian brokerage partly owned
by state-run VTB Group, said in a civil lawsuit that George
Urumov, a senior executive in its London office, embezzled at
least $17.8 million in signing bonuses meant for colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otkritie, based in Moscow, said it suffered a loss of at
least $23 million through the deception. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexey Karakhan, a Moscow-based spokesman for Otkritie,
said by mobile phone that Urumov had been suspended. Howard
Snell, head of Otkritie&#8217;s London office, declined to comment
when reached on his mobile phone. Urumov couldn&#8217;t be reached for
comment through Otkritie&#8217;s press office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Otkritie versus Urumov, High Court of Justice,

&lt;p&gt;Fed&#8217;s Fisher Says Regulators Should Break Up &#8216;Behemoth&#8217; Banks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher
said regulators should break up so-called too-big-to-fail
financial institutions to curtail the risk they pose to
financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Downsizing the behemoths over time into institutions that
can be prudently managed and regulated across borders is the
appropriate policy response,&#8221; Fisher said. He made the remarks
in the text of a speech given yesterday in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators in the U.S. and abroad have attempted to address
the risks posed by such systemically important financial
institutions, and if &#8220;properly implemented,&#8221; the Dodd-Frank
overhaul legislation &#8220;might assist in reining in the pernicious
threat to financial stability,&#8221; Fisher said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irish Central Bank Said to Approve Duffy as Allied Irish CEO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland&#8217;s central bank approved the appointment of David
Duffy as chief executive officer of government-owned Allied
Irish Banks Plc (ALBK), ending a year-long search, two people with
knowledge of the discussions said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duffy, 50, would be Allied Irish&#8217;s fourth leader in two
years after Eugene Sheehy stepped down in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allied Irish nominated the former executive at South
Africa&#8217;s Standard Bank Group Ltd. for the role last month,
subject to central bank and government approval, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the negotiations
are private. The appointment still needs government approval,
they said. Allied Irish, the nation&#8217;s second-biggest bank by

following the collapse of the country&#8217;s real-estate bubble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duffy didn&#8217;t immediately return an e-mail seeking comment.
Central Bank spokeswoman Nicola Faulkner, Finance Ministry

each declined to comment on the appointment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sunday Business Post identified Duffy as a potential

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Where&#8217;s My Water?,&#8221; the new
mobile game from Walt Disney Co. (DIS), stars Swampy, an alligator who
lives in an underground sewer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The googly eyed reptile likes to lounge around in his
subterranean bathtub while he scrubs his back with a brush.
Players swipe their fingers across an Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone screen
to guide water into his tub while dodging toxic sludge and
collecting rubber duckies as prizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the 99-cent application, also available for Apple&#8217;s
iPad tablet, the House of Mickey is attempting to do something
it has never done before: spin a multimillion-dollar franchise
out of a character that made his debut on a 3.5-inch screen,
Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its Nov. 21 issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the Swampy experiment is going swimmingly. Following
its Sept.&#160;22 release, &#8220;Where&#8217;s My Water?&#8221; quickly jumped to
the top of the Apple App Store&#8217;s paid applications chart,
displacing the record-setting &#8220;Angry Birds&#8221; game from the No.
1 spot for three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic behind Disney&#8217;s new release is simple. A movie
takes three to five years and hundreds of millions of dollars to
make, and as with &#8220;Mars Needs Moms,&#8221; Disney&#8217;s big theatrical
release this past spring, success is hardly guaranteed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;New Way&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of a mobile game runs in the hundreds of
thousands. It took a crew of seven people seven-and-a-half
months to produce &#8220;Where&#8217;s My Water?&#8221; If Swampy becomes a hit
with kids, a follow-up movie could have a ready base of fans
eager to buy tickets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a very, very cost-effective way to develop
characters,&#8221; said Tim Nollen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital
USA Inc. in New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s a new way of doing things.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 52&#160;percent of kids 8 and younger have used a mobile
device for games and other activities, according to a recent
survey of 1,384 parents by Common Sense Media Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new generation of Disney fans &#8220;is growing up, and this
is their main platform,&#8221; said Bart Decrem, senior vice
president and general manager of Disney Mobile, a 150-person
unit. &#8220;My gut feeling is, over the next few years, someone will
create a game with a billion gamers on it. We want to be that
company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney already has Swampy&#8217;s career plotted out. A 12-
episode animated series will air on Disney.com and on Google
Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s YouTube sometime in the first quarter of 2012, part of a
deal that will have the two companies spend as much as
$15&#160;million on co-branded content. A book and a movie featuring
the cute green gator could follow, Decrem says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Angry Birds&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company aims to replicate Rovio Entertainment Oy&#8217;s
success in catapulting &#8220;Angry Birds&#8221; into something beyond a
digital phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finnish gamemaker sells 1&#160;million plush toys a month --
along with T-shirts, school lunch boxes and other gear -- and
publishes a comic strip online. There are also plans for
educational books and a movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s no reason why Disney, with its amusement parks,
hundreds of stores and a cruise line, can&#8217;t do the same, said
Jack Kent, an analyst at researcher IHS Screen Digest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disney is one of the experts in merchandising,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney last year acquired social-gaming company Playdom
Inc. and mobile-games maker Tapulous Inc., where Decrem was
chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swampy&#8217;s Emotions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in this new medium required some adjustments for
Disney&#8217;s animators. Swampy had to be able to show emotions
within the constraints of a tiny phone screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company says it solved the problem by developing a
special technique that doesn&#8217;t require gamers to download large
files. It also has put more effort into character development
and storytelling than is typical for a mobile game -- an
investment it hopes will pay off as Swampy makes the progression
from mobile devices to streaming video, and perhaps eventually
the big screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is confident enough about its alligator&#8217;s ability to
navigate the digital shoals that it&#8217;s already considering two
more original characters for mobile gadgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to create new characters that are born and sized
for this platform,&#8221; said Decrem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CME Group Inc. (CME), the world&#8217;s largest
futures exchange that&#8217;s fallen more than 9 percent this week,
may face liability related to concerns it misled regulators over
what it knew about MF Global Holdings Ltd., according to Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;CME has been under pressure,&#8221; Daniel Harris, an analyst
at New York-based Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note to clients
yesterday. The concerns are &#8220;owing to worries it may face
liability over the timing of communications with the CFTC
following a discovery of a shortfall in MF Global&#8217;s segregated
client accounts,&#8221; he said, referring to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, the CME Group&#8217;s regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examiners from Chicago-based CME Group found unexplained
wire transfers at the broker-dealer unit of MF Global and a $900
million shortfall in client funds during the weekend the failing
broker was talking with possible buyers, a person briefed on the
matter said this week. CME, which oversees its futures-broker
members such as MF Global under its authority as a self-
regulatory organization, noticed the shortfall by Oct. 30, about
a day before the CFTC said they were told of the missing funds,
according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because the review isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CME Group &#8220;followed CFTC requirements and CME rules and
procedures in reviewing MF Global&#8217;s segregated funds statements
and coordinating that review with the CFTC,&#8221; the company said
in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Discussed the Shortfall&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange owner was told in the early hours of Oct. 31
&#8220;that there was an actual shortfall in the segregated funds
account and was told the CFTC was advised concurrently,&#8221;
according to the statement. &#8220;Shortly thereafter, CME Group
discussed the shortfall in a conference call with the CFTC and
other regulators.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CME Group fell $3.13, or 1.3 percent, to $238.05 as of 4
p.m. in New York, the lowest since Aug. 19. The shares have
declined for four days and are 26 percent lower this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global filed the eight-largest U.S. bankruptcy on Oct.
31 after a $6.3 billion bet on the bonds of some of Europe&#8217;s
most indebted nations prompted regulator concerns and credit
rating downgrades. The CFTC is investigating a $593 million-
shortfall in the segregated customer accounts at MF Global, a
person with knowledge of the regulatory probes said on Nov. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CFTC, a self-regulatory organization like
CME Group &#8220;must provide &#8216;immediate notification&#8216; when &#8216;a member
has failed to segregate or has misused customers&#8217; funds,&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;
according to Harris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;It is challenging to expect CME shares to recover near
term regardless of fundamental trends in the fourth quarter,&#8217;&#8217;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of oil that has leaked
into the ocean from a sea-floor fissure near a Chevron Corp. (CVX)
well in Brazil may be four times as large as previously
estimated, the country&#8217;s oil regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as 2,640 barrels have gushed into the sea during an
eight-day period, and oil continues to leak, the agency, known
as the ANP, said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, said Nov. 15 that
the oil slick caused by the spill was as much as 650 barrels. At
that time, the company said flows from the well appeared to have
ceased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has &#8220;substantially reduced&#8221; oil leaking from a
fissure after it began plugging an exploration well Nov. 15th at
the Frade offshore project, ANP said. The agency is
investigating the causes of the spill and is auditing safety
conditions at the project&#8217;s platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil may tighten environmental regulations as the country
plans to double oil output over the next decade, tapping fields
in the so-called pre-salt region of the Atlantic Ocean, Adriano Pires, head of the Brazilian Center for Infrastructure, said
today in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This could slow the expansion process if the government
implements more strict environmental regulations,&#8221; Pires said.
&#8220;This tells Brazilian society that the story about transforming
the pre-salt region isn&#8217;t that simple.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail and phone
call today seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production hasn&#8217;t been halted at Frade, located in deep
waters of the Campos Basin, according to Chevron. Oil was
leaking from fissures on the ocean floor near a well the company
was drilling and then plugged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened
after Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s 584,000-barrel-a-day Baytown refinery
in Texas isolated a pipe with a hole in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 1.95 cents to 5.8 cents a gallon below
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange in New York
at 12:37 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery fell 1.42 cents to $2.4154 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving, Texas-based Exxon found a hole in a pipe at the
Baytown refinery yesterday that resulted in emissions from a
gofiner unit, which removes sulfur from feedstock, according to
a filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
&#8220;The unit never came down so we are operational,&#8221; Neely
Nelson, a spokeswoman at the refinery, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Baytown has got to be the reason, or some other local
refinery glitch,&#8221; Phil Flynn, an analyst with PFGBest in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine any
other reason we&#8217;d be up because, if anything, we should be
lower.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same fuel in New York Harbor was unchanged at 2.75
cents above gasoline futures, and the fuel in Chicago was
unchanged at a discount of 11.63 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Midwest, or Group 3, narrowed for the first time in 13 days, by
1.38 cents to 3.25 cents below futures. The fuel touched the
lowest level since August yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) will charge
a lower co-pay for Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s cholesterol pill Lipitor than
it does for generic copies for the next six months, taking
advantage of a price reduction from the drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer by sales,
will pass on to customers savings it will receive when Pfizer
reduces the price of the drug after Lipitor loses patent
protection, Tyler Mason, a spokesman for Minnetonka,
Minnesota-based UnitedHealth, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move adds to agreements Pfizer has been making with
insurers and pharmacy benefit management companies to keep as
much of the market for the cholesterol drug as it can once the
drug&#8217;s U.S. patent ends at the end of this month. Lipitor,
Pfizer&#8217;s top-selling drug, generated $10.7 billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;UnitedHealthcare works diligently to keep down pharmacy
costs for members and customers by providing the lowest net
price, which is why we have placed Lipitor in the cheapest
tier,&#8221; Mason said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealthcare has 9.5 million individuals, according to
the company. After Nov. 30, the insurer&#8217;s customer will pay
about $30 to $35 for brand-name Lipitor, compared with $50 to
$60 for the generic, Mason said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, named the smallest group of new
managing directors since 2008 as the firm cuts jobs and grapples
with declining revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm appointed 261 people to managing director, the
company&#8217;s second-highest rank, according to an internal memo
obtained by Bloomberg News. The number is down 19 percent from
last year&#8217;s record list of 321 new managing directors and 
exceeds the 259 promotions in 2008. David Wells, a spokesman
for the New York-based company, didn&#8217;t reply to an e-mail and
two phone messages seeking confirmation of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, said this week that the firm is working to remain
positioned for a rebound even as it eliminates about 1,000 jobs
to contend with a drop in trading revenue. The company set aside
$10 billion for employees&#8217; salaries, bonuses and benefits in the
first nine months of this year, equivalent to $292,836 per
worker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The single most important thing we can do to enhance the
value of our business is to continue to hire the best and
brightest people from around the world,&#8221; Blankfein said on Nov.
15, at an investor conference in New York hosted by Bank of
America Corp. &#8220;And once they get into Goldman Sachs we want to
do everything we can to ensure that they have productive and
stimulating careers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company names managing directors annually and elects
employees to the firm&#8217;s partnership, the highest status, in
even-numbered years. Managing directors, though typically paid
more than junior employees, don&#8217;t share in the special bonus
pool reserved for the company&#8217;s partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is the list of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s &#8220;Managing
Director Class of 2011.&#8221; The employees listed have been invited
to become managing directors as of Jan. 1, 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said it is reducing the amount of oil
leaking from a project off the coast of Brazil after plugging
the source of the spill on Nov. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of oil leaking from fissures on the ocean floor
is less than the &#8220;hundreds of barrels&#8221; that gushed during the
first days after a drilling incident on Nov. 7, said George
Buck, the head of Chevron&#8217;s operations in Brazil. More than 10
barrels a day of &#8220;residual oil&#8221; in the rocks around the well
is still leaking, and the rate continues to decline, Buck said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The majority of this event has been over for several
days,&#8221; Buck told reporters in Rio de Janeiro. &#8220;We know we
stopped the flow at the reservoir.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign oil companies including Chevron, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) are waiting for Brazil to auction new
exploration areas in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Buck
said Chevron will study the spill to prevent similar incidents
in Brazil and other oil producing regions. Chevron is producing
about 80,000 barrels a day at the Frade project and didn&#8217;t halt
production during the spill, which was caused by an appraisal
well, Buck said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure Kick &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron underestimated the amount of pressure at a
reservoir at the project about 230 miles (370 kilometers)
northeast of Rio, Buck said. The well suffered a &#8220;kick&#8221; of
pressure when it reached the reservoir, causing oil to leak to
fissures on the ocean floor. Chevron cemented shut the section
of well above the reservoir and continues to work on sealing it,
Buck said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean Ltd. (RIG), the world&#8217;s biggest offshore-oil driller,
supplied Chevron with the Sedco 706 rig. The Vernier,
Switzerland-based company shut the well properly, Buck said.
Chevron &#8220;takes full responsibility&#8221; for the spill and is
cooperating with the Brazilian government to investigate the
causes, Buck said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buck declined to estimate the cleanup costs or potential
fines. Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator said Nov. 18 that as many as 2,640
barrels of oil spilled during the first eight days after the
incident. Buck said the regulator&#8217;s estimates are &#8220;a good
number.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transocean Ltd. (RIG), the operator of the
rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico and caused the worst
U.S. maritime spill, and Chevron Corp. (CVX) may be banned from deep-
water drilling in Brazil after an oil leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, which was fined 50 million reais ($28 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities, may lose the right to
develop deep-water fields there and be ordered to pay as much as
100 million reais to the regulator, Haroldo Lima, the head of
the agency, said. The regulator may also ban Transocean, Lima
said. Rio de Janeiro state may claim another 100 million reais
in damage, Rio Environment Secretary Carlos Minc said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we have reasons to do this, we will,&#8221; Lima told
reporters in Sao Paulo today, referring to a possible downgrade
of the &#8220;class A&#8221; status that allows Chevron to drill in deep
water. &#8220;It will depend on a detailed analysis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling at Chevron&#8217;s Frade project in the Campos Basin off
Rio&#8217;s coast triggered a leak of as much as 3,000 barrels in
eight days, Lima said. The spill followed a surge of pressure
from an oil reservoir on Nov. 7, George Buck, San Ramon,
California-based Chevron&#8217;s head of operations in Brazil, said in
Rio yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edited Images &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron edited video images that should have been made
available in their entirety to Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator ANP,
director Magda Chambriard said at a press conference in
Brasilia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company&#8217;s treatment of the regulatory agency and the
Brazilian government was unacceptable,&#8221; Chambriard said. &#8220;We
had to go aboard the platform to search for the original images
even after the company was notified to provide us with the
video.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean, which owned the rig involved in the 2010
blowout of BP Plc&#8217;s Macondo Well in the Gulf of Mexico, will be
banned from operating in Rio state, Minc said. More than 80
percent of Brazil&#8217;s crude is produced in Rio&#8217;s Campos Basin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Transocean continues to fully cooperate with Chevron, the
operator of the well, and Brazilian authorities in all aspects
of this matter,&#8221; Guy Cantwell, a Houston-based spokesman for
Transocean, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron may be fined by the oil regulator, known as ANP, as
early as today for inadequate equipment and withholding
information, Lima said. Each violation may cost the company 50
million reais, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron&#8217;s situation to obtain licenses to operate in
Brazil became more difficult after what happened,&#8221; Lima said in
Brasilia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has taken full responsibility for the spill and
brought it under control as fast as it could amid stormy weather
in the region, Buck said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The moment the seeps were first identified, we
immediately activated our emergency response plan and began
dispatching necessary resources to safely manage the
situation,&#8221; Lloyd Avram, a Chevron spokesman, said in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halted Flow &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has halted oil flow from the reservoir and
reduced the amount seeping from fissures in the ocean floor near
the drilling site, Buck said. Transocean wasn&#8217;t responsible for
the leak and acted quickly to help block it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is the third-largest oil producer in Brazil, behind
state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and Royal Dutch Shell
Plc. (RDSA) Frade was Brazil&#8217;s eighth most productive field in
September with 75,000 barrels a day of oil production, according
to the website of the country&#8217;s oil regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean has 10 rigs operating in Brazilian waters,
including the Petrobras 10000, a 2-year-old vessel designed to
drill seven miles beneath the sea surface and withstand 47-foot
waves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell 2 percent to $95.90 at 3:53 p.m. in New York.
Transocean dropped 3.6 percent to $45.75. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), operator of the $3.6
billion Frade oilfield off the Brazilian coast, said it hasn&#8217;t
received any notices of fines or other penalties from Brazil&#8217;s
government stemming from a subsea crude leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is investigating the cause of the leak from cracks
in the sea floor near an appraisal well, Scott Walker, a
spokesman for the San Ramon, California-based company, said
today in an e-mailed statement. The results of the probe will be
turned over to Brazilian authorities, he said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will be fined 50 million reais ($28 million) for
environmental violations associated with the leaks first spotted
about two weeks ago, Brazilian regulators said today. The
company may lose the right to drill in Brazil&#8217;s deep-water oil
region and could face another 100 million reais in fines,
Haroldo Lima, the head of the country&#8217;s oil agency, said today
during a meeting with reporters in Sao Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron may also be penalized for withholding information
from the government and editing video footage of the leaks
before turning it over, said Magda Chambriard, a director of
Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator, known as ANP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheen on the sea surface has been reduced to 18 barrels,
Walker said. Chevron estimated the entire volume of the leak at
2,400 barrels of oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are committed to deploying resources until the sheen
can no longer be detected,&#8221; the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean&#8217;s Role &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is the third-largest oil producer in Brazil, behind
state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Royal Dutch Shell
Plc. Frade was Brazil&#8217;s eighth most productive field in
September with 75,000 barrels a day of oil production, according
to the website of the country&#8217;s oil regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean Ltd. (RIG), owner of the rig under lease to Chevron at
the time of the leak, may also face a ban in water adjacent to
Rio de Janaeiro, Carlos Minc, environment secretary for Rio
state, said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean has 10 rigs operating in Brazilian waters,
including the Petrobras 10000, a 2-year-old vessel designed to
drill seven miles beneath the sea surface and withstand 47-foot

&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index may
fall to 1,100 if the U.S. debt-reduction supercommittee fails to
reach an agreement on budget cuts, according to Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.&#8217;s David Kostin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kostin, the New York-based strategist for Goldman, said in
a note dated Nov. 18 that lawmakers&#8217; failure to agree on at
least the minimum required savings would demonstrate &#8220;the
inability of elected officials to act in the long-term best
interests of all Americans&#8221; and may send the SP 500 down 9.5
percent from last week&#8217;s closing level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Democratic aide said the supercommittee will likely
announce today it was unable to reach an agreement on at least
$1.2 trillion in federal budget savings. The SP 500 fell 3.8
percent last week, its biggest drop since September, to 1,215.65
on Nov. 18. The benchmark measure for U.S. stocks slumped 1.9
percent to 1,192.98 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 may rally above 1,300 if the supercommittee
achieves an agreement of $3 trillion to $4 trillion in spending
cuts, Kostin said in the note. The index would remain in the
range of 1,200 to 1,250 in the more-likely scenario of officials
making agreements on the mandated $1.2 trillion, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kostin projects the benchmark equity index will close 2011
at 1,200, and that its companies will earn $96 a share for the
12-month period. The year-end estimate is 7.2 percent lower than
the average of the 12 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
gauge will climb to 1,300 in the next 12 months as profits
increase to $98 a share in 2012, according to his forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) pressed the Federal Reserve
earlier this month on the potential unintended consequences
stemming from its proposed ban on proprietary trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank lawyers H. Rodgin Cohen and Michael Wiseman from
Sullivan  Cromwell also attended the Nov. 8 meeting, according
to documents released by the Fed today. The firms discussed
&#8220;possible unintended consequences of the rule,&#8221; according to
the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal, which bans banks from investing more than 3
percent of their Tier 1 capital in private-equity or hedge
funds, will cost U.S. national banks about $1 billion in extra
regulatory and capital costs, according to a Sept. 7 analysis by
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers passed the Volcker rule last year as part of
the Dodd-Frank Act, aiming to curb risk-taking by bank holding
companies that receive federal assistance. Wall Street firms
have shut or spun off some funds that wager their capital in
advance of the rule, named after former Fed chairman Paul Volcker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John G. Smale, who led Procter 
Gamble Co. (PG), the world&#8217;s largest consumer-products maker, and
then became chairman of General Motors Corp., died on Nov. 19.
He was 84. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of death was complications from pulmonary
fibrosis, a type of lung disease, according to Paul Fox, a
Procter  Gamble spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smale served as PG&#8217;s chief executive officer from 1981 to
1990 in a career that spanned 43 years at the Cincinnati-based
company. Under his leadership, Procter  Gamble entered 23 new
countries, added 15 business categories, and doubled annual
sales, to $23.5 billion. Revenue was $82.6 billion in its latest
fiscal year, which ended in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;More than any other PG leader I know, John always tried
to make sure the longer-term health of the institution was taken
into consideration,&#8221; former Chairman and CEO A.G. Lafley said
in a statement sent by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That included an emphasis on research, and, according to
Smale, building an organization with strong values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All institutions, if they&#8217;re worth anything, have a
soul,&#8221; he said last November at the dedication of the John G.
Smale Auditorium at PG headquarters. &#8220;They have a character
that encourages people to really dedicate a working life to them
and to the fortunes of the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron said
bringing Britain&#8217;s debt under control is proving &#8220;harder than
anyone envisaged,&#8221; paving the way for the Office for Budget
Responsibility to downgrade its forecasts next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;High levels of public and private debt are proving to be
a drag on growth, which in turn makes it more difficult to deal
with those debts,&#8221; Cameron told business leaders in London
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne will present
updated economic and fiscal forecasts to Parliament on Nov. 29.
The OBR, which oversees forecasting for the Treasury, is likely
to cut its growth forecasts and say the budget deficit will be
higher than predicted at the time of the March budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fears about the immediate future are real,&#8221; Cameron told
the Confederation of British Industry annual conference.
&#8220;Paralysis in the euro zone is causing alarm in the markets and
having a chilling effect on economies in many countries,
including our own.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent forecasts published by the Treasury last week
showed the economy expanding by 1 percent this year and 1.2
percent in 2012, below the OBR&#8217;s predictions of 1.7 percent and
2.5 percent. The budget deficit was forecast to be 128 billion
pounds in the fiscal year through March, 6 billion pounds more
than predicted by the OBR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron has made his five-year plan to eliminate the bulk
of a deficit equal to 9 percent of gross domestic product the
centrepiece of his economic strategy, rebuffing criticism from
the opposition Labour Party that the cuts are hobbling growth.
The turmoil in the euro region underlined the need to stick to
the program, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People who argue that traditional fiscal stimulus, extra
spending funded by even more borrowing, is the right answer are
not just wrong, they are dangerously wrong,&#8221; Cameron said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seattle&#8217;s chief technology officer,
Bill Schrier, is bracing for a 6 percent budget cut in 2012,
bigger than this year&#8217;s, a sign of tighter spending that
indicates slower sales gains for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Intel Corp. (INTC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Spending is going to be down, and in some places it&#8217;s
going to be down considerably,&#8221; Schrier said of technology
spending by governments generally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schrier is likely to be told to cut even more next year, so
he&#8217;s delaying upgrades to Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 7, cutting
services contracts from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
and seeking cheaper alternatives to gear from Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belt-tightening in the biggest city in the Pacific
Northwest reflects a larger trend: Financial-services companies
such as Western  Southern Financial Group and governments,
including the state of California, will cut or leave spending on
information technology unchanged next year as economic growth
slows. That means some technology bellwethers, including Intel,
Microsoft, IBM and Cisco, may suffer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will be a tough environment just because there&#8217;s so
much pessimism out there,&#8221; said Richard Gordon, an analyst at
market research firm Gartner Inc. The industry will need to
prepare for &#8220;general downward pressure everywhere.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Gartner now expects information technology spending
among businesses to rise 3.9 percent next year, less than the
5.9 percent increase for 2011, the Stamford, Connecticut-based
research firm will probably cut that forecast at the end of the
quarter, Gordon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware May Benefit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some businesses that seek to stretch technology dollars may
step up spending on products that are designed to save money,
such as VMware Inc. (VMW)&#8217;s so-called virtualization software, which
helps clients make more efficient use of data centers. Other
companies that represent &#8220;areas of strength&#8221; include Citrix
Systems Inc. (CTXS) and SAP AG (SAP), according to Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology budgets will rise just 0.6 percent over the next
year, according to a September survey of U.S. and European CIOs
by UBS AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, sales growth will slow next year for companies
like Microsoft and IBM, which rely on government and financial-
services customers, said Gordon. Sales at Armonk, New York-based
IBM, the largest provider of technology services, will rise only
3 percent in 2012, less than half this year&#8217;s 7 percent pace,
according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, the largest
software maker, sales in fiscal 2012 will increase only 7
percent, compared with 12 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Real Risk&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue will climb 8 percent in fiscal 2012 at Oracle Corp. (ORCL),
the top seller of database software, compared with 33 percent
the prior year, while the rate of increase at Intel, the biggest
maker of computer chips, is projected to be 6 percent, a
fraction of this year&#8217;s estimated 26 percent, according to
Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlook for many executives dimmed in the second half
as Europe&#8217;s credit crisis spiraled, and more recently as
flooding in Thailand has threatened the supply of computer hard-
disk drives. Among corporate chief financial officers surveyed
by Duke University and CFO Magazine, 65 percent said they were
less optimistic about the U.S. economy in the third quarter than
they were in the second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a real risk, and it would be foolish to say
otherwise,&#8221; said Michael Holland, chairman of Holland  Co.,
which oversees about $4 billion, including shares of Microsoft,
Intel and IBM. &#8220;To be realistic is to expect things to be a
little less than the level that they were this year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero Spending Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation that technology stocks will decline has left
options traders at their most bearish since May 2010. Three-
month puts to sell the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) cost
10.44 points more than calls to buy, according to implied-
volatility data compiled by Bloomberg. The price relationship
known as skew increased 78 percent in the past four months and
reached 11.67 on Nov. 9, the widest in 17 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life insurer Western  Southern Financial Group is keeping
its technology budget flat next year after a 2 percent increase
this year, Chief Technology Officer Douglas Ross said. The
Cincinnati-based company is investing in virtualization software
from VMware so it can cut purchases of server computers from
Dell Inc. (DELL) and Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and storage products from EMC
Corp. and NetApp Inc. (NTAP), he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of scrutiny on whether the economy is
slowing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re certainly concerned about it. The
management team is really looking at every item to figure out
what we can dispense with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand from businesses this year was a bright spot for some
companies, including Microsoft and Intel, as consumers curtailed
spending on personal computers and other electronics. It won&#8217;t
provide as big a cushion in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thai Flooding Impact &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PC shipments will drop by as much as 13.4 percent in the
first quarter because of supply constraints and rising prices
related to flooding in Thailand, according to researcher IDC.
That&#8217;s down from a previous forecast for an 8.2 percent gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) will boost its technology
spending by 3.7 percent. While that&#8217;s about the same as last
year, it&#8217;s more modest than the bank&#8217;s historical increases,
which range from 4 percent to 6 percent, Chief Information
Officer John Fiore said. The bank is saving money by moving all
but the most complicated technology services to India, instead
of using vendors like IBM and Accenture Plc (ACN), he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the State of California hasn&#8217;t finished its budget,
Secretary of California Technology Carlos Ramos predicts another
year of cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insulated at Oracle &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth slowdown will hit some areas of technology
harder than others. Spending on technology services will rise
4.4 percent in 2012, compared with 7.3 percent growth this year,
according to Gartner. Spending on server computers will increase
5.8 percent, down from 11 percent this year, while software
spending will climb 7.4 percent next year, below this year&#8217;s 8.7
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that have a high percentage of recurring revenue
from maintenance contracts, such as CA Inc. (CA), or large cash piles,
including Microsoft and Redwood City, California-based Oracle,
have some insulation against sudden swings in customer spending,
said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies are increasing spending on areas that will
help them reduce expenses in the long run or reach new customers.
Equifax Inc. (EFX), the provider of consumer credit information, will
lift spending by 4 percent to 6 percent in 2012 after a 4
percent increase this year. The spending is aimed at helping the
company deliver on a pledge to investors that 10 percent of
sales will come from new products, CIO David Webb said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;After the Accident&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most companies today are totally dependent on technology
for growth and even if there is contraction in the general
market, to stay abreast of competition you have no choice but to
invest in technology,&#8221; Webb said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even companies that plan higher spending may favor modest
increases, said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Portland,
Oregon-based Becker Capital Management Inc., which oversees $2.2
billion in assets. Continued turmoil in Europe or in the broader
market may spook CEOs and CFOs who are still scarred from the
recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a world of driving after the car accident,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;After you get in an accident, you&#8217;re a little jumpy and
you go slower.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, said the war on drugs is stuck on a &#8220;stationary bike&#8221;
as demand persists despite efforts to crack down on traffickers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Drug trafficking continues feeding violence, which shows
the need for consumer nations to take more effective measures to
cut demand,&#8221; Santos said in a speech in London, according to a
statement on the presidential website. &#8220;We keep fighting drugs,
but the drugs keep flowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santos said he speaks with the &#8220;moral authority&#8221; of the
leader of a South American nation that has dismantled powerful
drug groups such as the Medellin and Cali cartels while reducing
cocaine output. His comments echo previous efforts, including
his suggestion that the world consider legalization, aimed at
opening a rethinking of U.S.-backed policies focused on
attacking output and not consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocaine cultivation in Colombia, which receives about $500
million a year in U.S. anti-narcotics aid, fell 37 percent since
2007 to 62,000 hectares in 2010, according to a UN report published
June 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under pressure by U.S.-backed eradication efforts,
cultivation has moved into neighboring Peru like air in a
balloon when it is squeezed, General Oscar Naranjo, head of
Colombia&#8217;s national police, told reporters in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.N. report found Colombia is now rivaled by Peru as
the world&#8217;s largest cocaine producer, each account for about 40
percent of world output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug organizations, such as the Sinaloa cartel and Zetas,
have emerged in Mexico as Colombian cartels declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-five thousand Mexicans have been killed  since 2006
and the drug war has cost the economy $120 billion in security
expenditures and lost investment, according to Bulltick Capital
Markets, a Miami-based investment firm that specializes in Latin
America. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) named John Skipper
president of ESPN, succeeding George Bodenheimer, who becomes
the profitable sports network&#8217;s executive chairman and gives up
oversight of day-to-day operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper, 55, previously executive vice president of
content, also becomes co-chairman of Disney Media Networks, the
Burbank, California-based entertainment and theme-park company
said today in a statement. The moves are effective Jan. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bodenheimer, 53, initiated the succession discussions this
year, Disney said. In his 13 years as president, ESPN has grown
to include eight U.S. television networks, five high-definition
services and a 3-D network. The sports network operates 48
international channels, 18 websites and has 750 radio
affiliates, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.9 percent to $34.02 at the close in New York
time. The stock has declined 9.3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media networks, led by cable outlets such as ESPN, are
Disney&#8217;s largest business, with pay-TV channels contributing a
third of the $10.4 billion of sales in the fourth quarter ended
Oct. 1. The cable networks produced 60 percent of Disney&#8217;s
operating profit of $2.11 billion. Hearst Corp. owns 20 percent
of ESPN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his new role, Bodenheimer will continue to serve as
chairman of ESPN&#8217;s board, provide strategic direction and
support a seamless transition, Disney said. Skipper has been
head of content since October 2005. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq has told Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) that
the U.S. company&#8217;s contracts with the Kurdistan Regional
Government to explore in northern Iraq are in violation of the
nation&#8217;s law, Deputy Prime Minister Hussain al-Shahristani said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon Mobil has written to the Iraqi government about
this and they have received the response from the ministry of
oil and the prime minister&#8217;s office that contracts will not be
recognized unless they are approved by the Iraqi government,&#8221;
Shahristani said today in London. &#8220;In this particular case,
there is a breach of laws and the Iraqi government is
considering its actions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting on Exxon&#8217;s contract for the West Qurna field,
signed with the central government in Baghdad, Shahristani said,
&#8220;There won&#8217;t be any discussion with other companies until a
decision is made.&#8221; Iraq expects to make a decision on Exxon&#8217;s
continued involvement by the end of the year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the contract there is a very clear article that the
company has to respect all the Iraqi laws, rules and
regulations,&#8221; he said when asked if contracts allow for one
company to be replaced with another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shahristani said he couldn&#8217;t predict when Iraq&#8217;s parliament
will pass the country&#8217;s oil law. The last amended version of the
bill was sent to the parliament more than a month ago, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advice to Wait &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that the
Obama administration had advised Exxon to wait before making any
commitments. &#8220;We have had conversations with Exxon for some
time, as we have had with all our friends, advising them to
wait,&#8221; Nuland said at a daily briefing in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration has cautioned companies about the risks
of investing in Iraq&#8217;s energy sector, she said. The department
has advised U.S. companies including Exxon that, if they want to
invest in the Iraqi energy sector, &#8220;they run significant
political and legal risks if they sign contracts&#8221; before an
agreement on distributing oil revenue is reached, Nuland said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has been urging Iraq to enact the necessary laws
for some time, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon spokesman Patrick McGinn said in an e-mail that the
company had no comment on the statements by Shahristani and
Nuland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPEC Quotas &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq will discuss production quotas with the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2014 and its limit will
depend on market conditions, Shahristani said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country is &#8220;preparing criteria to be used for
allocations for member countries,&#8221; he said in an interview at a
conference in London today. It will present these to the group
once Iraq&#8217;s output rises to about 4 million or 5 million barrels
a day, which is likely to be in 2014 or 2015, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s quota will depend on the development of capacity
among other OPEC members and global oil demand levels, he said.
Demand may be high enough that no formal limit is required,
Shahristani said. There is no reason why Iraq&#8217;s eventual quota
should be lower than that of any fellow members, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given Iraqi reserves and developing production capacity,
the economic need, the deprived opportunity in the past, the
financial surplus that some other member countries have, we
really don&#8217;t see why Iraq&#8217;s quota should be less than any other
country,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq plans to sign a contract with international companies
for the construction of a water injection plant soon,
Shahristani said. Exxon Mobil&#8217;s participation in this project,
and in an oil and gas field auction due to be held next year,
will depend on the outcome of the dispute over the company&#8217;s
involvement in Kurdistan, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chairman Bill Gates
faced more cross-examination on allegations that the world&#8217;s
largest software maker undermined Novell Inc.&#8217;s WordPerfect
program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell said in its 2004 complaint that Microsoft unfairly
restricted competition by using its monopoly on personal
computer operating systems to suppress a rival word-processing
program. Jeffrey Johnson, Novell&#8217;s lawyer, continued his
questioning of Gates, 56, today in federal court in Salt Lake
City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson began his cross-examination yesterday by asking
Gates about the U.S. government&#8217;s landmark antitrust case
against Microsoft that was settled more than eight years ago. In
that case, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft was declared an
illegal monopolist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates acknowledged &#8220;there was a lawsuit&#8221; and &#8220;findings&#8221;
concluding Microsoft engaged in anticompetitive conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates told Microsoft lawyer Steven Holley yesterday that he
&#8220;absolutely&#8221; denied the central allegation of Novell&#8217;s suit,
that in 1994, in developing the Windows 95 operating system,
Microsoft blocked an element of the software to thwart Novell&#8217;s
WordPerfect and Quattro Pro programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Pretty Irrelevant&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the elements restricted from the operating system may
have been useful to companies developing e-mail programs, they
were &#8220;pretty irrelevant&#8221; to word-processing, Gates testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson today showed the court an e-mail that Microsoft
lawyers had asked Gates about yesterday. The Oct. 3, 1994, e-
mail from Gates to Brad Silverberg, a Microsoft senior vice
president, and other employees concerned the &#8220;shell,&#8221; which
displayed file names in the Windows 95 operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message addressed Gates&#8217;s decision to restrict outside
programmers&#8217; access to &#8220;extensions,&#8221; or programming code, a
decision that Novell claims deliberately targeted WordPerfect
and made it impossible to run properly on Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have decided that we should not publish these
extensions,&#8221; Gates wrote in the message. &#8220;We should wait until
we have a way to do a high level of integration that will be
harder for likes of Notes, Wordperfect to achieve, and which
will give Office a real advantage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft lawyer Holley yesterday asked Gates if those
extensions were &#8220;crucial&#8221; to the development of WordPerfect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Absolutely Not&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Absolutely not,&#8221; Gates said. He also testified that he
restricted the extensions because they generated instability in
the Windows operating system, and could cause it to crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Aeschbacher, a lawyer for Microsoft, said in an
interview that Gates wanted to wait to add the extensions to a
future operating system Microsoft called &#8220;Cairo,&#8221; which
Microsoft never completed or shipped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell, which was bought by Seattle-based Attachmate Corp.
in April, has argued that WordPerfect&#8217;s share of the word-
processing market fell to less than 10 percent in 1996 from
almost 50 percent in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its value dropped from $1.2 billion in May 1994 to
$170 million in 1996, when it was sold to Ottawa-based Corel
Corp., said Novell. The company settled separate antitrust
claims against Microsoft for $536 million in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia,
revived the case, which had been dismissed by a lower court. The
appeals court ruled that Novell, which briefly owned WordPerfect
in the mid-1990s, didn&#8217;t cede its rights when it transferred
claims related to its personal-computer operating system
products to Caldera Inc. in 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court ruling sent the case back to U.S.
District Judge J. Frederick Motz in Baltimore, who had
originally rejected it. Motz is conducting the trial in Salt
Lake City, where the original lawsuit was filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Novell Inc. (NOVL) v. Microsoft Corp., 04-01045, U.S.
District Court, District of Utah (Salt Lake City). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) will be fined for
falsifying information to Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator on a spill in
deep waters off the coast of Rio de Janeiro and for failing to
meet a plan to counter the accident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of the fines for the two violations will be set
after the end of a probe into the leak, the regulator, known as
ANP, said in an e-mailed statement today. The environment agency,
which fined Chevron 50 million reais ($28 million) yesterday, and
the Brazilian Navy are also investigating the spill, ANP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leak, which started Nov. 7 in Chevron&#8217;s $3.6 billion
Frade project in the Campos Basin, may lead to tighter regulations
for oil producers, which could affect Brazil&#8217;s output target,
according to Erasto Almeida, a analyst at New York-based research
company Eurasia Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;More scrutiny could slow&#8221; production (PETR4) increases, although
it&#8217;s hard to asses by how much,&#8221; Almeida said in a phone
interview from New York today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras,
accounted for 90 percent of Brazilian oil output in September and
aims to more than double production to 6.4 million barrels a day
in 2020. The Rio de Janeiro-based company&#8217;s production rose 1.2
percent in the first nine months of this year, the slowest rate
since 2007, according to information on the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yen may rally through 70 per
dollar next year as global financial stability in the second
half damps investor appetite for the greenback, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s currency appreciated to 75.35 on Oct. 31, its
highest level since World War II. The yen will strengthen
further in the last six months of 2012 as the global economy
stabilizes, driving investors to shun the dollar in favor of
Japan&#8217;s currency, strategists led by Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan
rates and foreign-exchange research at JPMorgan in Tokyo, wrote
in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Risk sentiment will improve towards the second half of
2012 as the global economy recovers and the European fiscal
problem moves towards a resolution,&#8221; Sasaki wrote. &#8220;We expect
broad U.S. dollar weakness with an improvement in investors&#8217;
sentiment. In this setting, dollar-yen is likely to trend lower,
led by U.S. dollar weakness.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency pair will trade in a range in the first half
of the year as a recession in Europe and sluggish growth
elsewhere drive investors to buy the safest assets. The yen will
reach 72 per dollar during the year and may appreciate through
70, Sasaki wrote. He couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for comment
when contacted by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen dropped 0.1 percent to 76.96 per dollar at 1:40 New
York time. It has appreciated 5.3 percent so far this year in
the best performance against the greenback among the most-traded
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan Intervention &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors won&#8217;t be deterred by the prospect of Bank of
Japan intervention, Sasaki wrote. While the central bank has
sold yen in the foreign-exchange market to weaken the currency
four times in the past 14 months, the action will continue to be
sporadic and won&#8217;t take a permanent nature, according to Sasaki. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although we cannot rule out the possibility of
yen-selling intervention when the pace of decline in dollar-yen
is rapid, any intervention would probably be of only unilateral,
one-off nature,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Therefore, it is unlikely to have
a lasting impact on the underlying trend in yen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss National Bank imposed a ceiling on the franc at
1.20 per euro in September to curb the currency&#8217;s appreciation.
The Bank of Japan likely won&#8217;t engage in such action, according
to Sasaki. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, was sued for fraud by German lender
Bayerische Landesbank over losses on about $2.1 billion in
mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan units concealed the truth about the poor quality
of the loans underlying the securities and knew that credit
ratings misrepresented their risk, BayernLB said in a lawsuit
filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This misconduct has resulted in astounding rates of
default on the loans,&#8221; BayernLB said. Most of the securities
have been downgraded to junk, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender said it believed the mortgage securities were
safe investments based on representations about the quality of
loans and credit ratings when it invested almost $2.1 billion in
57 offerings from 2005 to 2007, according to the complaint. The
lawsuit names JPMorgan and other units of the New York-based
bank as defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bayerische Landesbank New York Branch v. Bear
Stearns  Co., 653239/2011, New York State Supreme Court, New
York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is nearing a
deal to acquire MF Global (MF) Holding Inc.&#8217;s stake in the London
Metal Exchange for about 25 million pounds ($39 million),
according to a person familiar with the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal values the exchange at about 530 million pounds,
the person said, declining to be identified because the talks
are private. An announcement may be made as soon as today, a
second person with knowledge of the deal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global filed for bankruptcy protection last month after
making bets that went bad on European sovereign debt. Its
British subsidiary, MF Global U.K. Ltd., one of 12 category 1
members of the LME that normally hold the right to trade on the
floor, was stopped from trading on the metals exchange on Oct.
31. The company&#8217;s special administrator in Britain, KPMG, has
been trying to sell the unit&#8217;s stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subsidiary owns 600,000 ordinary shares out of 12.9
million, a 4.7 percent stake, and 25,000 nonvoting B shares,
according to a U.K. Companies House filing on Oct. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has raised its holdings in the LME over the past
year. It owned 800,000 shares as of Oct. 24, compared with
550,000 shares a year earlier, according to filings with
Companies House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is also agent to a $1.2 billion loan to MF Global
Holdings, and was given a lien on all of the company&#8217;s available
assets as security for its loan by a New York bankruptcy court
judge. JPMorgan has also proposed letting MF Global use the only
cash collateral it has on hand, $26 million, to fund operations
while it winds down in bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LME, for its part, has been the object of takeover
interest. The exchange, which handles 80 percent of global trade
in metals futures, said in September it had received several
&#8220;expressions of interest.&#8221; A bid may be recommended to
shareholders as early as March, Martin Abbott, chief executive
officer of the exchange, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of JPMorgan and KPMG declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) bankers
accused of helping Americans cheat on taxes plan to ask the
Justice Department to dismiss their indictment amid talks to
resolve a U.S.-Swiss dispute over tax evasion and a probe of the
bank, according to five people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven current and former Credit Suisse bankers in
Switzerland were indicted July 21 in Alexandria, Virginia, on
one charge each of conspiring to defraud the U.S. The bank also
has said it is a target of a criminal investigation by the U.S.
Justice Department, and that it is cooperating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for six of the bankers and a Swiss trust company
owner charged with helping them wrote to Deputy U.S. Attorney
General James Cole Nov. 8 to say they wanted to resolve their
case as part of a U.S. settlement with the Swiss government, and
any accord between the Justice Department and Credit Suisse, the
people said. Lawyers for the seven defendants, who have yet to
appear in a U.S. court, asked Cole for a meeting, according to
the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I kind of doubt the Justice Department&#8217;s tax division
would be willing to walk away from this indictment and dismiss
it,&#8221; Larry Campagna, a tax attorney who isn&#8217;t involved in the
case, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;After convicting other
bankers and taxpayers, giving a pass to these people is somewhat
unlikely.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;But if I were representing them,&#8221; the lawyer added,
&#8220;I&#8217;d probably do the same thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Miller, a Justice Department spokesman, and David
Walker, a spokesman for Zurich-based Credit Suisse, declined to
comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants include Markus Walder, the former head of
North America offshore banking at Credit Suisse; Marco Parenti
Adami, a senior manager and private banker; and Susanne D. Ruegg
Meier, also a senior manager and private banker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Credit Suisse is committed to a fully compliant cross-
border business,&#8221; the bank said after the indictment. &#8220;Subject
to our Swiss legal obligations and throughout this process we
will continue to cooperate with the U.S. authorities in an
effort to resolve these matters.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Adami, 11-cr-00095, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N.Y., Delaware Can Intervene in BofA $8.5 Billion Accord &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York and Delaware attorneys general may participate
in litigation over Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s proposed $8.5 billion
settlement with mortgage investors, a federal judge ruled,
rejecting arguments by Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), trustee
for the mortgage bond trusts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan, who is
overseeing the case, approved requests to intervene by New York
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Delaware Attorney General
Beau Biden, according to an order filed Nov. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This action concerns far more than the financial
interests of a few sophisticated investors,&#8221; the judge wrote.
&#8220;And the intervention of the state AGs in this action will
protect the interests of absent investors.&#8221; Bank of New York
had argued Biden didn&#8217;t have a right to intervene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America has agreed to settle with investors in
Countrywide Financial Corp. mortgage-backed securities. The deal
was reached with an institutional investor group that includes
BlackRock Inc. and would apply to investors outside that group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-cv-05988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayer May Have Pitched Birth-Control Pill for Unapproved Use &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Units of Bayer AG, Germany&#8217;s largest drugmaker, may have
sought to market the Yasmin family of birth-control pills for
unapproved uses and misled women about the health risks the drug
posed, according to company e-mails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer unit officials discussed promoting the contraceptive
known as Yaz, a spinoff of Yasmin, for treatment of all types of
premenstrual syndrome, according to company files provided to
lawyers for women suing Bayer. U.S. regulators approved Yaz only
for the most severe form of PMS. Salespeople for Bayer unit
Berlex Laboratories Inc., acquired in the 2006 purchase of
Schering AG, received an e-mail that year from a company
official citing a Woman&#8217;s Day magazine article about Yaz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This article is a nice way of using YAZ for PMS treatment
instead of just focusing on the specific&#8221; class of women
battling premenstrual dysphoric disorder, the most severe form
of PMS, wrote Matt Sample, a Berlex sales consultant, according
to a copy of the e-mail produced as evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message and other internal company files were disclosed
as part of litigation claiming the drug caused blood clots,
heart attacks and strokes. Bayer faces more than 10,000 lawsuits
over injuries allegedly caused by the contraceptives. Lawyers
suing the drugmaker cited Food and Drug Administration reports
of at least 50 deaths tied to the pills from 2004 to 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bayer&#8217;s oral contraceptives have been and continue to be
extensively studied worldwide and are safe and effective when
used as directed and according to product labeling,&#8221; said Rose
Talarico, a U.S.-based spokeswoman for the company, in an e-
mail. She declined to comment further on the litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Yasmin and Yaz (Drospirenone) Marketing,
Sales Practices and Product Liability Litigation, 09-md-02100,
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois (East
St. Louis). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg&#8217;s Starr Sues U.S. for $25 Billion on AIG Bailout &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr International Co. accused the U.S. government in a
lawsuit of using the bailout of American International Group
Inc. (AIG) to give funds to AIG&#8217;s trading partners in violation of the
Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr, which was a major AIG shareholder and is headed by
the insurer&#8217;s founder, Hank Greenberg, claims the government
&#8220;destroyed the value of common stock&#8221; and took AIG&#8217;s property
without due process, according to a suit filed yesterday in the
U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington. Starr seeks $25
billion in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After obtaining control of AIG, the government used AIG
as a vehicle to funnel funds to other institutions and to
provide &#8216;back-door bailouts&#8217; on disparate terms far more
favorable to those institutions, including foreign companies,&#8221;
Starr alleges in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Massad, Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability at
the U.S. Department of the Treasury, said in an e-mailed that it
was reviewing the lawsuit and expects to defend its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is important to remember that the government provided
assistance to AIG -- and stopped it from collapsing -- in order
to prevent a meltdown of the entire global financial system,&#8221;
Massad said. &#8220;Our actions were necessary, legal, and
constitutional.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leilani Brown, a spokeswoman for Starr, didn&#8217;t return calls
seeking comment on the filing. Mark Herr, a spokesman for AIG,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Starr International Co. v. U.S., 11-779, U.S.
Court of Federal Claims (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corn-Syrup Makers Misleading Consumers, Sugar Refiners Say &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) and other high-fructose corn
syrup producers are misleading consumers about the true nature
of their product, a coalition of sugar processors and refiners
claimed in a revised lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corn-syrup producers are falsely marketing their
product as &#8220;corn sugar&#8221; in an advertising campaign to make it
more palatable to consumers, according to a Nov. 18 filing in
federal court in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The only sweetener that may be labeled simply as &#8216;sugar&#8217;
is the natural sucrose found in cane sugar and sugar beet
plants,&#8221; according to the complaint. &#8220;Defendants&#8217;
representations equating HFCS with real sugar -- such as &#8216;sugar
is sugar,&#8217; &#8216;your body can&#8217;t tell the difference,&#8217; and
&#8216;nutritionally the same as table sugar&#8217; -- mislead the consuming
public.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United States Sugar Corp., Western Sugar Cooperative,
Michigan Sugar Co. and seven other plaintiffs are suing ADM and
Minneapolis-based Cargill Inc. They seek a court order halting
the ads, plus unspecified money damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn Products International Inc. (CPO), based in Westchester,
Illinois, is among four other defendants in the suit, which
accuses the high-fructose corn syrup producers of trying to
rebrand their product after contributing to an increase in
obesity in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessie McKinney, a spokeswoman for Decatur, Illinois-based
Archer-Daniels Midland, said she couldn&#8217;t immediately comment on
the allegations. Lori Fligge, a spokeswoman for Cargill, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Hoffman, a spokesman for Corn Products International,
referred questions to the Corn Refiners Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sugar industry is wrongfully alleging that high
fructose corn syrup (a sugar made from corn) causes health
issues that do not arise from consuming cane and beet sugar,&#8221;
CRA President Audrae Erickson said in a statement. &#8220;The sugar
industry&#8217;s views are misleading American consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Western Sugar Cooperative v. Archer-Daniels
Midland Co., 11-cv-3474, U.S. District Court, Central District
of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occupy Wall Street Protesters Sue NYPD Over Citibank Arrests &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bartender and his fianc&#233;e involved in an Occupy Wall
Street protest sued the New York City Police Department for
alleged civil-rights violations stemming from a protest at a
Citibank branch last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a complaint filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court,
Julio Jose Jimenez-Artunduaga and Heather Carpenter claimed the
police violated protesters&#8217; constitutional rights against
unlawful detention and arrest and used excessive force after the
Oct. 15 demonstration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carpenter, 23, a Citibank account holder from Port
Jefferson on New York&#8217;s Long Island, decided to close her
account after being notified that the bank was imposing a $17
monthly fee unless she maintained a balance of $6,000, according
to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said in that she and other protesters, including
Jimenez-Artunduaga, joined a demonstration inside the branch at
555 LaGuardia Place in Manhattan&#8217;s Greenwich Village. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Carpenter left the branch after
closing her account and began filming demonstrators as they
interacted with police. An unidentified officer arrested
Carpenter, saying, &#8220;You were inside with everybody else. You
have to come with me,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple seeks unspecified damages and lawyers&#8217; fees.
Their attorney, Ron Kuby, and the Manhattan District Attorney&#8217;s
office said the charges were dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Browne, Deputy Commissioner for Public Information for
the New York Police Department, disputed the account of the
incident described by the plaintiffs in their lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both individuals were observed early on disrupting
business inside the bank, and then slipping outside as arrests
were under way, claiming falsely they were&#160;not engaged in the
disruption,&#8221; he said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;While still
inside the bank, they were told to leave by bank personnel and
did not. In fact, the males can be seen on a separate YouTube
video videotaping, and at one point going behind the bank&#8217;s
customer service desk to do so,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate O&#8217;Brien Ahlers, a spokeswoman for the New York City
Law Department said, &#8220;We will review the plaintiffs&#8217; papers
after the city is served with the complaint.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Carpenter v. New York City Police Department,
11-cv-8414, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates May Face Questions on Novell Monopoly Claims in Utah &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chairman Bill Gates may face cross-
examination about alleged monopolistic behavior 17 years ago
when he testifies in a Novell Inc. (NOVL) lawsuit accusing the world&#8217;s
largest software maker of undermining the WordPerfect program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is a byproduct of the U.S. government&#8217;s landmark
antitrust case against Microsoft that settled more than eight
years ago. In that case, the Redmond, Washington-based company
was declared an illegal monopolist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell said in its 2004 complaint that Microsoft unfairly
restricted competition by its word-processing program. Gates
targeted its products by name, Novell&#8217;s lawyers alleged, adding
that the Microsoft chairman said his company&#8217;s software couldn&#8217;t
compete without the benefit of anticompetitive conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia,
revived the case, which had been dismissed by a lower court
judge. The appeals court ruled Novell, which briefly owned
WordPerfect in the mid-1990s, didn&#8217;t cede its rights when it
transferred claims related to its personal computer operating
system products to Caldera Inc. in 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court ruling sent the case back to U.S.
District Judge J. Frederick Motz in Baltimore, who had
originally tossed it out. Motz is conducting the trial in Salt
Lake City federal court, where the original lawsuit was filed.
Gates was called to the witness stand yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell, which was bought by Seattle-based Attachmate Corp.
in April, has argued that WordPerfect&#8217;s share of the word-
processing market fell to less than 10 percent in 1996 from
almost 50 percent in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its value dropped from $1.2 billion in May 1994 to $170
million in 1996 when it was sold to Ottawa-based Corel Corp.,
said Novell, which is seeking three times its losses in the
lawsuit. The company settled separate antitrust claims against
Microsoft for $536 million in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which called Gates to testify in the company&#8217;s
defense, has denied Novell&#8217;s arguments that it maintained an
operating system monopoly by, in part, withdrawing programming
support so as to hobble Novell&#8217;s WordPerfect and Quattro Pro
programs for Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 95 operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Novell Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 04-01045, U.S.
District Court, District of Utah (Salt Lake City). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Madoff Trader David Kugel Pleads Guilty to Bank Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Kugel, a former trader at convicted confidence man
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s investment firm, admitted to bank fraud in
federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kugel pleaded guilty to six criminal counts pursuant to a
cooperation agreement with the government at a hearing yesterday
before U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain. Swain said that
Kugel, 66, faces as long as 85 years in prison and fines of
$11.75 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kugel was a supervisory trader in the proprietary trading
operation of Bernhard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC,
according to a letter this month from prosecutors to the judge.
He was accused of conspiracy to commit securities fraud going
back to the early 1970s by helping create fake trades to deceive
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kugel said yesterday that he conspired with Joann Crupi and
Annette Bongiorno, two former Madoff employees, to falsify
trading records and information. He said his conspiracy with
Bongiorno to create fake trading records for Madoff customers
dated back &#8220;to the early 1970s&#8221; and continued until the firm&#8217;s
collapse in December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bongiorno, who recruited investors and helped run Madoff&#8217;s
investment advisory office, and Crupi, a keypunch operator, were
charged last November by the U.S. in the Madoff probe. Both
women have denied the charges against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, is serving 150
years in prison for the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.
Investors lost about $20 billion in principal, the U.S. trustee
liquidating the securities business has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Kugel, 10-228, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybex Defective-Product Verdict Affirmed, Amount Reduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybex International Inc. (CYBI), a fitness-equipment maker, lost
an appellate court decision upholding a defective-product
verdict and said it will appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York state court reduced the judgment by about 31
percent to about $44 million, Cybex said in statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Contrary to the contention of Cybex on its appeal, we
conclude that a fair interpretation of the evidence supports the
jury&#8217;s verdict that Cybex was negligent and that its negligence
was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff&#8217;s injuries,&#8221; the
panel wrote in the Nov. 18 opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natalie Barnhard, a Cheektowaga, New York, assistant
physical therapist, sued Cybex after an exercise machine tipped
over and fell on top of her, leaving her a quadriplegic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cybex strongly believes that it was not at fault in the
accident that is the basis of the plaintiff&#8217;s claims and that
this case was wrongly decided as to liability,&#8221; Chief Executive
Officer John Aglialoro said in the statement. &#8220;While the
company appreciates the decision of the court to reduce the
judgment, we believe that the amount of damages represented by
the reduced judgment continues to be overstated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Law, the plaintiffs&#8217; attorney from Phillips Lytle
LLP, said the firm will talk to its client about whether to
accept the reduced award or seek a new trial on damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Barnhard v. Cybex, CA 11-00893, Supreme Court
of the State of New York, Appellate Division, Fourth Judicial
Department (Rochester). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuit News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBA Players Drop One Lawsuit, Focus on Minnesota Antitrust Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony and other
professional basketball players dismissed their antitrust
lawsuit against the National Basketball Association in Oakland,
California, to join a Minnesota case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Boies, an attorney representing players in their
legal filings against the NBA, told reporters at his office in
New York that the Minnesota case may move faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The point is to expedite this and move this along,&#8221;
Boies said yesterday. &#8220;The likelihood is that we&#8217;d get a faster
result in Minnesota than California.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The players allege that the league&#8217;s lockout is an illegal
group boycott that violates federal antitrust law, according to
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We assume that Mr. Boies was not happy with either the
reassignment of the case from Oakland to San Francisco or the
fact that the new judge scheduled the first conference for March
2012,&#8221; said Rick Buchanan, NBA executive vice president and
general counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBA players on Nov. 14 dissolved their union, a first for
the group, to allow for antitrust lawsuits against the league
after negotiations over a new labor agreement collapsed. The
sides were negotiating over how to split money from a league
that had about $4.3 billion in revenue last season. The NBA
season was to start Nov. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota case is Anthony v. NBA, 11-03352, U.S.
District Court, District of Minnesota (Minneapolis). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta Seeks to Depose Goldman Executives, Galleon Traders &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Director Rajat Gupta, set for
trial next year on insider-trading charges, told a judge in a
related civil case that he wants to question the bank&#8217;s
executives and Galleon Group LLC former traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan, who is
presiding over the cases, last week ordered Gupta, the
Securities and Exchange Commission and lawyers for Galleon co-
founder Raj Rajaratnam to identify witnesses they want to depose
in the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit. The lists were made public yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s list includes Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, President
Gary Cohn, Managing Director David Loeb and John Bryan or
another director. Also on the list is Caryn Eisenberg, the
former assistant to Rajaratnam; ex-Galleon trader Michael Cardillo; and James McNerney, presiding director of Procter 
Gamble Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The witnesses we list are believed to have information
relevant to this action,&#8221; wrote Gary Naftalis, the lawyer for
Gupta, in a letter to the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam was sentenced to 11 years in prison after he was
convicted of insider trading earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, and SEC v. Gupta,
11-cv-07566, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raytheon Loses Bid to Dismiss $1 Billion FAA Contract Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raytheon Co. (RTN) lost its attempt to dismiss a lawsuit accusing
the company of bid-rigging to secure an almost $1 billion
contract from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A District of Columbia Superior Court judge yesterday said
the case filed by Washington Consulting Group Inc. against
Raytheon, Raytheon Technical Services Co. LLC and one of its
employees can proceed. Raytheon had argued that the allegations
weren&#8217;t specific enough and that the plaintiff hadn&#8217;t first
filed its challenge with the FAA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FAA has no expertise or special competence in
adjudicating matters of state law, and plaintiff, as a
subcontractor, had no right -- much less a duty -- to challenge
the FAA award,&#8221; Judge Franklin Burgess said in his ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington Consulting, based in Bethesda, Maryland, seeks
more than $1 billion in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington Consulting claims Raytheon and its employee
Charles E. Keegan, who was allegedly having an affair with a
high-ranking FAA official, conspired with the agency to ensure
that his employer would win a 10-year contract in 2008 to train
air-traffic controllers, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Kasle, a spokesman for Waltham, Massachusetts-based
Raytheon, said he couldn&#8217;t immediately comment on the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Washington Consulting Group Inc. v. Raytheon
Technical Services Co. LLC, 10-00296, Superior Court of the
District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven J. Baum PC, New York Foreclosure Firm, to Shut Down &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven J. Baum PC, one of the largest law firms
specializing in home foreclosures in New York state, is shutting
down after losing business from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baum firm notified government entities, including the
New York State Department of Labor, that it planned mass job
cuts, it said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Earl Wells, a
firm spokesman, confirmed that it&#8217;s closing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage-
finance companies operating under U.S. conservatorship, dropped
Steven J. Baum PC from their lists of law firms eligible to
handle foreclosures. Home-loan servicers including Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) and Ally Financial Inc. also stopped using the
firm, which last month agreed to pay the U.S. $2 million and
change its practices to resolve a probe of faulty foreclosure
filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disrupting the livelihoods of so many dedicated and
hardworking people is extremely painful, but the loss of so much
business left us no choice but to file these notices,&#8221; Steven
J. Baum, who owns the firm, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baum wouldn&#8217;t comment further, Wells said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm has about 67 full- and part-time employees at its
headquarters in Amherst, New York, just north of Buffalo, and 22
full- and part-time employees at its Westbury, New York, office
on Long Island, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with the U.S. government concluded an
investigation into whether the firm filed misleading pleadings,
affidavits and mortgage assignments in courts, according to a
statement by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan. The
settlement didn&#8217;t constitute a finding of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven J. Baum PC has attracted lawsuits and fines for its
actions during the housing crisis. It has been accused of
overcharging, filing false documents and representing parties on
both sides of a mortgage transfer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ted Stevens Prosecutors Shouldn&#8217;t Face Charges, Counsel Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors&#8217; misconduct in the failed corruption case
against late Alaska Republican Senator Ted Stevens doesn&#8217;t
warrant criminal contempt charges, a lawyer appointed to
investigate the matter reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special counsel Henry F. Schuelke III didn&#8217;t recommend
bringing charges for criminal contempt because the evidence was
insufficient to prove &#8220;beyond a reasonable doubt&#8221; that the
prosecutors violated a &#8220;clear and unequivocal&#8221; court ruling,
U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan wrote in an order
yesterday that summarized the findings of Schuelke&#8217;s unreleased
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, Schuelke&#8217;s report outlined &#8220;concealment and
misconduct that was previously unknown and almost certainly
would never have been revealed,&#8221; wrote Sullivan, who oversaw
the trial and appointed Schuelke. Prosecutors systematically
concealed &#8220;significant exculpatory evidence&#8221; that would have
weakened the credibility of key government witnesses in the 2009
political corruption case, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sullivan said he intends to make the 500-page report public
after the Justice Department and Stevens&#8217;s attorneys have had a
chance to review it. He set aside the verdict against Stevens in
April 2009 and ordered an investigation into whether
prosecutors&#8217; conduct, which he said was the worst he had seen in
25 years on the bench, was criminal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department abandoned the case after Attorney
General Eric Holder discovered that the prosecutors had withheld
evidence that would have helped Stevens contest charges he
omitted $250,000 worth of gifts on his financial disclosure
reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is reviewing the order, spokeswoman
Laura Sweeney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those investigated included William Welch II, chief of the
Justice Department&#8217;s public integrity section; Brenda Morris,
the principal deputy director; and four other members of the
trial team. The section prosecutes public officials and
government employees for corruption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stevens, who represented Alaska for four decades in the
U.S. Senate, died in August 2010 in the crash of a small plane
in the state, along with four other people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs&#8217;s widow may never find a
better moment to sell her late husband&#8217;s $6.78 billion of Apple (AAPL)
Inc. and Walt Disney Co. (DIS) stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under U.S. law, Jobs&#8217;s heirs may sell Apple and Disney and
avoid $867 million in capital gains taxes. If Apple&#8217;s late co-
founder left his estate to his wife, Laurene Powell Jobs, the
family won&#8217;t be liable for the 35 percent estate tax until she
dies or gives money to others, according to estate planners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t see any reason not to sell all of it,&#8221; said Kacy
Gott, chief planning officer at the wealth-management firm
Aspiriant, whose clients have assets of as much as $100 million.
&#8220;They should have been looking to diversify years ago.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs&#8217;s heirs should sell some stock to reduce the estate&#8217;s
risks, said Joyce Franklin, a San Francisco financial planner
who works with high-tech executives. Making sales more
attractive: the capital gains tax is set to rise to 20 percent
in 2013 from 15 percent now, and high-income Americans will also
be subject to a 3.8 percent levy on unearned gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs owned 138 million Disney shares, valued yesterday at
$4.74 billion, and 5.55 million Apple shares worth $2.05
billion, according to filings. Proxy statements show Jobs moved
his holdings into trusts as his health worsened. Trusts let
people distribute wealth over time and avoid probate fees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., operator of the $3.6
billion Frade oilfield off the Brazilian coast, is blocked from
drilling in the country while a recent spill is examined, the
South American country&#8217;s oil regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s &#8220;negligence&#8221; contributed to the spill and the
company needs to pay more attention to safety precautions, the
Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, or ANP, said today in an e-mailed
statement. The ban will remain in effect until the regulator
identifies the causes of the spill and considers it safe to
resume drilling,  ANP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company &#8220;will adhere to all the rules and regulations
of the government of Brazil and its agencies,&#8221; Lloyd Avram, a
spokesman, said in an e-mail. Chevron, based in San Ramon,
California, continues production from the field, he said. The
stock dropped (CVX) 2.8 percent to $93.75 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is sanctioning Chevron at a time other foreign oil
companies such as BP Plc, Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
are accelerating exploration in deep waters off the coast of
Brazil. The nation expects production to double during the next
decade as it develops the largest oil discoveries in the Western
Hemisphere since 1976. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was fined 50 million reais ($27 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities for the Nov. 7 spill in deep
waters off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. It will be fined for
falsifying information to ANP and for failing to meet a plan to
counter the accident, the regulator said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3,000 Barrels &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 3,000 barrels leaked, Haroldo Lima, head of
the ANP, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the third-largest oil producer in Brazil after
state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and Shell, operates
Frade with a 51.74 percent stake. Petrobras holds a 30 percent
stake and Frade Japao Petroleo Ltda., a joint venture including
Inpex Corp. and Sojitz Corp. holds 18.26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t return phone calls
seeking comment on the order. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s YouTube announced a
deal with Walt Disney Co. (DIS) to offer rentals of the studio&#8217;s
movies, letting U.S. and Canadian users watch such films as
&#8220;Cars 2&#8221; and &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A handful of titles will be available for rent today, with
hundreds more appearing in the weeks to come, YouTube said on
its blog. Disney joins Sony Corp., Comcast Corp.&#8217;s Universal
Pictures and Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s Warner Bros. in offering rentals
on YouTube. Some titles are available for free, with many new
releases costing $3.99 for 48 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Check back in because even more of the great Disney
classics and new releases will be added in weeks to come,
including our YouTube Movie Extras with behind-the-scenes clips,
interviews, and more,&#8221; said Minjae Ormes, movies and television
marketing manager at YouTube, in the blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube, the largest video-sharing site, is expanding its
media offerings and helping Google curb its reliance on
Internet-search advertising. The rental effort steps up
competition with Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. (NFLX),
three of the top providers of digital entertainment. Last week,
Google announced a music service that lets users stream songs
from more than 1,000 record labels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new agreement, YouTube users can get access to
movies from Disney, Disney-Pixar and DreamWorks Studios. The
films will be available on Google&#8217;s television service as well.
Netflix customers, meanwhile, will lose online access to late-
release Disney films in February when the video service&#8217;s
agreement with the Starz cable network expires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s stock dropped 1.7 percent to $570.11 at the close
in New York. Shares of the Mountain View, California-based
company have fallen 4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to buy
the London Metal Exchange shares of MF Global U.K. Ltd., while
talks on the sale of remaining assets in the U.K. continue, the
special administrator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global (MF) filed for bankruptcy protection last month after
making bets that went bad on European sovereign debt. Its
British unit, MF Global U.K. Ltd., one of 12 category 1 members
of the LME that normally hold the right to trade on the floor,
was stopped from trading on the bourse on Oct. 31. The company&#8217;s
special administrator in Britain, KPMG LLP, put the unit&#8217;s stake
on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a &#8220;competitive bidding process,&#8221; JPMorgan
agreed to purchase all of MF Global&#8217;s shareholding, Richard
Fleming, Richard Heis and Mike Pink, the special administrators
of MF Global U.K. Ltd. at KPMG, said today in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sales process for various aspects of the MF Global
U.K. business continues apace and we are in negotiations with
several parties to this end,&#8221; Heis said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit owned 600,000 ordinary shares out of 12.9 million,
a 4.7 percent stake, and 25,000 non-voting B shares out of 1.36
million, according to a U.K. Companies House filing on Oct. 24.
JPMorgan may pay about 25 million pounds ($38.8 million) for the
stake, a person familiar with the process said yesterday. The
price was not given on today&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, one of the category 1 LME members, has raised its
holdings in the bourse over the past year. The latest purchase
will make the company a holder of 1.4 million shares, or 11
percent, making it the biggest shareholder. It owned 800,000
shares according to the Oct. 24 filing, compared with 550,000
shares a year earlier, according to Companies House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its holdings in the past
year by 330,000 ordinary shares to 1.23 million shares, or 9.5
percent, according to the Companies House filing. Metdist
Trading Ltd. and Metdist Ltd. own a combined 1.21 million
shares, or 9.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LME issues two share classes. Ordinary shares confer
ownership and 330,000 of them traded at 4.925 pounds in July,
according to data on the bourse&#8217;s website. B shares exchanged
hands at 85.425 pounds on Sept. 27. Neither shares trade on an
exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odin Knudsen, the JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) managing director for environmental markets, resigned last
month as the largest U.S. lender scaled back its climate-related
practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knudsen, 68, left the New York-based lender by mutual
agreement after it became apparent the U.S. was not going to
join a global system to trade carbon emissions, undermining the
bank&#8217;s business plans, he said in a Nov. 21 phone interview.
JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;d all been geared up for the U.S. coming on board at
some point,&#8221; Knudsen said. &#8220;The market pretty much died out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knudsen, who once headed the World Bank Carbon Fund, is the
second senior carbon markets banker to announce his departure
this month after emissions credits and clean power stocks
plunged in 2011. Investors deserted those markets as the United
Nations plan for a global emissions cap remains gridlocked and
European governments that subsidize most clean energy projects
are battered by the sovereign debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark EU carbon-emission permits have dropped 40
percent this year, falling to a record low today, while the
Bloomberg Industry solar energy stocks index (BISOLAR) plunged 68 percent,
undercutting investor interest in buying research and advisory
services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permits Slumped &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of carbon trading fell 8 percent to 23.7 billion
euros ($32 billion) in the third quarter from the previous three
months as the price of European emission permits slumped,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A record 1.5 billion tons of EU carbon permits was traded
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange between July and September,
exchange data show. Trade in UN carbon credits was a record 348
million tons in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN), the Swiss bank that lost $2.3 billion from
unauthorized trading this year, in September shut its climate-
change advisory practice and fired the staff, according to
former vice chairman of the securities unit Jon Anda, who ran
the team. Anda was fired along with his team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean-energy analyst Ben Lynch left Commerzbank AG in the
past two months, according to spokeswoman Claire Tappenden. The
industry is being covered by Lauren Licuanan, a power analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knudsen, who worked 27 years at the World Bank before
joining JPMorgan on Sept. 11, 2007, originally planned to leave
earlier this year and was persuaded to stay on to assess the
bank&#8217;s own environmental impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time he quit the environmental markets business
&#8220;there were only a few of us left,&#8221; he said. The unit had
employed several &#8220;tens&#8221; of people around the world at its
height. He declined to give specific details of staffing numbers
because the information is confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He plans to develop his own company, Real Options
International, offering carbon securities analysis, and may tap
the emissions market that California is due to start in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S.&#8217;s failure to join a global market &#8220;was a large
disappointment,&#8221; Knudsen said. &#8220;You&#8217;re starting over again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prista Oil Group BV, Bulgaria&#8217;s
biggest producer of brake-fluid and motor oil, bought Chevron
Corp&#8217;s (CVX) stake in a blending plant in Uzbekistan, Prista Oil
Chairman Plamen Bobokov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prista Oil bought Chevron&#8217;s 50.1 percent stake in Uz-
Texaco, a Fergana, Uzbekistan-based blending joint venture with
state-owned Uzbekneftgaz, for an undisclosed price, Bobokov said
in a phone interview in Sofia today. Prista Oil, in which
Chevron Corp holds 25 percent, has two blending factories in
Bulgaria, one in Hungary and one in Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This acquisition helps us set foot on the central Asian
market, which is more stable and predictable with the ongoing
crisis in European markets,&#8221; Bobokov said. &#8220;We plan to export
more than half of the Uzbek plant&#8217;s output, to neighboring
central Asian countries, as well as Ukraine and Moldova.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new joint venture has been renamed Uz-Prista and is
estimated to produce 48,800 tons of engine oils in 2012 and
50,000 tons in 2013, while sales are expected to reach $60
million next year and $65 million in 2015, Bobokov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are looking for new markets outside the European Union
to help us compensate for the crisis, which will probably worsen
next year,&#8221; Bobokov said. &#8220;We won a supply tender in Algiers
and have orders from companies in Libya and Egypt for our
Turkish plant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prista Oil produces Valvoline motor oil in its plant near
Istanbul in Turkey under a contract with Ashland Inc. (ASH) and owns
Monbat AD (5MB), Bulgaria&#8217;s biggest car-battery maker. The company&#8217;s
2010 net income fell to 1.54 million lev ($1.06 million) from
5.4 million lev in 2009, according to the company&#8217;s website. The
group&#8217;s total output rose to 66,000 tons of engine oils in 2010
from 59,000 tons in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&#8220;negligence&#8221; contributed to the accident, Brazil&#8217;s oil
regulator, the Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, said yesterday. The
ban will remain in place until the regulator identifies the
causes and considers it safe to resume drilling, ANP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a setback for Chevron in Brazil,&#8221; Gianna Bern,
president of Chicago-based risk management adviser Brookshire
Advisory and Research, said yesterday in a telephone interview
from Buenos Aires. &#8220;It will be challenging for Chevron to
emerge unscathed from the accident.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is seeking to ensure foreign oil companies such as
BP Plc, Statoil ASA (STL) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), which are
exploring in deep waters off the coast of Brazil, help the
country maximize vast oil deposits located deep beneath the
ocean while avoiding disasters similar to BP&#8217;s Gulf of Mexico
oil spill, the worst offshore incident in U.S. history. Brazil
expects crude production to double during the next decade as it
develops the largest oil finds in the Western Hemisphere since
Mexico&#8217;s Cantarell in 1976. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Meeting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said today in a statement it &#8220;has not received any
formal notice from&#8221; the Brazilian regulator suspending its
drilling license, although it &#8220;acknowledges&#8221; the ANP posted a
suspension notice on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil producer &#8220;will adhere to all the rules and
regulations of the government of Brazil and its agencies,&#8221;
Lloyd Avram, a spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mail. Chevron,
based in San Ramon, California, continues production from the
field, he said. The stock slid (CVX) 2.8 percent to $93.75 at the
close in New York yesterday. U.S. markets are closed today for
the Thanksgiving holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ali Moshiri, Chevron&#8217;s president for Latin America and
African operations, is scheduled to meet with Brazil Mining and
Energy Minister Edison Lobao at 3 p.m. today, according to a
statement on the ministry&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron hopes to continue operating in Brazil, George Buck,
the head of Chevron&#8217;s Brazil operations, said at a Congressional
hearing in Brasilia yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sincere apologies to the Brazilian people and the
Brazilian government,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure &#8216;Kick&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron underestimated the amount of pressure at a
reservoir at the Frade project about 230 miles (370 kilometers)
northeast of Rio de Janeiro, Buck told reporters on Nov. 20. The
well experienced a pressure &#8220;kick&#8221; at the reservoir, prompting
oil to leak to fissures on the ocean floor, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron halted the flow of oil from the &#8220;source&#8221; at the
reservoir on Nov. 13 and reduced the spill to residual seepage,
he said. The company will continue to seal the well that caused
the spill, the ANP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was fined 50 million reais ($27 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities for the spill, which
occurred Nov. 7 off the coast of Rio. The company will be fined
for falsifying information to ANP and also for failing to meet a
plan to counter the accident, the regulator has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 3,000 barrels leaked, Haroldo Lima, head of
the ANP, said Nov. 22. Lima, Buck and Petroleo Brasileiro SA
Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli are scheduled to
meet with state lawmakers in Rio today at 2 p.m. local time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP&#8217;s Gulf Spill &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the third-largest oil producer in Brazil after
state-controlled Petrobras (PETR4) and Shell, operates Frade with a
51.74 percent stake. Petrobras holds a 30 percent stake and
Frade Japao Petroleo Ltda., a joint venture including Inpex
Corp. (1605) and Sojitz Corp. (2768), holds 18.26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t return phone calls
seeking comment on the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian regulators are forcing Petrobras to shut
production equipment more frequently for maintenance after the
BP spill in April 2010, Gabrielli said in an Oct. 6 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Here in Brazil laws are stricter than in the United
States,&#8221; Gabrielli told reporters yesterday in Rio before ANP
announced the drilling ban. &#8220;The plan continues to be strongly
oriented toward accident prevention.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ANP also said it rejected Chevron&#8217;s request to drill a
so-called pre-salt well at the Frade project, where the
increased depth makes drilling more risky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to see increasingly draconian measures,&#8221;
said Brookshire&#8217;s Bern. &#8220;Operators can&#8217;t afford to have any
accidents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of workers in southern
China went on strike in the last week to demand higher pay and
better treatment, disrupting work at companies including one
that supplies equipment to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Shenzhen, 1,000 workers went on strike Nov. 22 at a
factory owned by a Taiwanese computer-parts maker after the
company required staff to work overtime from 6 p.m. to midnight,
New York-based China Labor Watch said in a statement. A day
earlier, workers at a Shenzhen factory owned by lingerie-maker
Top Form International Ltd. (333) struck over wages and
&#8220;unachievable&#8221; production quotas, the group reported. Last
week, 7,000 workers at a shoe factory struck in Dongguan, the
China Labor Bulletin reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies operating in Guangdong, China&#8217;s richest and most
populous province, face both slowing global demand for their
exports and increasing competition for workers from central and
western China, home to many of the province&#8217;s migrant laborers,
said Wang Erping, a scholar at the Chinese Academy of Sciences
in Beijing who studies protests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For a long time there was surplus labor in Guangdong,
allowing factories to keep wages low and extend working hours,&#8221;
Wang said. &#8220;Now China&#8217;s middle and western areas have had a lot
of growth, and are using local labor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Getting Squeezed&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economic growth has slowed amid a cooling property
market and the spreading sovereign-debt crisis in the European
Union, China&#8217;s biggest export market. China&#8217;s manufacturing may
contract this month by the most since March 2009, according to a
preliminary purchasing managers index released yesterday by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geoffrey Crothall, a spokesman for the Hong Kong-based
China Labor Bulletin, said the surge in strikes this month is
probably the biggest since a wave of stoppages at suppliers to
Japanese automakers last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we are seeing at the moment is like a spike in that
action and that is probably related to the global economic
turndown, orders decreasing, workers getting squeezed by their
employers because the companies themselves are making less
profit,&#8221; Crothall said. &#8220;The first thing they do is pass these
costs on to the workers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hung Up &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronics company where China Labor Watch said
workers were striking, Jingmo Electronics Technology (Shenzhen)
Co., makes keyboards, wireless cameras, hard-disk drives and
computer displays, according to its website. When called today
at 11:30 a.m, a woman who answered the phone said no one was
working today and there was no strike. She then hung up without
identifying herself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to its website, the company makes equipment for
multinational firms including International Business Machines
Corp. and LG Electronics. (066570) Ed Barbini, a spokesman at IBM, didn&#8217;t
immediately return an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 200 employees at Top Form&#8217;s Shenzhen plant
staged a five-day strike over pay before returning to work,
Kenny Suen, the Hong Kong-based company&#8217;s vice president of
production, said in a phone interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employees started their strike on Nov. 16 and returned
to work Nov. 22, he said. The stoppage was over wages, he said
without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The strike is now resolved,&#8221; Suen said. The impact was
&#8220;insignificant&#8221; and the company can catch up on lost output
&#8220;fairly quickly,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Top Form International fell as much as 9.6
percent in Hong Kong trading to 33 Hong Kong cents, the lowest
on an intraday basis since July 2009, and were down 2.7 percent
at 2:11 p.m. The shares have fallen 51 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crothall said workers in the coastal provinces are quicker
to strike now because inflation exacerbates any cuts to their
pay and because of concern that their employers will relocate
abroad or to inland areas of China. Food prices in October rose
11.9 percent from a year ago, China&#8217;s National Bureau of
Statistics reported on Nov. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are just preparing for the worst,&#8221; Crothall said.
&#8220;There is a general level of uncertainty about what is going to
happen in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Esm&#233; E. Deprez" date="Nov 25, 2011  2:50 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-25/muni-borrowing-may-rise-20-as-yields-sink-near-record-lows-jpmorgan-says.html"><headline>Muni Borrowing in 2012 May Rise 20% as Yields Sink, DeGroot Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Municipal borrowers may sell 20
percent more long-term debt next year compared with 2011 as
yields sink to near historic lows, according to Peter DeGroot,
head of municipal research at JPMorgan Chase  Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as $350 billion of bonds maturing in more than 12
months may be sold in 2012, compared with $291 billion projected
for this year, DeGroot and Josh Rudolph, an associate, said in a
note to investors. Rates on tax-exempt debt will decline in the
first quarter and remain low into the second, while rising by
year-end, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the past year&#8217;s focus on default risk and
bankruptcies is a bit off the mark,&#8221; DeGroot and Rudolph said
in the report, sent today. &#8220;General-obligation credit has two
key exposures to the economic cycle: tax revenues and pension
funding. Neither of the two are expected to deteriorate enough
to broadly threaten ability to pay.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter of next year, yields on tax-exempt
securities will fall by 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage
point, for five-year maturities to 35 basis points on 10-year
and 40 basis points for 30-year debt, according to the report.
By the end of December 2012, the analysts said yields will rise
on five-year bonds by 30 basis points and 55 basis points for
30-year issues. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Key Risks&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are two key risks to our relatively sanguine view
towards state and local government credit,&#8221; the analysts said.
&#8220;First is the unpredictable behavioral response of both
investors and issuers to the negative headlines surrounding
outlier credits. Second is the economic response to fiscal
consolidation needed at the federal level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt issued by states and local governments with a &#8220;high
dependency&#8221; on federal defense spending and grants may be
affected by the prospects of automatic U.S. budget cuts, they
said. The failure this week of the congressional supercommittee
to offer a federal deficit-reduction plan set in motion the so-
called sequestration process that targets Pentagon spending and
nonentitlement programs with cuts that may begin in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On balance in 2012, the municipal market will face higher
than typical headline risk associated with both domestic and
global policy events will promote abrupt shifts in capital from
risky to safe harbor assets,&#8221; the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prediction for an increase in municipal issuance, while
still trailing the 10-year average by 15 percent, tops the $310
billion estimated by George Friedlander, senior municipal-bond
strategist at Citigroup Inc. Friedlander made the prediction
during a panel discussion at a Bloomberg Link conference earlier
this month in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General-Obligation Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeGroot and Rudolph said they expect general-obligation
issuance to increase to $112 billion next year from $95 billion
in 2011. The predicted amount is less than in previous years,
the analysts said, citing &#8220;reluctance on the part of issuers to
borrow in the more restrictive fiscal climate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-rated tax-exempt bonds maturing in 30 years yielded
137.7 percent of equivalent Treasuries as of Nov. 23, the most
since April 15, 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The securities have returned about 9.1 percent this year through
Nov. 23, compared with almost 9.7 percent for comparable
Treasuries, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes
tracking price changes and interest payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through September, there were 42 defaults totaling $949
million, down from 79 valued at about $2.89 billion in the first
nine months of 2010, according to Richard Lehmann, publisher of
the Distressed Debt Securities Newsletter in Miami Lakes,
Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeGroot and Rudolph called that amount &#8220;muted&#8221; and said
they expect a similar level in 2012. That contrasts with the
view from Meredith Whitney, the banking analyst who in a Dec. 19
broadcast of CBS Corp.&#8217;s &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; show predicted
&#8220;hundreds of billions of dollars&#8221; of defaults in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Union regulators may seek
to spur mobile-phone payments as other regions take the lead in
services attracting investments from companies including Google
Inc. (GOOG), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Visa Inc. (V) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The region lacks a &#8220;concrete European framework&#8221; for
systems enabling customers to make purchases using their mobile
phones, according to a European Commission document obtained by
Bloomberg News that seeks views on future regulation for the
industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a consequence, the largest and most promising global
m-payment initiatives are currently launched outside Europe,&#8221;
according to the document. &#8220;Apple, Google and Visa have all
announced major efforts to enter the m-payment business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers may spend as much as $50 billion worldwide using
their mobile phones by 2014 through a technology called near
field communications, Juniper Research said in June. There were
7.1 million mobile payment users in Western Europe in 2010,
compared with 62.8 million users in the Asia-Pacific region, the
commission said, citing estimates from research company Gartner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile payments can be made either through the phone
accessing the Internet, or through a chip being embedded in the
handset that can be read at short distances by a payments
terminal, the commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fragmented&#8217; Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without measures tackling issues such as interoperability,
security and collaboration between companies, the European
market risks being &#8220;fragmented,&#8221; according to the EU document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chantal Hughes, a spokeswoman for the commission in
Brussels, declined to comment. Al Verney, a spokesman for
Google, declined to immediately comment. Alan Hely, a spokesman
for Apple, declined to comment on the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and Visa Europe Ltd. said in September they had agreed
to license mobile payments technology to Google to be
incorporated into its design of a new smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year will see mobile payments &#8220;really take hold&#8221;
with European consumers, Simon Kleine, a spokesman for
Visa Europe, said in an e-mail. &#8220;Advanced pilots are already
underway in France and Italy, with successful trials also
undertaken in the U.K., Poland and parts of Spain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile phone makers including Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) and Samsung
Electronics Co. are also offering the technology and British
phone operators Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) and others are planning a
U.K. platform to speed the introduction of payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition Authority &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission, the EU&#8217;s executive arm, is responsible for
proposing legislation that covers the 27-nation region. It is
also the region&#8217;s competition authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator is already investigating whether a group of
banks shut out a rival payment provider from talks to create
standards for online payments. This follows earlier probes into
Visa Europe and MasterCard Inc. (MA) into the fees they charge on
card payments made outside a user&#8217;s home country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission is considering the need for further measures
to rein in the card fees, according to the document. The
regulator will seek views on whether there is a need for
&#8220;intervention&#8221; to lower fee levels or make the charges more
transparent, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Triton Beteiligungsberatung GmbH, a
private equity firm that focuses on European investments, is
weighing the sale of its coal-tar chemicals business Ruetgers
Group, two people with knowledge of the process said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triton, which acquired the unit in 2008, hired Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to advise on the sale of the Zelzate, Belgium-
based company, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the matter is confidential. Financial information on
Ruetgers is not publicly available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruetgers, which distills coal tar to make chemicals used in
aluminum production, is Europe&#8217;s No. 1 coal-tar distiller and
may appeal to a private equity firm or strategic buyer, the
people said. Ruetgers&#8217; competitors include Koppers Inc. of the
U.S. and Himadri Chemicals  Industries Ltd. (HCI), which is backed by
Bain Capital LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Ruetgers and Triton weren&#8217;t immediately
available for comment. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruetgers, whose origins date back to 1847, employs about
1,000 and is led by Chief Executive Officer Henri Steinmetz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triton was among buyout firms that pursued Evonik
Industries AG&#8217;s carbon-black business, which was sold this year
to New York-based buyout firm Rhone Capital LLC for about $1.3
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koppers, which had 1,729 workers in 2010, had sales of
$1.25 billion and operating profit of $99 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bain acquired a stake in Himadri in 2010 and has sought to
expand in styrene through the purchase of Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)&#8217;s
styrene unit, and has pursued talks to buy TowerBrook Capital
Partners&#8217; latex unit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which is one of Peacocks&#8217; biggest junior

for a bigger stake in the company, the newspaper reported today.
The investment bank may ask Peacocks&#8217; senior lenders to roll

Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (OZM) and Perry Capital a small

&lt;p&gt;Online retail sales and payments

&lt;p&gt;Sales over the Internet increased 15 percent as of 6 p.m.

&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), EBay and other Internet retailers pay

said Andrew Lipsman, a vice president of industry analysis at
ComScore. &#8220;Consumers have been saving and got their houses in
order. They are feeling a bit better about spending than the
past several years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet sellers offered early discounts and set up pop-up
locations leading up to Cyber Monday, aiming to grab a bigger
portion of holiday sales by luring consumers from bricks-and-
mortar retailers. Sales on the Web and in malls surged over the
weekend, with consumers spending a record $52.4 billion, the
National Retail Federation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Seattle-based Amazon, the No. 1 e-commerce
company, jumped 6.4 percent to $194.15 at the close in New York,
the biggest gain in more than three months. EBay, based in San
Jose, California, rose 5.1 percent to $29.66, its largest
increase since mid-September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online Shopping at Work &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-commerce sales in November and December will rise 15
percent to $37.6 billion, Reston, Virginia-based ComScore
estimated. The researcher said Black Friday, or the day after
Thanksgiving, brought $816 million in online sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shopping from wireless devices is also on the rise this
year, Armonk, New York-based IBM said in a statement, with about
12 percent of consumers using a mobile device to visit a retail
site today, and 6.7 percent using one to make a purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many consumers wait until the Monday after Thanksgiving to
make online purchases, some of them taking advantage of faster,
more robust Internet connections available from offices. Half of
U.S. workers plan to spend time shopping via the Web this
holiday season, on par with 52 percent last year, according to a
survey by Careerbuilder.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of that tally, 34 percent will spend an hour or more
shopping this season, according to the survey of 4,384 workers
and 2,696 employers. It was conducted from Aug. 16 to Sept. 8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bond insurer Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO)
has come forward with three dozen new witnesses who it says will
back a legal claim that it was defrauded by JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)&#8217;s EMC Mortgage unit in a $337 million mortgage-backed
securities deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Hamilton, Bermuda-based Assured Guaranty filed
a new complaint on Nov. 18, unsealed today, in a lawsuit
accusing EMC and its parent at the time, Bear Stearns  Co., of
misleading the bond insurer. The complaint, which also names
JPMorgan as a defendant, includes a new fraud claim and new
allegations from insiders at EMC and elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The truth is now coming directly from Bear Stearns&#8217; own
former employees,&#8221; the insurer said in the complaint. &#8220;Seven
confidential witnesses who were responsible for underwriting at
EMC each have affirmed that they faced intense pressure to
approve the purchase of high volumes of loans for Bear Stearns&#8217;
securitizations without adequate review.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns is a defendant in two other lawsuits in
federal court in Manhattan by guarantors of mortgage-backed
deals who say they were defrauded by the bank, which collapsed
in 2008, according to the complaint. Assured Guaranty said its
complaint adds to those suits by citing accounts from insiders
and other sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment on the new complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit focuses on a 2005 transaction known as SACO I
Trust 2005-GP1, one of hundreds of securitizations by Bear
Stearns from 2004 to early 2007. Assured Guaranty claims EMC
knew that thousands of home-equity lines of credit that served
as collateral for $337 million in securities it guaranteed were
&#8220;junk&#8221; or otherwise flawed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Assured Guaranty Corp. v. EMC Mortgage Corp.,
10-cv-05367, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline in Los
Angeles fell against futures after Chevron Corp. (CVX) was said to be
preparing for the start of a gasoline-making unit at the El
Segundo refinery in Southern California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
dropped 2 cents to a premium of 5 cents a gallon versus gasoline
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:11 p.m.
East Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Prompt-delivery of the fuel rose 4.35 cents to $2.5677 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s 279,000-barrel-a-day El Segundo refinery shut the
fluid catalytic cracker, which processes vacuum gasoil into
gasoline and other products, for repairs in October, two people
with knowledge of the work said Nov. 21. The unit&#8217;s start was
scheduled to begin tomorrow, said one of the people, who
declined to be identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, reported planned
flaring at the refinery from tomorrow through Dec. 1, according
to a notice filed with the South Coast Air Quality Management
District. The emissions aren&#8217;t related to a breakdown, the
filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco lost 1 cent, narrowing its premium
to 2.5 cents against futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend diesel in Los Angeles fell 2.5 cents to a
premium of 1.25 cents to heating oil futures traded on the
Nymex. The same fuel in San Francisco was unchanged at a premium
of 1.75 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, was
unchanged at a discount of 3.75 cents to futures, holding at the
fuel&#8217;s lowest level since Aug. 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP should
get a record fine of at least 1.5 million pounds ($2.33 million)
for failures concerning reports on client-money accounts at
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s London securities unit, the U.K.&#8217;s
accounting watchdog told a tribunal today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Accountancy  Actuarial Discipline Board is seeking
fines that top the 1.2 million-pound sanction against Coopers 
Lybrand LLP in 1999. The independent arbitrators in London will
make a decision within 15 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. was fined a record 33.3 million
pounds last year by the Financial Services Authority, Britain&#8217;s
banking regulator, for not properly separating client money from
the firm&#8217;s accounts. An average of $8.6 billion wasn&#8217;t properly
segregated in an error that went undetected by PwC for seven
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It didn&#8217;t just happen once but it happened for seven
consecutive years,&#8221; Simon Browne-Wilkinson, a lawyer for the
AADB, said. &#8220;This is a case of a systemic failure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PwC compiled reports for the FSA on the banks&#8217; client-money
holdings from 2002 to 2008 and failed to catch JPMorgan&#8217;s
mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Dutton, a lawyer for PwC, argued the fine should be
capped at 1 million pounds because the firm had admitted and
apologized for the error, which was a &#8220;result of information
technology changes made by JPM treasury staff,&#8221; and that no
clients of the bank had lost money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We acknowledge that we did not maintain our usual high
standards,&#8221; PwC spokesman David Jetuah said in an e-mail. &#8220;PwC
takes very seriously its reporting requirements to the Financial
Services Authority. We hope that the regulatory response will be
proportionate to the issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Orleans, the Louisiana city
rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina collapsed its levees,
extended maturities of about $15.5 million in debt to March 2013
through a loan from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to avoid additional
budget cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the only company willing to finance privately,
said Lisa Daniel, a managing director at Public Financial
Management in Memphis, the city&#8217;s adviser. It offered a 5.95
percent rate, the lowest among five banks New Orleans talked
with, she said. The previous interest was 5 percent. The
refinancing will add about $924,000 in debt-service costs over
two years, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What they&#8217;re doing is irresponsible,&#8221; said John Kennedy,
Louisiana&#8217;s Republican treasurer and chair of the State Bond
Commission. &#8220;All the city is doing is pushing the payment of
debt into the future, instead of dealing with it today. It&#8217;s a
very dangerous precedent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move delays payments on the 1998 bonds for 15 months.
About $7.5 million of debt service would have come due on Dec. 1
without the refinancing. All six members of the Democrat-
dominated City Council voted in favor of the plan on Nov. 17,
and it passed the bond commission 9-3, said Kennedy, who voted
against it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;House in Order&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, a Democrat, inherited a
$100 million budget deficit when he took office in May 2010,
said Andy Kopplin, the city&#8217;s chief administrative officer. The
city has cut spending from $528 million in 2009 to $488 million
this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve done all the things that you can do to get your
fiscal house in order, but we have this lingering $25 million
deficit,&#8221; Kopplin said. &#8220;A modest restructuring of that debt
can be easily managed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Kelly, a spokesman at JPMorgan&#8217;s commercial bank,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private placements allow issuers to bypass a public sale
and registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The debt doesn&#8217;t get rated, which may attract
municipalities with lower credit grades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approval came two weeks after Moody&#8217;s Investors Service
put $699 million of New Orleans debt on review for possible
downgrade, citing audited fiscal 2010 results that fell
&#8220;significantly below expectation.&#8221; The company rates the
city&#8217;s general-obligation debt A3, the fourth-lowest investment
grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Shot &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly rated one-year notes yield 1.09 percent, five
basis points below the 2011 average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Orleans has a history of relying on so-called &#8220;one-
shot&#8221; revenue sources, or non-recurring income such as funding
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Robyn
Rosenblatt, a senior analyst at Moody&#8217;s who covers the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a payment deadline of Dec. 1, the city waited until
the last minute and didn&#8217;t consider other options, Kennedy said.
Revenue anticipation notes, which are short-term securities,
might have saved taxpayers&#8217; money, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to refinance through a private placement &#8220;was
mostly a timing issue&#8221; because the city could not obtain a
rating on the debt and draft an official statement fast enough,
said PFM&#8217;s Daniel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue-anticipation notes &#8220;clearly would have been less
efficient,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It would have incurred a whole lot of
debt-service burden and would be viewed negatively by the rating
agencies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expensive Storm &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Katrina, the most expensive natural disaster in
U.S. history, killed at least 1,330 people in Louisiana and
Mississippi in 2005. About 85 percent of New Orleans flooded
after levees collapsed. The storm surge extended as far as 10
miles inland, displacing almost 200,000 residents, a
congressional report in February 2006 found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The population of New Orleans declined by more than 140,000
residents, or 29 percent, from 2000 to 2010, Census Bureau data
show. It is still the most populous city in Louisiana, with
about 344,000 residents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry groups with members
including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google Inc. (GOOG) warned the European
Union against setting &#8220;overly strict&#8221; data privacy rules,
claiming they would harm technology development in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Overly strict, static and bureaucratic data-protection
rules will have a detrimental impact on Europe&#8217;s economy,&#8221; said
11 industry associations, including the Business Software
Alliance, which counts Microsoft among its members, and IAB
Europe, which has Google and Yahoo! Inc. on its roster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viviane Reding, the EU&#8217;s justice commissioner, has promised
to propose changes to the region&#8217;s 16-year-old data-protection
law before February. Reding reiterated earlier this month her
stance that U.S. companies that operate in the 27-nation EU will
have to stick to the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry groups responded today with a set of
recommendations urging the European Commission, the EU&#8217;s
executive agency, &#8220;to achieve the right balance&#8221; between
preserving privacy and enabling the free flow of information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expanded
coverage of Turkish stocks to 60, adding 41 new companies
including 13 new &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendations, the company said in a
report dated November 25 and received by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top picks are based on macroeconomic themes and include the
&#8220;increasing importance of Turkish industry,&#8221; rising domestic
consumption and increasing per capita growth, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman now rates 15 Turkish stocks at &#8220;buy.&#8221; They
include builder Enka Insaat  Sanayi AS (ENKAI), fertilizer producer
Gubre Fabrikalari AS (GUBRF), gold miner Koza Altin Isletmeleri AS (KOZAL),
pharmaceuticals distributor Selcuk Ecza Deposu Ticaret  Sanayi
AS (SELEC), glassmakers Turkiye Sise  Cam Fabrikalari AS (SISE), Trakya Cam
Sanayi AS and Anadolu Cam Sanayii AS. (ANACM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list also includes automobile companies Tofas Turk
Otomobil Fabrikasi AS (TOASO) and Dogus Otomotiv Servis  Ticaret AS (DOAS),
farm vehicle maker Turk Traktor  Ziraat Makineleri AS (TTRAK), acrylic
fiber producer Aksa Akrilik Kimya Sanayii (AKSA) AS, white goods
producer Arcelik AS (ARCLK), airport operator TAV Havalimanlari Holding
AS (TAVHL) and the holding companies Alarko Holding AS (ALARK) and Yazicilar
Holding AS. (YAZIC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average potential gain for the new buy-rated stocks is
58 percent compared with an average of 13 percent for Turkish
stocks under coverage, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No banks were listed with a &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendation. Turkiye
Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB), a state-owned bank, is the preferred bank in
Turkey, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s economy will &#8220;slow sharply and may even enter a
relatively mild recession in late 2011 and early 2012,&#8221;
according to the report. Growth should reach about 1.5 percent
in 2012, below the global average, and then return to a higher
rate in the medium term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup Inc. had long-term credit grades
reduced to A- from A by Standard  Poor&#8217;s after the ratings firm
revised criteria for dozens of the world&#8217;s biggest lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP made the same cut to Morgan Stanley and Bank of
America&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit today. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was
reduced one level to A from A+. SP upgraded Bank of China Ltd. (3988)
and China Construction Bank Corp. to A from A- and maintained
the A rating on Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (1398),
giving all three lenders higher grades than most big U.S. banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moves may increase pressure on firms already dealing
with weak economies and Europe&#8217;s mounting sovereign debt crisis.
Lenders including Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley
have said they may have to post billions of dollars of
additional collateral and termination payments on trades because
of a one-level downgrade in their credit ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s evident that stress from the European banking system
is taking its worldwide toll,&#8221; Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, said
in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ratings firm also downgraded UBS AG (UBSN) and Barclays Plc (BARC) to
A from A+, and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) to A+ from AA-, according to
the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change in Technique &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP, a unit of New York-based McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP), has been
changing the way it looks at debt after its faulty grades
contributed to the credit-market seizure that brought down
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos. It started
to review the methodology in December 2008, months after the
collapse of those two firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most bank stocks were little changed in after-hours
trading. Bank of America fell 4 cents to $5.04, while Citigroup
dropped 19 cents to $25.05 and Goldman Sachs declined 21 cents
to $88.60 as of 6:30 p.m. in New York trading. Citigroup (C) issued
a statement disputing SP&#8217;s downgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think moving from single A to single A- has much
of an economic impact on anyone,&#8221; said David Hilder, a New
York-based analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group. &#8220;Those
ratings are at a high level compared to the whole spectrum of
ratings and are still well into the territory of investment
grade.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Bank of America, the bigger impact might have been with
when Moody&#8217;s Investors Service reduced its grade in September to
Baa1, two notches below the prior A2 rating, Hilder said. By
contrast &#8220;these are relatively minor changes,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collateral Triggers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downgrades &#8220;could likely have a material adverse effect on
our liquidity, potential loss of access to credit markets, the
related cost of funds, our businesses and on certain trading
revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty
creditworthiness is critical,&#8221; Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America said in its quarterly filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which noted the risk of downgrades from SP
and Fitch Ratings in the filing, previously said it has prepared
by lining up funding for a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citibank NA, the deposit-taking arm of New York-based
Citigroup, was downgraded to A from A+. The bank estimated in a
quarterly filing that a one-level reduction to the unit&#8217;s rating
could trigger $4 billion of collateral payments and other cash
obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Dissents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We completely disagree with SP&#8217;s change to Citigroup
Inc.&#8217;s holding company long-term and short-term ratings,&#8221; said
Jon Diat, a spokesman for the lender, in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Less than 1 percent of Citi&#8217;s funding will be affected by the
SP revision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley estimated over-the-counter derivatives
counterparties could demand $1.29 billion of collateral or
termination payments from the New York-based firm after a one-
notch downgrade. In addition, the firm may have to post an
additional $323 million to exchanges and clearinghouses. All the
estimates were as of Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. lender (BKX), has
said the New York-based company may have to post an extra
$1.5 billion in collateral against its derivatives and pay
additional sums for contract terminations after a one-notch cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, David Wells, a
spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan&#8217;s Joe Evangelisti declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power Shift &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP analysts wrote earlier this month that the new ratings
would reflect &#8220;a potential shift in the power balance of global
banking.&#8221; In August, SP downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit
rating from AAA, citing political failure to reduce record
deficits. The ratings company downgraded the six largest U.S.
banks while upgrading two Chinese lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP analysts wrote in a Nov. 1 research note describing its
criteria that developed banking markets in the U.S. and Europe
were under pressure, while emerging markets in Latin America and
Asia were expanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Leading banks in these regions have benefited from strong
economic growth which has supported household and corporate
credit quality,&#8221; SP wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP, the world&#8217;s largest provider of bond ratings, has
roiled markets this month with a pair of errors related to
sovereign credit ratings. On Nov. 10, the company sent, and then

&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect debt issued by
U.S. banks from Bank of America Corp. to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. jumped after Standard  Poor&#8217;s lowered their long-term
credit ratings as it revised criteria for the banking industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Bank of America, which were little
changed before the announcement, increased 16.9 basis points to
478.8 and those on its Merrill Lynch  Co. unit climbed 24.1 to
524.9 as of 4:46 p.m. in New York, according to data provider
CMA. Contracts on Goldman Sachs increased 8 to 403.6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP lowered its ratings on the banks to A- from A as
Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis deepens, in a move that may be
costly for the banks. Bank of America said in a regulatory
filing this month that it may have to post $5.1 billion of
additional collateral and termination payments on its
trades were it to be downgraded one level by rating companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The European sovereign and banking system stress no
longer has borders,&#8221; said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.
&#8220;A stone splashing in the European pond causes big ripples in
the U.S. as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on Citigroup Inc. increased 9.2 basis points to
306.8 basis points and swaps tied to Morgan Stanley&#8217;s debt added
6.2 basis points to 506.9, according to CMA, which is owned by
CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. Contracts linked to JPMorgan Chase
 Co. increased 3.8 basis points to 171. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline in San
Francisco fell to its lowest level against futures since August
after Chevron Corp. (CVX) was said start a crude unit at the Richmond
oil refinery and a cracking unit at the El Segundo plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco dropped 3.5 cents to a discount of
1 cent a gallon versus gasoline futures traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 2:07 p.m. East Coast time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It&#8217;s the first time since Aug. 16
that the fuel traded at a discount in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was expected to start a fluid catalytic cracker at
the El Segundo refinery today that was shut in October for
repairs, a person with direct knowledge of the work said Nov.
21. The San Ramon, California-based company also restored
service to a crude unit at the Richmond refinery that was shut
Nov. 14 after a fire, two people familiar with the plant&#8217;s
operations said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to supply products to our customers without
interruption,&#8221; Melissa Ritchie, a Chevron spokeswoman based at
the Richmond refinery, said in an e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in Los Angeles dropped 4 cents, narrowing its
premium to 1 cent against futures. That&#8217;s the lowest level for
the fuel since Nov. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend diesel in Los Angeles fell 1.25 cents to
reach parity with heating oil futures traded on the Nymex. The
same fuel in San Francisco weakened 1.75 cents, also to trade
even with futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martinez Shutdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Antonio-based Tesoro Corp. (TSO) shut a crude distillation
unit at the Martinez refinery in Northern California after a
naphtha leak, Tina Barbee, a Tesoro spokeswoman based at the
company&#8217;s headquarters, said in an e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery reported &#8220;a liquid spill&#8221; from the crude
unit, known as the &#8220;50 Unit,&#8221; at about 7:15 a.m. local time
yesterday, Matt Kaufmann, a hazardous materials specialist for
Contra Costa County, said in a telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 50 Unit was scheduled for a five-week maintenance
turnaround beginning in January, a person familiar with the
plant&#8217;s operations said Oct. 5. Barbee declined to comment
today, citing company policy, on whether the planned work will
be conducted now while the unit is down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, was
unchanged at a discount of 3.75 cents to futures, holding at the
fuel&#8217;s lowest level since Aug. 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s biggest
theme-park operator, sold bonds for the third time this year
after reporting fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts&#8217;
estimates on growth in cable television and at U.S. resorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of ESPN issued $1 billion 0.875 percent, three-
year notes and $600 million of 4.125 percent, 30-year bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A Deere  Co. (DE) unit
joined the Burbank, California-based entertainment company in
marketing a benchmark-sized offering today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies are racing to sell debt as borrowing costs hover
within 60 basis points of a record low, propelling bond sales
this month to $98.6 billion as of yesterday, the highest since
May. Yields on investment-grade debt of 4.01 percent yesterday
compare with the record low of 3.45 percent reached in August,
and are down from 4.15 percent on Oct. 11, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney said on Nov. 10 that profit in the fourth quarter
totaled 59 cents a share, exceeding analysts&#8217; projections of 55
cents, the average of 26 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Higher
fees from pay-TV operators, advertising gains and improved
results at resorts drove revenue and profit higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising Earnings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rise in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization is improving Disney&#8217;s leverage without the company
working toward any debt reduction, Dave Novosel, an analyst at
Gimme Credit LLC wrote in a Nov. 14 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Revenue and margins are increasing nicely, aided by an
improving economy and a much better advertising environment,&#8221;
he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney sold $1.85 billion of bonds in August and $500
million of notes in May, Bloomberg data show. The company&#8217;s 30-
year bonds priced to yield 125 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, and compare with $350 million of 4.375
percent bonds issued in August at an 87.5 basis-point spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Deere Capital Corp. issued $500 million of 2 percent
debt due in January 2017 and $600 million of 1.25 percent debt
due in 2014, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowers issued $159 billion of corporate bonds in May,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
proprietary traders Bennett Grau and Mark Mallon are teaming up
with former colleague Marc Mezvinsky to start a hedge fund,
according to a person with knowledge of their plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three are raising money for their new firm, Eaglevale
Partners LP, which plans to start trading in the first half of
2012, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the information is private. The fund will employ a global macro
strategy, seeking to profit from economic trends by trading
securities from bonds to commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mezvinsky, 33, who last year married Chelsea Clinton, 31,
used to work with Grau and Mallon at Goldman Sachs&#8217;s global
macro proprietary-trading group before he left in 2008 for
investment firm 3G Capital Inc. The three join Morgan Sze and
Pierre-Henri Flamand, former heads of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s global
principal strategies proprietary group, who each started their
own hedge funds in Hong Kong and London in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those from high-profile prop desks seem to have an edge
over their competition in attracting assets,&#8221; said Don
Steinbrugge, managing partner of Agecroft Partners LLC, a
Richmond, Virginia-based firm that advises hedge funds and
investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Hickey, head of global
leveraged finance at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), plans to retire
at the end of the year, after about two decades at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickey, 50, was named a partner at the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank by assets in 2004, according to a memo obtained by
Bloomberg News. Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, confirmed
the contents of the memo and declined further comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickey has been leading Goldman&#8217;s America&#8217;s middle-market
lending effort, according to the memo from Richard Gnodde, David Solomon and John Weinberg, co-heads of investment banking at the
New York-based firm. That role will now be handled by Craig
Packer, according to the memo. Hickey didn&#8217;t immediately return
an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at Goldman, Hickey served as global head of loan
trading and head of bank loan syndicate, sales and trading,
according to a 2006 news release. He also was a member of the
board of directors of the New York-based Loan Syndications and
Trading Association between 2003 and 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickey first joined Goldman in 1987 working in investment
banking and the fixed income divisions in New York and London
until 1996, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that year, Hickey helped start the lending business at
Donaldson Lufkin  Jenrette where he served as head of loan
syndications, sales and trading before returning to Goldman as a
managing director in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickey has worked on a joint venture with the Yale Pre-MBA
Leadership Program, promoting diversity at the Yale School of
Management, through Goldman Sachs Gives, a donor-advised fund,
according to the memo. He will continue in his role as chairman
of that program on behalf of the organization, the Goldman memo
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the third-largest oil
producer in Brazil, has delayed three wells at the offshore
Frade project while it waits for the government to lift a
drilling ban following an oil spill earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron put on hold plans to develop the water injection
wells at Frade after the Brazilian oil regulator&#8217;s Nov. 23 ban
on the company&#8217;s drilling, Ali Moshiri, head of operations in
Latin America and Africa, said in a telephone interview from
Houston yesterday. Water injection wells help to maintain
reservoir pressure and separate water from oil at other wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 3,000 barrels of oil were leaked during the Nov.
7 spill, according to the regulator, which suspended Chevron&#8217;s
drilling in the country until a probe into the leak is
completed. San Ramon, California-based Chevron is cooperating
with authorities to investigate the causes of the spill and
still plans to invest $3 billion in existing projects in Brazil
and expand when the country offers new areas, Moshiri said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re hoping it won&#8217;t last very long, because I&#8217;m not
quite sure why it was suspended in the first place,&#8221; Moshiri
said. &#8220;Not even one drop has reached the beach, a reaction of
this magnitudes is really surprising.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two largest oil producers in Brazil are state-
controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)
Brazil plans to double oil production in the next ten years as
it taps the largest discoveries in the Western Hemisphere in
over 30 years that are located in deep waters of the Atlantic
Ocean. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the
bankrupt investment bank seeking approval for a $65 billion
liquidation plan next month, named a committee to select
directors to oversee the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selection committee of creditors&#8217; representatives will
include Thomas Tormey of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), part of a
group that proposed an alternative liquidation plan; Christian Wyatt of Fir Tree Partners, representing a so-called ad hoc
group; and Noel Purcell of Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., co-
chairman of an existing creditor committee, according to a court
filing yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Ryan of Elliott Management Corp., the defunct firm&#8217;s
president, John Suckow, and liquidators of Lehman affiliates,
also are on the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history
in September 2008, has said it can probably get a judge&#8217;s
approval for a plan to pay an estimated $370 billion in claims,
with distributions starting early next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) will
probably be stuck in a 250-point range next year as Europe&#8217;s
debt crisis offsets optimism about U.S. earnings, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark index for U.S. equities will most likely
fluctuate between 1,100 and 1,350, forming an &#8220;inside-range
year&#8221; by staying roughly within the band seen this year, said
Michael Krauss, JPMorgan&#8217;s New York-based head of technical
research. He sees a 12 percent chance of an economic recession
that would push the SP 500 as low as 800. The odds of the index
rising to 1,500 because of progress on the crisis or stimulus
from central banks are 8 percent, Krauss said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The markets now are like ships caught in the
treacherously stormy seas of headline risk,&#8221; Krauss wrote in a
note to clients yesterday. &#8220;It will be difficult for equities
to sustain back above the 1,300-1,350 trendlines, as long as the
European sovereign debt crisis and recession lurks in the
background. Similarly, it will be tough to move below strong
1,075-1,100 clustered support, as long as the U.S. avoids an
economic recession, earnings stay elevated, and investors remain
defensively positioned.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure surged 2.9 percent to 1,192.55 yesterday,
ending a seven-day losing streak, after Thanksgiving retail
sales climbed to a record and speculation grew that European
leaders will intensify efforts to end the debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset Purchases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve asset purchases meant to boost the economy
and better-than-expected earnings helped drive the SP 500 to a
34-month high of 1,363.61 at the end of April. The index sank to
1,099.23 last month as the European debt crisis, which began
more than two years ago in Greece, spread to Italy and Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krauss said in December that the index would likely peak at
about 1,350 in the middle of 2011 before dropping to 1,100. He
boosted his year-end projection to more than 1,400 in April,
then scrapped that target three months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market&#8217;s trend and momentum now suggest higher odds of
more losses, Krauss said. The SP 500 remains below its 200-day
average and that level has been falling since Aug. 9, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index&#8217;s monthly stochastic and Moving Average
Convergence/Divergence line charts, which track the market&#8217;s
momentum, continue to show a sell signal that began in July.
Such signals tend to last seven to nine months, suggesting the
market may be under pressure during the first four months of
next year, Krauss said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index reached an intraday peak of 1,370.58 on May 2,
surging 106 percent from a 12-year low of 666.79 on March 6,
2009. It has since fallen 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Absent a resolution to the European debt crisis, and a
market-friendly outcome to the November 2012 presidential
election, we believe it will be extremely difficult to exceed
this May&#8217;s 1,371 SP 500 peak during 2012,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;If our
favored 1,100-1,350 range proves incorrect, it is technically
more likely that the downside support breaks, rather than the
upside barrier.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
clients should exit a bet that Hong Kong-listed companies in
China will gain as UBS AG and Citigroup Inc. cut growth
forecasts for the world&#8217;s second-biggest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are closing our recommended long position in Chinese
equities&#8221; after the trade lost 5 percent, Goldman analysts
including Noah Weisberger wrote in an e-mailed report dated
yesterday. In a Nov. 6 report, the analysts favored shares in
the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index. (HSCEI) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premier Wen Jiabao&#8217;s crackdown on property speculation is
damping home sales and construction just as Europe&#8217;s soveriegn-
debt crisis threatens exports. The central bank triggered
speculation that monetary policy may be further loosened to spur
growth by allowing reserve requirements for some rural credit
cooperatives to fall this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product will increase 8 percent in 2012,
less than a previous call of 8.3 percent, Hong Kong-based
economist Wang Tao, of UBS, said in a note today. Citigroup cut
its forecast to 8.4 percent from 8.7 percent. The banks have
also reduced global growth estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think the balance of risks is no longer attractive,&#8221;
the Goldman analysts wrote in yesterday&#8217;s report, referring to
their previous stock call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, a gauge of 40
mainland companies listed in Hong Kong, dropped 9.7 percent from
Nov. 5 through yesterday on concern Chinese growth may falter.
It climbed 1.8 percent as of 2:40 p.m. local time today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euro Zone Woes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Nov. 6 report, the analysts highlighted the shares&#8217;
underperformance relative to the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Much weaker euro zone growth will affect the rest of the
world, including China,&#8221; UBS economist Wang said today. &#8220;We
think more obvious and persistent easing will likely occur in
the first quarter of 2012, when export, construction and
industrial production should have decelerated significantly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economy grew 9.1 percent in the third quarter from
a year earlier. Expansion has slowed from 11.9 percent in the
first quarter of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.1 percent as
of 1:25 p.m. local time, paring this year&#8217;s decline to about 14
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley yesterday lowered its China growth estimate
for next year to 8.4 percent from 8.7 percent. The nation is
unlikely to be immune from weaker external demand although
domestic demand will &#8220;hold up well,&#8221; Hong Kong-based
economists led by Helen Qiao and Yuande Zhu said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sliding Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048), China&#8217;s second-largest
developer by market value, said its contracted sales fell 39
percent in October from a year earlier. Barclays Capital
estimates home prices may decrease by 10 percent to 30 percent
in the next year. Home prices fell in 33 of 70 cities in
October, government data shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think a sharper deceleration in property investment is
the biggest risk to China&#8217;s economy,&#8221; Johanna Chua, Hong Kong-
based chief economist for Asia at Citigroup, said in today&#8217;s
report. &#8220;But a hard landing can be averted in the near term
with sufficient policy flexibility to provide offsetting support
for growth, especially on the fiscal front.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS&#8217; Wang said the government may relax fiscal policy and
bank lending quotas next year.  She estimates additional fiscal
spending of about 1 percent of gross domestic product over a 12-
month period and that the central bank will raise its new
lending target for 2012 to 8 trillion yuan ($1.25 trillion) from
7.3 trillion to 7.4 trillion this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserve Requirements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup said the central bank may cut banks&#8217; reserve
requirements before the Chinese New Year in late January if
recent capital outflows continue and raise interest rates to
stabilize deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS predicts the world economy will expand 2.7 percent next
year, down from a previous estimate of 3.1 percent. Citigroup is
forecasting 2.5 percent after the sixth consecutive monthly
downgrade, economists led by Willem Buiter and Michael Saunders
said in a report dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
says that growing doubts about the survival of Europe&#8217;s monetary
union has caused global growth to stall and represents the main
risk to the world economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paris-based organization has lowered its estimate for
China&#8217;s 2012 expansion to 8.5 percent from a 9.2 percent
forecast in May. A slowdown in property sales could trigger
developer collapses and lead to bad loans, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anglo American Plc (AAL), Naspers Ltd. (NPN) and
Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP) are among JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s top 2012
South African stock picks as the investment bank favors mining,
media and retail companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has an &#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on South
African equities, which may rise 15 percent by the end of next
year, strategists including Deanne Gordon wrote in a note
yesterday. The recommendation means investors should hold more
of the shares than are represented in benchmark indexes. This
gain lags behind JPMorgan&#8217;s estimated 22 percent increase for
emerging markets, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank is &#8220;neutral&#8221; South African cash,
which may return 5.5 percent and &#8220;underweight&#8221; government
bonds, which may rise 2 percent in 2012, the strategists wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African Rainbow Minerals Ltd. (ARI), a diversified mining group,
Harmony Gold Mining Co, Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN), the
largest maker of generic medicines in the southern hemisphere,
British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) and retailers Mr. Price Group Ltd.,
The Spar Group Ltd. (SPP) and Woolworths Holdings Ltd. are also among
JPMorgan&#8217;s top ten stock picks for 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks to avoid, according to JPMorgan, include Standard
Bank Group Ltd., Africa&#8217;s biggest lender, Telkom South Africa
Ltd., Africa&#8217;s largest fixed-line phone company, Massmart
Holdings Ltd. (MSM), South Africa&#8217;s biggest food and general-goods
wholesaler, and Group Five Ltd., a construction company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and six others may be
questioned under oath by lawyers for the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Rajat Gupta, who was charged with insider trading
as part of the Galleon Group LLC investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs director, sought
to depose Blankfein and other firm executives including Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar, President Gary Cohn, Managing
Director David Loeb and John Bryan, as part of a related suit
brought by the SEC. While U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New
York authorized the questioning of Blankfein before the April 9
criminal trial, he said depositions of the other officers must
be conducted afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who also sat on the board of Procter  Gamble Co.
and led McKinsey  Co., was indicted by a federal grand jury
last month on five counts of securities fraud and one count of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud for passing inside
information to Galleon co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. Rakoff is
presiding over Gupta&#8217;s criminal case as well as the SEC lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Blankfein, Rakoff granted SEC requests to
question Gary Rosenbach, Galleon&#8217;s co-founder, and Ian Horowitz,
a former trader who worked for Rajaratnam and was recorded on a
U.S. wiretap. The judge said lawyers may also depose three other
individuals associated with Galleon -- Ananth Muniyappa, Brock
Vandervliet and Leon Shaulov. Also to be deposed is Greg Ormond
of Exemplar Wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;No Material Argument&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court sees no material argument whatsoever for
delaying the depositions,&#8221; Rakoff said in his ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 62, of Westport, Connecticut, was a close friend and
business associate of Rajaratnam, prosecutors said. He made
multimillion-dollar investments with the hedge fund manager and
also passed him inside information after attending Goldman Sachs
board meetings from 2008 through January 2009, according to the
indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff today said the SEC couldn&#8217;t depose Ragakanthan
Rajaratnam, the younger brother of Raj Rajaratnam&#8217;s who once
worked as a Galleon portfolio manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge today also delayed a request to question Caryn
Eisenberg, the former assistant to Rajaratnam; ex-Galleon trader
Michael Cardillo; and James McNerney, presiding director of
Procter  Gamble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven Years &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on Rakoff&#8217;s ruling. John Nester, a spokesman
for the SEC, declined to immediately comment on the judge&#8217;s
decision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) was &#8220;irresponsible&#8221;
and acted with an &#8220;absolute lack of caution&#8221; in operations that
led to a leak in the Frade oilfield off the coast of Rio de
Janeiro, the state&#8217;s governor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company&#8217;s going to pay for this and it&#8217;s going to be
expensive,&#8221; Rio de Janeiro Governor Sergio Cabral told reporters
in New York today, according to a statement e-mailed by his
office. He said Chevron used &#8220;medieval techniques&#8221; in the
operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was fined 50 million reais ($27.6 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities for the spill, which
occurred Nov. 7 about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of
Rio de Janeiro. An estimated 3,000 barrels leaked, Haroldo Lima,
head of Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator, Agencia Nacional do Petroleo,
said Nov. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will be fined for falsifying information to ANP
and also for failing to meet a plan to counter the accident, the
regulator has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabral&#8217;s statement did not specify if further actions would
be taken against Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an e-mailed statement, Chevron said it quickly moved to
address the leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our combined efforts greatly diminished the size of the
sheen and stopped the source of the seep flow within only four
days of first detection,&#8221; the company said in an e-mail from its
press department. &#8220;Up to 18 vessels have been in rotating
operation to support well plugging operations and sheen
cleanup.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY), India&#8217;s

of Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s $10.7 billion Lipitor cholesterol pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration approved Ranbaxy&#8217;s copy of

Laboratories in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the agency said today
in a statement. Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) today began selling
a copy of Lipitor in the U.S. under an agreement with New York-
based Pfizer. Watson&#8217;s version didn&#8217;t require FDA clearance
because Pfizer is providing the drug to sell without the brand
label in return for a share of the revenue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., after this
year&#8217;s losing endorsement of U.S. bank stocks, recommends as its
top trade for 2012 a bet against European high-yield corporate
debt and forecasts a &#8220;deeper recession&#8221; for the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth-biggest U.S. bank in terms of assets recommended
in a research note that investors speculate on the rising cost
of insuring against the default of European junk bonds by using
the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with mostly
high-yield credit ratings. The gauge of derivatives will climb
to 950 basis points, or 9.5 percentage points, from 770 basis
points, according to Goldman Sachs, which urges investors to
exit the trade if the index falls to 680 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ongoing shocks from the region&#8217;s sovereign crisis --
and policy responses to them -- are likely to be the biggest
determinant of the outlook over the next few months,&#8221; Dominic Wilson and Jan Hatzius, economists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in
the research note, published today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said a year ago that the U.S. economy would
expand 2.7 percent in 2011, and U.S. bank stocks, junk bonds,
commodities, Japanese equities and China&#8217;s currency were its top
recommendations. America&#8217;s gross domestic product is forecast to
grow 1.8 percent in 2011, according to the median forecast of 63
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drop in Financials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index has lost 18
percent this year in the worst performance among 10 industry
groups. U.S. banks, measured by the 24-company KBW Bank Index,
have fallen 26 percent on a total return basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America&#8217;s high-yield corporate debt has returned 1.4
percent as of yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Total Return Index
of commodities has gained 1 percent. Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock
Average has dropped 16 percent, while China&#8217;s yuan has
appreciated 3.6 percent against the dollar this year, according
to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy will expand 1.5 percent next year, while
Europe&#8217;s will contract 0.8 percent, according to Goldman Sachs.
The bank lowered its worldwide economic growth estimate to 3.2
percent from 3.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis in the euro zone will weigh on the
U.S. economy through early 2012, according to Hatzius. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzius on Crisis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There will be an intensification over the next few
months,&#8221; Hatzius said today in a conference call with clients.
A &#8220;tightening of financial conditions&#8221; will limit the
&#8220;willingness of banks to lend,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe may stem its debt crisis by moving to a &#8220;full
fiscal union&#8221; in which all countries assume responsibility for
the euro area&#8217;s sovereign debt or by &#8220;a much larger
commitment&#8221; by the European Central Bank to support sovereign-
debt markets, according to the Goldman Sachs note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s European growth estimate &#8220;is conditional on
major policy changes in the region, probably involving a partial
&#8216;mutualization&#8217; of the existing debt stock supported by the
ECB,&#8221; the Goldman Sachs economists wrote. &#8220;The alternative
scenario is that the euro area breaks up and there is a much
deeper recession.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk, or high-yield, bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and less than BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also recommended betting on German 10-year
bund yields climbing to 2.8 percent from 2.3 percent and exiting
the trade if they fall to 2 percent. The bank predicted the euro
will rise to 1.35 Swiss francs from 1.2260 and said investors
should abandon the trade if the euro falls to 1.20 francs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should go long on Canadian stocks versus Japanese
equities, bet on the Malaysian ringgit and the yuan against the
dollar and pound and speculate on a gain in Brent crude oil,
according to Goldman Sachs. A long is a bet an asset will gain
in value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline in Los
Angeles fell to a two-week low against futures after Chevron
Corp. (CVX) said the El Segundo refinery in Southern California was
operating normally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in Los Angeles weakened 1.88 cents to a discount of
0.88 cent a gallon versus gasoline futures traded on the New
York Mercantile Exchange at 4:20 p.m. New York time, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the first time the fuel
has traded at a discount in Los Angeles since Nov. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s 279,000-barrel-a-day El Segundo plant,
California&#8217;s largest oil refinery, is &#8220;operating normally,&#8221;
Rod Spackman, a company spokesman based in El Segundo, said in
an e-mail. The San Ramon, California-based company was scheduled
to start a fluid catalytic cracker at the plant yesterday after
repairs, a person with knowledge of the work said Nov. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron also restored service to a crude unit at the
240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond refinery that was shut Nov. 14
after a fire, two people familiar with the plant&#8217;s operations
said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco slipped 0.38 cent, extending its
largest discount to futures since August to 1.38 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend diesel in Los Angeles fell 0.13 cent to a
discount of 0.13 cent against heating oil futures traded on the
Nymex. The same fuel in San Francisco fell 0.88 cent to a
discount of 0.88 cent to futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon,
weakened 2 cents to a discount of 5.5 cents to futures,
extending the fuel&#8217;s lowest level since Aug. 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s (PFE) long dependence on the
cholesterol pill Lipitor to produce almost one-fifth of the
company&#8217;s revenue begins eroding today when the drug&#8217;s patent
protection ends in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step will be rebuilding the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker into a smaller, faster-moving company that focuses on
development of biologic drugs and specialty medicines while
expanding sales of existing products, such as Lipitor and the
erection drug Viagra, in emerging countries such as China,
executives said in interviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to be a one-product company,&#8221; said Geno Germano, Pfizer&#8217;s president of specialty care and oncology,
interviewed at the company&#8217;s New York headquarters. &#8220;We&#8217;re
poised to deliver significant new pipeline assets in the coming
year, and in coming years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 3.5 percent to $20.07 at the close in New York,
and has gained 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker is depending on four products to generate $4
billion in new revenue by 2014, said Timothy Anderson, a Sanford
C. Bernstein analyst in New York, in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugs are Prevnar, a bacterial infection vaccine gained
in Pfizer&#8217;s 2009 Wyeth purchase; the blood-thinner Eliquis, co-
developed with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY); the rheumatoid
arthritis drug tofacitinib; and the cancer drug Xalkori for non-
small-cell lung tumors. Pfizer is awaiting U.S. regulatory
approval on Eliquis and tofacitinib. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The liquidator of brokerage MF
Global Inc., accused by some customers of having a conflict of
interest because of past work done for JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
said revenue from such jobs in 2009 and 2010 was less than one-
tenth of 1 percent of his law firm&#8217;s total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustee James Giddens disclosed the revenue from JPMorgan,
a lender to MF Global&#8217;s parent company, in court papers after
the judge handling the bankruptcies ordered him to describe his
relationship with the biggest U.S. bank. Customers have said he
may have interests opposed to theirs because of such work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trustee and HHR do not hold or represent an interest
that is adverse to the MFGI estate,&#8221; Giddens said yesterday in
a filing, referring to his firm Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP. By
contrast, Giddens said that he had &#8220;investigated and actively
pursued claims&#8221; against the bank in his role as trustee of the
Lehman Brothers Inc. brokerage, settling for $860 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giddens gave no details of the work he performed for the
bank. His firm has &#8220;historically&#8221; represented JPMorgan or
affiliates or syndicates in &#8220;certain corporate and other
matters,&#8221; he said. The firm&#8217;s revenue from the work this year
is projected to be less than 1/1000 of 1 percent of revenue and
the trustee himself wasn&#8217;t involved in the work, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is agent to a $1.2 billion loan to the brokerage&#8217;s
parent, MF Global Holdings Ltd., and is allowing the company to
use cash securing a loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominion Objection &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominion Resources Inc., whose Virginia Electric  Power
Co. and other affiliates are creditors of the MF Global
brokerage, said in court papers that the bankrupt parent company
shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to use cash, because brokerage customers
may need to obtain assets from the parent to make up for an
apparent shortfall in their collateral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Giddens said he would return as much as $2.1
billion to commodity customers, an amount that&#8217;s 66 percent of
U.S. customers&#8217; segregated assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest, and third, transfer to customers of the defunct
brokerage will bring total distributions to $4.1 billion, or
about three-quarters of customer assets, he said in a statement.
The Securities Investor Protection Corp., which hired Giddens
for the MF Global brokerage liquidation, said it supported the
transfer. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn signed an order
yesterday setting a hearing on the distribution for Dec. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortfall in the MF Global brokerage&#8217;s U.S. segregated
customer accounts may exceed $1.2 billion, more than double what
was previously estimated, Giddens has said. That would mean
customer accounts are missing about 22 percent of their total of
$5.4 billion. A shortfall of 11 percent had been previously
estimated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Conservative Approach&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trustee continues to take a conservative approach to
the shortfall,&#8221; spokesman Kent Jarrell said in an e-mail
yesterday, responding to questions about reports that some of
the missing money may have been found. &#8220;These have always been
presented as preliminary numbers that may well change, and we of
course hope for the benefit of customers that the number comes
down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parent company&#8217;s Oct. 31 bankruptcy filing, the eighth-
largest in U.S. history, listed assets of $41 billion. The firm
said it has about $26 million in cash. Corzine, the former co-
chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), quit as MF
Global&#8217;s CEO on Nov. 4. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Supreme Court justices debated
an effort to make investment banks, including units of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), pay back money they earned
by allegedly manipulating dozens of initial public offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing arguments yesterday in Washington, the justices
questioned whether Vanessa Simmonds could press ahead with what
originally were 55 lawsuits filed in federal court in Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute stems from a provision in federal securities
law that requires corporate insiders to give back &#8220;short-
swing&#8221; profits -- money from the sale of stock held for less
than six months. The 1934 Securities Exchange Act gives
investors two years to sue over violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In letting some of the suits go forward, a federal appeals
court said the time limit hadn&#8217;t kicked in because the
defendants didn&#8217;t file required disclosure forms. The panel
threw out 30 of the suits on other grounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an hour-long session in Washington, the justices
signaled they were reluctant to erect a rigid rule on the time
limit. Justice Elena Kagan suggested the court might return the
dispute to the lower courts to determine whether Simmonds had
enough information about the alleged wrongdoing to file her suit
earlier, even without the disclosure forms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices are considering an appeal filed by units of
Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Deutsche Bank AG (DB),
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), as well as
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simmonds was a college student when she bought the stock in
55 companies that went public at the height of the IPO boom in
the late 1990s and 2000. Her father, David Simmonds, is one of
the lawyers pressing the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Credit Suisse v. Simmonds, 10-1261, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schaeuble Defends EFSF Panel at German Constitutional Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble defended giving
a parliamentary subcommittee the ability to quickly approve
emergency or classified euro rescue-fund actions at the nation&#8217;s
top court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe heard
arguments in a case filed by two opposition lawmakers, who say
the rules curb their parliamentary rights and put power in the
hands of too small a group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government argues the subcommittee must be allowed to
make decisions privately so that the European Financial
Stability Facility can take actions requiring strict
confidentiality, such as bond purchases on the secondary market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Confidentiality is the prerequisite that you can use
those instruments at all,&#8221; Schaeuble told the judges.
&#8220;Announcing beforehand that you&#8217;ll buy bonds in the secondary
market may be suitable at a Carnival speech, but not for
responsible operation of the EFSF.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court on Sept. 7 cleared Germany&#8217;s participation in the
EFSF while stressing the legislature, the Bundestag, must keep
authority over budgetary aspects of the rescue plan. The nine-
member, all-party subcommittee was established to comply with
the ruling while giving the panel powers to approve emergency or
classified decisions. The 41-member budgetary committee must
have a say in EFSF decisions, the court said in its ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s judges in October halted committee activities
while the suit is pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judges are expected to issue a ruling later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: BVerfG, 2 BvE 8/11. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consultant Made $780,000 on Julius Baer, Swatch Bets, FSA Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A management consultant on trial for insider trading made
about 500,000 pounds ($780,000) betting on tips from a hedge-
fund employee about companies including Julius Baer Group Ltd.
and Swatch Group AG (UHR), prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rupinder Sidhu, who faces 23 counts of insider trading,
used Hotmail accounts and MSN Messenger to covertly communicate
with Anjam Ahmad, a trader at AKO Capital LLP, Michael Brompton,
a prosecutor for the Financial Services Authority, told a jury
in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmad told Sidhu, a childhood friend, when AKO was about to
buy or sell a stock so he could benefit from the effect on its
share price, Brompton said. This was &#8220;carried out on an
increasingly large scale and for increasingly large profits&#8221;
between June and August in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 40-year-old, who also faces one count of money
laundering, pleaded not guilty in April. The trial is expected
to last for three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidhu is accused of using spread-betting sites to speculate
on stocks including Julius Baer, Swatch, Reed Elsevier Plc and
Michael Page International Plc, making sums ranging from 1,600
pounds to 137,000 pounds, Brompton said &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a &#8220;classic example of insider trading,&#8221; Brompton
told jurors yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargill Accused of Job Discrimination at Arkansas Plant &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargill Meat Solutions, processor of Honeysuckle White and
Riverside turkeys, discriminated against 4,069 qualified job
applicants, the Labor Department said as it sought to strip the
company of its U.S. contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female, white, black, Hispanic and American Indian
applicants at the Cargill Inc. unit were denied entry-level jobs
at a production plant in Springdale, Arkansas, according to a
statement yesterday on an agency complaint. The company has $550
million in contracts to supply the U.S. military, the department
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department filed the complaint after it was unable to
arrange back pay, with interest, for the rejected job
applicants, according to the statement. The Wichita, Kansas-
based company didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an unfortunate case in which thousands of
qualified workers were denied the opportunity to compete fairly
for jobs in a tough economy,&#8221; said Patricia Shiu, director of
the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Labor Department is seeking to cancel Cargill Meat
Solutions&#8217; government contracts and bar it from future work
until the company resolves violations and changes employment
practices, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glencore Unit Should Be Liquidated, Thai Bitumen Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glencore International Plc&#8217;s Singapore unit should be
liquidated after failing to pay a $20.2 million arbitration
award, Thai Bitumen Co. said in a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glencore Singapore, a unit of the largest publicly traded
commodities company, is &#8220;therefore deemed to be insolvent and
unable to pay its debts,&#8221; Thai Bitumen director Chaiwat
Srivalwat said in the Nov. 23 winding-up petition filed in the
Singapore High Court. A closed hearing is scheduled for Dec. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Singapore unit of Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore was
ordered to pay $20.2 million and interest to Thai Bitumen by
arbitrator Kenneth Rokison on Sept. 21, according to the
lawsuit. Glencore failed to deliver 600,000 barrels of
Venezuelan crude oil to Thai Bitumen, breaching an October 2008
sale contract, Rokison ruled in the London arbitration
proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glencore hasn&#8217;t filed its reply to the Singapore lawsuit.
Spokesman Charles Watenphul declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Thai Bitumen&#8217;s Chaiwat and the company&#8217;s lawyer Cavinder Bull
didn&#8217;t reply to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thai Bitumen, a unit of Thailand&#8217;s biggest asphalt producer
Tipco Asphalt Pcl. (TASCO), and Glencore couldn&#8217;t agree on the interest
amount to be paid on the arbitration award, according to court
papers. Glencore&#8217;s lawyers claimed Thai Bitumen had over-
calculated the interest by $42,785, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glencore declared force majeure on the delivery to Thai
Bitumen, a legal clause that allows delays because of an
incident outside a supplier&#8217;s control, after a decision by
Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA to cut
production in 2008, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Thai Bitumen Co. v Glencore Singapore Ltd.
CWU152/2011 in the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olympus Whistle-Blower Woodford Meets With U.S. Prosecutors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olympus Corp. (7733) whistle-blower Michael Woodford said he met
for two hours yesterday with U.S. prosecutors and investigators
for the Securities and Exchange Commission in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former head of the Tokyo-based camera maker arrived at
the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in Lower Manhattan for a briefing
with eight investigators from the Justice Department, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the SEC, he said in an
interview. It was Woodford&#8217;s second meeting with prosecutors; a
prior meeting lasted three hours, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Different elements or parts of the Olympus story appeal
to different jurisdictions,&#8221; Woodford said, declining to detail
his talks with the U.S. government. &#8220;I&#8217;ve passed on everything
I know.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodford was fired as president and chief executive officer
on Oct. 14 after he confronted the Olympus board about oversized
payments made to advisers in the acquisition of Gyrus Group Plc
in 2008. Olympus revealed this month that it used the purchase
of Gyrus and three other takeovers to hide decades-old
investment losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara in New York, and SEC spokesman John Nester declined to
comment on yesterday&#8217;s meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Challenges NCUA&#8217;s Claims Over Failed Credit Unions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) said it will challenge a U.S. regulator&#8217;s
claim that Wachovia Corp. misrepresented mortgage-backed
securities in 2006 sales to a pair of credit unions that later
collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Credit Union Administration sued Wachovia,
accusing the lender acquired by Wells Fargo during the subprime
mortgage crisis of &#8220;pervasive disregard of underwriting
standards&#8221; and issuing offering documents with &#8220;material
untrue statements,&#8221; according to a statement released
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Kansas,
details about $200 million in purchases by the U.S. Central
Federal Credit Union and Western Corporate Federal Credit Union,
which were placed under conservatorship in 2009. NCUA, which is
serving as liquidating agent for the failed lenders, has filed
similar suits against firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, said the San
Francisco-based bank believes the claims are without merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look forward to defending ourselves vigorously in this
matter,&#8221; Martinez said yesterday in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Pipeline Rupture May Force It to Pay More for 2006 Spill &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc, still facing fallout from the 2010 explosion of its
Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico, is fighting a U.S. bid to
revoke its probation over a five-year-old spill in Alaska
following a more recent pipeline rupture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP pleaded guilty in 2007 to violating the Clean Water Act
by spilling 200,000 gallons of oil from its Prudhoe Bay field
into water on Alaska&#8217;s North Slope in 2006. It paid a $12
million fine and $8 million for restitution and community
service and was put on three years&#8217; probation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government began arguing yesterday in federal
court in Anchorage that the U.K.-based company violated its
probation by allowing a pipeline rupture two years ago in the
same area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities last year filed a petition to revoke BP&#8217;s
probation 12 days before it was to expire, claiming the company
failed to take precautions and implement safeguards. Prosecutors
may seek more money from the company if the judge agrees the
terms of the probation were violated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BP&#8217;s 2006 spill was the result of a lack of maintenance
and a failure to heed warning alarms indicating that the
pipeline was leaking oil,&#8221; U.S. lawyers said in a Nov. 14
filing. &#8220;The 2009 spill vividly demonstrates that BP has not
adequately addressed the management and environmental compliance
problems that have plagued it for many years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spill &#8220;was an unfortunate incident, but it was not a
crime,&#8221; the company said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was an accident,&#8221; Steve Rinehart, a BP spokesman,
said in a phone interview. &#8220;No one was hurt, and there was
minimal environmental impact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP didn&#8217;t violate any conditions of its probation, the
company said in court filings. BP wasn&#8217;t negligent and didn&#8217;t
discharge oil in the waters of the U.S., the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP spilled about 13,500 gallons of oil near Prudhoe Bay in
November 2009 when a section of the company&#8217;s pipeline at its
Lisburne Processing Center ruptured, &#8220;creating a two-foot hole
in the pipe that allowed the contents to spill onto the tundra
and surrounding wetlands,&#8221; the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., 3:07-
cr-00125, U.S. District Court, District of Alaska (Anchorage). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anglo Irish Bank Noteholder&#8217;s Lawsuit Dismissed by U.S. Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo Irish Bank Corp., the bank nationalized by the Irish
government in 2009, won dismissal of a noteholder lawsuit that
sought to block the sale of its U.S. loan portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe in Manhattan said in
an order Nov. 28 that the claims were prohibited by the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendant is a &#8216;foreign state&#8217; within the meaning of
the&#8221; act, Gardephe said. &#8220;Plaintiffs have not demonstrated
that Ireland has waived sovereign immunity for purposes of this
action or that any exception to sovereign immunity is
applicable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fir Tree Partners, a New York investment firm, sued Anglo
Irish Bank in February, claiming it owns $200 million of notes
the bank issued in the U.S. Fir Tree sought an order blocking
Anglo Irish Bank from transferring any U.S. assets out of the
country so it can force the bank to honor its debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Smith, a lawyer for Fir Tree, didn&#8217;t return a call to
his office seeking comment on the ruling after regular business
hours Nov. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fir Tree Capital Opportunity Master Fund LP v.
Anglo Irish Bank Corp., 11-CV-0955, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Del Monte, KKR Deal Faces U.S. Antitrust Probe, Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Del Monte Foods Co. (DLM)&#8217;s $5.3 billion sale to a group of
private-equity firms led by KKR  Co. is the target of a U.S.
Justice Department antitrust probe, a lawyer who sued over the
deal said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors have been &#8220;investigating the facts and
circumstances surrounding the sale of Del Monte,&#8221; Stuart Grant,
a lawyer for Del Monte shareholders, said in a Nov. 23 court
filing as part of an $89.4 million settlement of investors&#8217;
claims over the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in San Francisco-based Del Monte argued in the
lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington they weren&#8217;t
getting enough for their shares in the buyout. Other
shareholders, who filed a related federal court suit in San
Francisco, questioned whether private-equity firms rigged bids
to artificially lower the price paid for the maker of Meow Mix
cat food and Milk Bone dog biscuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment Nov. 28 on whether the antitrust division was
investigating the Del Monte buyout. Kristi Huller, a KKR
spokeswoman, and Chrissy Stengel, a Del Monte spokeswoman,
didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment on the filing Nov. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement also resolves investors&#8217; claims that
Barclays Plc (BARC), which served as Del Monte&#8217;s financial adviser
while providing some financing for the buyers, had conflicting
interests in the deal. The private-equity group led by New York-
based KKR included Vestar Capital Partners and Centerview
Partners LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster ordered Del
Monte in February to delay a shareholder vote on the deal so
investors could consider whether to back it in light of
disclosures about London-based Barclays&#8217;s dual roles. Laster
will decide whether to approve the settlement at a hearing
tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

Litigation, CA6027, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Settles Privacy Complaints of U.S. Regulator &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest social-networking site,
agreed to settle complaints by the Federal Trade Commission that
it failed to protect users&#8217; privacy or disclose how their data
could be used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed 20-year agreement would require Palo Alto,
California-based Facebook to get clear consent from users before
sharing material posted under earlier, more restrictive terms,
the FTC said yesterday in a statement. It would also compel
independent reviews of Facebook&#8217;s privacy practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies must live up to their promises about privacy,&#8221;
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said on a conference call with
reporters. The settlement &#8220;will protect consumer choices and
ensure they have full and truthful information about their
data.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement is part of an effort to resolve legal issues
that could be a distraction as Facebook moves toward an initial
public offering, said Francis Gaskins, president of Los Angeles-
based IPODesktop.com, a Web site that tracks IPOs. Facebook is
considering an IPO that would raise $10 billion and value the
company at more than $100 billion, a person familiar with the
matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog posting, Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark
Zuckerberg said the company should have been more vigilant in
protecting users&#8217; privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m the first to admit that we&#8217;ve made a bunch of
mistakes,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geronzi, Arpe Convicted in Parmalat-Related Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Italian court convicted bankers Cesare Geronzi and
Matteo Arpe in a case related to the 2003 bankruptcy of Parmalat
SpA (PLT), Radiocor news agency reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geronzi was sentenced to five years in jail, while Arpe was
given a sentence of three years and seven months by the court in
Parma, Radiocor said. The bankers were accused of fraudulent
bankruptcy connected to the sale of water company Ciappazzi to
Parmalat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ennio Amodio, a lawyer for Geronzi, termed the sentencing
&#8220;profoundly unfair,&#8221; Radiocor said. Both of the bankers
previously have denied any wrongdoing. Spokesmen for Geronzi and
Arpe weren&#8217;t immediately available for comment when contacted by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortress Credit Suit Against Dechert Thrown Out on Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dechert LLP won an appeal dismissing a lawsuit by Fortress
Investment Group LLC (FIG) that claimed the law firm issued a false
opinion letter endorsing a transaction with convicted lawyer
Marc Dreier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortress claimed the 2008 letter caused it to lend $50
million to what it believed was the firm of Sheldon Solow, a New
York developer who was a client of Dreier&#8217;s defunct firm, Dreier
LLP. Dreier, 61, is serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison
after pleading guilty to selling more than $400 million in phony
notes to hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state appeals court in Manhattan yesterday reversed a
ruling in which a lower-court judge declined to dismiss
Fortress&#8217;s claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As Dreier was Solow Realty&#8217;s attorney and the guarantor
of the loan, defendant had no reason to suspect that Solow
Realty was not in fact a party to the loan transaction or that
Dreier forged the signatures of its principal and CEO,&#8221; a
unanimous five-judge panel said yesterday in an opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This decision is of tremendous importance to the lawyers
and law firms who give closing legal opinions, a fundamental
aspect of many financial transactions,&#8221; said Joel Miller, lead
counsel for Dechert. Miller said Fortress tried to use the
Dechert letter as an &#8220;insurance policy against anything going
wrong with the transaction, including Fortress&#8217;s own lack of due
diligence which allowed it be defrauded by Marc Dreier.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dechert told Fortress that it was acting as &#8216;special
corporate counsel&#8217; to Solow Realty in the transaction -- a
statement that Fortress relied on in entering into the
transaction and that proved to be utterly false,&#8221; Marc
Kasowitz, who represents Fortress in the case, said in a
statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreier&#8217;s firm, which had 250 attorneys, filed for
bankruptcy protection in December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fortress Credit Corp. v. Dechert, 603819/2009,
New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First
Department (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On The Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen Stanford Mental Fitness Hearing Scheduled for Dec. 20 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford, the Texas financier accused of leading a
$7 billion investment fraud, faces a Dec. 20 hearing to
determine whether he is mentally fit to stand trial next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, returned to Houston earlier this month after
an almost nine-month stay at a U.S. Bureau of Prisons hospital
at Butner, North Carolina. He was treated there for a dependency
on anti-anxiety drugs given to him in prison and evaluated for
the after-effects of a head injury sustained in a jailhouse
assault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houston U.S. District Judge David Hittner yesterday
scheduled the competency hearing to determine if Stanford can
assist in his defense. In a separate order, the judge said
Stanford&#8217;s criminal trial would start with jury selection on
Jan. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former chairman and chief executive officer of Houston-
based Stanford Group Co. is accused of misleading investors
about the nature and oversight of certificates of deposit issued
by his Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, who maintains his innocence, has been in custody
since June 2009, when he was indicted by a federal grand jury in
Houston. The court has twice postponed previously scheduled
trial dates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ali Fazel, one of his defense attorneys, yesterday declined
to comment on the hearing and trial dates, citing an earlier
order from Hittner barring attorneys from discussing the case
publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a request for comment on the trial date.
She has previously declined to comment because of the gag order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09cr342, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP&#8217;s Macondo Legal Proceedings May Last to 2014 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc&#8217;s legal proceedings over the Macondo well that
caused the worst U.S. oil spill may last into 2014, Citigroup
Inc. (C) said, citing the company&#8217;s lead lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blame for the accident will likely be apportioned in late
2013, with punishment decided the following year. That&#8217;s later
than analyst Alastair Syme had expected and is &#8220;slightly more
favorable&#8221; for the company than an earlier decision, he said in
a research note published yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP has set aside about $40 billion for costs from the
disaster that spewed almost 5 million barrels of oil into the
Gulf of Mexico last year. Shares are down more than 30 percent
since the spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is still a risk that ultimate fines and penalties
could be above BP&#8217;s current financial provisioning,&#8221; Syme
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is counting on $5 billion in fines and $7
billion in compensation. If BP is found to be grossly negligent,
its costs may rise by another $10 billion, Syme said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
and most-profitable U.S. bank, is damping employees&#8217; salary and
bonus expectations as the lender wraps up year-end performance
reviews, said three executives familiar with the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers are telling workers at the New York-based firm
that total average compensation may be lower to unchanged from
last year and that year-end bonuses mostly will depend on the
company&#8217;s profit (JPM) and the performance of their divisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which posted a record $17.4 billion in net income
last year, may earn $19.1 billion in 2011 even as revenue and
profit margins shrink, according to projections by 12 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey. Average 2011 compensation for the bank&#8217;s
256,000 employees will drop or stagnate as the company resists
an industry trend of mass layoffs, the people said. Financial
companies have cut more than 200,000 jobs worldwide this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Firms are going to have to base bonuses much more on
merit than strategy,&#8221; Paul Sorbera, president of Wall
Street executive search firm Alliance Consulting, said yesterday
in a phone interview. &#8220;There are groups and departments that
will do well, and groups and departments not doing well, that&#8217;s
where you see challenges to the bonus pool.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees in JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank are bracing for a
smaller-than-usual share of the bonus pool, even as net income
for the division during the first nine months of the year
climbed 18 percent to $6.1 billion from a year earlier, said one
of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the
company&#8217;s compensation practices aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board of directors, led by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, opted to exclude certain paper gains from
its performance equations, such as a so-called debt-valuation
adjustment that added $1.9 billion of pretax profit to the
investment bank&#8217;s third-quarter results, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit, which had 26,615 employees at the end of
September, set aside $7.71 billion for compensation in the first
three quarters, a 2 percent drop from a year earlier. The
expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and benefits, was
enough to give each of the division&#8217;s employees $289,611 for the
first nine months of this year, compared with average
compensation of $298,866 for the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the bank isn&#8217;t planning layoffs, &#8220;we always trim our
sails,&#8221; Dimon, 55, told reporters during an Oct. 13 conference
call. The unit reduced its workforce 4 percent in the third
quarter from the previous three-month period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will be &#8220;squeezing a little bit here and
squeezing a little bit there&#8221; to further trim staff at the
investment bank by about 1,000 people, or &#8220;maybe a little bit
more,&#8221; in the next 18 months, Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-Card Unit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average bonuses for employees in JPMorgan&#8217;s asset
management division, which is projected to have weaker year-end
results, also will be lower than last year, one of the people
said. Executives in JPMorgan&#8217;s credit-card unit, where profit
more than doubled, may see bonuses rise slightly due to their
division&#8217;s stronger overall performance, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average compensation figures are derived by dividing the
overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and they
don&#8217;t represent individual workers&#8217; actual pay. Investment banks
set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and typically
decide bonuses at year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every week since August has brought news of firings
by the world&#8217;s biggest banks. HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe&#8217;s
biggest lender, announced that month it would eliminate 30,000
jobs by the end of 2013. In September, Bank of America Corp.,
the second-biggest U.S. lender, said it would cut the same
number of jobs. Both banks are trimming about 10 percent of
their employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas, France&#8217;s largest bank, said this month that it
will cut about 1,400 jobs at its corporate and investment-
banking unit, and UniCredit SpA, Italy&#8217;s biggest lender, said it
plans to eliminate 6,150 positions by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The firms that are stable and are performing well overall
have some retention strength versus firms that are struggling,
so that gives them a little flexibility on how deep they have to
go on layoffs and how much they&#8217;re able to allocate to
bonuses,&#8221; Sorbera said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and HSBC
Holdings Plc forecast that China will cut interest rates in
2012, putting the banks at odds with most of their rivals, who
see elevated inflation preventing a reduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&#8217;s Bank of China reduced lenders&#8217; reserve
requirements on Nov. 30 for the first time since 2008 as
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis deepened. Eleven economists of 20 in a
Bloomberg News survey conducted yesterday and today say rates
will stay unchanged through next year and another four predict
increases. Goldman and HSBC are among five that see cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s challenge in loosening monetary policy is to
sustain the expansion of the world&#8217;s second-largest economy
without spurring price gains, fueling bad loans or reigniting a
real estate boom that has started to deflate. Inflation will
remain too high for the benchmark one-year deposit rate to be
lowered from the current 3.5 percent, according to Mizuho
Securities Asia Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The authorities should be careful that the loosening does
not go too far in order to prevent a repeat of mistakes during
the 2008 global financial crisis,&#8221; said Ma Xiaoping, a Beijing-
based economist with HSBC. Ma said rates may be cut after
inflation falls below 3 percent in the second half of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Asia, policy makers are moving to preserve growth.
In Tokyo, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda yesterday ordered a
fourth extra budget, a step unprecedented since postwar
reconstruction, while Thailand cut interest rates this week and
Indonesia did the same on Nov. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending Cuts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a signal that Japan's post-earthquake rebound may be
fading, companies cut spending at a faster pace in the most
recent quarter, data released in Tokyo showed today. Capital
spending fell 9.8 percent from a year earlier, the Finance
Ministry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index swung between gains and losses
and was little changed at 11:11 a.m. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data due today may show the U.S. jobless rate holding
steady at 9 percent, according to analysts&#8217; median estimate.
A better-than-forecast manufacturing expansion reported
yesterday indicated the world&#8217;s largest economy is weathering
the crisis that prompted a Federal Reserve-led effort this week
to ease borrowing costs for financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the euro area, a report today may show that producer-
price inflation cooled as austerity measures and weakness in
global demand threaten to trigger a recession in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse Than Lehman &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The current crisis is grimmer and more challenging than
the global financial crisis triggered by the Lehman Brothers
bankruptcy in 2008,&#8221; Zhu Guangyao, a Chinese vice finance
minister, said at a forum in Beijing yesterday. &#8220;So the most
imperative task now is to try our best to stimulate global
economic growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC&#8217;s Ma said three more reserve-ratio cuts are likely in
the first half of next year, along with tax breaks and fiscal
stimulus, after a report yesterday indicated Chinese
manufacturing contracted for the first time since March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While China&#8217;s inflation has slowed to 5.5 percent from a
three-year high of 6.5 percent in July, the rate remains 2
percentage points higher than the one-year deposit rate,
discouraging saving and adding to the risk of asset bubbles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Inflation will decline quickly in coming months as
cooling economic growth caps demand,&#8221; said Song Yu, a Beijing-
based economist for Goldman, who says a rate reduction may come
in the second quarter of 2012, when year-on-year consumer-price
gains may fall below the level of the benchmark deposit rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC sees the one-year lending rate falling by a quarter
percentage point to 6.31 percent in the second half of 2012,
with the deposit rate declining to 3.25 percent. Credit Agricole
CIB, Capital Economics Ltd. and Hang Seng Bank also see cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property Slowdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides weakness in export demand, China&#8217;s real-estate
market is cooling because of a government campaign to limit the
risk of asset bubbles and make housing more affordable after
record lending in 2009 and 2010 triggered price gains. Property
risks overshadow the economy as declines in home sales threaten
to trigger developer collapses, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Monetary easing and more expansionary fiscal policy is
necessary to avoid a sharp downturn as external uncertainty is
increasing and domestic growth momentum slowing,&#8221; said Shen Jianguang, an economist at Mizuho who previously worked for the
International Monetary Fund. &#8220;Yet, inflation remains high and
is expected to stay above 4 percent next year which could be
still too uncomfortable for an interest rate cut.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark rates have been on hold since July after five
increases that began in October last year. Deutsche Bank AG and
Morgan Stanley are in the majority arguing that the central
bank&#8217;s pause will continue through 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Excessive Speculation&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG says the reserve-ratio move is
policy fine-turning and not a reversal of a monetary stance that
the government describes as &#8220;prudent.&#8221; Credit Suisse, Mizuho,
Citigroup Inc. and Australia  New Zealand Banking Group predict
interest rates will rise by the end of next year, the survey
showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deposit rates are too low, fueling &#8220;excessive&#8221;
speculation in financial assets and making an increase
inevitable,  Dong Tao, a Credit Suisse economist in Hong Kong,
said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The half percentage point reserve-requirement cut that
takes effect on Dec. 5 may pump about 350 billion yuan ($55
billoin) into the financial system, according to an estimate by
UBS AG. In yesterday&#8217;s survey, Capital Economics forecast five
more reductions in reserve ratios before the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The speed at which the euro-zone crisis is escalating
suggests external conditions will be more challenging over the
next year than previously seemed likely,&#8221; Mark Williams, a
London-based economist for Capital Economics, said in a note.
&#8220;In turn, policymakers are likely to respond more forcefully.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) didn&#8217;t report to
Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator that hydrogen sulfide was mixed with the
crude it was producing at a well in the Frade field off the
coast of Rio de Janeiro, said Magda Chambriard, a director at
the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gas was discovered when ANP, as the regulator is known,
started investigating an oil spill at the well last month,
Chambriard said at an event in Rio de Janeiro today, according
to the regulator&#8217;s press office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said ANP ordered it to close down one of its 11
production wells and four water injection wells at the offshore
field, according to a statement distributed by Business Wire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The production well cited by the ANP accounts for less
than 10 percent of Frade&#8217;s total production of about 79,000
barrels per day,&#8221; Chevron said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was fined 50 million reais ($27.8 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities for the spill, which
occurred Nov. 7 about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of
Rio de Janeiro. An estimated 3,000 barrels leaked, Haroldo Lima,
head of Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator, Agencia Nacional do Petroleo,
said Nov. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in today&#8217;s statement that it&#8217;s working
with Brazilian government agencies to address issues related to
its operations in the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) were among five banks sued by
Massachusetts for allegedly conducting unlawful foreclosures and
deceiving homeowners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley filed the
lawsuit today against the three banks, as well as Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) and Ally Financial Inc., in state court in Boston. She
accused the banks of engaging in unfair and deceptive trade
practices in violation of state law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stakes could not be higher at this stage of the
game,&#8221; Coakley said at a press conference in Boston. &#8220;The
foreclosure crisis continues to be at the root of the economic
mess that we find ourselves in and our inability to turn it
around.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State attorneys general across the U.S. have been
negotiating a possible settlement with the five banks that would
resolve a probe into foreclosure practices that began more than
a year ago following disclosures that faulty documents were
being used to seize homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and federal officials are aiming to reach a deal that
would provide mortgage relief to homeowners and set requirements
for the ways mortgage servicers conduct home foreclosures and
interact with borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Enforceable Relief&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coakley today blamed the banks for failure to reach a deal,
saying they hadn&#8217;t offered &#8220;meaningful and enforceable relief&#8221;
to homeowners for harm they have caused. With a settlement still
out of reach more than a year after all 50 states announced
their investigation into bank practices, Coakley said, she
decided to file her lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have had more than a year to show they&#8217;ve understood
their role and the need to show their accountability for this
economic mess, and they failed to do so,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, California Attorney General Kamala Harris
said she was withdrawing from the talks, saying a proposed
settlement was &#8220;inadequate&#8221; and would allow too few California
homeowners to stay in their homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Stumpf, chairman and chief executive officer of San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo, said in a CNBC interview today that
he&#8217;s disappointed the lawsuit was filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve worked hard to come to an agreement that I think
would be good for the country and good for housing,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We can work through that better together than working it out
in court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;In Good Faith&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based Ally, said its
GMAC Mortgage unit, which was named as a defendant, will fight
the lawsuit and has worked &#8220;in good faith&#8221; with Coakley&#8217;s
office during the past year to discuss mortgage servicing and
ways to assist borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who is leading
negotiations with the banks for the states, said today in a
statement from his office that he&#8217;s optimistic a settlement will
be reached &#8220;on terms that will be in the interests of
Massachusetts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coakley said the banks moved to seize Massachusetts homes
when they had no legal authority do so because they didn&#8217;t hold
the mortgage on the properties. Failure to obtain valid mortgage
assignments before foreclosure has affected titles to
&#8220;hundreds, if not thousands, of properties&#8221; in the state, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Strung Along&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks also deceived and misled homeowners about loan
modifications, the attorney general said in a statement. The
servicers &#8220;often strung along borrowers for months&#8221; in trial
modifications before rejecting their attempts to modify loans,
according to Coakley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are also accused of engaging in &#8220;robosigning,&#8221; in
which foreclosure paperwork is signed without verification of
the information in the documents. The practice was also used in
the transfer of mortgages, Coakley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we do not do this, we are stuck in this downward
spiral of more foreclosures in a way that is totally
counterproductive to the economy,&#8221; she said at the press
conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit also names Merscorp Inc., which runs a mortgage
registry used by banks, as a defendant. According Coakley, the
banks undermined the public land record system through the use
of the registry, which tracks servicing rights and ownership
interests in mortgage loans. Merscorp spokeswoman Karmela Lejarde said in an e-mail that the system complies with
Massachusetts law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Disappointed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan, said
the bank is disappointed Massachusetts sued while settlement
negotiations with state and federal officials continue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to believe that collaborative resolution
rather than continued litigation will most quickly heal the
housing market and help drive economic recovery,&#8221; Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup hasn&#8217;t had time to review the lawsuit, Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said in an e-
mail. The company has been cooperating with the attorney
general, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Bank of
America N.A., 11-4363, Suffolk County Superior Court (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline in Los
Angeles traded at a discount to futures for a second consecutive
day after Chevron Corp. (CVX) started units at the El Segundo refinery
in Southern California following a power failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in Los Angeles was unchanged at a discount of 0.88
cent a gallon versus gasoline futures traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 4:10 p.m. New York time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel fell to a discount in Los
Angeles yesterday for the first time since Nov. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s 279,000-barrel-a-day El Segundo plant,
California&#8217;s largest oil refinery, was bringing process units
back to normal operating rates after high Santa Ana winds
knocked out power to the plant last night, Rod Spackman, a
company spokesman based in El Segundo, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This short disruption will not affect our ability to
supply products to our customers in Southern California,&#8221;
Spackman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was scheduled to return a fluid catalytic cracking
unit at the El Segundo plant to service earlier this week after
repairs, according to a person familiar with the work. The
company also started a crude unit at the 240,000-barrel-a-day

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s $10.7 billion
cholesterol pill Lipitor gained a rival today after Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) was cleared by U.S. regulators to sell copies
of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, lost on another
front when WellPoint (WLP) Inc., the largest insurer by enrollment,
said it will support use of a generic version by its members by
assigning a lower co-pay to the copycat than to the brand drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance for Ranbaxy,
India&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, followed a dispute over whether the
company could produce the copies given questions about its
manufacturing plants. A deal to share profits with Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), the world&#8217;s biggest generic-drug
maker based in Israel, helped overcome that hurdle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA approval gives Ranbaxy exclusive rights to sell
copies for 180 days, competing with Lipitor and a Pfizer-
authorized version marketed by Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)
Pfizer took advantage of Ranbaxy&#8217;s dispute with regulators by
making agreements with insurers to block competing generic
versions in return for price cuts for the branded medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Had it been a clear situation that Ranbaxy would not have
been able to make it, they could have commanded a better
price,&#8221; said Jason Gerberry, an analyst with Leerink Swann 
Co. in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copycat Revenue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copycat Lipitor may generate as much as $650 million for
Ranbaxy in its first 180 days of sale, according to the median
estimate of five Mumbai-based analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy, 64 percent-owned by Daiichi Sankyo Co. and based
near New Delhi, sought to convince the FDA that approval
shouldn&#8217;t be thwarted by an ongoing dispute about plant
violations in India. The FDA approval may have been contingent
on the Teva deal, said Bino Pathiparampil, an analyst at IIFL
Ltd. in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source for the active ingredient is approved to be
produced in two sites, one of which is a Ranbaxy plant in
Toansa, India, Sandy Walsh, a spokeswoman for FDA, said in an e-
mail. The other is undisclosed as part of Ranbaxy&#8217;s confidential
application, she said. The generic, known as atorvastatin, will
be manufactured by the company&#8217;s unit in New Brunswick, New
Jersey, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva isn&#8217;t providing the active ingredient, Denise Bradley,
a spokeswoman for the Israeli drugmaker, said in an e-mail. A
spokesman at Ranbaxy declined to elaborate and terms of the
companies&#8217; agreement haven&#8217;t been disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva&#8217;s Cut &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Meyers, chief executive officer of Arcoda Capital
Management in New York, estimated Teva will receive 35 percent
of Ranbaxy profit from generic Lipitor during the first six
months that the Indian drugmaker has the rights to exclusively
sell it. That would make Teva&#8217;s cut equivalent to $105 million
in revenue, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy gained 2 percent to 443.15 rupees at the close in
Mumbai, paring a gain of as much as 11 percent. The Bombay Stock
Exchange&#8217;s India Healthcare Index lost 0.3 percent. New York-
based Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $20.03 at the close in
New York trading. The stock had gained 14 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA granted Teva tentative approval today for its
version of generic Lipitor. Teva plans to begin selling the
product in May, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s marketing strategy includes agreements with the
health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc., of Minnetonka,
Minnesota, and the pharmacy benefit manager Catalyst Health
Solutions Inc. (CHSI), of Rockville, Maryland, to block the copycat
versions in return for lower prices on brand-name Lipitor.
Pfizer&#8217;s effort has had mixed results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WellPoint, Wal-Mart &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WellPoint, based in Indianapolis, today said it would favor
Watson&#8217;s copy with a $10 to $15 co-payment, charging patients
$20 to $35 for brand-name Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), the world&#8217;s largest retailer, also
said today it began offering the Watson version of Lipitor to
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is &#8220;trying to squeeze the last drops of juice out
of the once-fat orange,&#8221; said Erik Gordon, a business professor
at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who follows the
industry, said in an e-mail. &#8220;The real game at Pfizer is to
sell off units (PFE), cut RD and use the cash to prop up the stock
price with buybacks and dividends. It&#8217;s financial engineering
from a company run by an accountant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer plans to divest its animal health and nutritionals
units, which generated $5.44 billion in revenue last year. The
money is to be used for share buybacks, Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejection of Strategy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s in the best economic interests of our members for
several manufacturers to make atorvastatin,&#8221; Kristin Binns, a
WellPoint spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The agreement applies
to the company&#8217;s 10.5 million-person commercial market, as well
as the insurer&#8217;s Medicare patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three U.S. senators said yesterday in a letter sent to
Pfizer that they&#8217;ll look into the drugmaker&#8217;s agreements with
the insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. They&#8217;re questioning
whether the deals will artificially prop up patient costs, the
letter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By working with manufacturers to push brand-name drugs,
drug-benefit companies may be abusing Medicare to boost their
profits and denying generic alternatives to patients -- a
practice that needs to end immediately,&#8221; said Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who leads the Finance Committee, in a
statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTC Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senators&#8217; letter follows a demand by Maryland
Democratic Representative John Sarbanes that the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission review the agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Teva, approval of Ranbaxy&#8217;s Lipitor copy is a
psychological positive, said Leerink Swann&#8217;s Gerberry. It&#8217;s a
&#8220;modest negative&#8221; for Pfizer and Watson, he said in a note to
clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The uncertainty of Ranbaxy&#8217;s situation created a segment
of customers that held off on procuring normal inventory
stocking in the hope that Ranbaxy would get approved and offer
lower pricing,&#8221; Gerberry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva said on Nov. 2 that if it manages to introduce an
&#8220;important undisclosed product&#8221; in the fourth quarter, the
company would meet the upper range of a forecast of earnings
excluding some costs of $4.92 to $5.02 a share this year.
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analysts speculated in a report last
month that the new product was Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy may have sought a marketing deal with Petach Tikva,
Israel-based Teva in case it didn&#8217;t win timely approval, said
Priti Arora, an analyst at Kotak Institutional Securities in
Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is something more in this deal than meets the
eye,&#8221; Arora said in a telephone interview. &#8220;My feeling is that
they allied with Teva as a backup measure in case approval was
held back due to its manufacturing issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson began selling a copy of Lipitor in the U.S. at 12:01
a.m. New York time yesterday under the agreement with Pfizer.
Watson&#8217;s version didn&#8217;t require FDA clearance because Pfizer is
providing the drug to sell without the brand label in return for
a share of the revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the first generic to challenge Pfizer&#8217;s patent, Ranbaxy
is allowed six months under a 1984 law before other generic
versions can come on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Teva&#8217;s approval, Mylan Inc. of Canonsburg,
Pennsylvania and Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories Ltd. of Hyderabad,
India are among those seeking FDA clearance to sell Lipitor
copies after Ranbaxy&#8217;s six-month exclusivity expires, according
to U.S. court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing Defects &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. enforcement actions against Ranbaxy, India&#8217;s
biggest drugmaker, began in 2008 when the FDA cited
manufacturing defects at two of the company&#8217;s plants in India
and subsequently barred the company from importing about 30
different drugs. The following year, the agency said one of
those plants, in Paonta Sahib, India, falsified data used in
drug applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making generic Lipitor in the U.S. instead of India will
reduce the amount of profit Ranbaxy makes on each dollar of
sales, Kotak&#8217;s Arora said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Margins for manufacturing in India are around 60 percent
compared to about 40 percent from the U.S.,&#8221; she said. The
brokerage had estimated Ranbaxy would generate $560 million in
generic-Lipitor sales during the six months of exclusivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In approving the deal, Janet Woodcock, director of the
FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a
statement it was  &#8220;important to have affordable treatment
options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index will
end next year at 1,250 as a stagnating U.S. economy damps
valuation increases for equities, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s
David Kostin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kostin, the New York-based strategist at the firm, lifted
his estimate for earnings by companies in the benchmark stock
measure to $100 a share in 2012 from $98, according to a note
dated yesterday. He boosted his projection for combined profit
this year by $1 to $97. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 declined 0.9 percent this year through
yesterday amid concern European officials will fail to tame the
region&#8217;s debt crisis, triggering a global recession. The gauge&#8217;s
price-earnings multiple based on estimated profit for the next
year has averaged 12.9 times this year and fell as low as 11
times on Oct. 3, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.S. economy remains in stagnation,&#8221; Kostin said.
&#8220;This fact will limit any significant rally or sustained P/E
expansion in the SP 500 (SPX) in 2012. The high degree of political
uncertainty coupled with downside policy tail risk drives our
view that equity investors should focus on the underlying
fundamentals and position portfolios for the worst while hoping
for the best.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell 0.2 percent to 1,244.58 at 4 p.m. New York
time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowest Estimate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kostin&#8217;s projection for the SP 500 in 2012 is 0.4 percent
higher than the index&#8217;s closing level today. His estimate is the
lowest out of six strategists&#8217; forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.
The average estimate is for the benchmark equity measure to
climb to 1,398, according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs predicts the U.S. economy will post its fifth
straight year of economic stagnation in 2012 with growth at 1.5
percent. Kostin&#8217;s team examined 17 periods of prolonged low
economic growth in countries since 1980 and found P/E multiples
&#8220;tend to stay flat&#8221; during these times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the euro could wipe 25 percent in value
from stocks, driving the SP 500 to 900, Kostin said in the
note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The European sovereign debt and banking crises likely
will be resolved during the next six months,&#8221; he wrote in the
note. &#8220;The euro situation must be resolved in order for tail
risk to recede and allow the possibility for share prices to
advance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walton Street Capital LLC hired CBRE
Group Inc. to sell 95 industrial properties that it acquired for
about $2.8 billion in 2007, when commercial real estate prices
peaked, as a debt payment on the buildings comes due in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties are 82 percent leased, according to a CBRE
marketing document, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg
News. Occupancy was 91 percent when Chicago-based Walton Street
bought the buildings, known as the CalWest portfolio, Real
Estate Alert reported at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property owners have had difficulty refinancing debt amid
the decline in U.S. real estate values from their highs and
upheaval in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market
since July. Walton Street has a $2.45 billion loan repayment
deadline in June. Blackstone Group LP (BX), the world&#8217;s largest
private-equity firm, has acquired almost $600 million of debt on
the buildings, putting it in a position to take control if the
borrower defaults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Walton Street would have to come up with a lot more money
to hang onto this,&#8221; said Dan Fasulo, managing director at Real
Capital Analytics Inc., a property-research firm in New York.
&#8220;The problem is they bought this portfolio very much at the
height of the market, and I&#8217;m not sure these assets are worth
that anymore.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial real estate prices in the U.S. have fallen 42
percent from their peak in October 2007, according to an index
compiled by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Properties &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton Street paid about $120 per square foot for the
CalWest properties, which total 23.4 million square feet (2.2
million square meters) and are mostly located in California.
While it&#8217;s difficult to generalize, Fasulo estimates industrial
assets are now valued at about $80 to $100 per square foot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re actually fortunate that most of the assets are in
California, where there is significant demand,&#8221; Fasulo said.
&#8220;They&#8217;re hoping someone will come along and see the value and
help them work out of a difficult situation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Mogentale, managing principal at Walton Street, didn&#8217;t
respond to telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment.
Christy Ingle, a spokeswoman for CBRE, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portfolio is made up of single-building and
multibuilding warehouses and business parks. There are 527
buildings in all and one land parcel, according to the CBRE
document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Port Cities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the properties are located in or near port cities,
including in Orange County, California; Los Angeles; Oakland,
California; San Diego; Seattle; and Portland, Oregon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton Street bought the assets from a joint venture of the
California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System and Deutsche Bank
AG&#8217;s RREEF unit. The acquisition was funded with the $2.45
billion loan from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Barclays
Capital Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. About $275 million of
debt was packaged into bonds and sold to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some industrial property owners tried unsuccessfully to
sell assets earlier this year, Fasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After the market got hot earlier in the year, there were
a handful of major industrial offerings that came to market and
the buyers basically pushed back,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A lot of stuff
fell apart.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The liquidator of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s
firm, who lost the right to demand $19 billion in damages from
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), can appeal the ruling to a higher court, a
judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last month won dismissal of trustee Irving Picard&#8217;s damage claims in his lawsuit alleging the biggest U.S.
bank aided Madoff&#8217;s fraud. Picard can&#8217;t sue for common-law
damages on behalf of the defunct Madoff firm&#8217;s customers, U.S.
District Judge Colleen McMahon ruled in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge directed a clerk to enter a final judgment
dismissing eight claims from Picard&#8217;s complaint and said he can
appeal the ruling under a deal struck with JPMorgan, according
to court papers. Her decision followed a telephone conference
yesterday, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard agreed to put his remaining claims against JPMorgan
on hold while he appeals. He told McMahon in a filing last month
he has &#8220;no choice but to appeal the order.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Permitting an immediate appeal would provide much-needed
finality for the trustee and the BLMIS estate as to the
viability of these claims,&#8221; he said. BLMIS refers to Madoff&#8217;s
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rulings by district judges McMahon and Jed Rakoff have
knocked more than $28 billion off of Picard&#8217;s claims against
banks and may cost him as much as $11 billion in recoveries from
other cases to benefit investors who lost money in the Ponzi
scheme, according to the trustee&#8217;s estimates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of a record cotton
crop and falling consumption will expand global stockpiles by
the most since 2005, driving further declines in the price of
this year&#8217;s worst-performing commodity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvests will increase 7.5 percent to 123.89 million 480-
pound bales (27 million metric tons) in the 12 months ending in
July, as demand drops to a three-year low of 114.27 million
bales, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. Prices may
decline 15 percent to 77 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York by the end of next year, from 91.1 cents now, based on
the median of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a double whammy,&#8221; said James Dailey, who manages
$215 million of assets at TEAM Financial Management LLC in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. &#8220;Cotton is facing the worst-case
nightmare for a commodity, where you have a glut in physical
production combined with weakening demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotton fell 58 percent since reaching an all-time high of
$2.197 in March as investors bet that prices would curb demand
and encourage supply. Output is rising from Australia to China
to India, more than compensating for a U.S. decline caused by
the worst crop conditions since the dust bowl era of the 1930s.
Speculators in U.S. futures are now the least bullish in 2-1/2
years, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic growth is forecast by the International Monetary
Fund to slow next year from Europe to China to the Middle East,
potentially curbing the consumption of commodities. Clothing
manufacturers including Levi Strauss  Co. are already starting
to cut prices to stimulate demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Index of Equities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&#8217;s 37 percent decline in prices means cotton fell
the most among 24 commodities in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI
gauge, which advanced 3.2 percent. The fiber rose the most in
2010, adding 92 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index of
equities dropped 8.8 percent since the end of December and
Treasuries returned 8.8 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index
shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotton will reach 85 cents in six months, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said in a report Nov. 10, reducing its previous
forecast of $1. The most widely held option on futures gives
holders the right to sell at 90 cents by Feb. 10, according to
ICE Futures U.S. data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and other speculators are holding a net-long
position, or bets on higher prices, of 11,985 futures and
options, the least since April 2009, CFTC data show. They have
been reducing their position since a peak of 81,336 contracts in
September 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water Supply &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s harvest, the biggest of any nation, is expanding
for the first time in four years, the USDA estimates. Output in
Australia may rise as much as 25 percent to a record as water
supply improves, Adam Kay, chief executive officer of Cotton
Australia, a Mascot, New South Wales-based producer&#8217;s group,
said in an interview Nov. 16. Exports from India, the second-
biggest shipper, may climb 14 percent, B.A. Patel, the country&#8217;s
joint textiles commissioner, told reporters Nov. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USDA cut its global demand forecast five times in the
past six months, on expectations that global growth is slowing.
Consumption contracted more than 11 percent in 2009, the most in
at least a half century, during the worst global slump since the
Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists don&#8217;t expect a repeat next year, with the
International Monetary Fund predicting global growth of 4
percent, unchanged from 2011. China, the biggest cotton
consumer, will expand 9 percent, and India, the second-largest,
7.5 percent, the Washington-based group estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Turbo Boost&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price slump since March may spur purchases by textile
makers after signs of improving consumer demand. U.S. retail
sales jumped to a record $52.4 billion during the four-day
Thanksgiving weekend through Nov. 27, according to the National
Retail Federation. More than 51 percent of shoppers bought
clothes, the Washington-based NRF said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mill demand must, at some point in time, catch up with
retail demand,&#8221; said O.A. Cleveland, an agricultural economist
and a professor emeritus in agricultural economics at
Mississippi State University. &#8220;It would be a turbo boost for
prices if we see Chinese mills spinning more cotton because it
means there&#8217;s actual demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China may be accelerating purchases to rebuild reserves
depleted this year by state sales aimed at containing inflation.
Imports reached a six-month high of 250,000 tons in September
and remained there in October, customs data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine Months &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gains in Chinese imports may not last. Production of
fabric in the nation fell 4.9 percent in September from a year
earlier and declined in eight of the past nine months, INTL
FCStone Inc. said in a report Nov. 8. Cotton-cloth exports
dropped 10.1 percent in September, a sign fabric production may
remain weaker into 2012, the New York-based trader and adviser
wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China will use 1.1 percent less cotton in the season ending
in July, Cotlook Ltd. said in a Nov. 17 report. The Birkenhead,
England-based research company also cut its demand forecasts for
the Indian subcontinent and Brazil and anticipates a &#8220;massive&#8221;
3.56 million-ton supply surplus, compared with 653,000 tons in
the previous year. Expectations that declining prices would spur
demand &#8220;have steadily faded,&#8221; Cotlook said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheaper cotton will help clothing manufacturers, who
contended this year with prices that averaged $1.365 a pound,
the most since at least 1958. Levi Strauss cut prices in the
third quarter to reduce inventory, Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen said in October. The San Francisco-based company had
raised prices in the past year in response to the surge in
cotton, and shoppers balked at the higher costs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Cotton-Price Hangover&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a cotton-price hangover that&#8217;s going to be with
us for a long time,&#8221; said Rogers Varner Jr., the president of
Varner Bros., a brokerage in Cleveland, Mississippi. &#8220;The price
increase earlier this year was so extreme. It was more than just
turmoil. It was upheaval.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz Claiborne Inc., the operator of the Juicy Couture and
Kate Spade clothing lines, is still suffering from the surge in
cotton, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Warren said on a
conference call Nov. 9. The New York-based company&#8217;s 2012
margins will be boosted after the slump in prices, Warren said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Historically, cotton wants to be between 50 cents and 80
cents, and that just seems to be the fair value for it,&#8221; said
Michael Smith, the president of TK Futures  Options in Port
St. Lucie, Florida. &#8220;Cotton ran up more than other commodities,
and so it still has a lot more correcting to do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey has the highest rates in
emerging Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) said, after it started following the country&#8217;s overnight
money market rates instead of the central bank&#8217;s benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman showed Turkish rates as the highest regionally
after switching from forecasting the one-week repo lending rate,
which the central bank labels as its benchmark rate, according
to the e-mailed report today. Goldman expects the overnight
rate, which it says is now the policy rate for Turkey, to
decline to 9.5 percent by the end of next year compared to the
current 11.27 percent, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect overnight Istanbul Stock Exchange interest
rates to hover around 13 percent over the next six months,&#8221;
Goldman economist for the region Ahmet Akarli said in the report
from London. &#8220;However, if we are right about Europe, the
central bank would likely ease policy once again in the second
half of 2012, as balance of payments pressures subside and the
lira finds better fundamental support. Between six to 12 months
therefore we expect the bank to ease overnight ISE rates to
around 9.5 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s central bank introduced a more flexible interest
rate policy on Oct. 26, lending to banks at rates between the
5.75 percent one-week repo rate and overnight rates of as much
as 12.5 percent. Governor Erdem Basci labeled the move as a rate
increase, though he said the 5.75 percent rate was still his
benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey now has the highest interest rates in the region
followed by Hungary on 6.5 percent and South Africa on 5.5
percent, Goldman said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank may widen its so-called interest rate
corridor to between 5 percent and 14 percent from between 5
percent and 12.5 percent to &#8220;reinforce tight monetary
conditions,&#8221; Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Turkey&#8217;s two-year lira bonds fell 7 basis points
to 10.32 percent at 5 p.m. in Istanbul. The yield was 9.62
percent before the central bank switched to its more flexible
policy in October. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WellPoint Inc. (WLP), the largest U.S.
health insurer by enrollment, won&#8217;t put Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s brand-name
Lipitor drug on its generics list and will instead favor a copy
made by Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI), Kristin Binns, a
spokeswoman for the insurer, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor, the cholesterol medication that is Pfizer&#8217;s
biggest product, began facing generic competition as of
yesterday. The drugmaker has been making agreements with
insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to favor its brand
version and block generic competitors in return for price cuts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red Bull GmbH, the Austrian energy-
drink maker, lost a court bid to stop a maker of Scalextric
racing games from putting its brand name on toy cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A court in Alicante, Spain, that frequently rules on
European Union trademark cases dismissed the complaint against
Tecnitoys Juguetes SA, Tomas Fornesa, a lawyer for the
Barcelona-based company, said by phone. Red Bull initially
sought 9 percent of game sales, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Bull&#8217;s sponsorships in car racing have included backing
Volkswagen AG&#8217;s entry in the Dakar Rally. Tecnitoys replicates
the advertising logos on the racing cars. The toymaker doesn&#8217;t
make a version of the Formula One cars from Red Bull&#8217;s two
Formula One teams, Fornesa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nobody buys our games for the Red Bull branding,&#8221;
Fornesa said. &#8220;That would be like someone buying a Real Madrid
soccer shirt because of the sponsor&#8217;s name.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tecnitoys and other Scalextric makers typically pay
licensing fees of 4 percent to 10 percent of sales to carmakers
including McLaren Group Ltd. and Daimler AG&#8217;s Mercedes Benz to
replicate their racing cars, Fornesa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Bull&#8217;s deadline to appeal has expired, Fornesa said.

Bull, didn&#8217;t return two e-mails seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Wins Australia Round of Apple Fight Over Tablet Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co., the world&#8217;s biggest smartphone
maker, scored a victory in its global patent dispute with Apple
Inc. (AAPL) as an Australian appeals court overturned a ban on the sale
of its tablet computer rivaling the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung can begin sales of its Galaxy Tab 10.1 in the
country starting Dec. 2, a federal appeals judge ruled
yesterday. A three-member appeal panel unanimously said a lower-
court judge made a mistake in granting Cupertino, California-
based Apple&#8217;s request for a ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple must file an emergency appeal against this verdict in
the Canberra-based High Court, the nation&#8217;s apex legal body, to
extend the ban. The Australia dispute is part of a conflict
between the companies on at least four continents that began in
April, when Apple sued Samsung in the U.S. and accused it of
&#8220;slavishly&#8221; copying the designs of iPhones and iPads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The removal of the injunction is a win for consumer
choice in the Australian tablet market,&#8221; Tim Renowden, an
analyst at researcher Ovum Plc, said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Samsung is not out of the Australian scrub yet&#8221; because the
removal of the ban still hinges on the High Court, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The High Court must decide before the end of business
tomorrow whether to grant Apple&#8217;s request to keep the ban in
place beyond that date. If it grants the request, Apple will
have 28 days from Nov. 30 to file a request to appeal the
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ruling clearly affirms that Apple&#8217;s legal claims lack
merit,&#8221; said Nam Ki Yung, a spokesman for Suwon, South Korea-
based Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple said &#8220;it&#8217;s no coincidence that Samsung&#8217;s latest
products look a lot like the iPhone and iPad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This kind of blatant copying is wrong and, as we&#8217;ve said
many times before, we need to protect Apple&#8217;s intellectual
property when companies steal our ideas,&#8221; the company said in
an e-mail after yesterday&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung is the second-largest component supplier for Apple.
The Korean company gets about 7.6 percent of its total revenue
from selling memory chips, displays and other components for the
iPhone and iPad, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) v. Apple Inc.

(Sydney). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Lipitor, Pfizer Slims Down to Push Mini-Blockbusters &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s (PFE) long dependence on the cholesterol pill
Lipitor to produce almost one-fifth of its revenue began eroding
yesterday when the drug&#8217;s patent protection ended in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step will be rebuilding the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker into a smaller, faster-moving company that focuses on
development of biologic drugs and specialty medicines while
expanding sales of existing products, such as Lipitor and the
erection drug Viagra, in emerging countries such as China,
executives said in interviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to be a one-product company,&#8221; said Geno Germano, Pfizer&#8217;s president of specialty care and oncology,
interviewed at the company&#8217;s New York headquarters. &#8220;We&#8217;re
poised to deliver significant new pipeline assets in the coming
year, and in coming years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 67 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $20.07 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday and has gained 15
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker is depending on four products to generate $4
billion in new revenue by 2014, Timothy Anderson, a Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. analyst in New York, said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugs are Prevnar, a bacterial infection vaccine gained
in Pfizer&#8217;s 2009 Wyeth purchase; the blood-thinner Eliquis, co-
developed with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY); the rheumatoid
arthritis drug tofacitinib; and the cancer drug Xalkori for non-
small-cell lung tumors. Pfizer is awaiting U.S. regulatory
approval on Eliquis and tofacitinib. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber-Security &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama Invokes Cold-War Law to Unmask Chinese Telecom Spyware &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is invoking Cold War-era national-security powers
to force telecommunication companies including ATT Inc. and
Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) to divulge confidential information
about their networks in a hunt for Chinese cyber-spying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a survey distributed in April, the U.S. Commerce
Department asked for a detailed accounting of foreign-made
hardware and software on the companies&#8217; networks. It also asked
about security-related incidents such as the discovery of
&#8220;unauthorized electronic hardware&#8221; or suspicious equipment
that can duplicate or redirect data, according to a copy of the
survey reviewed by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey represents &#8220;very high-level&#8221; concern that
China and other countries may be using their growing export
sectors to develop built-in spying capabilities in U.S.
networks, said a senior U.S. intelligence official who asked not
to be named because he wasn&#8217;t authorized to speak on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is beyond vague suspicions,&#8221; said Richard Falkenrath, a senior fellow in the Council on Foreign Relations
Cyberconflict and Cybersecurity Initiative. &#8220;Congress is now
looking at this as well, and they&#8217;re doing so based on very
specific material provided them in a classified setting&#8221; by the
National Security Agency, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey went to dozens of telecommunications companies,
software makers and information-security companies, including
some foreign firms, according to James Lewis, a cyber-security
expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or
CSIS, in Washington. Lewis said ATT (T) and Verizon Communications
were among the companies that received it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of the companies were hesitant to cooperate because
they had learned the Commerce Department unit handling the
survey had itself been hacked by the Chinese in 2006, creating
the possibility that company data provided might become known to
the Chinese, according to a former government official familiar
with the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Siegel, a spokesman for Dallas-based ATT, declined to
comment on security issues. Edward McFadden, a spokesman for New
York-based Verizon, said the company had received the survey and
declined to comment further. Eugene Cottilli, a Commerce
Department spokesman in Washington, had no immediate comment on
the survey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies Urged to Share Cyber Threats With U.S. in House Bill &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government and companies would be encouraged to
share information about cybersecurity threats and hacker attacks
under legislation unveiled by House Intelligence Committee
Chairman Mike Rogers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure would shield companies from lawsuits and public
disclosure requirements when they inform federal agencies about
their security vulnerabilities and the type of cyber attacks
they experienced, Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers have increased scrutiny of network security
in the wake of hacking incidents at companies including Sony
Corp. (6758) and Citigroup Inc. (C) The National Counterintelligence
Executive said last month that hackers and illicit programmers
in China and Russia are pursuing American industrial secrets,
jeopardizing an estimated $398 billion in U.S. research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers has accused the Chinese government of launching
attacks, saying at a hearing last month that attacks from China
have reached an &#8220;intolerable level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Executive Says Congress Should Address Online Taxes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Misener, Amazon.com Inc.&#8217;s vice president for global
public policy, urged Congress to set standards for collecting
state sales taxes from online merchants. Any exceptions to the
tax should be kept &#8220;very low&#8221; for fairness reasons, Misener
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misener spoke yesterday at a House Judiciary Committee
hearing. Seattle-based Amazon (AMZN), the largest online retailer, has
long battled attempts by states to levy sales taxes on Internet
transactions. Now it&#8217;s backing efforts to create a federal
standard for states to collect sales tax on online purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision exempted businesses from
collecting sales taxes in states in which they don&#8217;t have a
physical presence, or &#8220;nexus,&#8221; such as a store or warehouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That ruling has given Internet-based sellers an advantage
in the marketplace over brick-and-mortar retailers, said
Representative John Conyers of Michigan, the top Democrat on the
Judiciary Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Online retailers have, let&#8217;s face it, an unfair
advantage,&#8221; said Conyers, a co-sponsor of one of three pending
bills that would give states the ability to collect taxes on
sales by out-of-state vendors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue has divided online retailers. Executives from San
Jose, California-based EBay Inc. (EBAY) and Overstock.com (OSTK) of Salt Lake
City cautioned lawmakers against passing a measure that would
harm small businesses or saddle online retailers with added
expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon&#8217;s Misener said technology has advanced enough so
that all but the smallest sellers can manage sales tax
collections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix Viewing Seen Swelling U.S. Cable Bills Next Year &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) and U.S. pay-TV companies, weighing
how to profit from surging Internet demand spurred by Netflix
Inc. (NFLX) and Hulu, are on the verge of instituting new fees on Web-
access customers who use the service most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one major cable operator will institute so-called
usage-based billing next year, predicts Craig Moffett, an
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. He said Cox
Communications Inc., Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) or Time Warner
Cable may be first to charge Web-access customers for the amount
of data they consume, not just transmission speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As more video shifts to the Web, the cable operators will
inevitably align their pricing models,&#8221; Moffett said in an
interview. &#8220;With the right usage-based pricing plan, they can
embrace the transition instead of resisting it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. providers like Time Warner Cable have weighed usage-
based plans for years as a way to squeeze more profit from Web
access, and to counter slowing growth and rising program costs
in the TV business. While customer complaints hampered earlier
attempts, pay-TV companies are testing usage caps and price
structures that point to the advent of permanent fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re basically a broadband provider,&#8221; Peter Stern,
chief strategy officer for New York-based Time Warner Cable,
said Nov. 17 at the Future of Television conference in New York.
&#8220;As a convenience for our customers, we package and distribute
television and provide service around that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harlan Ellison Drops Suit Against Makers of &#8216;In Time&#8217; Movie &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harlan Ellison dropped a copyright suit against New Regency
Productions Inc. and screenwriter and director Andrew Niccol
that claimed the movie &#8220;In Time&#8221; was based on his story
&#8220;&#8216;Repent, Harlequin!&#8217; Said the Ticktockman.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Sept. 14 in federal court
in Los Angeles, &#8220;Repent, Harlequin!&#8221; is &#8220;one of the most famous
and widely published science fiction short stories ever
written.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellison claimed that the movie, which opened in October and
stars Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, used his story
without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 28, Adam Thurston, a lawyer in the Los Angeles
office of Drinker Biddle  Reath LLP, filed a motion withdrawing
the case with prejudice, meaning that the suit can&#8217;t be refiled.
Neither Thurston nor Vincent Cox, a lawyer from Leopold, Petrich
 Smith PC who represents the defendants, would say why the suit
was withdrawn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After seeing the film &#8216;In Time,&#8217; Harlan Ellison decided
to voluntarily dismiss the action,&#8221; the lawyers said in a joint
statement. &#8220;No payment or screen credit was promised or given to
Harlan Ellison. The parties wish each other well, and have no
further comment on the matter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Kilimanjaro Corp. v. New Regency Productions
Inc.,  2:11-cv-07575, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google to Begin Appeal of Italy Privacy Conviction in 2012 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) will begin an appeal as soon as January of a
conviction by an Italian court of two managers and a former
executive for violating privacy laws, said Peter Fleischer, the
company&#8217;s global privacy counsel and a defendant in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three were convicted in February by a Milan court on
charges related to a clip uploaded to Google Video in 2006 by a
group of Turin school students, who filmed themselves bullying
an autistic classmate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milan Judge Oscar Magi ruled that Fleischer, David
Drummond, Google&#8217;s senior vice president of corporate
development and a former chief financial officer, were guilty of
privacy violations. They were sentenced to six-month terms,
which were suspended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jill Pietrini, a trademark attorney and the chair of the
intellectual property practice group of Manatt, Phelps 
Phillips, is leaving the firm to join Sheppard Mullin Richter 
Hampton as a partner in its Century City, California, office.
Pietrini, 50, said she expects many of her clients -- including
Metallica and the online retailer Caf&#233; Press -- to follow her to
her new firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlo Van den Bosch, co-chair of Sheppard Mullin&#8217;s
intellectual property group, said Pietrini &#8220;will play an
important role in the future growth of our trademark practice.&#8221;
He added that the number of IP lawyers at the firm has grown to
about 70 from 40 in the past five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an e-mailed statement, Chad S. Hummel, chair of Manatt&#8217;s
litigation division, said &#8220;Jill is a fine lawyer and we wish
her well. Manatt has a vibrant and broad national IP practice,
which complements our business, entertainment and media, and
litigation practices. We will continue to grow this core
practice area.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

brought by the SEC. While U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New
York authorized the questioning of Blankfein before the April 9
criminal trial, he said depositions of the other officers must
be conducted afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who also sat on the board of Procter  Gamble Co.
and led McKinsey  Co., was indicted by a federal grand jury in
October on five counts of securities fraud and one count of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud for passing inside
information to Galleon co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. Rakoff is
presiding over Gupta&#8217;s criminal case as well as the SEC lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Blankfein, Rakoff granted SEC requests to
question Gary Rosenbach, Galleon&#8217;s co-founder, and Ian Horowitz,
a former trader who worked for Rajaratnam and was recorded on a
U.S. wiretap. The judge said lawyers may also depose three other
individuals associated with Galleon -- Ananth Muniyappa, Brock
Vandervliet and Leon Shaulov. Also to be deposed is Greg Ormond
of Exemplar Wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court sees no material argument whatsoever for
delaying the depositions,&#8221; Rakoff said in his ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 62, of Westport, Connecticut, was a close friend and
business associate of Rajaratnam, prosecutors said. He made
multimillion-dollar investments with the hedge fund manager and
also passed him inside information after attending Goldman Sachs
board meetings from 2008 through January 2009, according to the
indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on Rakoff&#8217;s ruling. John Nester, a spokesman
for the SEC, declined to immediately comment on the judge&#8217;s
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raj Rajaratnam was sentenced to 11 years in prison, the
longest ever for insider trading, after he was convicted earlier
this year. He is set to surrender to prison officials Dec. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, and SEC v. Gupta,
11-cv-07566, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appeals Panel to Review Bid to Return BofA Accord to State &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) persuaded a federal appeals
court to review its request to return an $8.5 billion bond
settlement with Bank of America Corp. to state court from
federal court for a judge&#8217;s approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Manhattan-based U.S. Court of Appeals in New York
yesterday granted the petition for expedited review. BlackRock
Inc. (BLK) had also asked the court to reverse U.S. District Judge
William Pauley&#8217;s ruling in October keeping the accord in federal
court for review, rather than remanding it to New York State
Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed agreement, first filed in New York state
court, would settle claims from investors in the mortgage bonds
of Countrywide Financial Corp., which Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America (BAC) bought in 2008. The deal was reached with
an institutional investor group that includes BlackRock and
Pacific Investment Management Co. and would apply to 530
mortgage-securitization trusts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Delay in the resolution of this appeal will prejudice the
institutional investors and other beneficiaries of the trusts,&#8221;
New York-based BlackRock said in papers filed with the appeals
court on Nov. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York, the trustee for the mortgage-bond trusts,
filed the settlement in state court and planned to seek approval
at a November hearing. Under the state proceeding, approval
would bind investors outside the group that negotiated the
agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investor group, Walnut Place LLC and related entities,
moved the case to federal court and is fighting a bid by Bank of
New York to return it to state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-4554, 11-4571, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA) Defeats Lawsuit Over Shine Group Acquisition Records &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rupert Murdoch and his News Corp. persuaded a judge to
throw out an investor lawsuit seeking information about the $675
million purchase of a U.K.-based television production company
owned by Murdoch&#8217;s daughter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge John Noble concluded that a
suit filed by an Illinois-based pension fund seeking to inspect
News Corp. documents about the purchase of Elisabeth Murdoch&#8217;s
Shine Group Ltd. was moot since it and other shareholders had
also sued the company&#8217;s directors over the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Central Laborers Pension Fund can no longer
&#8220;tender a proper purpose for pursuing efforts to inspect the
books and records of News Corp.&#8221; on the acquisition, Noble
ruled yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling comes as New York-based News Corp. continues to
be investigated and sued over claims that thousands of people&#8217;s
phones were hacked by its News of the World tabloid, which was
shuttered in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teri Everett, a News Corp. spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t return a
call for comment on Noble&#8217;s decision to throw out the investor
suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. officials announced in February the media
company would acquire Shine Group, which supplies television
content to U.K. TV companies including the British Broadcasting
Corp., in an all-stock deal valued at about $675 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Central Laborers Pension Fund v. News Corp, CA
6287, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ally Financial Units Sued by Insurer Over Mortgage Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ally Financial Inc., the auto and home lender that received
a government bailout, was sued by Financial Guaranty Insurance
Co., which claims Ally misrepresented the quality of mortgage
loans underlying securities that Financial Guaranty insured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lawsuits filed Nov. 29 in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan, Ally Financial&#8217;s GMAC Mortgage and Residential
Funding units are accused of breach of contract in connection
with policies issued by New York-based Financial Guaranty
related to about $3.8 billion worth of residential mortgage-
backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMAC Mortgage &#8220;fraudulently induced FGIC&#8217;s agreement to
provide this insurance through willful and material
misrepresentations and omissions concerning the nature of its
business practices and the credit quality of tens of thousands
of mortgage loans that provided the collateral&#8221; for securities,
Financial Guaranty said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are substantial legal and factual defenses related
to the FGIC claims and we intend to defend our position
aggressively,&#8221; Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based
Ally, said in an e-mail. &#8220;We have reviewed loan level &#8216;put-
back&#8217; claims from FGIC in the normal course as contractually
required and have met our contractual obligations at all times,
including repurchasing loans where a claim was valid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FGIC Corp., the holding company for Financial Guaranty
Insurance Co., sought bankruptcy protection from creditors in
August 2010 after suffering losses from the drop in the U.S.
housing market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. v. GMAC
Mortgage LLC, 653302/2011; Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. vs.
Residential Funding Co. LLC, 653303/2011; and Financial Guaranty
Insurance Co. vs. Residential Funding Co., 653304/2011, New York
State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penn State Sued by Man Alleging Years of Sandusky Sex Abuse &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania State University and its former assistant
football coach Jerry Sandusky were sued by an unidentified man
who claims Sandusky sexually abused him more than 100 times over
four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff sued yesterday as a John Doe in the
Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, saying he met Sandusky
through the Second Mile youth charity at the age of 10 and was
sexually abused from 1992 to 1996. The abuse occurred in and out
of Pennsylvania, including on university property, according to
the complaint. Second Mile, which Sandusky founded, is also a
defendant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandusky, 67, is charged with 40 criminal counts tied to
alleged sexual molestation of eight boys from 1994 to 2009. He
has denied wrongdoing. The plaintiff in yesterday&#8217;s suit, the
first against Penn State stemming from the Sandusky case,
accused Second Mile and the university of negligence in failing
to protect children from sexual abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t want other kids to be hurt and abused by Jerry
Sandusky, or anybody like Penn State to allow people like him to
do it -- rape kids!&#8221; the accuser said yesterday in a statement.
&#8220;I never told anybody what he did to me over 100 times at all
kinds of places until the newspapers reported that he had abused
other kids, and the people at Penn State and Second Mile didn&#8217;t
do the things they should have to protect me and the other
kids.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Amendola, an attorney for Sandusky, didn&#8217;t return a
phone call seeking comment on the suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa Powers, a spokeswoman for the State College,
Pennsylvania-based university, declined to comment on the suit,
saying the school hadn&#8217;t received the court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will review the lawsuit and respond appropriately when
we have done so,&#8221; Eric Herman, a spokesman for Second Mile,
said in an e-mail. &#8220;The Second Mile will adhere to its legal
responsibilities throughout this process. As always, our
thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTA Bank (BTAS) Seeks Jail for Ex-Chairman Ablyazov at U.K. Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTA Bank, the Kazakh lender that defaulted on $12 billion
of debt before restructuring last year, asked a U.K. judge to
jail its former chairman, Mukhtar Ablyazov, for contempt of
court in a fraud lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ablyazov, who fled Kazakhstan to escape prosecution and
lives in the U.K., violated a 2009 court order freezing his
assets by failing to reveal ownership in a Moscow skyscraper
project and more than 600 shell companies used to conceal his
wealth, BTA&#8217;s lawyer said yesterday at the start of a two-week
trial in London. Ablyazov attended the hearing with an
interpreter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t quite been a case like this before,&#8221; BTA&#8217;s
lawyer, Stephen Smith of New Square Chambers, said at the
hearing. &#8220;The bank&#8217;s primary purpose is to coerce Ablyazov into
complying with the court order.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTA, based in Almaty, filed a series of U.K. lawsuits
against Ablyazov and Roman Solodchenko, its former chief
executive officer, claiming they took more than $5 billion from
the bank using fake loans, back-dated documents and a web of
offshore companies. The men deny the claims, while BTA has said
its accountants are still unwinding the transactions behind the
alleged theft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ablyazov claims the bank&#8217;s case is politically motivated
because he was part of the democratic opposition to Kazakhstan&#8217;s
president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the country for
more than two decades and was re-elected in April with 95.5
percent of the vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s &#8220;true motive&#8221; for seeking to put Ablyazov in
jail during the case is to win &#8220;a knockout blow in order to
impact Ablyazov&#8217;s ability to operate commercially or politically
or to defend himself,&#8221; his lawyer Duncan Matthews said at
yesterday&#8217;s hearing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank Lawyer Says HMRC Warning Didn&#8217;t Change Trade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Deutsche Bank AG tax lawyer said that in 2009 the lender
considered its German carbon-trading businesses safe and wasn&#8217;t
prompted to change its policies by a warning from British tax
authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking with a German tax investigator in December
2009 and January 2010, he had no indication that the bank&#8217;s
trades were linked to fraud, Goetz Weitbrecht, Deutsche Bank&#8217;s
head of tax for continental Europe, said at a Frankfurt criminal
trial yesterday. That assessment was backed by the fact a tax
review by German officials wasn&#8217;t continued and Value Added Tax
refunds were paid out at the time, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I personally had an all-clear signal,&#8221; Weitbrecht said.
&#8220;Had we gotten the indication that something was wrong, we
would have stopped the trades.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six managers at emissions-trading companies are on trial in
Frankfurt in what prosecutors call an international scheme to
evade VAT when trading the certificates with Deutsche Bank.
Neither the bank nor Weitbrecht are accused of wrongdoing at the
trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Revenue  Customs office, or HMRC, told Deutsche
Bank tax managers in London at a Nov. 18, 2009, meeting that 90
percent of emission trading in some countries was done to commit
VAT fraud, according to a memo read in the court by a defense
lawyer yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weitbrecht said yesterday that, while he may have been
informed about the London HMRC meeting, he doesn&#8217;t remember it.
He relied on information he received from Harald Gebbers, a
German tax investigator with whom he spoke twice on the phone in
December 2009 and January 2010, and on the fact that tax
authorities paid out VAT refunds to Deutsche Bank at the time,
Weitbrecht said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We had a good and trusting relationship with the
authorities, so I relied on the information I got there,&#8221;
Weitbrecht said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German prosecutors formally started their probe of the
trading on Nov. 19, 2009. Tax investigators had already looked
earlier into the issue. Prosecutors are probing 170 suspects,
including seven Deutsche Bank employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presiding Judge Martin Bach said yesterday he expects
closing arguments to start tomorrow. A verdict may come before
Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SocGen Wins Defamation Suit Over Report Questioning Solvency &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale SA (GLE) won a defamation suit against an online
news site over a September report that France&#8217;s second biggest
bank was shut out of the interbank lending market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ElectronLibre.info, published by Paris-based EL Publishing
SAS, must pay 1 euro ($1.35) to Societe Generale for publishing
the report, a Paris court ruled yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EL Publishing and director Emmanuel Torregano were ordered
to pay Societe Generale legal costs and to remove the Sept. 7
article from the site within three days or risk an additional
1,000-euro-a-day fine. The site must also run a paragraph on its
homepage saying the court condemned it for running the article
and to pay for that to appear in a publication of Societe
Generale&#8217;s choosing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis has hit French banks hard.
Societe Generale has fought to maintain customer confidence as
shares have dropped almost 46 percent since Aug. 1 and its
third-quarter profit fell 31 percent on a 333 million-euro
pretax writedown on Greek sovereign debt and lower trading
revenue. The bank sued Associated Newspapers Ltd.&#8217;s Mail on
Sunday in London in October for an August report that it was in
a &#8220;perilous&#8221; state and possibly on the &#8220;brink of disaster.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the current situation and all that we have
learned&#8221; about banks during the sovereign-debt crisis, &#8220;I will
advise my client to appeal,&#8221; ElectronLibre lawyer Hasna Boulet
said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam Asks Court to Let Him Remain Free During Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raj Rajaratnam, the former Galleon Group LLC hedge fund
manager convicted of directing the biggest insider-trading ring
in a generation, asked a federal appeals court to let him remain
free while he challenges the government&#8217;s use of wiretaps in his
trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 54, scheduled to begin an 11-year sentence in a
Massachusetts prison next week, claims improper wiretapping of
his phone conversations will lead to reversal of his May
conviction and that he should remain free in the meantime. A
panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York declined to rule
immediately after a 20-minute hearing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patricia Millett, a lawyer for Rajaratnam, told the court
his appeal presents a &#8220;substantial question of law&#8221; and said
he&#8217;s unlikely to flee to his native Sri Lanka before the appeal
is decided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;His passport was surrendered ages ago. All his family are
here,&#8221; Millett told a three-judge panel of the court.  &#8220;He has
nothing to go to in Sri Lanka.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell, who presided over the
case and sentenced Rajaratnam in October, rejected his request
for bail pending the appeal. Rajaratnam claims a March 7, 2008,
wiretap application by FBI special agent B.J. Kang contained
&#8220;glaring omissions&#8221; that would likely lead the appeals court
to reverse his conviction, justifying his release on bail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millett argued the omissions violated Rajaratnam&#8217;s
constitutional rights and the legal requirement that the
government show wiretapping is necessary before getting a
warrant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no substantial question of law likely to result
in a new trial,&#8221; said Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan
Streeter, who argued that the court should let Rajaratnam begin
his prison term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 11-4416, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). The lower-court case
is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-01184, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Ropes  Gray Lawyer Gets 6 Months in Goffer Tipping Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brien Santarlas, a former lawyer at Ropes  Gray LLP, was
sentenced to six months in prison for passing information on
pending mergers to stock traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santarlas, 34, pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges in
December 2009 and cooperated with the U.S. investigation of
illegal tips to hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling that cooperation &#8220;very, very important,&#8221; U.S.
District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan yesterday said that
as a lawyer, Santarlas should be held to a high standard and his
sentence should send a message to other attorneys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s important that those legal professionals understand
they breach those duties at their peril,&#8221; Sullivan said before
he handed down Santarlas&#8217;s sentence. &#8220;You don&#8217;t get a pass.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santarlas and Arthur Cutillo, a fellow attorney at Ropes 
Gray, passed tips about two pending mergers that the firm was
working on to Cutillo&#8217;s college roommate, Jason Goldfarb, who
passed along the information to Zvi Goffer, a former trader at
Galleon Group LLC. The deals were Bain Capital Partners&#8217;
acquisition of 3Com Corp. and TPG Capital&#8217;s purchase of Axcan
Pharma Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santarlas pleaded guilty to securities fraud and agreed to
forfeit $32,500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forgive myself,&#8221; Santarlas told the judge
yesterday. &#8220;I violated my oath as an attorney.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY)&#8217;s copy of
the $10.7 billion Lipitor cholesterol pill was released in the
U.S., sending its shares up and threatening Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy, India&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, won approval yesterday
from the Food and Drug Administration to sell generic versions
of the world&#8217;s top-selling medicine. The company, based near New
Delhi, will share profit on the first six months&#8217; sales with
Israel&#8217;s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), Ranbaxy said
today, adding that terms of the agreement won&#8217;t be disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy, 64 percent-owned by Daiichi Sankyo Co., sought to
convince the FDA that its copies are equivalent to the original
and that approval shouldn&#8217;t be thwarted by an ongoing dispute
about plant violations in India. The FDA approval was for
products made at a plant in New Jersey which may have been
contingent on a deal with Teva, said Bino Pathiparampil, an
analyst at IIFL Ltd. in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It could well be that the Lipitor ingredients could come
from Teva,&#8221; Pathiparampil said in an interview. In that
scenario, &#8220;Ranbaxy will assemble the drug at their factory in
New Jersey.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen at Ranbaxy and Teva declined to elaborate on
today&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee prices may extend
gains as rain disrupts supplies from Colombia and Central
America, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee will be at $2.35 a pound in three months, the bank
forecast in a report dated today. &#8220;We see risk to our short-
term price forecast as skewed to the upside,&#8221; Damien Courvalin,
an analyst at Goldman, said in the report. Prices have climbed
5.2 percent on ICE Futures U.S. in New York over the past month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Colombia has revised its production estimate lower for
2011 for the second time in two weeks on disease outbreak and
adverse weather,&#8221; Courvalin said. &#8220;Recent torrential rains in
Central America have likely caused damage to both the local
crops and infrastructure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s crop will be about 8 million bags in 2011,
according to Luis Munoz, chief executive officer of Colombia&#8217;s
National Federation of Coffee Growers. Output next year may not
increase if adverse weather persists, he said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return of the La Nina weather pattern, a cooling of the
Pacific Ocean that can affect weather around the world, may
damage production in Brazil, the world&#8217;s largest producer of
coffee, Goldman&#8217;s Courvalin wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices may fall to $2 a pound in six months and to $1.75
cents a pound in 12 months, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect a continued supply response to the current high
coffee prices during the 2012-13 crop year,&#8221; Courvalin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee for March delivery was down 0.4 percent to
$2.359 a pound by 6:20 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Arabica is grown mainly in Latin America and favored by
Starbucks Corp., the world&#8217;s largest coffee shop owner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rolls-Royce Group Plc, the world&#8217;s
second-largest aircraft-engine maker, can further increase
margins on &#8220;significant&#8221; potential for cost reduction,
according to David Perry, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolls-Royce could improve profitability at its marine
business by cutting costs in Scandinavia, Perry wrote, following
a presentation the London-based company made to investors
yesterday. The company also can improve margins at its civil
aerospace and energy units, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sales should double organically over the next decade and
its high levels of research and development create significant
barriers to entry,&#8221; Perry wrote. He has Rolls-Royce on
Goldman&#8217;s &#8220;conviction buy list.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolls-Royce Chief Executive Officer John Rishton told
investors the company has &#8220;extraordinary visibility on
growth,&#8221; according to Perry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Citigroup&#8217;s Jeremy Bragg maintained his &#8220;buy&#8221;
rating on the stock following the investor day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to believe Rolls offers the attractive
combination of resilient earnings, strong balance sheet and
margin expansion potential despite current macro issues,&#8221;
Rupinder Vig, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note
today. He has an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolls-Royce rose 0.8 percent to 735 pence at 10:01 a.m. in
London, extending yesterday&#8217;s 3.4 percent gain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its
three, six and 12-month price forecasts by 9.3 percent on the
growing potential for supplies to outpace demand in the 2011-12
season started last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocoa will be at $2,450 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York in three, six and 12 months, down from a previous estimate
of $2,700 a ton, Goldman said in a report dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, cocoa prices fell to their lowest levels since
March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The growing likelihood that global cocoa production
exceeds demand for a second year in the 2011-12 season that
started last month is leading us to lower our three- to 12-month
forecasts,&#8221; said Damien Courvalin, an analyst at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the Ivorian reform of the cocoa and
coffee sectors, which includes a price guarantee to farmers of
as much as 60 percent of the international price, may support
investment in cocoa, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocoa has fallen 11 percent in New York over the past
month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its
estimate for Turkey&#8217;s gross domestic product growth next year to
0.5 percent from 1.5 percent, according to an e-mailed statement
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey is likely to experience a &#8220;sharp economic slowdown
on the back of tightening domestic and external financing
conditions,&#8221; Goldman said in a report on central and eastern
Europe and the Middle East by analysts including Ahmet Akarli
dated Nov. 30. &#8220;The Euro-area crisis has recently taken a turn
for the worse,&#8221; the analysts said, adding that &#8220;the crisis
will culminate in output losses, especially in the periphery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balance sheet strength and economic interconnectivity will
be key factors for emerging economies in weathering the crisis,
with interconnections being detrimental as it leaves economies
exposed to &#8220;ripple effects throughout the region.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resolution of the European crisis could lead to a
&#8220;significant recovery in asset prices&#8221; in Turkey, the analysts
said, &#8220;which could be the trigger for recovery through 2013.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turkish economy may rebound in the second half of 2012
as external conditions normalize, Goldman said. There is
&#8220;limited scope&#8221; for appreciation of the lira, the world&#8217;s
second worst-performing currency this year after the South
African rand, over the next six to 12 months, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis was
strong though &#8220;not particularly well-balanced; it was primarily
driven by domestic demand, which led to a significant
deterioration in Turkey&#8217;s external imbalances,&#8221; the analysts
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticky Inflation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coming year may be one of &#8220;two halves&#8221; for Turkey,
according to the report, with the first half of the year
characterized by economic challenges and the second possibly
bringing a &#8220;solid rebound,&#8221; depending on Europe&#8217;s response to
the debt crisis, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation is likely to remain &#8220;sticky&#8221; at around 10
percent through the middle of next year, pushing Turkey&#8217;s
central bank to reinforce tighter monetary conditions, which
will contribute to a slowdown in economic activity, the report
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman also adjusted its forecasts for the lira downward,
predicting it weakening to 1.95 per dollar in three months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lira may weaken to 1.95 per
dollar in three months, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said, revising
its forecast from a previous 1.90 per dollar due to &#8220;the
deterioration in the outlook for Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lira is expected to decline to 1.90 per dollar in six
months compared with a previous estimate of 1.70, Goldman said
in an e-mailed report today. The forecast for the lira in 12
months time was changed to 1.75 from 1.65, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency fell 0.2 percent to 1.8328 per dollar at 9:43

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) forecast
that commodities may rally 15 percent in the next 12 months,
sticking with an &#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on raw materials
and predicting Brent crude may surge to highest level since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities may gain as the global economy avoids recession
next year and in 2013, analysts led by London-based Jeffrey Currie said in a report today. Brent, the benchmark used to
price two-thirds of global oil supplies, may jump to $127.50 a
barrel at the end of next year and $135 in 2013, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s bullishness contrasts with the view from JPMorgan
Chase  Co., which cut commodities to &#8220;underweight&#8221; on Nov. 22
citing policy failures in the U.S. and crisis-hit Europe. Data
today showed manufacturing in China, the largest user of energy
and base metals, shrank for the first time since February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The European debt crisis remains a significant downside
risk in 2012,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;However, as long as the risks
manifest themselves in economic weakness and not in financial
stress that would likely precipitate a global recession, it is
unlikely to severely impact commodity markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities as measured by the SP GSCI Spot Index are
beating equities for a fifth consecutive year, signaling that
demand from developing economies is sustaining global growth.
The gauge rallied 9.6 percent in October and 1.6 percent last
month even as the euro-zone debt crisis intensified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Large Driver&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risks to this view are skewed to the upside,
particularly given the return of significant backwardation to
the oil market that could become a very large driver of
returns,&#8221; Goldman said, referring to a pattern where near-term
prices are higher than those further out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent for January delivery, the most-active contract,
traded at $110.95 at 2:19 p.m. in Singapore as the December 2012
contract was at $105.73. Brent peaked this year at $127.02 in
April, and hasn&#8217;t traded at more than $127.50 since August 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman correctly advised investors to sell oil and copper
in April and turned more bullish the next month before prices
rebounded. The New York-based bank lowered its commodity gain
forecast from 20 percent for the SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity
Index earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase cut its commodity outlook citing Europe&#8217;s
worsening debt crisis and slowing growth across emerging markets,
according to the report last month. Raw materials show limited
potential for gains in 2012 as the global economy slows and risk
aversion boosts the dollar, Morgan Stanley analysts led by New
York-based Hussein Allidina said in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Potential Shortages&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman economists reduced their forecast for global
economic growth next year to 3.2 percent from 3.4 percent, the
report said. &#8220;This reduced outlook, but avoidance of global
recession, makes it more likely that commodity markets can
maintain a central course between the whirlpool of a world
economic recession and the rocks of potential shortages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12-month target for copper was retained at $9,500 per
metric ton on China&#8217;s demand growth, the Goldman report said.
The metal for three-month delivery fell as much as 1.3 percent
to $7,781.50 on the London Metal Exchange today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forecast for Comex gold was held at $1,940 an ounce in
12 months, the report said. Futures traded at $1,746.90 at 2:15
p.m. Chicago-traded corn may rise to $6.85 per bushel in three
months, before sliding to $5.50 in 12 months, the bank said,
expecting &#8220;large&#8221; supplies from non-U.S. countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, the Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index fell to 49 in
November from 50.4 in October, the China Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing said. That was below the median estimate of 49.8
in a Bloomberg survey of 18 economists. A level above 50
indicates expansion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY)&#8217;s copy of
the $10.7 billion Lipitor cholesterol pill was released in the
U.S., sending its share up the most in six months and
threatening sales for Pfizer Inc. (PFE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy, India&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, won approval to sell
generic versions of the world&#8217;s top-selling medicine by the Food
and Drug Administration yesterday. The company, based near New
Delhi, will share profit on the first six months&#8217; sales with
Israel&#8217;s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), Ranbaxy said today,
adding that terms of the agreement won&#8217;t be disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy sought to persuade the FDA that its copies are
equivalent to the original and that approval shouldn&#8217;t be
thwarted by an ongoing dispute about plant violations in India.
The FDA approval was for products made at a plant in New Jersey
which may have been contingent on a deal with Teva, said Bino Pathiparampil, a health-care analyst at IIFL Ltd. in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It could well be that the Lipitor ingredients could come
from Teva,&#8221; Pathiparampil said in an interview. In that
scenario, &#8220;Ranbaxy will assemble the drug at their factory in
New Jersey.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen at Ranbaxy and Teva declined to elaborate on
today&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian drugmaker, 64 percent-owned by Daiichi Sankyo
Co., surged as much as 11 percent in Mumbai trading. The shares
traded 4.7 percent higher at 454.85 rupees, the most since May
30, at 11:22 a.m. local time, while the BSE India Sensitive
Index gained 2.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daiichi Sankyo (4568) increased 2.1 percent to 1,402 yen in Tokyo
trading at 2:53 p.m. local time. A spokesman for the Tokyo-based
company declined to comment on the agreement between Teva and
Rabaxy, as well as on the impact on earnings of sales of generic
Lipitor sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Simply Relieved&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is simply relieved to hear that the drug is
approved,&#8221; said Yasuhiro Nakazawa, a health-care analyst at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copycat Lipitor may generate as much as $650 million for
Ranbaxy in its first 180 days of sale, according to the median
estimate of five Mumbai-based analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This medication is widely used by people who must manage
their high cholesterol over time, so it is important to have
affordable treatment options,&#8221; Janet Woodcock, director of the
FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a
statement released late yesterday in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy may have sought a marketing deal with Petach Tikva,
Israel-based Teva in case it didn&#8217;t win timely approval, said
Priti Arora, an analyst at Kotak Institutional Securities in
Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Backup Measure&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is something more in this deal than meets the
eye,&#8221; Arora said in a telephone interview. &#8220;My feeling is that
they allied with Teva as a backup measure in case approval was
held back due to its manufacturing issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva said on Nov. 2 that if it manages to introduce an
&#8220;important undisclosed product&#8221; in the fourth quarter, it
would meet the upper range of its forecast of earnings excluding
some costs of $4.92 to $5.02 a share this year. Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. analysts speculated in a report last month that
the new product &#8220;is ostensibly Lipitor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s medicine lost patent protection in the U.S.
yesterday. Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) began selling a copy of
Lipitor in the U.S. yesterday under an agreement with New York-
based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker. Watson&#8217;s version
didn&#8217;t require FDA clearance because Pfizer is providing the
drug to sell without the brand label in return for a share of
the revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited Competition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the first generic to challenge Pfizer&#8217;s patent, Ranbaxy
is allowed six months before other generic versions can come on
the market under a 1984 law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan Inc. of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania; Teva; and Dr.
Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories Ltd. of Hyderabad, India, are among
generic-drug makers seeking FDA approval to sell Lipitor copies
after Ranbaxy&#8217;s six-month exclusivity expires, according to U.S.
court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. enforcement actions against Ranbaxy, India&#8217;s
biggest drugmaker, began in 2008 when the FDA cited
manufacturing defects at two of the company&#8217;s plants in India
and subsequently barred the company from importing about 30
different drugs. The following year, the agency said one of
those plants, in Paonta Sahib, India, falsified data used in
drug applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors had been negotiating a dispute settlement
that may cost Ranbaxy more than $1 billion, Fortune Magazine
reported in May, without saying where it go the information.
There was no mention of a settlement in the FDA&#8217;s statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making generic Lipitor in the U.S. instead of India will
reduce the amount of profit Ranbaxy makes on each dollar of
sales, Kotak&#8217;s Arora said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Margins for manufacturing in the India are around 60
percent compared to about 40 percent from the U.S.,&#8221; she said.
The brokerage had estimated Ranbaxy would generate $560 million
in generic-Lipitor sales during the six months of exclusivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will have to revise our estimates because of this and
the Teva deal,&#8221; Arora said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has struck deals with companies including Catalyst
Health Solutions Inc. (CHSI) and Coventry Health Care Inc. (CVH) to prevent
generic Lipitor from reaching some patients until the end of May
2012, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such deals may help Pfizer retain as much as 40 percent of
the Lipitor market during the six-month period in which Ranbaxy
and Watson will be the only providers of generic versions, Paul Bisaro, Watson&#8217;s chief executive officer, said Nov. 9 in a
speech at a Credit Suisse health-care conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also has reached agreements with health insurers to
keep as much of the market as possible. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH),
the biggest U.S. health insurer by sales, said Nov. 19 it will
charge a lower co-pay for Pfizer&#8217;s pill than it does for
generics for the next six months, taking advantage of a price
reduction from the drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will limit the benefit of Ranbaxy&#8217;s exclusivity, said
SMBC Nikko&#8217;s Nakazawa. Ranbaxy&#8217;s copy may generate $300 million
for the Indian drugmaker next year, adding 10 billion yen ($129
million) to Daiichi Sankyo&#8217;s operating profit for the year
ending March 2013, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promise of an experimental drug
for cancer means that Onyx (ONXX) Pharmaceuticals Inc. may reward
shareholders with a record windfall by selling itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onyx, which is developing a drug called carfilzomib to
treat blood cancer, jumped this week by the most since July 2010
after two people with knowledge of the matter said the drugmaker
is exploring options including a sale. Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. says Onyx could command at least $70 a share in an
acquisition, or more than 70 percent above its average in the
past 20 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a takeover offer at that price would be costlier for
potential buyers than any biotechnology deal of comparable size,
Onyx may interest companies such as Pfizer Inc. and Takeda
Pharmaceutical Co. as their own drugs lose patent protections,
Mizuho and Tullett Prebon Plc said. Onyx, which already sells a
kidney-cancer treatment named Nexavar, may get U.S. approval for
carfilzomib as early as March, helping it double sales within
five years, analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers are &#8220;in the market for transactions and new
drugs,&#8221; Walter Todd, co-chief investment officer at Greenwood
Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina, which manages $940 million,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;You have huge patent
expirations. Cancer is an area that a lot of companies are
focused on. Large companies are looking for growth opportunities
and these smaller names are going to be attractive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd said New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, along with GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) of London, were among
companies that could benefit from acquiring Onyx. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeover Speculation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Onyx surged 14 percent on Nov. 28 after two
people familiar with the situation, who declined to be
identified because the discussions were private, said that the
company had hired investment bank Centerview Partners to help it
review alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential buyers are studying Onyx&#8217;s business and its
carfilzomib drug, which treats a cancer of plasma cells known as
multiple myeloma, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Lori Melancon, a spokeswoman for South San Francisco,
California-based Onyx, said it doesn&#8217;t comment on rumor or
speculation, Jefferies Group Inc.&#8217;s Biren Amin says the company
signaled a willingness to sell itself in October when it settled
a lawsuit with Bayer AG over the experimental cancer medicine
regorafenib and amended its collaboration agreement for Nexavar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amended Oct. 11 agreement now maintains Onyx&#8217;s profit-
sharing, co-development and co-promotion of Nexavar with
Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer in the event that Onyx, valued
at $2.8 billion, is bought, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change of Control &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re definitely putting themselves out there,&#8221; Amin,
an analyst at Jefferies in New York, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;At the end of the day, most of these small- to mid-
cap biotech companies want to sell themselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onyx could be worth $70 a share to $80 a share in an
acquisition, according to an estimate from Gene Mack, a New
York-based analyst at Mizuho. Based on Onyx&#8217;s average price of
$39.39 in the past 20 trading days, a $70-a-share offer would
represent a 78 percent takeover premium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would exceed the 67 percent premium that Takeda,
Asia&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, agreed to pay for Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. in 2008 in
the costliest biotechnology deal between $1 billion and $10
billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driven by carfilzomib, analysts estimate Onyx will generate
more than $1 billion in revenue by 2016, versus an estimated
$443 million this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical Need &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onyx could have the experimental medicine cleared for
marketing by March if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
assigns &#8220;fast track&#8221; status to its new drug application,
according to Andrew Berens, a senior health-care analyst for
Bloomberg Industries in Skillman, New Jersey. The designation is
used to &#8220;expedite the review of drugs to treat serious diseases
and fill an unmet medical need,&#8221; the FDA&#8217;s website said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in oncology drugs has increased as aging societies
become more prone to cancer and doctors get better at diagnosing
the disease, according to Matthew DiFilippo, chief portfolio
strategist at Stewart Capital in Indiana, Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of Revlimid, the blood-cancer pill that is Celgene (CELG)
Corp.&#8217;s top-selling drug, have jumped sevenfold since 2006 to
almost $2.47 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Onyx may entice drugmakers as patents of
their best-selling treatments expire, leaving them vulnerable to
declining sales as generic makers offer cheaper versions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Unprecedented&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s 10 largest drugmakers by sales, which include
Pfizer and Glaxo, all have U.S. patents that will expire in the
next two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pfizer,
which lost patent protection on its cholesterol pill Lipitor
yesterday, faces expirations on at least five drugs in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of Lipitor, the world&#8217;s top-selling medicine with
$10.7 billion in revenue last year, may drop by 58 percent to
$4.5 billion next year, according to analysts&#8217; estimates (PFE)
compiled by Bloomberg. Some patents on Glaxo&#8217;s Advair asthma
inhaler, its best-selling product that accounted for almost 20
percent of revenue, will begin expiring in 2013, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Large pharma is facing unprecedented revenue loss as
these multiple blockbuster drugs lose their exclusivity,&#8221;
Bloomberg Industries&#8217; Berens said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;Historically, they haven&#8217;t been able to replace them through
internal RD, so they have to look externally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joan Campion, a spokeswoman at Pfizer, said in an e-mail
that the company doesn&#8217;t comment on market speculation. Kevin Colgan, a spokesman for Glaxo, declined to comment on whether it
is considering a purchase of Onyx. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeda, Celgene &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An acquisition by Takeda would also make sense, according
to Sachin Shah, a special situations and merger arbitrage
strategist at Tullett Prebon. Actos, Takeda&#8217;s best-selling
diabetes treatment, will begin facing competition from generic
drugmakers starting in August. Analysts project that Actos will
lose about $2.1 billion in revenue by next fiscal year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onyx would complement Takeda&#8217;s Velcade drug, a blood-cancer
medicine that it acquired from Millennium Pharmaceuticals in
2008. Velcade will top $1 billion in revenue by 2016, analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. Mizuho&#8217;s Mack estimates
peak sales for Onyx&#8217;s carfilzomib of more than $2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The synergies would be the greatest on the multiple
myeloma side with Takeda,&#8221; which would otherwise compete with
Onyx, Shah said in a telephone interview from Mumbai. &#8220;This is
the time for them to take advantage of an opportunity where big
pharma is looking to plug some of their holes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also cited Celgene, which specializes in cancer
therapies and offers a drug that would also compete with Onyx&#8217;s
carfilzomib, as another potential buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk-Reward Analysis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsuo Oguri, spokesman at Takeda, declined to comment on
whether the company is considering an acquisition of Onyx. Brian Gill, a spokesman for Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a message requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a deal for Onyx at $70 a share would be almost twice
the industry&#8217;s median based on reported sales, Mizuho&#8217;s Mack
says the potential reward is worth the risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onyx &#8220;could be a good fit for anyone in large pharma that
deals in oncology or would want a footprint in oncology,&#8221; he
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;What sets it apart is they have
very, very rich near-term revenue opportunities, which is
important to pharmaceutical companies. This makes it easy for
pharma companies to pay a premium.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $375
million of bonds tied to the Palisades Center shopping mall in
New York, according to a person familiar with the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $242.9 million portion of top-ranked debt with a
projected life of 4.9 years yields 195 basis points more than
benchmark swap rates, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the deal was private. The issuer initially
proposed paying a spread of about 215 basis points, or 2.15
percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer Pyramid Management Group LLC owns the property
and J.C. Penney Co., Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp. (TGT) are the
largest tenants of the 1.9-million square-foot shopping center
in West Nyack, New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks have arranged about $26 billion of
commercial-mortgage backed securities this year. While that&#8217;s up
from $11.5 billion in 2010, issuance totaled more than $200
billion in 2007 when commercial-real estate prices peaked, the
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds rather than Treasuries fell yesterday
to 2.77 percentage points from 2.88 percentage points in the
prior week, according to the Barclays Capital CMBS AAA Super
Duper Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basketball hall of famer Magic Johnson is teaming with Guggenheim Partners Chief Executive
Officer Mark Walter to bid on baseball&#8217;s Los Angeles Dodgers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group also includes Stan Kasten, former president of
the Atlanta Braves and Washington Nationals. Kasten would
relocate to Los Angeles and become the Dodgers&#8217; chief executive
should the group get the team, which filed for bankruptcy in
June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Guggenheim Baseball Management brings together a team of
proven winners with deep ties to the Los Angeles community, an
impressive track record of sports excellence and the financial
wherewithal to provide long-term financial stability for the
Dodgers organization,&#8221; Walter said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guggenheim, founded in 2000 with backing from the
Guggenheim family and based in New York and Chicago, oversees
more than $125 billion in customer assets, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson didn&#8217;t immediately return a message left on his
mobile phone. On Twitter, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to have the
opportunity to be part of the Dodgers legacy  bring a World
Series championship back to LA.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasten declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 52-year-old Johnson delivered five National Basketball
Association championships to Los Angeles as leader of the
&#8220;Showtime&#8221; Lakers. He sold his minority share of the team last
year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) were among five banks sued by
Massachusetts for allegedly conducting unlawful foreclosures and
deceiving homeowners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley filed the
lawsuit yesterday against the three banks, as well as Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC) and Ally Financial Inc., in state court in Boston.
The banks are accused of engaging in unfair and deceptive trade
practices in violation of state law, according to the attorney
general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the stakes could not be higher at this stage
of the game,&#8221; Coakley said at a press conference in Boston.
&#8220;The foreclosure crisis continues to be at the root of the
economic mess that we find ourselves in and our inability to
turn it around.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State attorneys general across the country have been
negotiating a possible settlement with the five banks that would
resolve a probe into foreclosure practices that began more than
a year ago following disclosures that faulty documents were
being used to seize homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John
Stumpf said in a CNBC interview yesterday that he is
disappointed the lawsuit was filed. Wells Fargo is based in San
Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve worked hard to come to an agreement that I think
would be good for the country and good for housing,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We can work through that better together than working it out
in court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based Ally, said its
GMAC Mortgage unit, which was named as a defendant, will
&#8220;vigorously defend&#8221; itself against the lawsuit and has worked
&#8220;in good faith&#8221; with Coakley&#8217;s office during the past year to
discuss mortgage servicing and ways to assist borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan, said
the bank is disappointed Coakley filed the lawsuit while
negotiations with state and federal officials continue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to believe that collaborative resolution
rather than continued litigation will most quickly heal the
housing market and help drive economic recovery,&#8221; Lawrence
Grayson, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup hasn&#8217;t had time to review the lawsuit, Mark
Rodgers, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said in an e-
mail. The bank has been cooperating with the attorney general,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Sues U.S. Claiming $350 Million in Excess Taxes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. sued the U.S. government claiming it&#8217;s
owed more than $350 million in refunds for tax overpayments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some excess payments were caused by &#8220;computational and
data entry errors&#8221; by the Internal Revenue Service, and the
government hasn&#8217;t acted on its claim for a refund, Wells Fargo
said yesterday in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. Court of Federal
Claims in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, says the overpayments
involve the interest rates on taxes paid and stem from
acquisitions by the bank from 1996 through 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wells Fargo, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
predecessors whose assets and liabilities were assumed by Wells
Fargo&#8221; filed claims for refunds &#8220;based on application of a net
zero rate of interest,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancel Martinez, a Wells Fargo spokesman, declined to
comment immediately on the lawsuit. Sara Eguren, an IRS
spokeswoman, said the agency doesn&#8217;t generally comment on
litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wells Fargo  Co. v. U.S., 11-808, U.S. Court
of Federal Claims (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Sued Over Competing Bid for Carbon Trader &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Barclays Plc (BARC) unit was accused of using its role as a deal
adviser to a carbon-trading firm to get confidential data about
a takeover target and then buying the company itself, according
to a lawsuit filed by CF Partners (U.K.) LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CF Partners hired Barclays to work on its plan to buy
Tricorona AB, a Sweden-based emissions trader, in 2008. When the
deal stalled, Barclays began secret negotiations with Tricorona,
according to papers filed by CF Partners&#8217; lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays, based in London, completed a $173 million deal
for 85 percent of Tricorona in July 2010. Barclays spokeswoman
Aurelie Leonard declined to comment on the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank used confidential research from CF Partners about
the value of Tricorona&#8217;s portfolio, according to the lawsuit. CF
Partners wants damages of least 82.4 million euros ($111
million) from Britain&#8217;s second-largest bank for breach of
confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James McRobbie, general counsel of CF Partners, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CF Partners (UK) LLP v Barclays Bank Plc  Anr,
HC11C03443, High Court of Justice, Chancery Division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Millennium Global Manager Charged With Securities Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors charged Michael Balboa, a former
portfolio manager at Millennium Global Investments Ltd., with
participating in a securities fraud scheme involving Nigerian
sovereign debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A criminal complaint unsealed yesterday in federal court in
Manhattan alleges that Balboa and his co-conspirators sent
multiple e-mails to an independent valuation agent who inflated
month-end market prices for Nigerian warrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, filed by U.S. Postal Inspector Jessica
Brown, charges that Balboa engaged in an eight-month scheme in
2008 to commit securities and wire fraud with two unidentified
co-conspirators who are cooperating with the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millennium Global in 2008 liquidated Balboa&#8217;s hedge fund,
which buys emerging-market debt, after lenders withdrew credit,
two people familiar with the situation said in October 2008.
Millennium Global, a London-based money manager, was founded by
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive Michael Huttman in
1994. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balbao was also sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Balboa, 11-mag-3038, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg&#8217;s AIG Bailout Suits Pursue Unique Theories &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maurice R. Greenberg, the former American International
Group Inc. (AIG) chief executive officer, seeks to break new ground in
lawsuits challenging the U.S. takeover of the insurer in a
bailout that reached $182 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg&#8217;s Starr International Co. sued the government
Nov. 21, calling the public assumption of 80 percent of stock in
the insurer in 2008 an unconstitutional &#8220;taking&#8221; of property
that requires $25 billion in compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr also sued the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
saying it breached its duty to AIG shareholders by loaning $85
billion at 14.5 percent while offering better terms to banks in
a &#8220;backdoor bailout.&#8221; AIG almost collapsed after bets tied to
the housing market soured, and the bailout was revised at least
four times before reaching $182 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both complaints were filed by attorney David Boies, who
represented the U.S. in its Microsoft Corp. 1999 antitrust trial
and Al Gore in the Florida presidential recount litigation in
2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any time David Boies is asking for $25 billion, I would
say this is not a normal case,&#8221; said Robert H. Thomas of the
Honolulu firm Damon Key Leong Kupchak Hastert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He takes cutting edge cases in unexplored areas of law,&#8221;
said Thomas, who specializes in land-use and eminent domain.
&#8220;It&#8217;s audacious. As someone who represents plaintiffs in these
kinds of cases, I&#8217;d say more power to him. But it&#8217;s a stretch.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boies didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment on his chances
of success in the Starr cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Gutt, a spokesman for the New York Fed, said the
allegations have no merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;AIG&#8217;s board of directors had an alternative choice to
borrowing from the Federal Reserve, and that choice was
bankruptcy,&#8221; Gutt said. &#8220;Bankruptcy would have left all AIG
shareholders with worthless stock. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s actions
with regard to AIG helped to restore financial stability in the
United States during a period of intense volatility and
vulnerability in the U.S. economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal claims case is Starr International Co. v. U.S.,
1:11-cv-00779, U.S. Court of Federal Claims (Washington). The
Federal Reserve case is Starr International Co. v. Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, 1:11-cv-08422, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online Gambling Trial Judge &#8216;Unlikely&#8217; to Dismiss Indictment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge said he&#8217;s unlikely to dismiss an illegal
gambling case involving the three largest Internet poker
companies doing business in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think it extraordinarily unlikely the entire indictment
will be dismissed,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in
Manhattan said at the end of a hearing yesterday on a request to
dismiss the case. He said he would rule later on the motion and
that a trial, if held, would begin March 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven defendants were accused in April of bank fraud,
money laundering and illegal gambling through the online
companies PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for two of the defendants, Chad Elie and John
Campos, argued in court yesterday that the U.S. law making it a
crime for businesses to accept payment in connection with
unlawful Internet gambling doesn&#8217;t apply to poker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Scheinberg, 10-cr-00336, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff Trustee Can Appeal $19 Billion JPMorgan Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidator of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s firm, who lost the
right to demand $19 billion in damages from JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM), can appeal the ruling to a higher court, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last month won dismissal of trustee Irving
Picard&#8217;s damage claims in his lawsuit alleging the biggest U.S.
bank aided Madoff&#8217;s fraud. Picard can&#8217;t sue for common-law
damages on behalf of the defunct Madoff firm&#8217;s customers, U.S.
District Judge Colleen McMahon ruled in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge directed a clerk to enter a final judgment
dismissing eight claims from Picard&#8217;s complaint and said he can
appeal the ruling under a deal struck with JPMorgan, according
to court papers. Her decision followed a telephone conference
Nov. 30, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard agreed to put his remaining claims against JPMorgan
on hold while he appeals. He told McMahon in a filing last month
he has &#8220;no choice but to appeal the order.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Permitting an immediate appeal would provide much-needed
finality for the trustee and the BLMIS estate as to the
viability of these claims,&#8221; he said. BLMIS refers to Madoff&#8217;s
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rulings by district judges McMahon and Jed Rakoff have
knocked more than $28 billion off of Picard&#8217;s claims against
banks and may cost him as much as $11 billion in recoveries from
other cases to benefit investors who lost money in the Ponzi
scheme, according to the trustee&#8217;s estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount sought from JPMorgan, Madoff&#8217;s primary banker,
represented Picard&#8217;s estimate of principal lost by all Madoff
investors by the time the Ponzi scheme collapsed in December
2008, according to a complaint filed in June. The bank could
have stopped the fraud if it had passed on its suspicions to
regulators, he alleged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it didn&#8217;t know about or in any way become a
party to the fraud and couldn&#8217;t be held responsible for a scheme
orchestrated by Madoff alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff pleaded guilty and is serving a 150-year prison
term. Picard and his firm have made about $224 million in fees
since Madoff&#8217;s 2008 arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McMahon cases are Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 11-
cv-913; Picard v. UBS Fund Services (Luxembourg) SA, 11-cv-4212,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lindsey Manufacturing Wins Dismissal of Foreign Bribery Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindsey Manufacturing Co., the first corporation to go to
trial on charges it violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act, won dismissal of its conviction after the judge found the
prosecution had engaged in &#8220;flagrant&#8221; misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Howard Matz in Los Angeles yesterday
threw out the convictions of the Azusa, California-based maker
of emergency electricity towers; Keith Lindsey, the closely held
company&#8217;s president; and Steve Lee, its finance chief, and he
dismissed the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matz said it was &#8220;with deep regret&#8221; that he was compelled
to find that the government had allowed an Federal Bureau of
Investigation agent to testify untruthfully before a grand jury,
inserted falsehoods in requests for search warrants, improperly
reviewed e-mails between a defendant and her lawyer, and made
misrepresentations to the court, among other misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dr. Lindsey and Mr. Lee were put through a severe
ordeal,&#8221; the judge said in his ruling. &#8220;Charges were filed
against them as a result of a sloppy, incomplete and notably
over-zealous investigation, an investigation that was so flawed
that the government&#8217;s lawyers tried to prevent inquiry into
it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a Nov. 29 hearing, where the judge had issued his
tentative decision to dismiss the case, Jeffrey Goldberg, a
Justice Department lawyer, argued that the government had made
only &#8220;honest mistakes&#8221; that didn&#8217;t warrant a finding of
misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is appealing the ruling, according to a
notice of appeal filed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury in May found the company and the two executives
guilty of paying bribes, through an intermediary, to executives
with a state-owned Mexican utility to win contracts. Lindsey and
Lee faced as long as five years in prison for each of five
counts of bribing a foreign official, as well as five years for
a conspiracy count. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aguilar, 10-1031, U.S. District Court,

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam Must Report to Prison After Bail Request Denied &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raj Rajaratnam, the former Galleon Group LLC hedge fund
manager convicted of directing the biggest insider-trading ring
in a generation, must go to prison while he challenges the
government&#8217;s use of wiretaps in his trial, an appeals court
ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s decision clears the way for Rajaratnam, 54, to
report to federal prison in Massachusetts to begin serving an
11-year sentence. He has been ordered to surrender Dec. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendant shall surrender at such time and place as
shall be instructed by the district court,&#8221; a panel of U.S.
appeals court judges in New York said, denying him a chance to
remain free on bail. Terence Lynam, a lawyer for Rajaratnam,
declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 20-minute hearing Nov. 30 before the appeals court in
Manhattan, a defense lawyer said improper wiretapping of
Rajaratnam&#8217;s phone conversations would lead to reversal of his
May conviction and that he should remain free in the interim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patricia Millett, another lawyer for Rajaratnam, told the
three-judge panel that the appeal presented a &#8220;substantial
question of law&#8221; and that Rajaratnam was unlikely to flee to
his native Sri Lanka before a ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell, who presided over the
case and sentenced Rajaratnam in October, had rejected a request
for bail pending the appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court panel included U.S. Chief Judge Dennis
Jacobs and Circuit Judges Robert Katzmann and Peter Hall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 11-4416, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). The lower-court case
is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-01184, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roomy Khan&#8217;s Sentencing Delayed as Cooperation Continues &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roomy Khan&#8217;s sentencing for her role in the Galleon Group
LLC insider-trading case was postponed after U.S. prosecutors
said she&#8217;s still helping them investigate at least one person
who hasn&#8217;t been charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khan, a former Intel Corp. (INTC) executive and stock trader, was
among the first people to plead guilty and cooperate with the
U.S. against Raj Rajaratnam, Galleon&#8217;s co-founder. She was
scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 5. Yesterday, U.S. District Judge
Richard Berman, who is presiding over her case, granted the
government&#8217;s request and set her sentencing for March 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Khan didn&#8217;t testify at Rajaratnam&#8217;s trial, she played
a crucial role for the U.S. as prosecutors and agents with the
FBI used her information to obtain a court-authorized wiretap of
Rajaratnam&#8217;s phone, according to testimony from a pretrial
hearing in his case last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Khan is continuing to cooperate in connection with the
investigation of at least one individual who has not yet been
charged,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Michaelson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 54, was convicted in May of directing the
biggest insider-trading ring in a generation and sentenced to
serve an 11-year prison term. He lost a bid yesterday to remain
free pending his appeal and was ordered by a panel of judges at
the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York to surrender to U.S.
prison officials on Dec. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Khan, 09-cr-991, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Del Monte Wins Approval of Settlement of KKR Buyout Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Del Monte Foods Co. (DLM) and Barclays Plc won a judge&#8217;s approval
of a $89.4 million settlement of investor lawsuits over the
buyout of the pet-food maker by a group of private-equity firms
led by KKR  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord, which gave Del Monte investors about 50 cents
more a share, &#8220;provides excellent consideration,&#8221; Delaware
Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster said before approving the
settlement yesterday at a hearing in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in San Francisco-based Del Monte, maker of Meow
Mix cat food and Milk Bone dog biscuits, alleged they were
shortchanged in KKR&#8217;s buyout, for which London-based Barclays
provided some financing. Shareholders received a total $19.50 a
share as a result of the accord, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristi Huller, a KKR spokeswoman, couldn&#8217;t immediately
comment on Laster&#8217;s decision to approve the settlement yesterday
and Kerrie-Ann Cohen, a Barclays spokeswoman, declined to
comment. Chrissy Stengel, a Del Monte spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord resolves claims that Barclays, which also served
as Del Monte&#8217;s financial adviser, had conflicting interests in
the $5.3 billion deal because of its financing for the buyers.
The private-equity group led by New York-based KKR included
Vestar Capital Partners and Centerview Partners LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the settlement, Laster yesterday approved a
total of $22.3 million to cover Del Monte investors&#8217; legal fees
and costs in bringing the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Del Monte Foods Co. Shareholder
Litigation, CA6027, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingersoll-Rand Reaches Settlement in Employee Payout Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR) reached a settlement with 130 employees
who sued for as much as $72 million in pay under an incentive
plan tied to the sale of the company&#8217;s Dresser-Rand Group Inc. (DRC)
unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms weren&#8217;t disclosed in court documents. The accord was
reached on Nov. 29 during the third week of a trial in federal
court in Newark, New Jersey. U.S. District Judge Dickinson
Debevoise dismissed jurors before they could weigh whether
Ingersoll-Rand owed from $11 million, as the company argued, to
$72 million, as workers claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a good settlement,&#8221; attorney Mark Lanier, who
represented a group of employees, said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;We were excited to finish the case. But by settling at this
time, we eliminated the risk of an adverse verdict or a two-year
appeal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingersoll-Rand, a Swords, Ireland-based maker of heating
and ventilation equipment, offered the plan, dated in 2000, to
retain workers when it began trying to sell Dresser-Rand. After
Dresser-Rand, which makes oilfield equipment, was sold in 2004
for $1.2 billion, Ingersoll-Rand said the 2000 plan no longer
applied. Workers sued and Debevoise ruled the plan remains in
effect, setting up the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misty Zelent, a spokeswoman for Ingersoll-Rand, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Nye v. Ingersoll Rand Co., 08-cv-03481, U.S.
District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Rothstein Employees Charged in Lawyer&#8217;s Ponzi Scheme &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors charged two more associates of Scott
Rothstein, the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, attorney who last year
admitted to selling investors interest in bogus settlements in
sexual-harassment and whistle-blower cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Boockvor, 66, was charged yesterday with one count
of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and helping Rothstein&#8217;s
scheme by preparing false documents purportedly from TD Bank (TC),
where Rothstein&#8217;s firm held about 38 trust accounts, prosecutors
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statements were used to convince investors that
Rothstein&#8217;s law firm was holding money in trust when in fact the
money was being spent on his lavish lifestyle and political and
charitable contributions. Boockvor worked for the firm doing a
variety of administrative tasks, according to prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marybeth Feiss, 42, one of Rothstein&#8217;s administrative
assistants, was charged with violating federal election campaign
laws and conspiring to defraud the U.S. by helping to bundle
more than $1 million in contributions to the presidential
campaign of U.S. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government said Feiss organized political fundraisers
where contributions were solicited for McCain&#8217;s campaign. The
law firm allegedly reimbursed its associates and employees for
their contributions, disguising those payments as bonuses or
expense reimbursements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feiss, reached at home, declined to comment on the charges.
No attorney was listed in federal records for Boockvor, and he
couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boockvor used unidentified co-conspirators who worked for
TD Bank to convince potential investors that the bank statements
were legitimate, the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest cases bring to eight the number of people
charged in the scheme. &#8220;We are not done yet,&#8221; U.S. Attorney
Wifredo A. Ferrer in Miami said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Boockvor, 0:11-cr-60281, and U.S. v.
Feiss, 0:11-cr-60282, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
Florida (Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) may be expelled from

coastline, EFE reported, citing Energy Minister Edison Lobao. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobao said Chevron must pay a 50 million real fine

</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper" date="Dec 03, 2011 12:36 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-03/goldman-s-forst-resigns-eric-lane-promoted-to-run-fund-unit-with-o-neill.html"><headline>Goldman&#8217;s Forst Resigns; Eric Lane Promoted to Run Fund Unit With O&#8217;Neill</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Edward C. Forst, co-head of the
investment management division at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), will
leave at the end of the year and cede his role to Eric S. Lane,
according to internal memos obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forst, 50, who first joined Goldman Sachs in 1994, is the
third member of the New York-based bank&#8217;s management committee
to resign since the beginning of November, after Kevin W. Kennedy, who ran the business in Latin America, and Yusuf A. Alireza, co-head of the Asia-Pacific business outside Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein has said that building the investment management
division, which oversees private equity and hedge funds and also
handles money for wealthy individuals, is a priority for the
firm. Timothy O&#8217;Neill, who has served as a co-head of the unit
since 2008, will remain in the role alongside Lane, the memos
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lane, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1996 and was promoted to
partner in 2002, is a longtime employee of the investment
management division, known as IMD. In that sense he represents a
change from recent leaders of the business, including Forst,
O&#8217;Neill and former managers such as Marc A. Spilker and Peter S. Kraus, who were transferred from positions in trading or
investment banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leader, Clients &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a long-tenured leader in IMD, Eric has demonstrated
dedication to our clients and a deep understanding of markets,&#8221;
Blankfein and Gary D. Cohn, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s president and chief
operating officer, said in one of the memos to staff yesterday.
&#8220;His extensive experience in the division positions him
well to lead IMD with Tim.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New
York, confirmed the memos&#8217; contents and declined to comment
further. The New York Times wrote about the changes yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forst, who worked at Bankers Trust before joining Goldman
Sachs, started his Goldman Sachs career in capital markets and
later held senior roles in the equities and fixed-income,
currencies and commodities, or FICC, trading divisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He became co-head of investment management in 2007 and then
left the firm in 2008 for a role at Harvard University. A year
later, he returned to Goldman Sachs as the firm&#8217;s senior
strategy officer and in 2010 returned to his current role at the
investment management division. &lt;/p&gt;
