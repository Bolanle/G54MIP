<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by
Louisiana''s pension fund for police, which said the bank''s
$88.3 million settlement with the U.S. Treasury Department
stemmed from a breach of fiduciary duty by its directors. </p>
<p>The complaint, filed today in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan, follows an Aug. 25 announcement that the company
agreed to resolve alleged violations of international sanctions
programs including Cuban assets control and anti-terrorism
regulations. </p>
<p>The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System,
an investor in JPMorgan that provides retirement benefits for
full-time municipal police officers in Louisiana, accused the
current directors of the New York-based bank, including Chairman
Jamie Dimon, of knowingly allowing and rewarding violations
of Treasury Department programs. </p>
<p>The misconduct occurred, unchecked, under the defendants''
watch because of their complicity in the improprieties alleged
herein, the pension fund said in the complaint. Because of
its acquiescence in the scheme, JPMC''s board cannot be
disinterested and independent. </p>
<p>The Treasury said that JPMorgan, through its correspondent
banks, maintained prohibited financial transactions with
sanctioned entities in countries including Cuba and Iran. The
JPMorgan payment agreed upon by the Office of Foreign Assets
Control, known as OFAC, involves egregious violations for
five years, according to a Treasury Department statement. </p>
<p>The OFAC enforcement action covers actions from December
2005 to March 2011 involving multiple violations of sanctions
programs, the Treasury Department said. The violations include
processing 1,711 wire transfers totaling $178.5 million from
December 2005 to March 2006 involving Cuban people and a trade
loan of
$2.9 million with a blocked affiliate to the Islamic Republic of
Iran Shipping Lines. </p>
<p>OFAC said the $88.3 million payment from JPMorgan is based
on the bank''s cooperation, transaction review and the absence of
an OFAC notice or finding of violation during the five years of
the transactions. </p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages caused by the
individual defendants'' unlawful course of conduct and breaches
of fiduciary duty, including costs to the company associated
with the settlement, remedial measures, damage to goodwill and
increased regulatory scrutiny. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. Dimon, 653083/2011, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by two
investors who claim the bank was at the very center of
Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>The investors, Stephen and Leyla Hill, claim JPMorgan
should have been aware that Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities LLC was passing all the money he stole from customers
through a JPMorgan account known as the 703 Account. They
seek to represent all investors who had money invested with
Madoff in December 2008, when he was arrested and the fraud
collapsed. He was convicted and sentenced to 150 years in
prison. </p>
<p>While numerous financial institutions enabled Madoff''s
fraud, JPMC was at the very center of that fraud, and thoroughly
complicit in it, the Hills said in a complaint filed today in
Manhattan federal court. JPMC could not perform even cursory
due diligence on Madoff or BLMIS without bumping up against
evidence of Madoff''s fraud. </p>
<p>The suit comes a week after a judge dismissed $19 billion
in claims by the trustee liquidating Madoff''s former firm. On
Nov. 1, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan ruled
that the trustee, Irving Picard, isn''t the legally appropriate
party to demand common-law damages on behalf of former Madoff
investors such as the Hills. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn''t immediately return a call seeking comment on
the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The case is: Hill v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 11-07961, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>General Motors Co. (GM), the U.S.
automaker trying to end losses in Europe, named the chief
executive officer of its German brand Adam Opel GmbH to head of
all of its European operations, effective Jan. 1. </p>
<p>Karl-Friedrich Stracke becomes president of GM Europe,
replacing Nick Reilly, who will retire in March after a 37-year
career, the Detroit-based automaker said today in an e-mailed
statement. Stracke will retain the Opel post, GM said. </p>
<p>GM is trying to stem losses in Europe that have totaled
$14.5 billion since 1999. The company''s European operations
earned $102 million before taxes and interest in the second
quarter following a first-quarter loss of $390 million,
including a writedown of goodwill. Without that cost, GM''s
European operations would have generated a first-quarter profit
of $5 million. </p>
<p>The main thing Stracke has to do stabilize Opel, Jim Hall, principal of Birmingham, Michigan-based consulting firm
2953 Analytics Inc., said in a phone interview. Opel is the
European-cost brand without the luxury of a premium nameplate to
offset their higher production costs. </p>
<p>Stracke, a 55-year-old German native, became head of Opel
in April as GM named Reilly, 61, the division''s supervisory
board chairman. The automaker opted to keep Opel in November
2009 after its emergence from U.S.-backed bankruptcy, backing
out of a German government-brokered agreement to sell the
majority of the unit to Canadian parts maker Magna International
Inc. (MG) and partner OAO Sberbank. </p>
<p>Reilly may just be tired, especially with the unmitigated
bizarreness that''s gone through GM Europe and all the proposed
sales of Opel to parties that didn''t speak the same language,
Hall said. </p>
<p>GM rose 1.7 percent to $24.01 at the close in New York. The
shares have slid 35 percent this year. </p>

<p>A Morgan Stanley (MS) infrastructure fund
sold its 50 percent stake in Inversiones Grupo Saesa Ltda.,
Chile''s second-largest electricity distributor, to Alberta
Investment Management Corp. for an undisclosed amount. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s MSIP bought Saesa in July 2008 with
Ontario Teachers'' Pension Plan. Teachers'' will retain a 50
percent interest in Saesa after the sale, Morgan Stanley wrote
in a statement distributed by Business Wire today. </p>
<p>Our investment thesis for Saesa has been proven out, as
we worked with the management team to implement operational
changes and make additional investments that should allow Saesa
to continue its strong growth, MSIP Chief Investment Officer
Sadek Wahba said in the statement. </p>
<p>Chile needs to double electricity capacity this decade to
meet growing demand. President Sebastian Pinera aims to achieve
average annual economic growth of 6 percent over his four-year
term and shorten Chile''s path to becoming the region''s first
advanced nation. Electricity demand probably will grow on
average 6.7 percent through 2020, Energy Minister Rodrigo Alvarez said last month. </p>
<p>Saesa operates 53,500 kilometers (33,000 miles) of
transmission and distribution lines and owns and operates about
190 megawatts of wind, hydro, diesel and gas electric-generating
capacity, according to today''s statement. </p>

<p>A shelf registration allows companies to sell a specified

<p>About $19.9 billion of the securities were unsold under a

updated on February 2010, according to the filing. About $1.7
million in securities were added today. </p>
<p>The new registration replaces the 2008 filing, which was

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised $1.1
billion selling shares of Industrial  Commercial Bank of China (601398)
Ltd., trimming an investment first made in 2006 after the stock
posted its biggest monthly rally in 2 1/2 years. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs sold 1.75 billion ICBC shares at HK$4.88 (63
cents), two people with knowledge of the matter said, asking not
to be identified because the details are private. ICBC fell 7.1
percent to HK$4.82 at 10:06 a.m. in Hong Kong trading </p>
<p>ICBC, the world''s largest bank by market value, jumped 28
percent in the month through yesterday''s close after the Chinese
government started buying shares in state-owned lenders that had
been pummeled by concern that bad loans may increase. Goldman
Sachs, which last month posted its second quarterly loss in 12
years, has made $2.65 billion on its ICBC stake since the fourth
quarter of 2006. </p>
<p>Goldman and most banks globally had a terrible third
quarter, so anything they can do to sort of salvage the year-
end will help, John Wadle, head of research on banking at
Mirae Asset Securities (HK) Ltd., said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television today. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which relied on trading for 62 percent of
revenue so far this year, recorded losses from that business on
21 days in the third quarter, the most since the fourth quarter
of 2008, according to a quarterly filing. </p>
<p>The amount of ICBC stock sold is smaller than the 2.4
billion shares Goldman Sachs offered, and the sale was priced at
the low end of the HK$4.88 to HK$5 offering range, according to
a term sheet obtained by Bloomberg News. The KBW Bank Index (BKX)
dropped 5.9 percent yesterday to 38.43, its steepest decline in
two months. </p>
<p>Third Sale </p>
<p>The deal was Goldman Sachs''s third sale of ICBC stock, an
investment it originally made in 2006 before the Chinese bank''s
initial public offering. Around that time, China allowed foreign
lenders to purchase pre-IPO stakes in state-owned banks after
about a decade spent bailing them out from bad debts. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, based in New York, sold 3.04 billion ICBC
shares at HK$5.74 each in September last year, raising about
$2.25 billion. The Wall Street firm sold an almost $2 billion
stake in ICBC in June 2009, the maximum number of shares it was
free to divest at the time. </p>
<p>ICBC President Yang Kaisheng said his bank understands and
respects Goldman Sachs''s decision to sell its shares. The sale
was to raise funds for internal adjustments Goldman Sachs is
undertaking, and isn''t a reflection of the New York-based bank''s
valuation of ICBC''s stock, Yang told reporters in Beijing
yesterday. </p>
<p>Modestly'' Reducing </p>
<p>The value of our holding has appreciated considerably and
we have modestly reduced the size of our investment over time,
but we intend to remain a very significant long-term shareholder
in ICBC, said Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs
in New York. Van Praag declined to comment on the size of the
sale. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs initially bought 4.9 percent of ICBC for
about $2.59 billion, according to a regulatory filing. The bank
booked a third-quarter loss of $1.05 billion on its investment
in ICBC, according to its Oct. 18 earnings report. </p>

<p>Credit-default swaps on the biggest
U.S. banks climbed as yields for Italy, the world''s third
biggest sovereign borrower, rose to euro era records and stoked
concern that Europe''s fiscal crisis is accelerating. </p>
<p>Contracts linked to the debt of Morgan Stanley jumped 34.1
basis points to 426.8 basis points and those tied to Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America Corp. (BAC) increased 30.4 to
377.4 as of 2:32 p.m. in New York, according to data provider
CMA. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) added 26 to 339 and a gauge of
U.S. corporate credit risk rose by the most since September. </p>
<p>Traders pushed the contracts higher on concern that
Europe''s burgeoning debt crisis may infect bank balance sheets
worldwide. Yields on Italy''s $2.2 trillion of debt surged as
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi agreed to step down
after the approval of an austerity plan and a clearinghouse said
it will demand more money to back trades in the bonds, further
squeezing banks. </p>
<p>There is a risk of contagion that sits there in the
financial sector, Scott MacDonald, head of credit and economic
research at Aladdin Capital Management LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut, said in a telephone interview. If we have a big
tumble here with Italy, it''s going to cause a very steep
recession in Europe and it will have ripples through interbank
markets. </p>
<p>Yields on Italian five-year notes rose above 7 percent for
the first time in the euro era. The yield on Italy''s 10-year
bond rose to 7.32 percent, and credit-default swaps on Italy''s
government bonds jumped to 562, CMA data show. </p>
<p>Margins Raised </p>
<p>LCH Clearnet SA raised the deposit factor charged for
Italian bonds due in seven to 10 years. The deposit requirement
will be raised to 11.65 percent, the French unit of LCH Clearnet
said in a document on its website dated yesterday. That compares
with a charge of 6.65 percent announced on Oct. 7. </p>
<p>Clearing houses guarantee investors'' trades are completed
by standing in the middle of two counterparties. They raise
margin requirements to protect themselves against losses if one
side of the trade fails. </p>
<p>LCH raising margin requirements really is not a good
sign, according to MacDonald. This is something that''s done
when people feel that the country or the other party at the
other end of the line cannot fund itself, so you''re beginning to
raise issues of liquidity, he said. The drying up of liquidity
in international markets is what gets dangerous, MacDonald
said. That''s a real problem. That impacts Main Street, and
that''s what you had in 2008. </p>
<p>MF Global Filing </p>
<p>New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS) said last month it had $2.1
billion of net exposure in the peripheral European countries. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said today that it had $4.16 billion of gross
funded exposure to governments, financial institutions and
companies in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain as of
Sept. 30, with Italy accounting for more than half. </p>
<p>Concern over bets on European sovereign debt toppled New
York-based MF Global Inc. last month. The futures broker filed
for bankruptcy protection on Oct. 31 after a $6.3 billion bet on
the bonds of some of Europe''s most indebted nations prompted
regulator concerns and a credit rating downgrade. </p>
<p>MF Global''s bankruptcy triggered an 18 percent slide in New
York-based Jefferies Group Inc. last week, as investors
speculated that the firm could be hurt by similar risks.
Jefferies has issued six statements this month detailing its
investments in European sovereign debt and said it cut both its
gross holdings in sovereign securities of Portugal, Italy,
Ireland, Greece and Spain by almost 50 percent since last week. </p>
<p>Index Soars </p>
<p>The firm''s $550 million of 6.875 percent senior unsecured
notes maturing in April 2021 fell 2.25 cents to 85.5 cents on
the dollar to yield 9.2 percent at 2:27 p.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on Citigroup Inc. (C) added 27.9 basis
points to 257.9, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. Contracts tied to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s debt
increased 13 to 153.1, and those on Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) added 13
to 153, the data show. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 8.4 basis points to a
mid-price of 129.6 basis points as of 2:53 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. </p>
<p>The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has increased
from 113.4 basis points on Oct. 27, the lowest level in more
than two months, on concern that Europe''s debt crisis is
spreading. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, had $2.32 billion of funded
credit exposure to Italy''s government, financial institutions
and companies as of Sept. 30. </p>
<p>Hedges that offset those risks result in a net funded
exposure of $700 million, the New York-based company said in a
quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
today. Substantially all of the hedges are purchased from
investment-grade counterparties based outside of Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, Goldman Sachs said. </p>
<p>Italian stocks and bonds fell today on concern Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi''s offer to resign won''t be enough to
contain the turmoil in a nation with the euro-region''s second-
biggest debt. Concern that Europe''s debt crisis would spark bank
losses contributed to a 19 percent tumble in the 843-company
Bloomberg World Financial Index this year. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said Italy accounted for more than half of
the $4.16 billion of gross funded exposure the firm had to the
five European countries on Sept. 30, and less than half of the
$2.46 billion in net funded exposure to those nations, according
to the filing. The company also has $750 million of unfunded
lending commitments to borrowers in the five countries, the
filing shows. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s net funded exposure tied to Italy was
$1.79 billion at the end of September, accounting for most of
the $2.11 billion total from the five countries, the New York-
based firm said in a presentation last month. The nations
represented $5.69 billion in exposure before hedges, with risks
linked to Italy of $4.58 billion. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C)''s net current funded exposure tied to the
five countries was $7.2 billion at the end of September, more
than three times the exposure to Belgium and France, the New
York-based bank said last week in a filing. Total cross-border
claims linked to Italy were $14.5 billion. The company said the
risk of loss associated with the exposure is likely materially
lower than the amount disclosed. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s exposure to Italy from trading,
lending and securities available for sale was $11.3 billion as
of Sept. 30, the New York-based company said last week in a
filing. Net exposure including hedging and collateral was $5.5
billion. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase </p>
<p>Net exposure to Italy''s sovereign debt was $2.4 billion at
the end of the third quarter, more than half the $4.5 billion of
net sovereign exposure it had to the five countries. JPMorgan''s
credit-default swaps on the debt were bought from counterparties
based outside those countries and are either investment grade or
are well-supported by collateral arrangements, JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. (BAC)''s non-U.S. exposure linked to Italy
was $6.54 billion at the end of September, almost 45 percent of
the total linked to the five European countries, the Charlotte,
North Carolina-based lender said Nov. 3. </p>
<p>Of that total, $1.5 billion is in sovereign risk, most of
which is hedged by credit-default protection, the bank said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley fell 6.6 percent in New York trading at
10:39 a.m., the biggest decline among the largest U.S. banks.
The drop was 5.5 percent at Citigroup, 5.3 percent at Goldman
Sachs, and 4.5 percent at JPMorgan. Bank of America lost 3.3
percent. </p>

<p>Oil prices may be significantly
higher if supplies from Iran are disrupted following a United

Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts. </p>
<p>While shut-in Iranian production is certainly not our
base case, we highlight the upside risk to our price forecasts
if tensions flare to the point of conflict, analysts including
Hussein Allidina in New York said in a report yesterday. </p>
<p>It''s unlikely that there will be a significant supply
disruption, according to the analysts, and there will be
little lasting impact on crude prices. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-biggest U.S. shopping-mall owner, said funds from
operations excluding some items rose 0.4 percent in the third
quarter as occupancy in its regional malls increased. </p>
<p>The company''s core FFO climbed to $224.2 million, or 23
cents a share, from $223.2 million, or 68 cents, a year earlier,
the Chicago-based real estate investment trust said in a
statement today. General Growth''s forecast for full-year core
FFO beat analyst estimates. FFO is a measure of a property
owner''s ability to generate cash. </p>
<p>General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection a year
ago, is refinancing debt to lower expenses and plans to
redevelop, expand and refurbish shopping centers to boost
growth. Last month, the company said it sold Faneuil Hall

Westlake Center in Seattle and a shopping center in Provo, Utah,
as it focuses on its regional malls. </p>
<p>It''s still a story of debt refinancing and pushing out

transferred to a new publicly traded REIT, Rouse Properties Inc. </p>
<p>Full-Year Forecast </p>
<p>General Growth forecast core FFO of 93 cents to 95 cents a
share for the full year. Analysts projected full-year FFO of 90
cents a share, the average of 11 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey. </p>
<p>The core FFO excludes items such as discontinued operations
and costs related to debt retirement. Net income was $252
million, or 26 cents a share, compared with a loss of $231
million, or 69 cents, a year earlier. </p>
<p>General Growth said occupancy in its regional malls rose to
92.7 percent in the quarter and initial rent on leases completed
in 2011 increased 6.7 percent to $63.71. Comparable sales by its
tenants gained 7.8 percent to $471 a square foot. </p>
<p>The company is among landlords who are increasing rents on
new leases as sales by its tenants rise. U.S. retail purchases
climbed 1.1 percent in September, the most in seven months,
Commerce Department data showed. </p>
<p>General Growth announced earnings before the start of
regular U.S. trading. Its shares rose 2.2 percent to $14.83
yesterday in New York. </p>
<p>Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), the only U.S. mall owner larger
than General Growth, on Oct. 25 reported third-quarter results
that beat analysts'' estimates and raised its full-year forecast
as income from rents rose. Simon, based in Indianapolis, also
boosted its quarterly dividend to 90 cents a share, a 12.5
percent increase. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
relied on trading for 62 percent of revenue so far this year,
recorded losses from that business on 21 days in the third
quarter, the most since the fourth quarter of 2008. </p>
<p>The firm''s traders lost more than $100 million on one of
the days, according to the New York-based company''s quarterly
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They
produced more than $100 million on nine days out of 64 total
days in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, the filing showed. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, last
month reported its second quarterly loss as a public company as
it marked down the value of investments the firm had made with
its own money. The bank, which sustained a 22 percent drop in
client-trading revenue in the first nine months of this year,
has said it plans to cut about 1,000 jobs this year. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
this week that its traders lost money on 31 days during the
quarter. Traders at JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America
Corp., the two biggest U.S. banks, lost money on 16 days and 20
days respectively, according to company filings last week. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s traders lost money on 15 days during the
second quarter and on a single day in the first quarter,
according to company reports. Goldman Sachs recorded zero
trading losses in the first quarter of 2010, the only such
perfect quarter in the firm''s history. </p>
<p>Trading losses exceeded Goldman Sachs''s value-at-risk
limit, a measure of how much the company estimates it could lose
in the securities markets in one day, on one occasion during the

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, will get a $20 million fee
for advising El Paso Corp. (EP) if the pipeline company completes a
planned $21 billion sale to Kinder Morgan Inc. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is the second-largest shareholder of Kinder
Morgan and has two directors on the Houston-based pipeline
company''s board. Goldman Sachs didn''t take part in negotiations
with Kinder Morgan or express an opinion on the deal price,
Kinder Morgan said today in a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs had been advising Houston-based El Paso on an
unrelated plan to spin off the company''s exploration and
production division when Kinder Morgan made an unsolicited
offer, Kinder Morgan said. Goldman Sachs collected $5 million
for that work and would have gotten another $25 million if the
spinoff had been completed, Kinder Morgan said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s private-equity arm invested alongside
Kinder Morgan Chief Executive Officer Richard Kinder to take his
company private in a 2007 leveraged buyout, and the New York-
based investment bank retains a stake after an initial public
offering this year. Goldman Sachs directors on the Kinder Morgan
board, Henry Cornell and Kenneth Pontarelli, didn''t take part in
discussions about the El Paso offer, Kinder Morgan said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) advised El Paso on negotiations with Kinder
Morgan and gave an opinion that the sale price was fair. The
bank may collect a total of $35 million for its advice if the
deal is completed, Kinder Morgan said. </p>
<p>Kinder Morgan''s financial advisers, Evercore Partners Inc.

<p>General Motors Co. (GM), the biggest U.S.
automaker, is optimistic about Europe as the manufacturer
shifts marketing of the Chevrolet brand in the region to its
Asian and Middle Eastern unit. </p>
<p>The General Motors International Operations unit, which
already sells GM''s brands including Chevrolet outside the
Americas and central and western Europe, will take on the new
market as of Jan. 1, Tim Lee, president of the division, said in
an interview in Dubai. </p>
<p>GM''s global third-quarter profit fell 2.5 percent and the
Detroit-based carmaker abandoned a goal yesterday of breaking
even this year in Europe, where it makes Opel and Vauxhall
models, as economic conditions in the region deteriorate. Lee''s
GMIO unit was the automaker''s only business outside North
America to report a profit in the quarter, in contrast to losses
at GM Europe and in South America. </p>
<p>I am very optimistic that between the divisions --
Chevrolet, Opel and Vauxhall -- we can find good synergies and
improve our business conditions, Lee said. </p>
<p>GM expects a very strong end to the year in GMIO''s
markets, Lee said. The unit is also responsible for GM''s
business in Africa and former Soviet countries including Russia. </p>
<p>Floods in Thailand, currently in the 15th week, won''t have
any material impact on GM''s operations in the country in the
fourth quarter, Lee said. The company has relocated its national
headquarters from Bangkok to its plant in the city of Rayong,
where production is continuing, he said. </p>
<p>Development Costs </p>
<p>GM''s worldwide profit this year has been affected by
increasing costs related to engineering, marketing and
introducing models, Lee said. </p>
<p>The spending has brought us down a bit, but these are
investments we''re making in the future, said Lee, who is
presenting Chevrolet''s new TrailBlazer sport-utility vehicle at
the Dubai International Motor Show. </p>
<p>The U.S. carmaker had aimed to break even this year in
Europe in terms of earnings before interest and taxes, excluding
reorganization costs. GM Europe''s losses during the quarter
narrowed to $292 million from $559 million a year earlier, while
the unit''s deliveries rose 4.6 percent to 407,000 vehicles. The
results in Europe and South America were unacceptable, Chief
Executive Officer Dan Akerson said yesterday. </p>
<p>Europe is a concern, Lee said. We have yet to solve
the riddle in terms of being steadily profitable in Europe, but
we are working on it every day both from the Opel, the Vauxhall
and the Chevrolet side. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends
buying the euro after developments in Europe''s sovereign-debt
crisis this week. Morgan Stanley said its time to sell the 17-
nation currency against the dollar. </p>
<p>The 17-nation currency gained today, rising 1.1 percent to
$1.3749, as former European Central Bank Vice President Lucas
Papademos was sworn in as prime minster of Greece and Italy''s
Senate approved an austerity bill, paving the way for a new
administration that may be led by former European Union
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. Italian bonds gained,
pushing yields down from euro-era records above 7 percent. </p>
<p>The emergency of the new governments helps reduce near-
term political uncertainty and suggests that euro-zone fiscal
tensions could continue to decline, at least for a period of
time, wrote Thomas Stolper, Goldman''s London-based chief
foreign-exchange strategist, in a client note. </p>
<p>Investors should target $1.40 and should exit the trade if
the euro falls to $1.35, according to the Goldman note. In a
video webcast today, Stolper reiterated a 12-month forecast of
$1.48 for the euro. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said the shared currency may fall to $1.30,
according to analysts led by Hans Redeker, the firm''s head of
foreign-exchange strategy in London. Political uncertainties
and Italian bond yields that remain above 6 percent leave the
firm fundamentally bearish on the euro as Italy runs the risk
of being too big to save, the firm said in a client note. </p>
<p>Traders should sell the euro, targeting $1.3050, and end
the bet if it rises to $1.3950, Morgan Stanley recommended in a
note yesterday. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the U.S. oil
company that helped engineer a 48 percent production increase
from Iraq''s West Qurna field in one year, risks a backlash from
that nation''s central government by signing exploration deals
with semi-autonomous Kurds. </p>
<p>Exxon, the world''s biggest company by market value, recently
signed contracts with the Kurdistan Regional Government to
explore six blocks in the country''s north, Michael Howard, an
adviser to the regional authority, said today in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>Exxon may be jeopardizing existing oilfield-development
agreements overseen by Iraq''s central government, Abdul-Mahdy al-
Ameedi, the head of the Baghdad-based Oil Ministry''s licensing
department, said today in a telephone interview. A dispute
between Baghdad and the regional government over oil contracts
led to a temporary suspension of crude exports in 2009. </p>
<p>They know very well that any company will be disqualified
from implementing its contract with the Oil Ministry if it
signs a deal with Kurdish regional authorities, Al-Ameedi said.
It''s the public policy of the Oil Ministry that companies have
to choose one of two options: The KRG or the Oil Ministry. </p>
<p>Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon,
declined to comment. The company''s shares gained 1 percent to
$79.47 at 12:49 p.m. in New York. The stock has risen 9.2 percent
this year, poised for the biggest annual gain since 2007. </p>
<h2>No Blacklist </h2>
<p>The Oil Ministry''s warning may be an empty threat, given the
importance of Exxon''s expertise to central government efforts to
lift production in southern oil fields, said Richard Quin, lead
analyst for Middle East-North Africa energy research at Wood
Mackenzie Consultants Ltd. </p>
<p>It wouldn''t be in Iraq''s best interest to effectively rip
up their contract, Quin said in a telephone interview from
Edinburgh. That would be detrimental to Iraq''s expansion of
southern exports. </p>
<p>Iraqi law also appears to be on the side of Exxon and its
Kurdish partners, Quin said. </p>
<p>There is no legislation or real mechanism for Baghdad to
really force through a blacklist, he said. </p>
<p>Exxon, whose worldwide crude output exceeded that of every
member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
except Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela last year, is the latest
Western entrant into Kurdistan. Others include Vallares Plc, the
explorer founded by former BP Plc (BP/) Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward, Afren Plc (AFR), Hess Corp. (HES), Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR), Marathon Oil
Corp. (MRO) and Repsol YPF SA. (REP) </p>
<h2>Shares Rise </h2>
<p>The announcement of Exxon''s Kurdish contracts boosted the
shares of other explorers that are targeting the region. Gulf
Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP) surged 33 percent in London trading,
while DNO International ASA (DNO) jumped 31 percent in Oslo. </p>
<p>An index of 10 Western oil companies with Kurdish
exploration agreements rose as much as 3.3 percent today, the
biggest intraday gain since Oct. 27. </p>
<p>Iraqi political leaders will have a say in how the central
government and Oil Ministry react to Exxon''s Kurdish agreements,
Al-Ameedi said. </p>
<p>Any decision on whether to penalize Exxon wouldn''t only be a
commercial decision, he said. The ministry needs to discuss
with the cabinet in order to take the right action. </p>
<p>Exxon and partners Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Iraq''s Oil
Exploration Co. boosted production from the West Qurna field in
the southern part of the country to 370,000 barrels a day last
month from about 250,000 barrels a year earlier. </p>
<p>The companies are injecting water into the field to flush
more crude to the surface, under the terms of a 20-year
development deal signed in January 2010. </p>

<p>U.S. banks led by JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) are boosting their share of loan
underwriting in Europe to the highest since 2007 as French
lenders'' dominance ebbs amid the region''s expanding debt crisis. </p>
<p>The Wall Street banks captured 10 percent of the $860
billion of loans arranged this year, up from 8 percent in 2010.
BNP Paribas SA, Credit Agricole SA (ACA) and Societe Generale SA have
15 percent of the market, the least since 2006 and down from
16.5 percent a year ago, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole remain the top two
lenders. Societe Generale slipped back to its No. 6 ranking of
2009. </p>
<p>The trend of U.S. banks taking market share from the
French banks has started and will probably continue as U.S.
lenders are in a better situation now having addressed their
problems from 2007 and 2008, whereas French banks are facing the
need to adapt, said Elisabeth Grandin, a director in Standard
 Poor''s European financial services group in Paris. </p>
<p>Citigroup and JPMorgan were hired by Danone (BN) to help
coordinate the biggest yogurt maker''s 2 billion-euro ($2.72
billion) credit line in July, according to Bloomberg data. BNP
Paribas, Credit Agricole and Societe Generale were among the
leaders of Danone''s last loan in December 2007. </p>
<p>Dollar Funding </p>
<p>French lenders are pulling back as the cost for European
banks to fund in dollars increases. The cost to banks of
converting euro payments into greenbacks as measured by three-
month cross-currency swap dropped to 113 basis points below the
euro interbank offered rate today, from 27.6 at the end of June. </p>
<p>If the difficulty in getting dollar funding forces them
to pull away from some deals, clearly this will be opportunities
for others to step up, said Ashu Khullar, London-based co-head
of Europe, Middle East and Africa loan structuring and
syndication at Citigroup. European banks have been very active
in trade, commodities and pre-export financings which tend to be
largely based in dollars. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in credit markets, Amgen Inc. (AMGN) and Peabody Energy
Inc. led $38.2 billion of corporate bond sales this week, the
most in more than five months, as economists lowering the odds
of a U.S. recession overshadowed Europe''s debt crisis. Empresas
ICA SAB, Mexico''s largest construction company, plans to sell
more bonds linked to revenue from infrastructure projects. </p>
<p>Futures traders are scaling back bets for the speed at which
the Federal Reserve will eventually lift its target rate for
overnight loans as U.S. employers remain slow to add workers. </p>
<p>Amgen Offering </p>
<p>Amgen, the world''s largest biotechnology firm, issued $6
billion of debt in the biggest bond offering since March,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. St. Louis-based Peabody
Energy, the U.S. coal producer, sold $3.1 billion of notes to
finance its acquisition of MacArthur Coal Ltd., the data show. </p>
<p>Issuance climbed 38 percent from last week with borrowers
from Israel''s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. to Encana
Corp., Canada''s biggest natural-gas producer, selling corporate
debt as yields fell. Sales reached $20.7 billion on Nov. 7, the
busiest day since May 27, after European Central Bank executive
board member Juergen Stark predicted the region''s debt crisis
will be under control within two years. </p>
<p>The U.S. economy will grow by 2.2 percent next year,
according to the median forecast of 63 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. That''s up from 2.0 percent in last month''s poll. The
chance of renewed recession fell to 25 percent from 30 percent,
economists in the survey said. </p>
<p>ICA Bonds </p>
<p>ICA sold 7.1 billion pesos ($525 million) of securities on
Sept. 29 that are backed by receivables from a contract to build
and operate prisons for Mexico''s government. The bonds, which
mature in 21 years, are rated AAA on a local scale by Standard 
Poor''s. That''s 12 levels higher than ICA''s own BB- rating by the
credit-rating service. </p>
<p>ICA may use a similar structure to sell debt for water-
treatment plants because it offers pretty good terms, Chief
Operating Officer Alonso Quintana said Nov. 9 in an interview in
Mexico City. </p>
<p>Implied yields on Eurodollar futures that expire in
December 2014 have slid 45 basis points, or 0.45 percentage
point, since Oct. 12 as traders price-in a slower pace of Fed
monetary policy tightening. The Fed has held its target rate for
overnight loans in a zero to 0.25 percent range since December
2008 and pledged in August to hold its key rate steady at least
mid-2013. </p>
<p>Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said this month the pace of
growth remains frustratingly slow though concern dimmed that
the U.S. economy risks sliding into another recession. </p>
<p>Europe Ratings </p>
<p>Eurodollar contracts, the world''s most actively traded
futures, are based on predictions for the three-month dollar
London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and are used to
speculate on changes in central-bank policy. </p>
<p>The European Commission may scale back plans to require
periodic changes in the firms that rate a company''s credit on
concerns there aren''t enough of them for the proposal to work,
said a person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The commission, the 27-nation EU''s executive arm, had
considered requiring companies to change the ratings firm they
use every three years to ensure that assessments remain
impartial, with a four-year period before a firm can be rehired.
The measure may now be scaled back, including a possible
extension of the three-year deadline for companies that hire
multiple ratings firms, said the person, who couldn''t be named
because the discussions are private. </p>
<p>Barclays'' High-Yield Forecast </p>
<p>Barclays is forecasting that speculative-grade borrowers
will sell in 2012 between $180 billion and $200 billion of junk
bonds and $150 billion to $175 billion of leveraged loans. </p>
<p>While we expect primary markets to be open in 2012, the
pace of issuance should be somewhat slower than in 2010 and
2011, as the low all-in yield environment of early 2011 pulled
forward some refinancing activity that otherwise may have
occurred next year, credit strategists led by Bradley Rogoff
said yesterday in the report. </p>
<p>From January through July of this year, companies sold
$184.6 billion in notes, a 50 percent increase from 2010,
according to Barclays. </p>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 index
fell for the second straight session yesterday, declining 0.03
cent to 91.9 cents on the dollar. The measure, which tracks the
100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien leveraged loans, has
climbed from 86.96 on Oct. 5, which was the lowest since
December 2009. </p>
<p>Loan Ratings </p>
<p>Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3
by Moody''s Investors Service and lower than BBB- by SP. </p>
<p>In emerging markets, relative yields rose 3 basis points to
395 basis points, or 3.95 percentage points, according to
JPMorgan''s EMBI Global index. The measure has ranged from 259 on
Jan. 5 to 496 on Oct. 4. </p>
<p>Corporate borrowers in Europe refinanced a record $454
billion of loans this year, up 52 percent from a year earlier,
to benefit from lower borrowing costs in the first half of 2011,
according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Interest margins have increased since July, with the
average paid by investment-grade borrowers in Europe at 91.6
basis points more than benchmark rates, up from 84.4 basis
points during the first six months of 2011. The interest margin
for leveraged buyouts increased to 434 basis points from 419.8,
the data show. </p>
<p>Capital Constraints </p>
<p>Banks that are less affected by dollar funding problems
and balance sheet reductions are unlikely to start pricing very
aggressively because everyone has capital constraints, said
Jon Abando, executive director of EMEA loan capital markets at
JPMorgan in London. If some banks are priced out of deals then
borrowers have a reduced number of banks which can participate
in a transaction. </p>
<p>U.S. lenders are closing in on France''s two biggest banks
after their share of the market tumbled to as low as 5.8 percent
following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. </p>
<p>In 2000, U.S. firms held 28 percent of the market,
according to Bloomberg data. Tighter regulations and the
sovereign debt crisis will lead the two biggest French lenders
to cut at least 300 billion euros from their balance sheets by
2013. </p>
<p>BNP Paribas (BNP) and Societe Generale announced their plans to
scale back in September. Rather than tap the market for capital,
the two lenders are seeking to free up a combined 10 billion
euros through asset cuts and disposals. </p>
<p>Lost Dominance </p>
<p>BNP Paribas lost its dominance in dollar-denominated loans
this year, falling to No. 2 after being supplanted by New York-
based JPMorgan, according to Bloomberg data. Paris-based BNP
Paribas, which helped arrange a $2.5 billion credit line in
April for SABMiller Plc, was absent from the brewer''s $12.5
billion loan from August to take over Foster''s Group Ltd. </p>
<p>Ashling Cashmore, a spokeswoman for BNP Paribas in London,
declined to comment, as did Charline Coue, a spokeswoman for
Credit Agricole and a spokesman in London for Societe Generale. (GLE) </p>
<p>We are aware of the short-term funding issues some
European banks are facing, which has made them less willing to
lend, especially in dollars, Jan-Maarten Mulder, the global
head of corporate finance and treasury at Amsterdam-based
Trafigura Beheer BV, said in an interview. There is relatively
more pressure on French banks recently. </p>
<p>Trafigura, the third-largest independent oil trader, may
switch some of its dollar funding into euros and seek more
letters of credit which have no capital requirements for
lenders, Mulder said. The firm has sought to diversify into the
U.S. and Asian market. </p>
<p>New Entrants </p>
<p>We are seeing some U.S. banks like Citigroup move into
our industry as they try to bolster their franchise, Mulder
said. We welcome new entrants into the market but even though
some traditional trade finance banks are going through difficult
times, they will remain dominant lenders. </p>
<p>Dollar-denominated deals account for 27 percent of the
market this year compared with 33 percent last year, Bloomberg
data show. </p>
<p>Citigroup is one of the managers of a $870 million term
loan last month to OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil producer controlled
by Russia''s natural-gas export monopoly, which didn''t have a
U.S. bank arranging its $1.5 billion pre-export financing last
year, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>In light of the market dislocation, there will be a
reshuffling of league table rankings in the next couple of years
as European banks try to identify who their key clients are and
rationalize their lending, said Citigroup''s Khullar. We''ve
been proactive in providing capital to our key clients in the
past 18 months after we addressed our issues from the last
crisis. </p>
<p>Balance Sheet </p>
<p>BNP Paribas is shrinking its balance sheet after total
assets jumped 34 percent to 2.24 trillion euros in the three
years to June 2010, equal to the size of Bank of America Corp.
and Morgan Stanley combined. Total assets fell to 1.93 trillion
euros in June, about the same size as France''s economy. </p>
<p>French financial firms top the list of Greek creditors with
about $57 billion in overall exposure to private and public debt
at the end of March, according to the Bank for International
Settlements based in Basel, Switzerland. </p>
<p>JPMorgan hired David Shaw from Barclays Capital in June for
the EMEA acquisition and leveraged finance group. Simon Rankin,
joined from Deutsche Bank to help run the newly formed emerging
market team within the group, according to Kate Haywood, a
London-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan. </p>

<p>Yusuf Alireza, who was promoted to
co-president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s operations in the
Asia-Pacific region outside Japan in January, is leaving after
19 years with the company, according to an internal memo. </p>
<p>David Ryan will remain as president of the business,
according to the memo from Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, and
Vice Chairman J. Michael Evans. Goldman Sachs spokesman Edward
Naylor confirmed the contents of the document. </p>
<p>Alireza, 41, is the most senior departure from Goldman
Sachs in the region since Ravi Sinha, former co-head of
investment banking for Asia ex-Japan, stepped down in April 2010.
Alireza was among four Asia-based members of the firm''s global
management committee. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s net revenue from Asia shrank to $7.1
billion last year from $8.3 billion in 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley''s net revenue from the
region more than doubled last year, to $4.3 billion. At 18
percent, Asia still accounted for a greater share of Goldman
Sachs''s overall revenue than at Morgan Stanley, which got 14
percent of its total from the region last year, the data shows. </p>
<p>Alireza has no plan to join a rival company, said a person
with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified.
Goldman promoted him along with Ryan in January, with Alireza
overseeing trading operations and Ryan focusing on advisory
services such as arranging mergers and managing stock sales. </p>
<p>Quarterly Loss </p>
<p>Alireza joined the firm''s fixed-income research group in
New York in 1992 and had held positions in fixed-income sales
and hedge fund sales, rising to become a partner in 2004,
according to the memo. He moved to Hong Kong in 2008 to run the
securities division in the Asia-Pacific region. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, based in New York, last month reported its
second quarterly loss in 12 years as a public company as the
firm lost money on investments. Still, revenue from trading
stocks and bonds rose 16 percent from the second quarter and the
backlog of investment-banking assignments climbed, the firm said. </p>
<p>Buckley Ratchford, Goldman Sachs''s head of global bank loan
trading and distressed investing, and Blake W. Mather, who runs
bank loan sales at the firm, are leaving at the end of this year,
according to internal memos. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. (BMY)''s experimental drug apixaban wasn''t safer or more effective
than a standard treatment in stopping blood clots in the legs
and lungs of patients after hospitalization, a study found. </p>
<p>The trial, reported today at the American Heart Association
meeting in Orlando, Florida, is the second to show new
anticoagulants don''t provide a benefit in severely ill patients
more than Sanofi''s injected drug Lovenox, the current standard.
Johnson  Johnson and Bayer AG (BAYN)''s Xarelto failed to beat the
standard therapy in a trial reported last April. </p>
<p>The potentially deadly clots occurred in 2.7 percent of
those given apixaban, also known by the brand name Eliquis,
compared with 3.1 percent of those given Lovenox, the results
showed. The difference wasn''t statistically significant,
researchers said. While the drugs'' benefits increased over time,
both also triggered more major bleeding. </p>
<p>We''ve made great headway in preventing deep vein
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in surgical patients and
hospitalized medical patients, said lead author Samuel
Goldhaber, director of the venous thromboembolism research group
at Brigham and Women''s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical
School, in a statement. Where we have failed to make progress
is the after-hospital discharge medical patient. </p>
<p>8 Million Patients </p>
<p>There are about 8 million U.S. patients a year that are at
moderate to high risk of venous thromboembolism, Goldhaber said.
About 1 percent of patients develop symptoms from the clots
after they are released from the hospital, and they are most
common in the following three months, said Mary Cushman,
director of the thrombosis program at the University of Vermont. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, and Bristol-Myers
are both based in New York. The companies are evaluating the
results and haven''t decided what their next steps will be, said
MacKay Jimeson, a Pfizer spokesman. </p>
<p>Researchers in the apixaban study and earlier trial of
Xarelto, made by New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ), and Bayer, of Leverkusen, Germany, were looking to see
if longer treatment with the new pills could cut death rates and
prevent complications from leg clots that occur in as many as
600,000 Americans each year. </p>
<p>Hospitalized patients, such as those with pneumonia or
heart failure, are at high risk for the clots. </p>
<p>The chance of success in the study was slim given the
difficulty of treating such sick patients, especially after the
Xarelto setback, said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink
Swann  Co. in Boston, in a Nov. 4 note to investors. </p>
<p>Atrial Fibrillation </p>
<p>Apixaban is in development to prevent stroke in patients
with atrial fibrillation, an erratic heartbeat that occurs in 2
million Americans a year. If approved, it will compete against
Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH''s Pradaxa in a market
estimated to top $10 billion in annual sales. </p>
<p>Analysts predict apixaban may take the lead after a study
presented in August found it reduced deaths and bleeding rates
more than warfarin, a form of rat poison used to treat the
condition for more than five decades, unlike its rivals. </p>
<p>Afib is clearly the primary indication for apixaban,
said Marc Goodman, an analyst at UBS AG in New York, in a note
after the results were released. While the drug was forecast to
generate about $100 million in 2015 for medically ill patients,
the results should have no meaningful impact on the
companies'' shares or the drug''s eventual sales, he said. </p>
<p>Hospitalized Patients </p>
<p>In hospitalized patients, the risk of the dangerous clots
were lower with apixaban as the trial progressed and patients
stopped getting Lovenox, which was given for longer than
patients now get it in routine care, Goldhaber said. That raises
the possibility that another study may find a benefit, he said. </p>
<p>There is no question this is a tremendous opportunity to
design and carry out a new trial, he said in an interview. I
have been in this field for 30 years, and I have no doubt that
it is going to happen. </p>
<p>Bleeding occurred in 7.73 percent of patients on apixaban,
up from 6.81 percent of those given Lovenox. Major bleeding was
2.5-fold higher in patients given apixban, occurring in 0.47
percent of those given the experimental drug versus 0.19 percent
of those on Lovenox. </p>
<p>The increased risk of major bleeding poses a problem since
few patients released from the hospital will ultimately develop
symptoms from the clots, which the drug was designed to prevent,
said Cushman from the University of Vermont. Cushman, who wasn''t
involved in the trial, reviewed the findings at a press
conference at the heart meeting. </p>
<p>The study was funded by Pfizer and Bristol-Myers and
published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Johnson 
Johnson, maker of Xarelto with Germany''s Bayer, is based in New
Brunswick, New Jersey. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) Chief Executive
Officer Rex Tillerson is playing catch-up with a former rival,
ex-BP Plc (BP/) CEO Tony Hayward, in a race to tap oil riches in Iraq''s
Kurdish region that dwarf the deep-water Gulf of Mexico. </p>
<p>Exxon, the world''s largest company by market value, signed a
contract to drill for crude in the Kurdish-controlled north of
the country on Oct. 18, Ashti Hawrami, the natural resources
minister for the Kurdistan Regional Government, said yesterday
during an oil conference in Erbil, Iraq. Hayward''s Vallares Plc
has a six-week head start with its $2.1 billion agreement in
September to acquire Turkey-based Genel Energy Plc, the biggest
oil producer in Kurdistan. </p>
<p>Home to about 40 percent of the Iraqi nation''s 115 billion
barrels of reserves, Kurdistan has attracted keen interest from
small and midsized foreign explorers since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 opened the region for the first time in decades.
The biggest international producers such as Exxon had steered
clear of Kurdistan to avoid getting in the middle of a long-
standing dispute between Iraq and Kurdish leaders over how to
divide oil revenue. </p>
<p>Iraq''s central government said it''s settled the dispute with
an agreement that would open the door to international oil
companies operating in the Kurdish region without penalty from
Iraq, according to a Nov. 12 report by Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty, the U.S. government-funded news outlet. </p>
<p>Expanding Production </p>
<p>Tillerson has been expanding Exxon''s holdings from the
Russian Arctic to the Texas-Mexico border to reverse a production
shortfall that saw third-quarter output drop the most in three
years. The company''s willingness to sign a contract with Kurdish
authorities may presage a flood of investment and acquisitions
not only in the northern region but all over Iraq as perceptions
of political and security risks diminish, said Gianna Bern,
president of Brookshire Advisory  Research Inc., a Chicago-based
risk-management adviser to the energy industry. </p>
<p>Iraq is open for business, Bern said. If Exxon can
advance its efforts in Iraq, then opportunities for all the major
oil companies to invest are going to increase significantly over
the next several years. </p>
<p>Kurdish authorities have offered international oil producers
more profitable terms than those given by Iraq''s central
government. In Kurdistan, foreign explorers are granted a share
of the oil pumped from each well. That''s a richer prospect than
the service contracts with Iraq''s government for developing
southern oilfields, which give foreign companies pre-set fees of
as little as $1.90 a barrel. </p>
<p>Tensions with Iraq </p>
<p>Shares of oil explorers focusing on Kurdish fields surged
today. Petroceltic International Plc (PCI) rose 8 percent in London
after earlier jumping 13 percent. Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP)
advanced as much as 14 percent. </p>
<p>Exxon riled some members of the Iraqi government by signing
its exploration contract with Kurdish leaders before the oil-
sharing agreement with Iraq had been completed. After Exxon''s
contract was reported Nov. 11, Abdul-Mahdy al-Ameedi, head of
licensing at the Iraqi central government''s Oil Ministry,
threatened to cancel the company''s existing contracts to extract
oil in Iraq''s southern fields. </p>
<p>A day later, Adal Barwari, Prime Minister Nouri Kamil al- Maliki''s adviser on Kurdish affairs, told Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty that the central government and the Kurds reached
mutually acceptable solutions to long-standing disagreements
over oil, territory and Kurdish armed forces. </p>
<p>Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon,
declined to comment yesterday in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Hayward''s Kurdish Plan </p>
<p>Hayward, forced out of London-based BP last year after the
Deepwater Horizon disaster that killed 11 rig workers and spilled
more than 4 million barrels of crude in the Gulf, plans to spend
about $725 million to develop Genel''s six Kurdish fields. An
equal amount will be devoted to buying up some of the 41
companies drilling for crude and natural gas in the Kurdish
region, Hayward said during a Sept. 8 meeting with reporters in
Istanbul. </p>
<p>We will be participating in the inevitable consolidation
among the 41 companies in the Kurdish region, he said. We
want to have the dominant position in the region by building a
bigger company. </p>
<p>Vallares, a so-called blank-check company founded by Hayward,
financier Nathaniel Rothschild and banker Julian Metherell, said
in a Nov. 3 statement that it plans to change its name to Genel
Energy Plc, pending approval by shareholders. </p>
<p>Kurdistan holds as much as 45 billion barrels in crude
reserves, Hawrami said in September. That''s more than double the
20.4 billion barrels of crude the U.S. Energy Department
estimates lay beneath the sea floor in the deep-water Gulf of
Mexico. </p>
<p>Unexploited Vast'' Reserves </p>
<p>Iraqi oil production surged to a 9-year high of 2.73 million
barrels a day in September, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Output fell 2.7 percent to 2.655 million barrels a day
last month after attacks on pipelines in the southern part of the
country disrupted transport. </p>
<p>Iraq may be one of the few places left where vast oil
reserves have barely been exploited, the U.S. Energy
Department''s Energy Information Administration said in a 2010
report on its website. </p>
<p>Tillerson, a University of Texas-trained engineer, is
spending $37 billion this year to drill wells, construct gas-
export terminals and expand oil refineries as he seeks new
sources of growth for Exxon. In the past year-and-a-half,
Tillerson signed a $3.2 billion deal with Russia''s OAO Rosneft to
explore the Black Sea and Kara Sea for crude, and devoted another
$40 billion to acqusitions in gas-rich U.S. shale formations. </p>
<p>Binding Contract'' </p>
<p>So far, Exxon has been mum about its plans for Kurdistan,
refusing even to confirm the existence of an agreement. </p>
<p>It''s a binding contract, Hawrami told reporters
yesterday at the Kurdistan-Iraq Oil and Gas Conference in the
regional capital city Erbil. </p>
<p>The agreement entitles Exxon to explore six blocks,
including Al Qush, Bashiqa, Tirman, Betwata, Qurna-Hanjeer and an
area along the border with Iran, he said. Hawrami didn''t disclose
any details about how much Exxon has pledged to spend on seismic
mapping, exploratory drilling or training local residents to work
in the oilfields. </p>
<p>Iraq is considered a frontier region in the oil
industry, said Brookshire Advisory''s Bern, a former BP crude
trader and author of Investing in Energy: A Primer on the
Economics of the Energy Industry. It''s still a risky place to
operate but if Exxon can advance its efforts there, it''ll be a
pretty significant feather in its cap. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its
forecast for commodity gains in the next year to 15 percent
after correctly predicting the climb in prices since the
beginning of last month. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index will be led by gains
in industrial metals in the next year, Jeffrey Currie, a Goldman
analyst in London, wrote in a report today. The bank, which
lowered its commodities forecast from 20 percent last month,
says copper will gain 22 percent and London oil 10 percent. </p>
<p>Goldman correctly advised investors to sell oil and
copper in April and turned more bullish the following month
before prices rebounded. It lowered its commodities outlook
after the GSCI Enhanced gauge jumped 15 percent since Oct. 4.
Raw materials have gained as European leaders attempted to
contain the region''s debt crisis and the Federal Reserve
signaled more stimulus may be available to spur growth. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the continuing European crisis, we
maintain our view that global growth will provide enough support
to demand to drive key commodity prices higher over the next 12
months, Currie wrote in the report. </p>
<p>Winners, Losers </p>
<p>Energy commodities will climb almost 19 percent in the next
12 months, and industrial metals will advance 26 percent,
Goldman said. Precious metals will increase 5 percent, livestock
will rise almost 11 percent and agriculture will drop 5.1
percent. Copper will be at $9,500 a metric ton in London in a
year and London oil will be at $125 a barrel, the bank said. </p>
<p>Goldman held its price forecasts for industrial metals and
raised its estimates from an Oct. 4 report for New York and
London oil, gasoline, gold and live cattle. It cut its outlook
for wheat, soybeans, cotton and sugar. </p>
<p>Europe''s inability to contain a regional debt crisis that
started in Greece more than two years ago led to a surge in
Italian bond yields as investors bet on which nation may need
aid next. Mario Monti, a former European Union competition
commissioner, was offered Italy''s prime minister post. George
Papandreou resigned last week as Greek prime minister to make
way for a coalition led by Lucas Papademos. </p>
<p>Whirlpool vs Rocks </p>
<p>The commodity markets continue to navigate between a
potential European whirlpool on one side and rocks on the other
side, which the market will likely run up against should demand
not falter and supply constraints force price spikes to balance
the market, Curry wrote. We continue to emphasize that
concerns about being pulled under by the whirlpool have pushed

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank, is preparing for a faster global economic
rebound than most forecasters expect, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said. </p>
<p>I don''t think that we can conclude that this slowdown is
secular rather than cyclical change, Blankfein, 57, said today
at an investor conference in New York hosted by Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)''s Merrill Lynch unit. The world will snap back and it
will be a surprise and it will be faster than people think. I
don''t know when that will be and we will gear ourselves
accordingly. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which was the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history before converting to a bank in 2008,
last month reported its second quarterly loss in 12 years as a
publicly traded company. The stock dropped 41 percent this year
through yesterday to $99.29, below the company''s $120.41
tangible book value per share at the end of September. </p>
<p>Blankfein, while noting that the firm is cutting costs and
adapting to changing regulation and slower economic growth, said
he is wary of overreacting by assuming the world has permanently
changed. He reminded investors that Goldman Sachs reported
record earnings in 2009 following a quarterly loss in 2008, in
part because competitors pulled away from making markets for
clients. </p>
<p>We''re managing our costs, obviously, but we''re not
thinking necessarily that there''s such a radical, structural
change, he said. We want to be in shape for the upturn. </p>
<p>Volcker Rule </p>
<p>Blankfein said he expects Goldman Sachs''s clients and other
end-users of investment-banking services to inform
regulators of their concerns about the Volcker rule, which
limits banks from trading on their own behalf and from investing
in private-equity and hedge funds. Clients are concerned the
regulations could reduce market liquidity and make trading more
expensive, he said. </p>
<p>As people weigh the costs to themselves, I think the
intensity will rise, he said. I think user groups will chime
in and make their interests known. In fact I''m sure of it. </p>
<p>People familiar with the situation said last week that
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were considering holding some
of the loan promises they make to clients at the original cost
instead of at the market cost. Asked to comment on a newspaper
report on the deliberations, Blankfein reiterated the firm''s
belief in the importance of mark-to-market accounting. He said
the firm had had a debate on how to mark unfunded loan
commitments to market. </p>
<p>Mark to Market </p>
<p>From time to time we evaluate how we are marking certain
kinds of things, Blankfein added. Somebody picked up on
something, eavesdropped on a partial conversation or something
and were, I guess, tapping into a conversation we were having
specifically about how -- how, not will -- how you mark unfunded
commitments that tend not to be drawn down just when they''re in
the money. </p>
<p>Blankfein has spoken at the annual Bank of America Merrill
Lynch Banking and Financial Services Conference every year
beginning in 2006, when he was named chairman and CEO. Guy Moszkowski, the Bank of America analyst who covers Goldman
Sachs, cut his recommendation on the stock to neutral from
buy in March. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-biggest
U.S. bank, may benefit from a decline in the dominance of fixed-
income trading on Wall Street, said Paul J. Taubman, co-
president of the firm''s institutional-securities group. </p>
<p>Fixed-income revenue grew in the last decade to almost two-
thirds of investment banking and trading revenue for the
financial industry, Taubman, 50, said today at an investor
conference in New York. Around 2000, the revenue was evenly
split between fixed-income, equity trading and investment
banking, he said. </p>
<p>We suffered as much as anything else from a mix shift
away from those businesses where we had historic leadership
positions, Taubman said. There''s no doubt that the
institutional-equities business and the investment-banking
business are likely to comprise an ever-increasing share of the
overall Street wallet for institutional revenues. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley generated $4.9 billion from fixed-income
trading and $4.9 billion from equity trading in the first nine
months of the year, excluding accounting adjustments. JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. generated more than twice as much
revenue from fixed-income trading as equities. All three firms
are based in New York. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley also had $3.3 billion in revenue from
investment banking. That represented an increase of 20 percent
from a year earlier, a bigger jump than any of its largest
competitors, said Taubman, who oversees investment banking and
capital markets. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman set out a goal earlier
this year of gaining 2 percentage points in fixed-income-trading
market share. </p>
<p>Every indication is that the investments made toward
that goal are paying off with increased share, Taubman said
today at the conference, hosted by Bank of America Corp.''s
Merrill Lynch unit. The number of corporate clients using the
firm''s debt-derivatives services climbed 33 percent from a year
earlier, Taubman said. </p>

<p>A benchmark gauge of U.S. credit-
default swaps rose to the highest level in five weeks as Fitch
Ratings said further contagion from Europe''s debt crisis would
pose a risk to American banks. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, added 2.3 basis points to a mid-
price of 134.6 basis points at 5:01 p.m. in New York, the
highest level since Oct. 11, according to index administrator
Markit Group Ltd. Credit default swaps on U.S. banks rose, led
by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Traders pushed the swaps index higher for a third day as
Fitch said that while U.S. lenders have manageable direct
exposures to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain,
further turmoil poses a serious risk to U.S. banks''
creditworthiness. The credit gauge has climbed from a two-month
low of 113.4 basis points on Oct. 27 even as economic data
signals the U.S. economy may avoid recession. </p>
<p>The market remains pretty fixated on Europe and all the
ups and downs from policy makers, George Bory, chief corporate
credit strategist for UBS AG, said in a telephone interview from
London. The renewed weakness in bond markets has put a little
bit more pressure on credit markets overall, which really limits
the ability for people to take risk going into the end of the
year. </p>
<p>Contracts on Morgan Stanley increased 24.6 basis points to
459.6 basis points, while those on Goldman Sachs added 18 to
367.9, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. Bank of America Corp. added 17.8
basis points to 402.8, the data show. </p>
<p>The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has increased
even as some U.S. economic reports have signaled consumers are
spending at a faster rate than analysts expected. U.S. retail
sales rose 0.5 percent in October, according to Commerce
Department figures yesterday, exceeding the median forecast of
81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News for a rise of 0.3
percent. </p>
<p>Domestic economic data has continued to improve over the
period, providing a favorable fundamental backdrop, Anthony Valeri, a market strategist with LPL Financial in San Diego,
which oversees $330 billion, said in a note to clients.
European headlines are likely to keep prices volatile over the
near term. </p>
<p>Contracts on Lowe''s Cos. climbed as it sold $1 billion of
debt a day after its credit grade was lowered by Standard 
Poor''s. The second-largest U.S. home-improvement retailer sold
10- and 30-year bonds with proceeds to be used for stock
buybacks, capital expenditures, acquisitions or working capital,
according to a regulatory filing today. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on the Mooresville, North Carolina-
based company climbed 3.5 basis points to 106.8 basis points,
according to CMA. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s Prevnar 13 vaccine for
a bacterial infection that causes pneumonia won the backing of a
U.S. advisory panel today for use in adults 50 and older, a
population that may add almost $2 billion to sales in 2015. </p>
<p>Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration at a meeting
today in Silver Spring, Maryland voted 14-1 that the shot was
safe and effective for adults in producing an immune response
against the pneumococcal bacteria. The FDA doesn''t have to
follow the panel''s recommendations. </p>
<p>The FDA is expected to decide on approval of Prevnar 13 in
adults 50 and older by Jan. 2. The agency is weighing approval
on the condition that Pfizer studies the vaccine further to
prove it protects against pneumococcal pneumonia. Pfizer started
an 85,000-subject trial in the Netherlands to confirm the
vaccine''s effectiveness in staving off the infection. </p>
<p>We are very optimistic that this trial is going to show
the data that you want to see, Marion Gruber, the FDA''s acting
director of vaccine research and review, said during the panel
meeting. She said the agency expects results from the study in
2013. </p>
<p>Prevnar 13, approved in the U.S. last year for children six
weeks to 5 years old, generated $2.82 billion the first nine
months of 2011, according to the New York-based drugmaker''s
regulatory filings. The vaccine may generate $5.9 billion by
2015, with adult use contributing $1.8 billion, said Catherine Arnold, an analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG in New York, in
an Oct. 21 investment note. </p>
<p>Staff Report </p>
<p>An FDA staff report released Nov. 14 determined the vaccine
was safe and effective in adults who received Merck  Co.''s
older vaccine approved almost 30 years ago and in those never
immunized. The report found no major side effects, though
limitations included the size of the safety database, which may
be too small to detect some rare adverse events, the report
said. </p>
<p>FDA considers the protection of adults from pneumococcal
pneumonia a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing
treatments, according to the report. </p>
<p>Pneumococcal pneumonia accounts for 175,000
hospitalizations each year in the U.S. and more than 6,000
deaths, according to the National Foundation for Infectious
Diseases. </p>
<p>Merck''s Pneumovax </p>
<p>Pfizer conducted clinical studies that showed the vaccine
likely will be associated with better protection than Whitehouse
Station, New Jersey-based Merck''s Pneumovax 23 against
pneumococcal pneumonia, Emilio Emini, Pfizer''s chief scientific
officer for vaccine research, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Pfizer hasn''t determined how long the shot will last and is
studying a five-year duration as part of the Netherlands trial,
said Peter Paradiso, of Pfizer''s vaccine development unit. </p>
<p>Merck''s Pneumovax 23 brought in $276 million in sales in
the first nine months of this year, according to company
filings. </p>
<p>Insurance coverage for Prevnar 13 will depend on whether
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention''s vaccines panel
recommends Prevnar 13 for those 50 and older. The 2010 health
law requires coverage of vaccines recommended by the panel
without a co-payment or deductible cost to patients. </p>
<p>Merck''s vaccine is recommended for people ages 65 and older
and for people 2 years and older at high risk for pneumonia,
such as those with sickle cell disease, HIV infection and other
conditions that compromise the immune system, according to the
CDC. It is also recommended for adults 19 to 64 years old who
smoke, have asthma or live in nursing homes or long-term care
facilities. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)''s Michael DePietro,
head of trading for U.S. home-loan bonds without government
backing, left the firm amid a slump in the market, according to
three people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>DePietro, an executive director at the New York-based bank
who led U.S. non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities
trading, departed this week along with Steven Sasson and another
member of his group, said two of the people, who declined to be
identified because the moves weren''t public. </p>
<p>Rebecca Hogan, a managing director who heads the bank''s
consumer asset-backed securities trading business, will take
DePietro''s post, one of the people said. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms'' inventories of non-agency securities
have declined in value as Europe''s debt crisis drives down
prices for risky bonds. Morgan Stanley posted a 17 percent
decline in third-quarter fixed-income trading revenue from a
year earlier, excluding accounting gains. That was driven in
part by relative weakness in mortgage trading, Chief
Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on an Oct. 19 conference call. </p>
<p>Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment on the departures, as did DePietro. Sasson
didn''t immediately return a message left on his cell phone. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley posted trading losses on 31 days in the
third quarter, the most since 2008, according to a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>The rout in the $1.2 trillion market for non-agency bonds
began in May as the Federal Reserve''s auctions of bonds assumed
in its American International Group Inc. (AIG) bailout added to dealer
stockpiles. Non-agency mortgage notes lack guarantees from U.S.-
backed Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. </p>
<p>Subprime Securities </p>
<p>Floating-rate subprime mortgage bonds from the credit
bubble have lost 13 percent on average since February, Barclays
Capital index data show, with some debt tumbling 30 percent,
according to investment firm Ellington Financial LLC. (EFC) </p>
<p>Trading has also slowed. In the past five weeks, dealers
have conducted auctions for $14.8 billion of non-agency debt,
down from $26.1 billion in the first five weeks of the year,
according to data from Empirasign Strategies LLC. Investment
banks reported completed sales of $4.4 billion of the bonds
offered in the most recent period, according to the New York-
based provider of data on securitized-debt trading. </p>

<p>Multinational companies including
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL) are urging Congress to make
passing a measure to allow a tax break on their offshore profits
a greater priority than a comprehensive tax-code overhaul. </p>
<p>The opportunity to boost the economy by encouraging
repatriation of more than $1 trillion in earnings held by U.S.
corporations overseas should, in the short run, trump the longer
process of revamping the tax code, the WIN America Coalition
said in a letter congressional leaders released today. </p>
<p>While we support congressional efforts to enact
comprehensive tax reform that makes our domestic tax code more
efficient for U.S. companies to compete in the growing global
market, we believe in the short term, Congress has an enormous
opportunity to immediately inject significant private-sector
investment into the U.S. economy, said the letter, signed by
Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, Oracle Co-
President Safra Catz, and the CEOs of 13 other companies. </p>
<p>The letter called on Congress to authorize the return of
overseas income at a more efficient tax rate than is currently
available. </p>
<p>The document didn''t specify a tax rate the companies were
seeking. Several pieces of repatriation legislation propose
allowing companies to return offshore profits at 5.25 percent,
the same rate in effect during a so-called tax holiday on
foreign income in 2004. The top corporate tax rate is currently
35 percent. </p>
<p>2004 Holiday </p>
<p>Opponents of a tax holiday, including Democratic Senator
Carl Levin of Michigan, have complained that companies used
revenue from the 2004 tax holiday to buy back stock and then cut
jobs. </p>
<p>Under the current U.S. worldwide tax system, multinational
companies with headquarters in the U.S. owe taxes on profits
they earn outside of the country. They get tax credits for
payments to other governments and can defer the residual U.S.
tax until they bring the money home. </p>
<p>House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp has
proposed shifting to a so-called territorial system, which would
shield 95 percent of corporate profits earned offshore from U.S.
taxation. </p>
<p>The WIN America coalition has been lobbying Congress for
the tax holiday for months. </p>
<p>The Obama administration has said that a tax holiday should
be considered in the context of a broader tax overhaul. </p>
<p>The congressional supercommittee is considering changes to
the tax code as it considers fashioning the framework of debt-
cutting plan by a Nov. 23 deadline. Failure to enact a debt-
reduction plan this year would trigger $1.2 trillion in
automatic spending cuts beginning in 2013. </p>

<p>Viktor Hjort, the Hong Kong-based
head of fixed income-research at Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd., spoke
about Asia''s credit outlook at a forum in Singapore today. </p>
<p>On Asia''s credit outlook: </p>
<p>European banks have to shrink over the next few years,
they have to de-leverage and one of things that they will most
likely end up doing is to shift some of their exposure or assets
to Asia. So Asian banks will have to deal with it over the
coming 12 to 24 months and will probably have to find new
avenues of funding to replace some of the wholesale funding
that''s been provided by European banks. </p>
<p>They are also going to have to sell some of the assets
European banks are most likely to exit. What that will mean is
that the cost of capital in Asia will gradually rise. </p>
<p>Access to lending conditions will deteriorate so that''s
negative for margins in Asia''s credit market. In the sense that
it will force more issuance in the bond markets, it will drive
up the cost of capital. </p>

<p>General Maritime Corp. (GMR), the second-
largest U.S. owner of oil tankers, filed for bankruptcy
protection from creditors after falling oil demand and a surplus
of ships led to two years of losses. </p>
<p>The New York-based company listed assets of $1.71 billion
and debt of $1.41 billion today in a Chapter 11 petition in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Lender Oaktree Capital Management
LP agreed to make a $175 million equity investment and a group
led by Nordea Bank Finland Plc will provide as much as $100
million in financing to help the company through reorganization,
General Maritime said. </p>
<p>There will be others joining them in bankruptcy, Nigel Prentis, a London-based analyst at HSBC Shipping, said by phone
today. If you look at the listed universe of tanker companies,
you are seeing their share prices have just collapsed this year.
The stock market has given up on them. </p>
<p>Freight rates for oil carriers have fallen to the lowest in
at least 14 years, prompting General Maritime to warn in a Sept.
30 regulatory filing that it might file bankruptcy.    Single-
voyage rates for very large crude carriers, hauling about 20
percent of the world''s oil, averaged $7,627 a day this year,
compared with $32,006 in 2010, according to the London-based
Baltic Exchange, which publishes costs along more than 50
maritime routes. </p>
<p>Angeliki Frangou, who heads three shipping companies
controlling more than 100 vessels, said this month that
bankruptcies within the industry will accelerate. Korea Line
Corp. (005880), Korea''s second-largest operator of dry-bulk ships, sought
U.S. bankruptcy protection in February. Time-chartered operators
Britannia Bulk Plc, Armada (Singapore) Pte Ltd. and Transfield
ER Cape also have filed for bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Ship Glut </p>
<p>The sovereign-debt crisis in Europe is curbing lending to
the industry, Frangou, the chief executive officer of Navios
Maritime Holdings Inc. (NM) and two related companies, said in a Nov.
10 interview. At the same time, a glut of ships has depressed
the price of vessels hauling oil, dry-bulk raw materials and
refined petroleum products. </p>
<p>The global fleet of very large crude carriers has expanded
about 9 percent to 570 ships in the past two years, the most
since 1983, according to London-based Clarkson Research Services
Ltd., a unit of the world''s largest shipbroker. Owners ordered
the greatest number of new vessels since the 1970s between 2006
and 2008, when charter rates surged to as much as $289,000. </p>
<p>Oil Demand </p>
<p>Those tankers started joining the fleet just as global
demand for oil fell by the most in 27 years, according to data
from London-based BP Plc. The International Energy Agency, the
Paris-based adviser to 28 nations, in September reduced its
forecast for 2012 crude demand by 0.4 percent to 90.7 million
barrels a day. It was the biggest cut since April 2009. </p>
<p>Seaborne oil shipments into the U.S. were forecast to drop
to 6.9 million barrels a day, or 17 percent of crude this year,
an 11-year low, according to Clarkson. Tankers are going unused
partly because domestic production in the U.S., the world''s
largest petroleum market, is at an eight-year high. </p>
<p>The depressed shipping rates mean owners of vessels bought
at higher prices are unable to cover operating costs and repay
loans, Frangou said. General Maritime, which operates in the
Caribbean, South and Central America, the U.S., Western Africa
and the North Sea, has a fleet of 31 double-hull tankers,
according to its website. </p>
<p>Operations are to continue without interruption the
company said in a statement. General Maritime expects to
substantially reduce its funded indebtedness and enhance its
liquidity profile. </p>
<p>Easier to Accept'' </p>
<p>General Maritime''s new financing agreement with lenders may
reassure companies that hire oil tankers, said Erik Folkeson Jensen, an analyst at First Securities ASA in Oslo. </p>
<p>Charterers will be a bit reluctant toward companies that
might get their ships arrested because they have failed to pay
down debt or make interest payments, Jensen said by phone.
Now that General Maritime has been given a deal, it might be
easier for charterers to accept General Maritime vessels. </p>
<p>Like Frangou, Norwegian shipping billionaire John Fredriksen and New York-based Wilbur Ross, chairman of private-
equity firm WL Ross  Co., are looking to acquire distressed
shipping companies. Fredriksen said in May that he would
consider buying tankers within a year or two as rates slide.
Ross, who invested in shipping for the first time three months
ago, said in August that deploying another few hundred
million in the industry is certainly easy to do. </p>
<p>Balance Sheet </p>
<p>General Maritime has been restructuring its balance sheets
since at least March, when it took out a $200 million loan from
Oaktree Capital Management to refinance 2005 debt and amend 2010
debt, according to the most recent annual report, filed in
March. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer John Tavlarios said in July that
the company made transactions to increase its liquidity, as it
announced a loss excluding some items of $36.8 million for the
quarter ended June 30, more than double the $14 million loss in
the same period a year earlier. </p>
<p>Among the largest unsecured creditors listed in court
papers were Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), trustee for holders
of $300 million in 12 percent callable bonds due in 2017. </p>
<p>The notes fell 1 cent to 9 cents on the dollar as of 10:01
a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt
has plunged from 101.5 cents in December 2010 and is at the
lowest on record. </p>
<p>Share Decline </p>
<p>In August, General Maritime led declines in oil-tanker
stocks as analysts predicted a return to recession in the U.S.
would delay any rebound in charter rates for tankers until after
2013. On Aug. 22, the company said it had received a delisting
notice as its share price failed to meet the New York Stock
Exchange''s minimum requirements. </p>
<p>The shares closed yesterday at 16 cents, down 95 percent
this year. Trading was delayed today. </p>
<p>Peter C. Georgiopoulos, founder and chairman of General
Maritime and also chairman of Athens-based Aegean Marine
Petroleum Network Inc. (ANW), holds more than 5 percent of General
Maritime, according to the bankruptcy petition. </p>
<p>Oil-tanker companies may demolish the most ships since 2003
to reduce the glut and lift charter rates. Owners might break up
5 percent of the fleet within 18 months, said Michael Pak, an
analyst at Clarkson Capital Markets LLC in Houston. </p>
<p>Ship Scrapping </p>
<p>Scrapping won''t be enough to make ships profitable. Freight
derivatives, traded by brokers and used to bet on future rates,
anticipate a 68 percent jump to $12,817 a day in 2013 compared
with this year''s average so far. That''s still 43 percent of what
Frontline Ltd., the biggest operator, says it needs to cover
costs. </p>
<p>Moody''s Investors Service cut its credit grade on General
Maritime''s debt to Caa3 in September, citing the increasing
likelihood of a restructuring because of weak sector
fundamentals. Lower freight rates also are reducing the market
value of tanker vessels, cutting another source of liquidity,
the Moody''s analysts wrote. </p>
<p>Prices for new vessels have plunged as much as a third from
a record three years ago, while used ships lost 38 percent of
their value, according to data from Clarkson. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Maritime Corp., 11-15285, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, hired Richard Lindquist from Guggenheim
Partners LLC as head of high yield in its asset-management
business. </p>
<p>Lindquist will oversee about $1.7 billion in assets and
report to Michael Kushma, chief investment officer for global
fixed-income, according to an internal memo obtained today by
Bloomberg News. Matt Burkhard, a spokesman for New York-based
Morgan Stanley, confirmed the contents of the memo. </p>
<p>Greg Fleming, who took over as head of Morgan Stanley
Investment Management last year, identified high-yield investing
as one of the unit''s most significant product gaps. The
division''s revenue is down 20 percent in the first nine months
of the year, as a 16 percent increase in traditional asset-
management revenue has been outweighed by declines in real-
estate investment and merchant-banking revenue. </p>
<p>Lindquist will be a senior member of MSIM''s fixed-income
strategy team, according to the memo. He was co-head of U.S.
high yield at Guggenheim since 2009, and previously worked at
HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Credit Suisse Group AG. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. (GM) will introduce
its Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid car in China at an auto show
on Nov. 21, and dealers will begin taking orders for the model
shortly, the automaker said. </p>
<p>This will be relatively low-volume, Kevin Wale,
president of the Detroit-based company''s China unit, said in a
phone interview yesterday in Shanghai, declining to comment on
specifics including pricing before the show in Guangzhou.
We''re trying to use this as a statement for technology and the
beginning of the path towards electrification. </p>
<p>GM will be first among the world''s largest automakers to
sell a plug-in car in China, where rivals including Daimler AG (DAI)
and Nissan Motor Co. also plan to introduce similar models.
Electric-car sales in China are forecast to exceed those in the
U.S. by 2020, helped by government subsidies and investment as
the Asian nation, the world''s largest polluter, seeks to cut
emissions, according to the Boston Consulting Group. </p>
<p>The Volt, which is powered by an electric battery for about
40 miles before a gasoline engine kicks in, retails in the U.S.
for $39,995 before a federal tax credit. </p>
<p>The model will complement an all-electric car that GM is
working to develop with its Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp.,
Wale said. </p>
<p>Daimler is working with Shenzhen-based carmaker BYD Co. to
introduce an electric vehicle in China in 2013, the Stuttgart,
Germany-based automaker said in April. Nissan plans to export
its all-electric Leaf car to China for fleet sales, the
Yokohama, Japan-based company said in September. </p>
<p>Toyota Prius </p>
<p>Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) started a yearlong test of its Prius
plug-in hybrid in the city of Tianjin early this year, and the
model isn''t being sold to consumers yet, said Niu Yu, a
spokesman for the Toyota City, Japan-based automaker. </p>
<p>Electric cars may account for as much as 7 percent of total
auto sales in China, the world''s largest vehicle market, by
2020, Boston Consulting said in a June 14 report. Chinese
consumers are more receptive to the technology than their U.S.
and European counterparts, with more than 90 percent showing
interest, the report found. </p>
<p>To achieve a breakthrough, carmakers must offer
attractive mass-market vehicles, and the vehicles'' relatively
high price and smaller driving range must be addressed, said
Marco Gerrits, a Beijing-based partner at the consulting
company. </p>
<p>Currently, buyers of energy-efficient cars in Shanghai,
Shenzhen and four other Chinese cities qualify for a 60,000 yuan
($9,450) subsidy. The government aims to have 1 million
electric-powered vehicles on the road by 2015, according to the
Ministry of Science. </p>
<p>Lower Parking Fees </p>
<p>State media have reported China would support the use of
such vehicles through favorable policies and buying incentives.
Alternative-energy cars will be exempt from current license-
plate and traffic restrictions in some major cities, Xinhua News
reported Nov. 12, citing a government notice. </p>
<p>There are 25 Chinese cities running trials for alternative-
energy vehicles, and local authorities must develop policies to
promote their adoption, including building charging points at
government agencies, hospitals and shopping malls, Xinhua said. </p>
<p>The trial cities should also lower fees for parking,
electricity and road use for such vehicles and adjust the
purchase policies of government agencies and state-linked
companies, according to the report, citing the National
Development and Reform Commission and the ministries of science
and technology, finance, and industry and information
Technology. </p>
<p>China Demand </p>
<p>China''s auto demand may grow 5 to 10 percent next year,
driven by demand for passenger cars, Wale said today. Sales of
commercial vehicles, which have dipped this year, will grow 5
percent, he forecast. </p>
<p>GM will expand its luxury Cadillac brand and distribution
network and broaden its range of sport-utility vehicles, he
said. </p>
<p>We''re seeing a much greater move to individuality in
terms of colors and body styles, said Wale, who aims for GM''s
China sales to grow faster than the overall market in 2012. </p>
<p>The U.S. carmaker is counting on China to overtake Toyota
in global sales this year. GM expanded deliveries in the Asian
nation 6.9 percent from a year earlier to 2,113,274 vehicles in
the first 10 months of 2011, according to the company. </p>

<p>The amount of oil that has leaked
into the ocean from a sea-floor fissure near a Chevron Corp. (CVX)
well in Brazil may be four times as large as previously
estimated, the country''s oil regulator said. </p>
<p>As much as 2,640 barrels have gushed into the sea during an
eight-day period, and oil continues to leak, the agency, known
as the ANP, said in an e-mailed statement today. </p>
<p>Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, said Nov. 15 that
the oil slick caused by the spill was as much as 650 barrels. At
that time, the company said flows from the well appeared to have
ceased. </p>
<p>Chevron has substantially reduced oil leaking from a
fissure after it began plugging an exploration well Nov. 15th at
the Frade offshore project, ANP said. The agency is
investigating the causes of the spill and is auditing safety
conditions at the project''s platform. </p>
<p>Brazil may tighten environmental regulations as the country
plans to double oil output over the next decade, tapping fields
in the so-called pre-salt region of the Atlantic Ocean, Adriano Pires, head of the Brazilian Center for Infrastructure, said
today in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro. </p>
<p>This could slow the expansion process if the government
implements more strict environmental regulations, Pires said.
This tells Brazilian society that the story about transforming
the pre-salt region isn''t that simple. </p>
<p>Chevron didn''t immediately respond to an e-mail and phone
call today seeking comment. </p>
<p>Production hasn''t been halted at Frade, located in deep
waters of the Campos Basin, according to Chevron. Oil was
leaking from fissures on the ocean floor near a well the company
was drilling and then plugged. </p>

<p>General Maritime Corp., the second-
largest U.S. owner of oil tankers, can draw $30 million of a $75
million loan that will require it to file a plan of
reorganization in 75 days or sell all its assets. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan court today
approved the company''s request to borrow funds from Nordea Bank
Finland Plc and other lenders. The company, which operates in
over 230 ports of call in over 70 countries, filed for
bankruptcy yesterday after falling oil demand and a surplus of
ships led to two years of losses. </p>
<p>The loan is critical for the survival of the company,
General Maritime''s bankruptcy counsel, Kenneth Eckstein, told
Glenn today. </p>
<p>General Maritime hopes to file a reorganization plan in
January, Eckstein said in court today. If the company doesn''t
outline the terms of a plan within 75 days from its Nov. 17
filing, it must sell all its assets through an auction, under
the requirements of its $75 million loan, he said. Oaktree
Capital Management LP, a lender, would be the so-called stalking
horse, or starting bidder, for that auction. </p>
<p>General Maritime owns 30 vessels and charters three, giving
it a total carrying capacity of 5.3 million deadweight tons. Its
vessels are registered in Bermuda, Liberia or the Marshall
Islands. Its publicly held securities include 121.5 million
common shares and $300 million in unsecured 12 percent notes due
2017, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Milestones </p>
<p>There are various milestones, required by the loan,
Eckstein said, adding that the company will use its time in
bankruptcy to seek a financial sponsor. Moelis  Co. is serving
as the company''s financial adviser. </p>
<p>A group of General Maritime Corp. noteholders opposed a
request for the loan. Its terms would serve to prematurely
limit or foreclose the rights of unsecured creditors or any
official committee appointed to represent their interests, the
group said in court papers filed today. </p>
<p>The ad-hoc group, which doesn''t have formal standing in the
case, owns over $185 million in 12 percent senior notes due
2017. It includes Capital Research and Management Company, J.P.
Morgan Investment Management, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC,
Stone Harbor Investment Partners LP and Third Avenue Focused
Credit Fund. </p>
<p>General Maritime already has a rough plan to restructure
with certain lenders; negotiations leading up to its bankruptcy
led to a restructuring support agreement under which lender
Oaktree Capital Management LP agreed to make a $175 million
equity investment. </p>
<p>New Company </p>
<p>Glenn ordered that papers detailing the support agreement
be filed publicly in court papers. </p>
<p>The agreement will convert all of the company''s debt into
stock in a newly created company, and lenders would agree to
vote in support of a plan of reorganization under certain terms,
according to court papers. Supporting lenders in the agreement
include those to a $550 million loan made in May 2011, and a
$372 million loan made in May 2010, according to court papers. </p>
<p>The noteholder group said in its objection that junior
secured lenders to a $200 million loan, which includes an
affiliate of Oaktree, shouldn''t benefit from protections given
to Nordea Bank and other lenders to the $75 million debtor-in-
possession financing. Such loans allow companies to keep
operating in bankruptcy and give them a higher priority to be
repaid. </p>
<p>Reserve </p>
<p>They also said a $75,000 reserve set aside to fund
investigations into any claims the estate might have is too low. </p>
<p>General Maritime and its lenders agreed to slight changes
in the loan today before it was approved, including a clause
which said unsecured creditors can challenge that cap. </p>
<p>Freight rates for oil carriers have fallen to the lowest in
at least 14 years, prompting General Maritime to warn in a Sept.
30 regulatory filing that it might file bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Separately, Glenn granted the company''s requests today to
pay critical foreign vendors, pay employee wages, continue its
insurance programs, and take other steps typical at the outset
of a bankruptcy. </p>
<p>General Maritime said its $75 million loan may be increased
by $25 million subject to the agreement of lenders and certain
other conditions. Fees for the loan will total around $2.3
million, according to court papers. The company''s non-bankrupt
affiliates will be transferred around $3 million per month,
General Maritime said. </p>
<p>General Maritime has been restructuring its balance sheet
since at least March, when it took out the $200 million loan
from Oaktree to refinance 2005 debt and amend 2010 debt,
according to the most recent annual report, filed in March. </p>
<p>The New York-based company listed assets of $1.71 billion
and debt of $1.41 billion today in a Chapter 11 petition in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Maritime Corp. (GMR), 11-15285, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, named the smallest group of new
managing directors since 2008 as the firm cuts jobs and grapples
with declining revenue. </p>
<p>The firm appointed 261 people to managing director, the
company''s second-highest rank, according to an internal memo
obtained by Bloomberg News. The number is down 19 percent from
last year''s record list of 321 new managing directors and 
exceeds the 259 promotions in 2008. David Wells, a spokesman
for the New York-based company, didn''t reply to an e-mail and
two phone messages seeking confirmation of the memo. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, said this week that the firm is working to remain
positioned for a rebound even as it eliminates about 1,000 jobs
to contend with a drop in trading revenue. The company set aside
$10 billion for employees'' salaries, bonuses and benefits in the
first nine months of this year, equivalent to $292,836 per
worker. </p>
<p>The single most important thing we can do to enhance the
value of our business is to continue to hire the best and
brightest people from around the world, Blankfein said on Nov.
15, at an investor conference in New York hosted by Bank of
America Corp. And once they get into Goldman Sachs we want to
do everything we can to ensure that they have productive and
stimulating careers. </p>
<p>The company names managing directors annually and elects
employees to the firm''s partnership, the highest status, in
even-numbered years. Managing directors, though typically paid
more than junior employees, don''t share in the special bonus
pool reserved for the company''s partners. </p>
<p>The following is the list of Goldman Sachs''s Managing
Director Class of 2011. The employees listed have been invited
to become managing directors as of Jan. 1, 2012. </p>

<p>General Maritime is scheduled to seek permission from U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan court today to draw
$30 million of a $75 million loan to fund operations while it

<p>The noteholder group said that junior secured lenders to a

bankruptcy and give them a higher priority to be repaid. </p>
<p>They also said a $75,000 reserve set aside to fund
investigations into any claims the estate might have is too low. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said it is reducing the amount of oil
leaking from a project off the coast of Brazil after plugging
the source of the spill on Nov. 13. </p>
<p>The amount of oil leaking from fissures on the ocean floor
is less than the hundreds of barrels that gushed during the
first days after a drilling incident on Nov. 7, said George
Buck, the head of Chevron''s operations in Brazil. More than 10
barrels a day of residual oil in the rocks around the well
is still leaking, and the rate continues to decline, Buck said. </p>
<p>The majority of this event has been over for several
days, Buck told reporters in Rio de Janeiro. We know we
stopped the flow at the reservoir. </p>
<p>Foreign oil companies including Chevron, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) are waiting for Brazil to auction new
exploration areas in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Buck
said Chevron will study the spill to prevent similar incidents
in Brazil and other oil producing regions. Chevron is producing
about 80,000 barrels a day at the Frade project and didn''t halt
production during the spill, which was caused by an appraisal
well, Buck said. </p>
<p>Pressure Kick </p>
<p>Chevron underestimated the amount of pressure at a
reservoir at the project about 230 miles (370 kilometers)
northeast of Rio, Buck said. The well suffered a kick of
pressure when it reached the reservoir, causing oil to leak to
fissures on the ocean floor. Chevron cemented shut the section
of well above the reservoir and continues to work on sealing it,
Buck said. </p>
<p>Transocean Ltd. (RIG), the world''s biggest offshore-oil driller,
supplied Chevron with the Sedco 706 rig. The Vernier,
Switzerland-based company shut the well properly, Buck said.
Chevron takes full responsibility for the spill and is
cooperating with the Brazilian government to investigate the
causes, Buck said. </p>
<p>Buck declined to estimate the cleanup costs or potential
fines. Brazil''s oil regulator said Nov. 18 that as many as 2,640
barrels of oil spilled during the first eight days after the
incident. Buck said the regulator''s estimates are a good
number. </p>

<p>Transocean Ltd. (RIG), the operator of the
rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico and caused the worst
U.S. maritime spill, and Chevron Corp. (CVX) may be banned from deep-
water drilling in Brazil after an oil leak. </p>
<p>Chevron, which was fined 50 million reais ($28 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities, may lose the right to
develop deep-water fields there and be ordered to pay as much as
100 million reais to the regulator, Haroldo Lima, the head of
the agency, said. The regulator may also ban Transocean, Lima
said. Rio de Janeiro state may claim another 100 million reais
in damage, Rio Environment Secretary Carlos Minc said. </p>
<p>If we have reasons to do this, we will, Lima told
reporters in Sao Paulo today, referring to a possible downgrade
of the class A status that allows Chevron to drill in deep
water. It will depend on a detailed analysis. </p>
<p>Drilling at Chevron''s Frade project in the Campos Basin off
Rio''s coast triggered a leak of as much as 3,000 barrels in
eight days, Lima said. The spill followed a surge of pressure
from an oil reservoir on Nov. 7, George Buck, San Ramon,
California-based Chevron''s head of operations in Brazil, said in
Rio yesterday. </p>
<p>Edited Images </p>
<p>Chevron edited video images that should have been made
available in their entirety to Brazil''s oil regulator ANP,
director Magda Chambriard said at a press conference in
Brasilia. </p>
<p>The company''s treatment of the regulatory agency and the
Brazilian government was unacceptable, Chambriard said. We
had to go aboard the platform to search for the original images
even after the company was notified to provide us with the
video. </p>
<p>Transocean, which owned the rig involved in the 2010
blowout of BP Plc''s Macondo Well in the Gulf of Mexico, will be
banned from operating in Rio state, Minc said. More than 80
percent of Brazil''s crude is produced in Rio''s Campos Basin. </p>
<p>Transocean continues to fully cooperate with Chevron, the
operator of the well, and Brazilian authorities in all aspects
of this matter, Guy Cantwell, a Houston-based spokesman for
Transocean, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Violations </p>
<p>Chevron may be fined by the oil regulator, known as ANP, as
early as today for inadequate equipment and withholding
information, Lima said. Each violation may cost the company 50
million reais, he said. </p>
<p>Chevron''s situation to obtain licenses to operate in
Brazil became more difficult after what happened, Lima said in
Brasilia. </p>
<p>Chevron has taken full responsibility for the spill and
brought it under control as fast as it could amid stormy weather
in the region, Buck said. </p>
<p>The moment the seeps were first identified, we
immediately activated our emergency response plan and began
dispatching necessary resources to safely manage the
situation, Lloyd Avram, a Chevron spokesman, said in an e-
mailed statement. </p>
<p>Halted Flow </p>
<p>The company has halted oil flow from the reservoir and
reduced the amount seeping from fissures in the ocean floor near
the drilling site, Buck said. Transocean wasn''t responsible for
the leak and acted quickly to help block it, he said. </p>
<p>Chevron is the third-largest oil producer in Brazil, behind
state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and Royal Dutch Shell
Plc. (RDSA) Frade was Brazil''s eighth most productive field in
September with 75,000 barrels a day of oil production, according
to the website of the country''s oil regulator. </p>
<p>Transocean has 10 rigs operating in Brazilian waters,
including the Petrobras 10000, a 2-year-old vessel designed to
drill seven miles beneath the sea surface and withstand 47-foot
waves. </p>
<p>Chevron fell 2 percent to $95.90 at 3:53 p.m. in New York.
Transocean dropped 3.6 percent to $45.75. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), operator of the $3.6
billion Frade oilfield off the Brazilian coast, said it hasn''t
received any notices of fines or other penalties from Brazil''s
government stemming from a subsea crude leak. </p>
<p>Chevron is investigating the cause of the leak from cracks
in the sea floor near an appraisal well, Scott Walker, a
spokesman for the San Ramon, California-based company, said
today in an e-mailed statement. The results of the probe will be
turned over to Brazilian authorities, he said in the statement. </p>
<p>Chevron will be fined 50 million reais ($28 million) for
environmental violations associated with the leaks first spotted
about two weeks ago, Brazilian regulators said today. The
company may lose the right to drill in Brazil''s deep-water oil
region and could face another 100 million reais in fines,
Haroldo Lima, the head of the country''s oil agency, said today
during a meeting with reporters in Sao Paulo. </p>
<p>Chevron may also be penalized for withholding information
from the government and editing video footage of the leaks
before turning it over, said Magda Chambriard, a director of
Brazil''s oil regulator, known as ANP. </p>
<p>The sheen on the sea surface has been reduced to 18 barrels,
Walker said. Chevron estimated the entire volume of the leak at
2,400 barrels of oil. </p>
<p>We are committed to deploying resources until the sheen
can no longer be detected, the company said in the statement. </p>
<p>Transocean''s Role </p>
<p>Chevron is the third-largest oil producer in Brazil, behind
state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Royal Dutch Shell
Plc. Frade was Brazil''s eighth most productive field in
September with 75,000 barrels a day of oil production, according
to the website of the country''s oil regulator. </p>
<p>Transocean Ltd. (RIG), owner of the rig under lease to Chevron at
the time of the leak, may also face a ban in water adjacent to
Rio de Janaeiro, Carlos Minc, environment secretary for Rio
state, said today. </p>
<p>Transocean has 10 rigs operating in Brazilian waters,
including the Petrobras 10000, a 2-year-old vessel designed to
drill seven miles beneath the sea surface and withstand 47-foot

<p>General Motors Co. (GM), 28 months after
its U.S.-backed bankruptcy, said it will build Chevrolet Equinox
sport-utility vehicles in a reopened Tennessee assembly plant
that used to make cars for the now-defunct Saturn brand. </p>
<p>GM will invest $61 million and add 685 hourly and salaried
workers as output at the factory resumes in 2012''s second half,
the Detroit-based automaker said today in a statement. GM will
spend an additional $183 million and add about 1,200 more jobs
to make midsized vehicles for the 2015 model year that the
company will name later, said Cathy Clegg, GM''s vice president
of labor relations. </p>
<p>Our No. 1 priority in auto negotiations this year was
jobs, Bob King, president of the United Auto Workers, said in
the statement. Joe Ashton, vice president of the Detroit-based
union''s GM department, has said getting work for the Tennessee
plant was one of the union''s main objectives in contract talks
with the automaker that concluded in September. </p>
<p>The UAW has said that GM, the largest U.S. automaker, will
add or retain 6,400 jobs and invest $2.5 billion in its plants
as part of their four-year contract ratified by members Sept.
28. </p>
<p>GM will use the Spring Hill plant to build a variety of
vehicles off of different base architectures, Clegg told workers
today at the factory. </p>
<p>Flex'' Operation </p>
<p>The flex operation can change products frequently based
on what we need to do in the market, Clegg said. GM may be
able to add production of a model that''s selling well in as
little as four to six months, she said. </p>
<p>The additional Equinox production will supplement output
from GM''s CAMI Automotive plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, and a
factory in Oshawa, Ontario. There is no impact to production
from those operations for the foreseeable future, Clegg said
today on a conference call with reporters. </p>
<p>GM idled its assembly plant in Spring Hill, about 35 miles
(56 kilometers) south of Nashville, in November 2009, when it
was making Chevrolet Traverse SUVs. The factory made GM''s first
Saturn, a red SL sedan, in July 1990, according to the company''s
website. </p>
<p>Saturn and the Tennessee plant had been championed by
former Chief Executive Officer Roger Smith as GM''s way to
profitably build small cars. The brand evolved into an
experiment in marketing, where dealers offered no-haggle
pricing. Saturn owners formed clubs to celebrate the small car.
Smith died in 2007 at age 82. </p>
<p>Saturn Brand </p>
<p>GM shuttered Saturn, Hummer and Pontiac and sold Saab as it
pared U.S. brands to four from eight as part of its $50 billion
government rescue and 2009 bankruptcy. The automaker has said
its new labor contract will cost $215 million over the next
three years as it raises wages for entry-level employees and
buys out some of its most expensive laborers. </p>
<p>GM fell 3.5 percent to $20.92 at 1:20 p.m. New York time. </p>
<p>Labor costs will rise 1 percent a year during GM''s contract
with the UAW, the smallest increase in a contract in four
decades, the company has said. </p>
<p>The Spring Hill plant will reopen as part of an
innovative staffing and operating agreement that allows GM
to build different vehicles on several platforms, Dan Ammann,
the company''s chief financial officer, said in a Sept. 28
conference call with analysts. Clegg didn''t elaborate on the
staffing agreement today at the plant. </p>

<p>Thirty-six years after his death,
Spanish Dictator General Francisco Franco managed to make his
presence felt in Spain''s general elections yesterday. </p>
<p>Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero had
called for the vote to be held on the anniversary of the
Generalissimo''s death. Nov. 20 is a day celebrated each year by
remnants of Franco''s fascist following in acts that are loathed
by millions of Spaniards who were marked by his dictatorship or
scarred by the bloody civil war that produced it. </p>
<p>Still, the vote''s outcome shows how the ghost of Franco,
and the Socialists'' attempts to associate the winning People''s
Party with its fascists roots, have lost most of their power.
The PP, founded by a minister in Franco''s last government, won
the biggest parliamentary majority in almost 30 years and will
bring leader Mariano Rajoy to power within a month. </p>
<p>Zapatero chose the date to sow division but I don''t
care, said Maria Asuncion Moreno, a 69 year-old homemaker
celebrating victory outside the PP''s Madrid headquarters last
night. The PP has nothing to do with Franco. </p>
<p>The pro-business party, which governs in 11 of 17 of the
country''s autonomous regions, has a chance to unseat the
Socialists in their southern stronghold of Andalusia in March
elections after yesterday''s landslide victory. </p>
<p>In a reflection of how Spain''s fascist past stays part of
its democratic present, both Rajoy and the Socialist candidate
Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba commented on how the incident-free
polling day and 72 percent turnout had bolstered Spanish
democracy. Rubalcaba''s campaign manager, Elena Valenciano, said
in a televised statement the main winner today has been
democracy, which emerges strengthened. </p>
<p>Absolute Power'' </p>
<p>The Socialist party traditionally plays on many Spaniards''
willingness to associate the PP with its fascist roots.
Rubalcaba, trailing by 15 percentage points in the polls, closed
the campaign in a Nov. 18 interview in El Pais newspaper by
appealing to voters to prevent the right from gaining absolute
power. </p>
<p>Zapatero cited his grandfather, who was shot by Franco''s
firing squads, as the inspiration for his political career. The
man was a soldier who fought to preserve the Second Republic of
Spain of the 1930s that was overthrown by Franco''s Nationalists. </p>
<p>During the 7 1/2 years of Zapatero''s mandate, he stirred
controversy by opening an inquiry into Republicans executed by
Franco''s troops and dumped in unmarked graves around Spain. </p>
<p>The date he chose this year for early elections is when
Franco''s relatives and sympathizers traditionally gather for a
mass in his honor at the Valley of the Fallen memorial in the
mountains outside Madrid. Hundreds of Catholics filed past
Franco''s grave, decorated with flowers, to take communion at
yesterday''s service in a church that had standing room only. </p>
<p>Mass, Mausoleum </p>
<p>The monument to soldiers killed in the three-year civil war
is a magnet for Franco supporters who mark Nov. 20, or 20-N
as it''s known in Spain, by holding their traditional mass there.
The complex was built partly by prisoners from the socialist and
anarchist forces that opposed him. </p>
<p>There has to be a change and the only party that can lead
the change is the PP, Jose Manuel Florez, 39, said yesterday
after the mass held at Franco''s mausoleum in the mountains
outside Madrid. They have a lot of work to do. </p>
<p>Florez, a dental implant salesman, attended the religious
service wearing a fascist flag as a neckerchief. Afterward,
outside the basilica where the dictator is buried, his son shot
a smartphone photograph of Florez making a fascist salute while
others sang Franco''s anthem, Face to the Sun. </p>
<p>PP loyalists say their party has again been left to restore
order after the Socialists left the country in a mess. Rajoy''s
PP predecessor Jose Maria Aznar, came to power in 1996 after the
Felipe Gonzalez government was weakened by a string of
corruption scandals and a recession. </p>
<p>Aznar Era </p>
<p>When Aznar came to power he found a country in a very bad
state and put it back on the right track, said Moreno. We
hope this is what is going to happen again, that is why we came
here today, she said at the Rajoy victory celebration. </p>
<p>Franco''s remaining supporters credit the dictator with
preventing the country''s collapse after the Second Republic or
falling under the sway of the Soviet Union. </p>
<p>Spain was in ruins when Franco took over and he kept the
country together, said Luis Alonso Garcia, 59, a fruit and
vegetable seller smoking a cigar and leaning on his walking
stick outside the basilica. We didn''t have much but what we
had was ours. People today have bought a load of useless rubbish
on their credit cards and now they can''t pay the bills. </p>
<p>Unemployment reached 22 percent in the third quarter while
the government''s borrowing costs in a bond auction last week
were back up at the level investors demanded before Spain joined
the single currency in 1999. </p>
<p>Family vs Country </p>
<p>El Pais, the left-leaning daily, which didn''t endorse the
Socialists in the election, ran a three-page story Nov. 19 on
how Franco was more effective in securing the future of his
family than his country. The newspaper described the Franco
family''s real estate holdings across Spain including a location
used to shoot erotic movie scenes southwest of Madrid. </p>
<p>Even with the biggest Parliamentary majority in 29 years,
Rajoy faces a challenge to maintain public support, said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at Eurasia Group. The new leader''s program
is likely to include additional spending cuts as he aims to
restore the country''s AAA-rating. </p>
<p>Unions will likely resist attempts to loosen labor laws and
even some PP voters were turned off by corruption charges that
forced the party''s regional leader for Valencia to resign. </p>
<p>I''ll vote for the PP while holding my nose, said
Agustin Velasco, 75, in an interview yesterday outside the mass.
I don''t like the PP but I want the Socialists out. </p>

<p>Seattle''s chief technology officer,
Bill Schrier, is bracing for a 6 percent budget cut in 2012,
bigger than this year''s, a sign of tighter spending that
indicates slower sales gains for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Intel Corp. (INTC) </p>
<p>Spending is going to be down, and in some places it''s
going to be down considerably, Schrier said of technology
spending by governments generally. </p>
<p>Schrier is likely to be told to cut even more next year, so
he''s delaying upgrades to Microsoft''s Windows 7, cutting
services contracts from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
and seeking cheaper alternatives to gear from Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) </p>
<p>Belt-tightening in the biggest city in the Pacific
Northwest reflects a larger trend: Financial-services companies
such as Western  Southern Financial Group and governments,
including the state of California, will cut or leave spending on
information technology unchanged next year as economic growth
slows. That means some technology bellwethers, including Intel,
Microsoft, IBM and Cisco, may suffer. </p>
<p>It will be a tough environment just because there''s so
much pessimism out there, said Richard Gordon, an analyst at
market research firm Gartner Inc. The industry will need to
prepare for general downward pressure everywhere. </p>
<p>While Gartner now expects information technology spending
among businesses to rise 3.9 percent next year, less than the
5.9 percent increase for 2011, the Stamford, Connecticut-based
research firm will probably cut that forecast at the end of the
quarter, Gordon said. </p>
<p>VMware May Benefit </p>
<p>Some businesses that seek to stretch technology dollars may
step up spending on products that are designed to save money,
such as VMware Inc. (VMW)''s so-called virtualization software, which
helps clients make more efficient use of data centers. Other
companies that represent areas of strength include Citrix
Systems Inc. (CTXS) and SAP AG (SAP), according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Technology budgets will rise just 0.6 percent over the next
year, according to a September survey of U.S. and European CIOs
by UBS AG. </p>
<p>As a result, sales growth will slow next year for companies
like Microsoft and IBM, which rely on government and financial-
services customers, said Gordon. Sales at Armonk, New York-based
IBM, the largest provider of technology services, will rise only
3 percent in 2012, less than half this year''s 7 percent pace,
according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>At Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, the largest
software maker, sales in fiscal 2012 will increase only 7
percent, compared with 12 percent in 2011. </p>
<p>Real Risk'' </p>
<p>Revenue will climb 8 percent in fiscal 2012 at Oracle Corp. (ORCL),
the top seller of database software, compared with 33 percent
the prior year, while the rate of increase at Intel, the biggest
maker of computer chips, is projected to be 6 percent, a
fraction of this year''s estimated 26 percent, according to
Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>The outlook for many executives dimmed in the second half
as Europe''s credit crisis spiraled, and more recently as
flooding in Thailand has threatened the supply of computer hard-
disk drives. Among corporate chief financial officers surveyed
by Duke University and CFO Magazine, 65 percent said they were
less optimistic about the U.S. economy in the third quarter than
they were in the second. </p>
<p>There is a real risk, and it would be foolish to say
otherwise, said Michael Holland, chairman of Holland  Co.,
which oversees about $4 billion, including shares of Microsoft,
Intel and IBM. To be realistic is to expect things to be a
little less than the level that they were this year. </p>
<p>Zero Spending Growth </p>
<p>Speculation that technology stocks will decline has left
options traders at their most bearish since May 2010. Three-
month puts to sell the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) cost
10.44 points more than calls to buy, according to implied-
volatility data compiled by Bloomberg. The price relationship
known as skew increased 78 percent in the past four months and
reached 11.67 on Nov. 9, the widest in 17 months. </p>
<p>Life insurer Western  Southern Financial Group is keeping
its technology budget flat next year after a 2 percent increase
this year, Chief Technology Officer Douglas Ross said. The
Cincinnati-based company is investing in virtualization software
from VMware so it can cut purchases of server computers from
Dell Inc. (DELL) and Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and storage products from EMC
Corp. and NetApp Inc. (NTAP), he said. </p>
<p>There''s a lot of scrutiny on whether the economy is
slowing, he said. We''re certainly concerned about it. The
management team is really looking at every item to figure out
what we can dispense with. </p>
<p>Demand from businesses this year was a bright spot for some
companies, including Microsoft and Intel, as consumers curtailed
spending on personal computers and other electronics. It won''t
provide as big a cushion in 2012. </p>
<p>Thai Flooding Impact </p>
<p>PC shipments will drop by as much as 13.4 percent in the
first quarter because of supply constraints and rising prices
related to flooding in Thailand, according to researcher IDC.
That''s down from a previous forecast for an 8.2 percent gain. </p>
<p>Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) will boost its technology
spending by 3.7 percent. While that''s about the same as last
year, it''s more modest than the bank''s historical increases,
which range from 4 percent to 6 percent, Chief Information
Officer John Fiore said. The bank is saving money by moving all
but the most complicated technology services to India, instead
of using vendors like IBM and Accenture Plc (ACN), he said. </p>
<p>While the State of California hasn''t finished its budget,
Secretary of California Technology Carlos Ramos predicts another
year of cuts. </p>
<p>Insulated at Oracle </p>
<p>The growth slowdown will hit some areas of technology
harder than others. Spending on technology services will rise
4.4 percent in 2012, compared with 7.3 percent growth this year,
according to Gartner. Spending on server computers will increase
5.8 percent, down from 11 percent this year, while software
spending will climb 7.4 percent next year, below this year''s 8.7
percent. </p>
<p>Companies that have a high percentage of recurring revenue
from maintenance contracts, such as CA Inc. (CA), or large cash piles,
including Microsoft and Redwood City, California-based Oracle,
have some insulation against sudden swings in customer spending,
said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. </p>
<p>Some companies are increasing spending on areas that will
help them reduce expenses in the long run or reach new customers.
Equifax Inc. (EFX), the provider of consumer credit information, will
lift spending by 4 percent to 6 percent in 2012 after a 4
percent increase this year. The spending is aimed at helping the
company deliver on a pledge to investors that 10 percent of
sales will come from new products, CIO David Webb said. </p>
<p>After the Accident'' </p>
<p>Most companies today are totally dependent on technology
for growth and even if there is contraction in the general
market, to stay abreast of competition you have no choice but to
invest in technology, Webb said. </p>
<p>Even companies that plan higher spending may favor modest
increases, said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Portland,
Oregon-based Becker Capital Management Inc., which oversees $2.2
billion in assets. Continued turmoil in Europe or in the broader
market may spook CEOs and CFOs who are still scarred from the
recession. </p>
<p>This is a world of driving after the car accident, he
said. After you get in an accident, you''re a little jumpy and
you go slower. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) named John Skipper
president of ESPN, succeeding George Bodenheimer, who becomes
the profitable sports network''s executive chairman and gives up
oversight of day-to-day operations. </p>
<p>Skipper, 55, previously executive vice president of
content, also becomes co-chairman of Disney Media Networks, the
Burbank, California-based entertainment and theme-park company
said today in a statement. The moves are effective Jan. 1. </p>
<p>Bodenheimer, 53, initiated the succession discussions this
year, Disney said. In his 13 years as president, ESPN has grown
to include eight U.S. television networks, five high-definition
services and a 3-D network. The sports network operates 48
international channels, 18 websites and has 750 radio
affiliates, Disney said. </p>
<p>Disney fell 0.9 percent to $34.02 at the close in New York
time. The stock has declined 9.3 percent this year. </p>
<p>Media networks, led by cable outlets such as ESPN, are
Disney''s largest business, with pay-TV channels contributing a
third of the $10.4 billion of sales in the fourth quarter ended
Oct. 1. The cable networks produced 60 percent of Disney''s
operating profit of $2.11 billion. Hearst Corp. owns 20 percent
of ESPN. </p>
<p>In his new role, Bodenheimer will continue to serve as
chairman of ESPN''s board, provide strategic direction and
support a seamless transition, Disney said. Skipper has been
head of content since October 2005. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chairman Bill Gates
faced more cross-examination on allegations that the world''s
largest software maker undermined Novell Inc.''s WordPerfect
program. </p>
<p>Novell said in its 2004 complaint that Microsoft unfairly
restricted competition by using its monopoly on personal
computer operating systems to suppress a rival word-processing
program. Jeffrey Johnson, Novell''s lawyer, continued his
questioning of Gates, 56, today in federal court in Salt Lake
City. </p>
<p>Johnson began his cross-examination yesterday by asking
Gates about the U.S. government''s landmark antitrust case
against Microsoft that was settled more than eight years ago. In
that case, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft was declared an
illegal monopolist. </p>
<p>Gates acknowledged there was a lawsuit and findings
concluding Microsoft engaged in anticompetitive conduct. </p>
<p>Gates told Microsoft lawyer Steven Holley yesterday that he
absolutely denied the central allegation of Novell''s suit,
that in 1994, in developing the Windows 95 operating system,
Microsoft blocked an element of the software to thwart Novell''s
WordPerfect and Quattro Pro programs. </p>
<p>Pretty Irrelevant'' </p>
<p>While the elements restricted from the operating system may
have been useful to companies developing e-mail programs, they
were pretty irrelevant to word-processing, Gates testified. </p>
<p>Johnson today showed the court an e-mail that Microsoft
lawyers had asked Gates about yesterday. The Oct. 3, 1994, e-
mail from Gates to Brad Silverberg, a Microsoft senior vice
president, and other employees concerned the shell, which
displayed file names in the Windows 95 operating system. </p>
<p>The message addressed Gates''s decision to restrict outside
programmers'' access to extensions, or programming code, a
decision that Novell claims deliberately targeted WordPerfect
and made it impossible to run properly on Windows. </p>
<p>I have decided that we should not publish these
extensions, Gates wrote in the message. We should wait until
we have a way to do a high level of integration that will be
harder for likes of Notes, Wordperfect to achieve, and which
will give Office a real advantage. </p>
<p>Microsoft lawyer Holley yesterday asked Gates if those
extensions were crucial to the development of WordPerfect. </p>
<p>Absolutely Not'' </p>
<p>Absolutely not, Gates said. He also testified that he
restricted the extensions because they generated instability in
the Windows operating system, and could cause it to crash. </p>
<p>Steve Aeschbacher, a lawyer for Microsoft, said in an
interview that Gates wanted to wait to add the extensions to a
future operating system Microsoft called Cairo, which
Microsoft never completed or shipped. </p>
<p>Novell, which was bought by Seattle-based Attachmate Corp.
in April, has argued that WordPerfect''s share of the word-
processing market fell to less than 10 percent in 1996 from
almost 50 percent in 1990. </p>
<p>Its value dropped from $1.2 billion in May 1994 to
$170 million in 1996, when it was sold to Ottawa-based Corel
Corp., said Novell. The company settled separate antitrust
claims against Microsoft for $536 million in 2004. </p>
<p>In May, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia,
revived the case, which had been dismissed by a lower court. The
appeals court ruled that Novell, which briefly owned WordPerfect
in the mid-1990s, didn''t cede its rights when it transferred
claims related to its personal-computer operating system
products to Caldera Inc. in 1996. </p>
<p>The appeals court ruling sent the case back to U.S.
District Judge J. Frederick Motz in Baltimore, who had
originally rejected it. Motz is conducting the trial in Salt
Lake City, where the original lawsuit was filed. </p>
<p>The case is Novell Inc. (NOVL) v. Microsoft Corp., 04-01045, U.S.
District Court, District of Utah (Salt Lake City). </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) will be fined for
falsifying information to Brazil''s oil regulator on a spill in
deep waters off the coast of Rio de Janeiro and for failing to
meet a plan to counter the accident. </p>
<p>The value of the fines for the two violations will be set
after the end of a probe into the leak, the regulator, known as
ANP, said in an e-mailed statement today. The environment agency,
which fined Chevron 50 million reais ($28 million) yesterday, and
the Brazilian Navy are also investigating the spill, ANP said. </p>
<p>The leak, which started Nov. 7 in Chevron''s $3.6 billion
Frade project in the Campos Basin, may lead to tighter regulations
for oil producers, which could affect Brazil''s output target,
according to Erasto Almeida, a analyst at New York-based research
company Eurasia Group. </p>
<p>More scrutiny could slow production (PETR4) increases, although
it''s hard to asses by how much, Almeida said in a phone
interview from New York today. </p>
<p>State-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras,
accounted for 90 percent of Brazilian oil output in September and
aims to more than double production to 6.4 million barrels a day
in 2020. The Rio de Janeiro-based company''s production rose 1.2
percent in the first nine months of this year, the slowest rate
since 2007, according to information on the company''s website. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is nearing a
deal to acquire MF Global (MF) Holding Inc.''s stake in the London
Metal Exchange for about 25 million pounds ($39 million),
according to a person familiar with the process. </p>
<p>The deal values the exchange at about 530 million pounds,
the person said, declining to be identified because the talks
are private. An announcement may be made as soon as today, a
second person with knowledge of the deal said. </p>
<p>MF Global filed for bankruptcy protection last month after
making bets that went bad on European sovereign debt. Its
British subsidiary, MF Global U.K. Ltd., one of 12 category 1
members of the LME that normally hold the right to trade on the
floor, was stopped from trading on the metals exchange on Oct.
31. The company''s special administrator in Britain, KPMG, has
been trying to sell the unit''s stake. </p>
<p>The subsidiary owns 600,000 ordinary shares out of 12.9
million, a 4.7 percent stake, and 25,000 nonvoting B shares,
according to a U.K. Companies House filing on Oct. 24. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has raised its holdings in the LME over the past
year. It owned 800,000 shares as of Oct. 24, compared with
550,000 shares a year earlier, according to filings with
Companies House. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is also agent to a $1.2 billion loan to MF Global
Holdings, and was given a lien on all of the company''s available
assets as security for its loan by a New York bankruptcy court
judge. JPMorgan has also proposed letting MF Global use the only
cash collateral it has on hand, $26 million, to fund operations
while it winds down in bankruptcy. </p>
<p>The LME, for its part, has been the object of takeover
interest. The exchange, which handles 80 percent of global trade
in metals futures, said in September it had received several
expressions of interest. A bid may be recommended to
shareholders as early as March, Martin Abbott, chief executive
officer of the exchange, said at the time. </p>
<p>Representatives of JPMorgan and KPMG declined to comment. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., operator of the $3.6
billion Frade oilfield off the Brazilian coast, is blocked from
drilling in the country while a recent spill is examined, the
South American country''s oil regulator said. </p>
<p>Chevron''s negligence contributed to the spill and the
company needs to pay more attention to safety precautions, the
Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, or ANP, said today in an e-mailed
statement. The ban will remain in effect until the regulator
identifies the causes of the spill and considers it safe to
resume drilling,  ANP said. </p>
<p>The company will adhere to all the rules and regulations
of the government of Brazil and its agencies, Lloyd Avram, a
spokesman, said in an e-mail. Chevron, based in San Ramon,
California, continues production from the field, he said. The
stock dropped (CVX) 2.8 percent to $93.75 at the close in New York. </p>
<p>Brazil is sanctioning Chevron at a time other foreign oil
companies such as BP Plc, Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
are accelerating exploration in deep waters off the coast of
Brazil. The nation expects production to double during the next
decade as it develops the largest oil discoveries in the Western
Hemisphere since 1976. </p>
<p>Chevron was fined 50 million reais ($27 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities for the Nov. 7 spill in deep
waters off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. It will be fined for
falsifying information to ANP and for failing to meet a plan to
counter the accident, the regulator said yesterday. </p>
<p>3,000 Barrels </p>
<p>An estimated 3,000 barrels leaked, Haroldo Lima, head of
the ANP, said yesterday. </p>
<p>Chevron, the third-largest oil producer in Brazil after
state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and Shell, operates
Frade with a 51.74 percent stake. Petrobras holds a 30 percent
stake and Frade Japao Petroleo Ltda., a joint venture including
Inpex Corp. and Sojitz Corp. holds 18.26 percent. </p>

<p>Jefferies Group Inc.''s 62 percent
stock-market swoon is more than just business for Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Richard Handler -- it''s personal. </p>
<p>The value of Handler''s stake has plunged by $248.7 million
this year, including $38.7 million in November alone after MF
Global Holdings Ltd. collapsed. What''s more, Handler hasn''t had
an employment contract as a safety net in the 21 years he''s
worked at New York-based Jefferies. </p>
<p>Handler, 50, focused this month on dispelling speculation
that a liquidity crunch and losses on European debt will sink
his firm, too. In a Nov. 21 letter to stakeholders, he branded
those ideas malicious lies spread by people whose
interests are absolutely opposed to yours and ours. Handler''s
interests, besides his job, include 12.1 million shares, making
him the biggest individual owner. </p>
<p>Handler is a quite unusual bird, Frank Glassner, CEO of
Veritas Executive Compensation Consultants in San Francisco,
said in a phone interview. He clearly communicates a message
that he''s in it for the long term and in it with shareholders as
well. It''s a great leap forward in faith on his part not to have
an executive contract. </p>
<p>The Jefferies CEO owns a bigger share of his company than
CEOs at the biggest Wall Street banks, with a 6 percent stake
that dwarfs the 0.43 percent Lloyd Blankfein holds in Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and the 0.05 percent of Morgan Stanley''s James Gorman, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Restricted Stock </p>
<p>Handler finished 2010 with almost 13.9 million shares,
including restricted stock, valued at $370.1 million at year-end
when Jefferies traded at $26.63, according to regulatory filings
and Bloomberg data. Handler''s current stake is valued at about
$121.4 million based on yesterday''s $10.06 closing price, the
lowest since March 2009. </p>
<p>Employment contracts and golden parachutes aren''t
typically offered to senior executives, according to Jefferies.
We believe our severance, change-in-control and pension
benefits are quite modest compared to general business practices
for companies of comparable size and character, Jefferies said
in a March regulatory filing. We have considered this fact in
setting the levels of total direct compensation. </p>
<p>Under a policy that limits severance to six months'' pay,
Handler would get $500,000 if he''s fired without cause,
according to the filing. If he''s dismissed involuntarily after a
change in control, $21.2 million in restricted stock units that
he''s already earned would vest immediately. </p>
<p>Repelling an Assault </p>
<p>Jefferies has plunged 21 percent since MF Global''s Oct. 31
bankruptcy, triggered by former CEO Jon Corzine''s $6.3 billion
bet on the bonds of Europe''s most-troubled nations. Handler has
defended his firm since, as it has come under pressure from
short sellers and a credit downgrade by Egan-Jones Ratings Co.
Jefferies issued seven statements on its European holdings and
cut its position by about three-quarters as of Nov. 21. </p>
<p>Handler took the lead in repelling what he called an
assault on his company as inquiries flooded in from investors
and analysts. The CEO personally sent and revised e-mails to the
news media as he sought to break the stock''s slide and convey
what his six-page letter called the reality of what is
happening at Jefferies. </p>
<p>He wrote that the firm struggled about whether to discuss
what Handler called even more remote rumors including sadly
some that are rather personal and, as with all the others,
utterly and totally false. In an interview with the New York
Times, Handler said he debated whether to write the Nov. 21
letter and that he thought it was too long and emotional. </p>
<p>Staying in Front'' </p>
<p>He''s being a good CEO in staying in front of the story,
said Tim White, a managing partner at Dallas-based executive
search firm Kaye/Bassman International Corp. When CEOs own a
big piece of a company, then they''re going to act in the
interest of shareholders more stridently than they might if they
didn''t own a big piece of it. </p>
<p>The campaign impressed Chris Kotowski, an Oppenheimer  Co.
analyst, who said he found Handler''s letter convincing. In a
note to investors today titled Another Hack Attack, he
called parts of an updated Egan-Jones''s analysis flat-out
wrong by a country mile. </p>
<p>According to a Nov. 22 Egan-Jones report, revenue has
fallen 37.8 percent annually over the last couple of years.
Kotowski said Egan-Jones also bizarrely projects that
Jefferies''s total assets would increase from $45 billion as of
Aug. 31 to about $67 billion at fiscal year-end and $102.2
billion in November 2012. </p>
<p>Grotesquely Wrong'' </p>
<p>Try as we might, we could not reverse engineer a 37.8
percent decline rate to figure out what the couple of years''
time-frame was, wrote Kotowski, who has a market perform
recommendation on Jefferies shares. Every analyst is entitled
to his or her opinion, but we doubt that the market will pay
much heed given the gross miscalculations we see in this
report. </p>
<p>Jefferies rose 4.5 percent to $10.51 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York after falling 1.4 percent to $10.06 yesterday. Egan-Jones
stands by its report, President Sean Egan said in an e-mail.
Gimme Credit, the research firm specializing in bonds, upgraded
Jefferies today to buy. </p>
<p>Handler bought 170,948 shares this year for $2.98 million,
a stake valued at $1.72 million based on yesterday''s close. On
Sept. 22, he sold 2 million shares for $12.58 each to Leucadia
National Corp. (LUK), Jefferies''s biggest owner with a 29 percent
stake. In a memo to employees, Handler said the sale was tied to
the vesting of stock awards that required significant tax
payments in cash. Handler had never before sold Jefferies
shares except for charitable donations, according to a filing. </p>
<p>Richard Khaleel, a spokesman for Jefferies, declined to
comment on Handler''s stake beyond what the firm has reported in
regulatory filings. </p>
<p>High-Yield Finance </p>
<p>Handler received a bachelor''s degree in economics from the
University of Rochester in 1983 and a master''s in business
administration from Stanford University in 1987. He joined the
company in 1990, when junk-bond powerhouse Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. filed for bankruptcy and Jefferies hired 60 of its
bankers to expand high-yield finance. </p>
<p>In his first year at the investment bank, Handler co-
founded the high-yield capital markets group and was a managing
director of the unit from May 1993 until February 2000. He
became CEO in 2001, when Jefferies had $3.96 billion in assets
and about 1,000 employees, and was named chairman a year later.
He has since expanded the balance sheet to $45.1 billion and
posted profits for the past 11 quarters. </p>
<p>Handler has almost quadrupled the staff as CEO, hiring
dealmakers and traders from the world''s biggest investment
banks, including Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse Group AG,
Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc. </p>
<p>His compensation for the 11 months ended November 2010
climbed 17 percent from all of the previous year to $15.2
million, including $917,000 in salary, a $1.25 million cash
bonus and $13 million in restricted stock units linked to
performance, according to the March filing. Last year, Jefferies
changed its fiscal year-end to Nov. 30 from Dec. 31. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to buy
the London Metal Exchange shares of MF Global U.K. Ltd., while
talks on the sale of remaining assets in the U.K. continue, the
special administrator said. </p>
<p>MF Global (MF) filed for bankruptcy protection last month after
making bets that went bad on European sovereign debt. Its
British unit, MF Global U.K. Ltd., one of 12 category 1 members
of the LME that normally hold the right to trade on the floor,
was stopped from trading on the bourse on Oct. 31. The company''s
special administrator in Britain, KPMG LLP, put the unit''s stake
on sale. </p>
<p>Following a competitive bidding process, JPMorgan
agreed to purchase all of MF Global''s shareholding, Richard
Fleming, Richard Heis and Mike Pink, the special administrators
of MF Global U.K. Ltd. at KPMG, said today in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>The sales process for various aspects of the MF Global
U.K. business continues apace and we are in negotiations with
several parties to this end, Heis said in the statement. </p>
<p>The unit owned 600,000 ordinary shares out of 12.9 million,
a 4.7 percent stake, and 25,000 non-voting B shares out of 1.36
million, according to a U.K. Companies House filing on Oct. 24.
JPMorgan may pay about 25 million pounds ($38.8 million) for the
stake, a person familiar with the process said yesterday. The
price was not given on today''s statement. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, one of the category 1 LME members, has raised its
holdings in the bourse over the past year. The latest purchase
will make the company a holder of 1.4 million shares, or 11
percent, making it the biggest shareholder. It owned 800,000
shares according to the Oct. 24 filing, compared with 550,000
shares a year earlier, according to Companies House. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its holdings in the past
year by 330,000 ordinary shares to 1.23 million shares, or 9.5
percent, according to the Companies House filing. Metdist
Trading Ltd. and Metdist Ltd. own a combined 1.21 million
shares, or 9.4 percent. </p>
<p>The LME issues two share classes. Ordinary shares confer
ownership and 330,000 of them traded at 4.925 pounds in July,
according to data on the bourse''s website. B shares exchanged
hands at 85.425 pounds on Sept. 27. Neither shares trade on an
exchange. </p>

<p>Odin Knudsen, the JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) managing director for environmental markets, resigned last
month as the largest U.S. lender scaled back its climate-related
practice. </p>
<p>Knudsen, 68, left the New York-based lender by mutual
agreement after it became apparent the U.S. was not going to
join a global system to trade carbon emissions, undermining the
bank''s business plans, he said in a Nov. 21 phone interview.
JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment. </p>
<p>We''d all been geared up for the U.S. coming on board at
some point, Knudsen said. The market pretty much died out. </p>
<p>Knudsen, who once headed the World Bank Carbon Fund, is the
second senior carbon markets banker to announce his departure
this month after emissions credits and clean power stocks
plunged in 2011. Investors deserted those markets as the United
Nations plan for a global emissions cap remains gridlocked and
European governments that subsidize most clean energy projects
are battered by the sovereign debt crisis. </p>
<p>Benchmark EU carbon-emission permits have dropped 40
percent this year, falling to a record low today, while the
Bloomberg Industry solar energy stocks index (BISOLAR) plunged 68 percent,
undercutting investor interest in buying research and advisory
services. </p>
<p>Permits Slumped </p>
<p>The value of carbon trading fell 8 percent to 23.7 billion
euros ($32 billion) in the third quarter from the previous three
months as the price of European emission permits slumped,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data. </p>
<p>A record 1.5 billion tons of EU carbon permits was traded
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange between July and September,
exchange data show. Trade in UN carbon credits was a record 348
million tons in the same period. </p>
<p>UBS AG (UBSN), the Swiss bank that lost $2.3 billion from
unauthorized trading this year, in September shut its climate-
change advisory practice and fired the staff, according to
former vice chairman of the securities unit Jon Anda, who ran
the team. Anda was fired along with his team. </p>
<p>Clean-energy analyst Ben Lynch left Commerzbank AG in the
past two months, according to spokeswoman Claire Tappenden. The
industry is being covered by Lauren Licuanan, a power analyst. </p>
<p>Knudsen, who worked 27 years at the World Bank before
joining JPMorgan on Sept. 11, 2007, originally planned to leave
earlier this year and was persuaded to stay on to assess the
bank''s own environmental impact. </p>
<p>By the time he quit the environmental markets business
there were only a few of us left, he said. The unit had
employed several tens of people around the world at its
height. He declined to give specific details of staffing numbers
because the information is confidential. </p>
<p>He plans to develop his own company, Real Options
International, offering carbon securities analysis, and may tap
the emissions market that California is due to start in 2013. </p>
<p>The U.S.''s failure to join a global market was a large
disappointment, Knudsen said. You''re starting over again. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., the U.S. oil producer
operating the $3.6 billion Frade oilfield off the coast of
Brazil, was blocked from drilling in the South American country
while the government probes a recent spill. </p>
<p>The company needs to pay more attention to safety after its
negligence contributed to the accident, Brazil''s oil
regulator, the Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, said yesterday. The
ban will remain in place until the regulator identifies the
causes and considers it safe to resume drilling, ANP said. </p>
<p>This is a setback for Chevron in Brazil, Gianna Bern,
president of Chicago-based risk management adviser Brookshire
Advisory and Research, said yesterday in a telephone interview
from Buenos Aires. It will be challenging for Chevron to
emerge unscathed from the accident. </p>
<p>Brazil is seeking to ensure foreign oil companies such as
BP Plc, Statoil ASA (STL) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), which are
exploring in deep waters off the coast of Brazil, help the
country maximize vast oil deposits located deep beneath the
ocean while avoiding disasters similar to BP''s Gulf of Mexico
oil spill, the worst offshore incident in U.S. history. Brazil
expects crude production to double during the next decade as it
develops the largest oil finds in the Western Hemisphere since
Mexico''s Cantarell in 1976. </p>
<p>Chevron Meeting </p>
<p>Chevron said today in a statement it has not received any
formal notice from the Brazilian regulator suspending its
drilling license, although it acknowledges the ANP posted a
suspension notice on its website. </p>
<p>The oil producer will adhere to all the rules and
regulations of the government of Brazil and its agencies,
Lloyd Avram, a spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mail. Chevron,
based in San Ramon, California, continues production from the
field, he said. The stock slid (CVX) 2.8 percent to $93.75 at the
close in New York yesterday. U.S. markets are closed today for
the Thanksgiving holiday. </p>
<p>Ali Moshiri, Chevron''s president for Latin America and
African operations, is scheduled to meet with Brazil Mining and
Energy Minister Edison Lobao at 3 p.m. today, according to a
statement on the ministry''s website. </p>
<p>Chevron hopes to continue operating in Brazil, George Buck,
the head of Chevron''s Brazil operations, said at a Congressional
hearing in Brasilia yesterday. </p>
<p>Sincere apologies to the Brazilian people and the
Brazilian government, he said. </p>
<p>Pressure Kick'' </p>
<p>Chevron underestimated the amount of pressure at a
reservoir at the Frade project about 230 miles (370 kilometers)
northeast of Rio de Janeiro, Buck told reporters on Nov. 20. The
well experienced a pressure kick at the reservoir, prompting
oil to leak to fissures on the ocean floor, he said. </p>
<p>Chevron halted the flow of oil from the source at the
reservoir on Nov. 13 and reduced the spill to residual seepage,
he said. The company will continue to seal the well that caused
the spill, the ANP said. </p>
<p>Chevron was fined 50 million reais ($27 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities for the spill, which
occurred Nov. 7 off the coast of Rio. The company will be fined
for falsifying information to ANP and also for failing to meet a
plan to counter the accident, the regulator has said. </p>
<p>An estimated 3,000 barrels leaked, Haroldo Lima, head of
the ANP, said Nov. 22. Lima, Buck and Petroleo Brasileiro SA
Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli are scheduled to
meet with state lawmakers in Rio today at 2 p.m. local time. </p>
<p>BP''s Gulf Spill </p>
<p>Chevron, the third-largest oil producer in Brazil after
state-controlled Petrobras (PETR4) and Shell, operates Frade with a
51.74 percent stake. Petrobras holds a 30 percent stake and
Frade Japao Petroleo Ltda., a joint venture including Inpex
Corp. (1605) and Sojitz Corp. (2768), holds 18.26 percent. </p>
<p>The regulator''s press office didn''t return phone calls
seeking comment on the order. </p>
<p>Brazilian regulators are forcing Petrobras to shut
production equipment more frequently for maintenance after the
BP spill in April 2010, Gabrielli said in an Oct. 6 interview. </p>
<p>Here in Brazil laws are stricter than in the United
States, Gabrielli told reporters yesterday in Rio before ANP
announced the drilling ban. The plan continues to be strongly
oriented toward accident prevention. </p>
<p>The ANP also said it rejected Chevron''s request to drill a
so-called pre-salt well at the Frade project, where the
increased depth makes drilling more risky. </p>
<p>We''re going to see increasingly draconian measures,
said Brookshire''s Bern. Operators can''t afford to have any
accidents. </p>

<p>Bond insurer Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO)
has come forward with three dozen new witnesses who it says will
back a legal claim that it was defrauded by JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)''s EMC Mortgage unit in a $337 million mortgage-backed
securities deal. </p>
<p>Lawyers for Hamilton, Bermuda-based Assured Guaranty filed
a new complaint on Nov. 18, unsealed today, in a lawsuit
accusing EMC and its parent at the time, Bear Stearns  Co., of
misleading the bond insurer. The complaint, which also names
JPMorgan as a defendant, includes a new fraud claim and new
allegations from insiders at EMC and elsewhere. </p>
<p>The truth is now coming directly from Bear Stearns'' own
former employees, the insurer said in the complaint. Seven
confidential witnesses who were responsible for underwriting at
EMC each have affirmed that they faced intense pressure to
approve the purchase of high volumes of loans for Bear Stearns''
securitizations without adequate review. </p>
<p>Bear Stearns is a defendant in two other lawsuits in
federal court in Manhattan by guarantors of mortgage-backed
deals who say they were defrauded by the bank, which collapsed
in 2008, according to the complaint. Assured Guaranty said its
complaint adds to those suits by citing accounts from insiders
and other sources. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment on the new complaint. </p>
<p>The suit focuses on a 2005 transaction known as SACO I
Trust 2005-GP1, one of hundreds of securitizations by Bear
Stearns from 2004 to early 2007. Assured Guaranty claims EMC
knew that thousands of home-equity lines of credit that served
as collateral for $337 million in securities it guaranteed were
junk or otherwise flawed. </p>
<p>The case is Assured Guaranty Corp. v. EMC Mortgage Corp.,
10-cv-05367, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman now rates 15 Turkish stocks at buy. They
include builder Enka Insaat  Sanayi AS (ENKAI), fertilizer producer
Gubre Fabrikalari AS (GUBRF), gold miner Koza Altin Isletmeleri AS (KOZAL),

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world''s biggest
theme-park operator, sold bonds for the third time this year
after reporting fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts''
estimates on growth in cable television and at U.S. resorts. </p>
<p>The owner of ESPN issued $1 billion 0.875 percent, three-
year notes and $600 million of 4.125 percent, 30-year bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A Deere  Co. (DE) unit
joined the Burbank, California-based entertainment company in
marketing a benchmark-sized offering today. </p>
<p>Companies are racing to sell debt as borrowing costs hover
within 60 basis points of a record low, propelling bond sales
this month to $98.6 billion as of yesterday, the highest since
May. Yields on investment-grade debt of 4.01 percent yesterday
compare with the record low of 3.45 percent reached in August,

America Merrill Lynch index data. </p>
<p>Disney said on Nov. 10 that profit in the fourth quarter
totaled 59 cents a share, exceeding analysts'' projections of 55
cents, the average of 26 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Higher
fees from pay-TV operators, advertising gains and improved

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the third-largest oil
producer in Brazil, has delayed three wells at the offshore
Frade project while it waits for the government to lift a
drilling ban following an oil spill earlier this month. </p>
<p>Chevron put on hold plans to develop the water injection
wells at Frade after the Brazilian oil regulator''s Nov. 23 ban
on the company''s drilling, Ali Moshiri, head of operations in
Latin America and Africa, said in a telephone interview from
Houston yesterday. Water injection wells help to maintain
reservoir pressure and separate water from oil at other wells. </p>
<p>As many as 3,000 barrels of oil were leaked during the Nov.
7 spill, according to the regulator, which suspended Chevron''s
drilling in the country until a probe into the leak is
completed. San Ramon, California-based Chevron is cooperating
with authorities to investigate the causes of the spill and
still plans to invest $3 billion in existing projects in Brazil
and expand when the country offers new areas, Moshiri said. </p>
<p>We''re hoping it won''t last very long, because I''m not
quite sure why it was suspended in the first place, Moshiri
said. Not even one drop has reached the beach, a reaction of
this magnitudes is really surprising. </p>
<p>The two largest oil producers in Brazil are state-
controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)
Brazil plans to double oil production in the next ten years as
it taps the largest discoveries in the Western Hemisphere in

year by staying roughly within the band seen this year, said
Michael Krauss, JPMorgan''s New York-based head of technical
research. He sees a 12 percent chance of an economic recession
that would push the SP 500 as low as 800. The odds of the index
rising to 1,500 because of progress on the crisis or stimulus
from central banks are 8 percent, Krauss said. </p>
<p>The markets now are like ships caught in the
treacherously stormy seas of headline risk, Krauss wrote in a
note to clients yesterday. It will be difficult for equities
to sustain back above the 1,300-1,350 trendlines, as long as the
European sovereign debt crisis and recession lurks in the
background. Similarly, it will be tough to move below strong
1,075-1,100 clustered support, as long as the U.S. avoids an
economic recession, earnings stay elevated, and investors remain
defensively positioned. </p>
<p>The measure surged 2.9 percent to 1,192.55 yesterday,
ending a seven-day losing streak, after Thanksgiving retail
sales climbed to a record and speculation grew that European
leaders will intensify efforts to end the debt crisis. </p>
<p>Asset Purchases </p>
<p>Federal Reserve asset purchases meant to boost the economy
and better-than-expected earnings helped drive the SP 500 to a
34-month high of 1,363.61 at the end of April. The index sank to
1,099.23 last month as the European debt crisis, which began
more than two years ago in Greece, spread to Italy and Spain. </p>
<p>Krauss said in December that the index would likely peak at
about 1,350 in the middle of 2011 before dropping to 1,100. He
boosted his year-end projection to more than 1,400 in April,
then scrapped that target three months later. </p>
<p>The market''s trend and momentum now suggest higher odds of
more losses, Krauss said. The SP 500 remains below its 200-day
average and that level has been falling since Aug. 9, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The index''s monthly stochastic and Moving Average
Convergence/Divergence line charts, which track the market''s
momentum, continue to show a sell signal that began in July.
Such signals tend to last seven to nine months, suggesting the
market may be under pressure during the first four months of
next year, Krauss said. </p>
<p>The index reached an intraday peak of 1,370.58 on May 2,
surging 106 percent from a 12-year low of 666.79 on March 6,
2009. It has since fallen 13 percent. </p>
<p>Absent a resolution to the European debt crisis, and a
market-friendly outcome to the November 2012 presidential
election, we believe it will be extremely difficult to exceed
this May''s 1,371 SP 500 peak during 2012, he wrote. If our
favored 1,100-1,350 range proves incorrect, it is technically
more likely that the downside support breaks, rather than the
upside barrier. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
clients should exit a bet that Hong Kong-listed companies in
China will gain as UBS AG and Citigroup Inc. cut growth
forecasts for the world''s second-biggest economy. </p>
<p>We are closing our recommended long position in Chinese
equities after the trade lost 5 percent, Goldman analysts
including Noah Weisberger wrote in an e-mailed report dated
yesterday. In a Nov. 6 report, the analysts favored shares in
the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index. (HSCEI) </p>
<p>Premier Wen Jiabao''s crackdown on property speculation is
damping home sales and construction just as Europe''s soveriegn-
debt crisis threatens exports. The central bank triggered
speculation that monetary policy may be further loosened to spur
growth by allowing reserve requirements for some rural credit
cooperatives to fall this month. </p>
<p>Gross domestic product will increase 8 percent in 2012,
less than a previous call of 8.3 percent, Hong Kong-based
economist Wang Tao, of UBS, said in a note today. Citigroup cut
its forecast to 8.4 percent from 8.7 percent. The banks have
also reduced global growth estimates. </p>
<p>We think the balance of risks is no longer attractive,
the Goldman analysts wrote in yesterday''s report, referring to
their previous stock call. </p>
<p>The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, a gauge of 40
mainland companies listed in Hong Kong, dropped 9.7 percent from
Nov. 5 through yesterday on concern Chinese growth may falter.
It climbed 1.8 percent as of 2:40 p.m. local time today. </p>
<p>Euro Zone Woes </p>
<p>In a Nov. 6 report, the analysts highlighted the shares''
underperformance relative to the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>Much weaker euro zone growth will affect the rest of the
world, including China, UBS economist Wang said today. We
think more obvious and persistent easing will likely occur in
the first quarter of 2012, when export, construction and
industrial production should have decelerated significantly. </p>
<p>China''s economy grew 9.1 percent in the third quarter from
a year earlier. Expansion has slowed from 11.9 percent in the
first quarter of last year. </p>
<p>The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.1 percent as
of 1:25 p.m. local time, paring this year''s decline to about 14
percent. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley yesterday lowered its China growth estimate
for next year to 8.4 percent from 8.7 percent. The nation is
unlikely to be immune from weaker external demand although
domestic demand will hold up well, Hong Kong-based
economists led by Helen Qiao and Yuande Zhu said in a note. </p>
<p>Sliding Sales </p>
<p>Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048), China''s second-largest
developer by market value, said its contracted sales fell 39
percent in October from a year earlier. Barclays Capital
estimates home prices may decrease by 10 percent to 30 percent
in the next year. Home prices fell in 33 of 70 cities in
October, government data shows. </p>
<p>We think a sharper deceleration in property investment is
the biggest risk to China''s economy, Johanna Chua, Hong Kong-
based chief economist for Asia at Citigroup, said in today''s
report. But a hard landing can be averted in the near term
with sufficient policy flexibility to provide offsetting support
for growth, especially on the fiscal front. </p>
<p>UBS'' Wang said the government may relax fiscal policy and
bank lending quotas next year.  She estimates additional fiscal
spending of about 1 percent of gross domestic product over a 12-
month period and that the central bank will raise its new
lending target for 2012 to 8 trillion yuan ($1.25 trillion) from
7.3 trillion to 7.4 trillion this year. </p>
<p>Reserve Requirements </p>
<p>Citigroup said the central bank may cut banks'' reserve
requirements before the Chinese New Year in late January if
recent capital outflows continue and raise interest rates to
stabilize deposits. </p>
<p>UBS predicts the world economy will expand 2.7 percent next
year, down from a previous estimate of 3.1 percent. Citigroup is
forecasting 2.5 percent after the sixth consecutive monthly
downgrade, economists led by Willem Buiter and Michael Saunders
said in a report dated yesterday. </p>
<p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
says that growing doubts about the survival of Europe''s monetary
union has caused global growth to stall and represents the main
risk to the world economy. </p>
<p>The Paris-based organization has lowered its estimate for
China''s 2012 expansion to 8.5 percent from a 9.2 percent
forecast in May. A slowdown in property sales could trigger
developer collapses and lead to bad loans, it said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and six others may be
questioned under oath by lawyers for the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Rajat Gupta, who was charged with insider trading
as part of the Galleon Group LLC investigation. </p>
<p>Lawyers for Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs director, sought
to depose Blankfein and other firm executives including Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar, President Gary Cohn, Managing
Director David Loeb and John Bryan, as part of a related suit
brought by the SEC. While U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New
York authorized the questioning of Blankfein before the April 9
criminal trial, he said depositions of the other officers must
be conducted afterwards. </p>
<p>Gupta, who also sat on the board of Procter  Gamble Co.
and led McKinsey  Co., was indicted by a federal grand jury
last month on five counts of securities fraud and one count of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud for passing inside
information to Galleon co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. Rakoff is
presiding over Gupta''s criminal case as well as the SEC lawsuit. </p>
<p>In addition to Blankfein, Rakoff granted SEC requests to
question Gary Rosenbach, Galleon''s co-founder, and Ian Horowitz,
a former trader who worked for Rajaratnam and was recorded on a
U.S. wiretap. The judge said lawyers may also depose three other
individuals associated with Galleon -- Ananth Muniyappa, Brock
Vandervliet and Leon Shaulov. Also to be deposed is Greg Ormond
of Exemplar Wealth. </p>
<p>No Material Argument'' </p>
<p>The court sees no material argument whatsoever for
delaying the depositions, Rakoff said in his ruling. </p>
<p>Gupta, 62, of Westport, Connecticut, was a close friend and
business associate of Rajaratnam, prosecutors said. He made
multimillion-dollar investments with the hedge fund manager and
also passed him inside information after attending Goldman Sachs
board meetings from 2008 through January 2009, according to the
indictment. </p>
<p>Rakoff today said the SEC couldn''t depose Ragakanthan
Rajaratnam, the younger brother of Raj Rajaratnam''s who once
worked as a Galleon portfolio manager. </p>
<p>The judge today also delayed a request to question Caryn
Eisenberg, the former assistant to Rajaratnam; ex-Galleon trader
Michael Cardillo; and James McNerney, presiding director of
Procter  Gamble. </p>
<p>Eleven Years </p>
<p>David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on Rakoff''s ruling. John Nester, a spokesman
for the SEC, declined to immediately comment on the judge''s
decision. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) was irresponsible
and acted with an absolute lack of caution in operations that
led to a leak in the Frade oilfield off the coast of Rio de
Janeiro, the state''s governor said. </p>
<p>The company''s going to pay for this and it''s going to be
expensive, Rio de Janeiro Governor Sergio Cabral told reporters
in New York today, according to a statement e-mailed by his
office. He said Chevron used medieval techniques in the
operations. </p>
<p>Chevron was fined 50 million reais ($27.6 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities for the spill, which
occurred Nov. 7 about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of
Rio de Janeiro. An estimated 3,000 barrels leaked, Haroldo Lima,
head of Brazil''s oil regulator, Agencia Nacional do Petroleo,
said Nov. 22. </p>
<p>The company will be fined for falsifying information to ANP
and also for failing to meet a plan to counter the accident, the
regulator has said. </p>
<p>Cabral''s statement did not specify if further actions would
be taken against Chevron. </p>
<p>In an e-mailed statement, Chevron said it quickly moved to
address the leak. </p>
<p>Our combined efforts greatly diminished the size of the
sheen and stopped the source of the seep flow within only four
days of first detection, the company said in an e-mail from its
press department. Up to 18 vessels have been in rotating
operation to support well plugging operations and sheen
cleanup. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., after this
year''s losing endorsement of U.S. bank stocks, recommends as its
top trade for 2012 a bet against European high-yield corporate
debt and forecasts a deeper recession for the region. </p>
<p>The fifth-biggest U.S. bank in terms of assets recommended
in a research note that investors speculate on the rising cost
of insuring against the default of European junk bonds by using
the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with mostly
high-yield credit ratings. The gauge of derivatives will climb
to 950 basis points, or 9.5 percentage points, from 770 basis
points, according to Goldman Sachs, which urges investors to
exit the trade if the index falls to 680 basis points. </p>
<p>The ongoing shocks from the region''s sovereign crisis --
and policy responses to them -- are likely to be the biggest
determinant of the outlook over the next few months, Dominic Wilson and Jan Hatzius, economists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in
the research note, published today. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said a year ago that the U.S. economy would
expand 2.7 percent in 2011, and U.S. bank stocks, junk bonds,
commodities, Japanese equities and China''s currency were its top
recommendations. America''s gross domestic product is forecast to
grow 1.8 percent in 2011, according to the median forecast of 63
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. </p>
<p>Drop in Financials </p>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials Index has lost 18
percent this year in the worst performance among 10 industry
groups. U.S. banks, measured by the 24-company KBW Bank Index,
have fallen 26 percent on a total return basis. </p>
<p>America''s high-yield corporate debt has returned 1.4
percent as of yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. The Standard  Poor''s GSCI Total Return Index
of commodities has gained 1 percent. Japan''s Nikkei 225 Stock
Average has dropped 16 percent, while China''s yuan has
appreciated 3.6 percent against the dollar this year, according
to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. </p>
<p>The U.S. economy will expand 1.5 percent next year, while
Europe''s will contract 0.8 percent, according to Goldman Sachs.
The bank lowered its worldwide economic growth estimate to 3.2
percent from 3.4 percent. </p>
<p>The financial crisis in the euro zone will weigh on the
U.S. economy through early 2012, according to Hatzius. </p>
<p>Hatzius on Crisis </p>
<p>There will be an intensification over the next few
months, Hatzius said today in a conference call with clients.
A tightening of financial conditions will limit the
willingness of banks to lend, he said. </p>
<p>Europe may stem its debt crisis by moving to a full
fiscal union in which all countries assume responsibility for
the euro area''s sovereign debt or by a much larger
commitment by the European Central Bank to support sovereign-
debt markets, according to the Goldman Sachs note. </p>
<p>The bank''s European growth estimate is conditional on
major policy changes in the region, probably involving a partial
mutualization'' of the existing debt stock supported by the
ECB, the Goldman Sachs economists wrote. The alternative
scenario is that the euro area breaks up and there is a much
deeper recession. </p>
<p>Junk, or high-yield, bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody''s
Investors Service and less than BBB- by Standard  Poor''s. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs also recommended betting on German 10-year
bund yields climbing to 2.8 percent from 2.3 percent and exiting
the trade if they fall to 2 percent. The bank predicted the euro
will rise to 1.35 Swiss francs from 1.2260 and said investors
should abandon the trade if the euro falls to 1.20 francs. </p>
<p>Investors should go long on Canadian stocks versus Japanese
equities, bet on the Malaysian ringgit and the yuan against the
dollar and pound and speculate on a gain in Brent crude oil,
according to Goldman Sachs. A long is a bet an asset will gain
in value. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s (PFE) long dependence on the
cholesterol pill Lipitor to produce almost one-fifth of the
company''s revenue begins eroding today when the drug''s patent
protection ends in the U.S. </p>
<p>The next step will be rebuilding the world''s biggest
drugmaker into a smaller, faster-moving company that focuses on
development of biologic drugs and specialty medicines while
expanding sales of existing products, such as Lipitor and the
erection drug Viagra, in emerging countries such as China,
executives said in interviews. </p>
<p>We''re not going to be a one-product company, said Geno Germano, Pfizer''s president of specialty care and oncology,
interviewed at the company''s New York headquarters. We''re
poised to deliver significant new pipeline assets in the coming
year, and in coming years. </p>
<p>Pfizer rose 3.5 percent to $20.07 at the close in New York,
and has gained 15 percent this year. </p>
<p>The drugmaker is depending on four products to generate $4
billion in new revenue by 2014, said Timothy Anderson, a Sanford
C. Bernstein analyst in New York, in a note to clients. </p>
<p>The drugs are Prevnar, a bacterial infection vaccine gained
in Pfizer''s 2009 Wyeth purchase; the blood-thinner Eliquis, co-
developed with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY); the rheumatoid
arthritis drug tofacitinib; and the cancer drug Xalkori for non-
small-cell lung tumors. Pfizer is awaiting U.S. regulatory
approval on Eliquis and tofacitinib. </p>

<p>General Catalyst Partners, the
venture-capital firm co-founded by Joel Cutler, is seeking to
raise $650 million for a new fund that will invest in technology
companies. </p>
<p>The firm, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is targeting
about $450 million for its General Catalyst Group VI LP fund,
which will focus on consumer Internet, social media and
technology businesses, according to marketing materials sent to
investors in October and reviewed by Bloomberg News. It is also
attempting to gather about $200 million for a supplemental
vehicle that will invest in larger deals with the main fund,
according to the marketing document. </p>
<p>General Catalyst, which also has offices in Palo Alto,
California, is trying to raise money following the slowest
quarter for venture-capital fundraising in eight years. Venture
firms collected $1.72 billion in the third quarter, down 53
percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the
National Venture Capital Association. </p>
<p>Since July, when publicly traded market volatility
increased dramatically, venture-capital fundraising has been
quite slow, as it has been in all areas of private equity,
said Kelly DePonte, a partner at Probitas Partners LLC in San
Francisco, which raises money for alternative-investment firms. </p>
<p>General Catalyst expects a December close for the fund,
according to two prospective investors who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. Its previous fund
and supplemental vehicle collected about $722 million in 2007. </p>
<p>Targeting Software, IT </p>
<p>Michelle Daubar, a spokeswoman for the firm, didn''t return
phone calls or e-mails seeking comment on the fundraising. </p>
<p>In addition to consumer Internet and new-media companies,
the latest fund will target software and information technology
firms, as well as companies that create fundamentally new
breakthrough-oriented ways of doing business, according to the
document. General Catalyst could increase the amount on both the
main and supplemental funds by 10 percent each. </p>
<p>Since its founding in 1999, the firm has raised five funds
and invested about $1.2 billion in 143 companies and start-ups,
according to the document. They include ProfitLogic Inc., which
was sold to Oracle Corp. in 2005; UPromise Inc., later sold to
Sallie Mae; SiteAdvisor Inc., which was sold to McAfee Inc. in
2006; and GroupMe Inc., which was bought by Skype Technologies
SA in August. </p>
<p>While General Catalyst lacks a stable of hot social-media
companies such as Twitter Inc., Zynga Inc. and Facebook Inc. to
help boost fundraising, investors point to Kayak Software Corp.,
the online travel website, as one of the firm''s more promising
holdings. </p>
<p>Kayak Investment </p>
<p>Kayak, which first registered for an initial public
offering in November 2010, was generating a 41 percent gross
internal rate of return and 5.65 times multiple for Fund III as
of Sept. 30, according to the marketing document. </p>
<p>General Catalyst first invested in Norwalk, Connecticut-
based Kayak from its third fund in 2004, with additional
investments from its fifth fund and supplemental vehicle in
December 2007. The firm said in its marketing document that it''s
weighing market conditions before taking Kayak public. </p>
<p>While the company is actively in the registration period,
it is assessing current market conditions before it proceeds
with its offering, according to the document. </p>
<p>General Catalyst has investments in several other companies
that have filed for IPOs, according to the document. They
include Brightcove Inc., an online video-management company;
Demandware Inc., an e-commerce platform; and Mascoma Corp., a
biofuels producer. </p>

<p>U.S. Supreme Court justices debated
an effort to make investment banks, including units of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), pay back money they earned
by allegedly manipulating dozens of initial public offerings. </p>
<p>Hearing arguments yesterday in Washington, the justices
questioned whether Vanessa Simmonds could press ahead with what
originally were 55 lawsuits filed in federal court in Seattle. </p>
<p>The dispute stems from a provision in federal securities
law that requires corporate insiders to give back short-
swing profits -- money from the sale of stock held for less
than six months. The 1934 Securities Exchange Act gives
investors two years to sue over violations. </p>
<p>In letting some of the suits go forward, a federal appeals
court said the time limit hadn''t kicked in because the
defendants didn''t file required disclosure forms. The panel
threw out 30 of the suits on other grounds. </p>
<p>In an hour-long session in Washington, the justices
signaled they were reluctant to erect a rigid rule on the time
limit. Justice Elena Kagan suggested the court might return the
dispute to the lower courts to determine whether Simmonds had
enough information about the alleged wrongdoing to file her suit
earlier, even without the disclosure forms. </p>
<p>The justices are considering an appeal filed by units of
Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Deutsche Bank AG (DB),
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), as well as
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Simmonds was a college student when she bought the stock in
55 companies that went public at the height of the IPO boom in
the late 1990s and 2000. Her father, David Simmonds, is one of
the lawyers pressing the case. </p>
<p>The case is Credit Suisse v. Simmonds, 10-1261, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). </p>

<p>Schaeuble Defends EFSF Panel at German Constitutional Court </p>
<p>German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble defended giving
a parliamentary subcommittee the ability to quickly approve
emergency or classified euro rescue-fund actions at the nation''s
top court. </p>
<p>Germany''s Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe heard
arguments in a case filed by two opposition lawmakers, who say
the rules curb their parliamentary rights and put power in the
hands of too small a group. </p>
<p>The government argues the subcommittee must be allowed to
make decisions privately so that the European Financial
Stability Facility can take actions requiring strict
confidentiality, such as bond purchases on the secondary market. </p>
<p>Confidentiality is the prerequisite that you can use
those instruments at all, Schaeuble told the judges.
Announcing beforehand that you''ll buy bonds in the secondary
market may be suitable at a Carnival speech, but not for
responsible operation of the EFSF. </p>
<p>The court on Sept. 7 cleared Germany''s participation in the
EFSF while stressing the legislature, the Bundestag, must keep
authority over budgetary aspects of the rescue plan. The nine-
member, all-party subcommittee was established to comply with
the ruling while giving the panel powers to approve emergency or
classified decisions. The 41-member budgetary committee must
have a say in EFSF decisions, the court said in its ruling. </p>
<p>The court''s judges in October halted committee activities
while the suit is pending. </p>
<p>The judges are expected to issue a ruling later this year. </p>
<p>The case is: BVerfG, 2 BvE 8/11. </p>

<p>Consultant Made $780,000 on Julius Baer, Swatch Bets, FSA Says </p>
<p>A management consultant on trial for insider trading made
about 500,000 pounds ($780,000) betting on tips from a hedge-
fund employee about companies including Julius Baer Group Ltd.
and Swatch Group AG (UHR), prosecutors said. </p>
<p>Rupinder Sidhu, who faces 23 counts of insider trading,
used Hotmail accounts and MSN Messenger to covertly communicate
with Anjam Ahmad, a trader at AKO Capital LLP, Michael Brompton,
a prosecutor for the Financial Services Authority, told a jury
in London. </p>
<p>Ahmad told Sidhu, a childhood friend, when AKO was about to
buy or sell a stock so he could benefit from the effect on its
share price, Brompton said. This was carried out on an
increasingly large scale and for increasingly large profits
between June and August in 2009. </p>
<p>The 40-year-old, who also faces one count of money
laundering, pleaded not guilty in April. The trial is expected
to last for three weeks. </p>
<p>Sidhu is accused of using spread-betting sites to speculate
on stocks including Julius Baer, Swatch, Reed Elsevier Plc and
Michael Page International Plc, making sums ranging from 1,600
pounds to 137,000 pounds, Brompton said </p>

told jurors yesterday. </p>

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Cargill Accused of Job Discrimination at Arkansas Plant </p>
<p>Cargill Meat Solutions, processor of Honeysuckle White and
Riverside turkeys, discriminated against 4,069 qualified job
applicants, the Labor Department said as it sought to strip the
company of its U.S. contracts. </p>
<p>Female, white, black, Hispanic and American Indian
applicants at the Cargill Inc. unit were denied entry-level jobs
at a production plant in Springdale, Arkansas, according to a
statement yesterday on an agency complaint. The company has $550
million in contracts to supply the U.S. military, the department
said in the statement. </p>
<p>The department filed the complaint after it was unable to
arrange back pay, with interest, for the rejected job

<p>Glencore Unit Should Be Liquidated, Thai Bitumen Says </p>
<p>Glencore International Plc''s Singapore unit should be
liquidated after failing to pay a $20.2 million arbitration
award, Thai Bitumen Co. said in a lawsuit. </p>
<p>Glencore Singapore, a unit of the largest publicly traded
commodities company, is therefore deemed to be insolvent and
unable to pay its debts, Thai Bitumen director Chaiwat
Srivalwat said in the Nov. 23 winding-up petition filed in the
Singapore High Court. A closed hearing is scheduled for Dec. 9. </p>
<p>The Singapore unit of Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore was
ordered to pay $20.2 million and interest to Thai Bitumen by
arbitrator Kenneth Rokison on Sept. 21, according to the
lawsuit. Glencore failed to deliver 600,000 barrels of
Venezuelan crude oil to Thai Bitumen, breaching an October 2008
sale contract, Rokison ruled in the London arbitration
proceedings. </p>
<p>Glencore hasn''t filed its reply to the Singapore lawsuit.
Spokesman Charles Watenphul declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Thai Bitumen''s Chaiwat and the company''s lawyer Cavinder Bull
didn''t reply to an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>Thai Bitumen, a unit of Thailand''s biggest asphalt producer
Tipco Asphalt Pcl. (TASCO), and Glencore couldn''t agree on the interest
amount to be paid on the arbitration award, according to court
papers. Glencore''s lawyers claimed Thai Bitumen had over-
calculated the interest by $42,785, according to court filings. </p>
<p>Glencore declared force majeure on the delivery to Thai
Bitumen, a legal clause that allows delays because of an
incident outside a supplier''s control, after a decision by
Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA to cut
production in 2008, according to the filing. </p>
<p>The case is Thai Bitumen Co. v Glencore Singapore Ltd.
CWU152/2011 in the Singapore High Court. </p>

<p>Olympus Whistle-Blower Woodford Meets With U.S. Prosecutors </p>
<p>Olympus Corp. (7733) whistle-blower Michael Woodford said he met
for two hours yesterday with U.S. prosecutors and investigators
for the Securities and Exchange Commission in New York. </p>
<p>The former head of the Tokyo-based camera maker arrived at
the U.S. Attorney''s Office in Lower Manhattan for a briefing
with eight investigators from the Justice Department, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the SEC, he said in an
interview. It was Woodford''s second meeting with prosecutors; a
prior meeting lasted three hours, he said. </p>
<p>Different elements or parts of the Olympus story appeal
to different jurisdictions, Woodford said, declining to detail
his talks with the U.S. government. I''ve passed on everything
I know. </p>
<p>Woodford was fired as president and chief executive officer
on Oct. 14 after he confronted the Olympus board about oversized
payments made to advisers in the acquisition of Gyrus Group Plc
in 2008. Olympus revealed this month that it used the purchase
of Gyrus and three other takeovers to hide decades-old
investment losses. </p>
<p>Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara in New York, and SEC spokesman John Nester declined to

<p>Wells Fargo Challenges NCUA''s Claims Over Failed Credit Unions </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) said it will challenge a U.S. regulator''s
claim that Wachovia Corp. misrepresented mortgage-backed
securities in 2006 sales to a pair of credit unions that later
collapsed. </p>
<p>The National Credit Union Administration sued Wachovia,
accusing the lender acquired by Wells Fargo during the subprime
mortgage crisis of pervasive disregard of underwriting
standards and issuing offering documents with material
untrue statements, according to a statement released
yesterday. </p>
<p>The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Kansas,
details about $200 million in purchases by the U.S. Central
Federal Credit Union and Western Corporate Federal Credit Union,
which were placed under conservatorship in 2009. NCUA, which is
serving as liquidating agent for the failed lenders, has filed
similar suits against firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, said the San
Francisco-based bank believes the claims are without merit. </p>
<p>We look forward to defending ourselves vigorously in this
matter, Martinez said yesterday in a telephone interview. </p>

<p>BP Pipeline Rupture May Force It to Pay More for 2006 Spill </p>
<p>BP Plc, still facing fallout from the 2010 explosion of its
Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico, is fighting a U.S. bid to
revoke its probation over a five-year-old spill in Alaska
following a more recent pipeline rupture. </p>
<p>BP pleaded guilty in 2007 to violating the Clean Water Act
by spilling 200,000 gallons of oil from its Prudhoe Bay field
into water on Alaska''s North Slope in 2006. It paid a $12
million fine and $8 million for restitution and community
service and was put on three years'' probation. </p>
<p>The U.S. government began arguing yesterday in federal
court in Anchorage that the U.K.-based company violated its
probation by allowing a pipeline rupture two years ago in the
same area. </p>
<p>Authorities last year filed a petition to revoke BP''s
probation 12 days before it was to expire, claiming the company
failed to take precautions and implement safeguards. Prosecutors
may seek more money from the company if the judge agrees the
terms of the probation were violated. </p>
<p>BP''s 2006 spill was the result of a lack of maintenance
and a failure to heed warning alarms indicating that the
pipeline was leaking oil, U.S. lawyers said in a Nov. 14
filing. The 2009 spill vividly demonstrates that BP has not
adequately addressed the management and environmental compliance
problems that have plagued it for many years. </p>
<p>The spill was an unfortunate incident, but it was not a
crime, the company said in court papers. </p>
<p>It was an accident, Steve Rinehart, a BP spokesman,
said in a phone interview. No one was hurt, and there was
minimal environmental impact. </p>
<p>BP didn''t violate any conditions of its probation, the
company said in court filings. BP wasn''t negligent and didn''t
discharge oil in the waters of the U.S., the company said. </p>
<p>BP spilled about 13,500 gallons of oil near Prudhoe Bay in
November 2009 when a section of the company''s pipeline at its
Lisburne Processing Center ruptured, creating a two-foot hole
in the pipe that allowed the contents to spill onto the tundra
and surrounding wetlands, the U.S. said. </p>

cr-00125, U.S. District Court, District of Alaska (Anchorage). </p>

<p>Anglo Irish Bank Noteholder''s Lawsuit Dismissed by U.S. Judge </p>
<p>Anglo Irish Bank Corp., the bank nationalized by the Irish
government in 2009, won dismissal of a noteholder lawsuit that
sought to block the sale of its U.S. loan portfolio. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe in Manhattan said in
an order Nov. 28 that the claims were prohibited by the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act. </p>
<p>Defendant is a foreign state'' within the meaning of
the act, Gardephe said. Plaintiffs have not demonstrated
that Ireland has waived sovereign immunity for purposes of this
action or that any exception to sovereign immunity is
applicable. </p>
<p>Fir Tree Partners, a New York investment firm, sued Anglo
Irish Bank in February, claiming it owns $200 million of notes
the bank issued in the U.S. Fir Tree sought an order blocking
Anglo Irish Bank from transferring any U.S. assets out of the
country so it can force the bank to honor its debt obligations. </p>
<p>Paul Smith, a lawyer for Fir Tree, didn''t return a call to
his office seeking comment on the ruling after regular business
hours Nov. 28. </p>
<p>The case is Fir Tree Capital Opportunity Master Fund LP v.
Anglo Irish Bank Corp., 11-CV-0955, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Del Monte, KKR Deal Faces U.S. Antitrust Probe, Lawyer Says </p>
<p>Del Monte Foods Co. (DLM)''s $5.3 billion sale to a group of
private-equity firms led by KKR  Co. is the target of a U.S.
Justice Department antitrust probe, a lawyer who sued over the
deal said in a court filing. </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors have been investigating the facts and
circumstances surrounding the sale of Del Monte, Stuart Grant,
a lawyer for Del Monte shareholders, said in a Nov. 23 court
filing as part of an $89.4 million settlement of investors''
claims over the deal. </p>
<p>Investors in San Francisco-based Del Monte argued in the
lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington they weren''t
getting enough for their shares in the buyout. Other
shareholders, who filed a related federal court suit in San
Francisco, questioned whether private-equity firms rigged bids
to artificially lower the price paid for the maker of Meow Mix
cat food and Milk Bone dog biscuits. </p>
<p>Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment Nov. 28 on whether the antitrust division was
investigating the Del Monte buyout. Kristi Huller, a KKR
spokeswoman, and Chrissy Stengel, a Del Monte spokeswoman,
didn''t return calls seeking comment on the filing Nov. 28. </p>
<p>The settlement also resolves investors'' claims that
Barclays Plc (BARC), which served as Del Monte''s financial adviser
while providing some financing for the buyers, had conflicting
interests in the deal. The private-equity group led by New York-
based KKR included Vestar Capital Partners and Centerview
Partners LLP. </p>
<p>Delaware Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster ordered Del
Monte in February to delay a shareholder vote on the deal so
investors could consider whether to back it in light of
disclosures about London-based Barclays''s dual roles. Laster
will decide whether to approve the settlement at a hearing
tomorrow. </p>

<p>Facebook Settles Privacy Complaints of U.S. Regulator </p>
<p>Facebook Inc., the world''s biggest social-networking site,
agreed to settle complaints by the Federal Trade Commission that
it failed to protect users'' privacy or disclose how their data
could be used. </p>
<p>The proposed 20-year agreement would require Palo Alto,
California-based Facebook to get clear consent from users before
sharing material posted under earlier, more restrictive terms,
the FTC said yesterday in a statement. It would also compel
independent reviews of Facebook''s privacy practices. </p>
<p>Companies must live up to their promises about privacy,
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said on a conference call with
reporters. The settlement will protect consumer choices and
ensure they have full and truthful information about their
data. </p>
<p>The settlement is part of an effort to resolve legal issues
that could be a distraction as Facebook moves toward an initial
public offering, said Francis Gaskins, president of Los Angeles-
based IPODesktop.com, a Web site that tracks IPOs. Facebook is
considering an IPO that would raise $10 billion and value the
company at more than $100 billion, a person familiar with the
matter said. </p>
<p>In a blog posting, Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark
Zuckerberg said the company should have been more vigilant in
protecting users'' privacy. </p>

<p>Geronzi, Arpe Convicted in Parmalat-Related Case </p>
<p>An Italian court convicted bankers Cesare Geronzi and
Matteo Arpe in a case related to the 2003 bankruptcy of Parmalat
SpA (PLT), Radiocor news agency reported. </p>
<p>Geronzi was sentenced to five years in jail, while Arpe was
given a sentence of three years and seven months by the court in
Parma, Radiocor said. The bankers were accused of fraudulent
bankruptcy connected to the sale of water company Ciappazzi to
Parmalat. </p>
<p>Ennio Amodio, a lawyer for Geronzi, termed the sentencing
profoundly unfair, Radiocor said. Both of the bankers
previously have denied any wrongdoing. Spokesmen for Geronzi and

<p>Litigation Departments </p>
<p>Fortress Credit Suit Against Dechert Thrown Out on Appeal </p>
<p>Dechert LLP won an appeal dismissing a lawsuit by Fortress
Investment Group LLC (FIG) that claimed the law firm issued a false
opinion letter endorsing a transaction with convicted lawyer
Marc Dreier. </p>
<p>Fortress claimed the 2008 letter caused it to lend $50
million to what it believed was the firm of Sheldon Solow, a New
York developer who was a client of Dreier''s defunct firm, Dreier
LLP. Dreier, 61, is serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison
after pleading guilty to selling more than $400 million in phony
notes to hedge funds. </p>
<p>A state appeals court in Manhattan yesterday reversed a
ruling in which a lower-court judge declined to dismiss
Fortress''s claims. </p>
<p>As Dreier was Solow Realty''s attorney and the guarantor
of the loan, defendant had no reason to suspect that Solow
Realty was not in fact a party to the loan transaction or that
Dreier forged the signatures of its principal and CEO, a
unanimous five-judge panel said yesterday in an opinion. </p>
<p>This decision is of tremendous importance to the lawyers
and law firms who give closing legal opinions, a fundamental
aspect of many financial transactions, said Joel Miller, lead
counsel for Dechert. Miller said Fortress tried to use the
Dechert letter as an insurance policy against anything going
wrong with the transaction, including Fortress''s own lack of due
diligence which allowed it be defrauded by Marc Dreier. </p>
<p>Dechert told Fortress that it was acting as special
corporate counsel'' to Solow Realty in the transaction -- a
statement that Fortress relied on in entering into the
transaction and that proved to be utterly false, Marc
Kasowitz, who represents Fortress in the case, said in a
statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Dreier''s firm, which had 250 attorneys, filed for
bankruptcy protection in December 2008. </p>

<p>On The Docket </p>
<p>Allen Stanford Mental Fitness Hearing Scheduled for Dec. 20 </p>
<p>R. Allen Stanford, the Texas financier accused of leading a
$7 billion investment fraud, faces a Dec. 20 hearing to
determine whether he is mentally fit to stand trial next year. </p>
<p>Stanford, 61, returned to Houston earlier this month after
an almost nine-month stay at a U.S. Bureau of Prisons hospital
at Butner, North Carolina. He was treated there for a dependency
on anti-anxiety drugs given to him in prison and evaluated for
the after-effects of a head injury sustained in a jailhouse
assault. </p>
<p>Houston U.S. District Judge David Hittner yesterday
scheduled the competency hearing to determine if Stanford can
assist in his defense. In a separate order, the judge said
Stanford''s criminal trial would start with jury selection on
Jan. 23. </p>
<p>The former chairman and chief executive officer of Houston-
based Stanford Group Co. is accused of misleading investors
about the nature and oversight of certificates of deposit issued
by his Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd. </p>
<p>Stanford, who maintains his innocence, has been in custody
since June 2009, when he was indicted by a federal grand jury in
Houston. The court has twice postponed previously scheduled
trial dates. </p>
<p>Ali Fazel, one of his defense attorneys, yesterday declined
to comment on the hearing and trial dates, citing an earlier
order from Hittner barring attorneys from discussing the case
publicly. </p>
<p>Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney didn''t
immediately respond to a request for comment on the trial date.
She has previously declined to comment because of the gag order. </p>

<p>BP''s Macondo Legal Proceedings May Last to 2014 </p>
<p>BP Plc''s legal proceedings over the Macondo well that
caused the worst U.S. oil spill may last into 2014, Citigroup
Inc. (C) said, citing the company''s lead lawyer. </p>
<p>Blame for the accident will likely be apportioned in late
2013, with punishment decided the following year. That''s later
than analyst Alastair Syme had expected and is slightly more
favorable for the company than an earlier decision, he said in
a research note published yesterday. </p>
<p>BP has set aside about $40 billion for costs from the
disaster that spewed almost 5 million barrels of oil into the
Gulf of Mexico last year. Shares are down more than 30 percent
since the spill. </p>
<p>There is still a risk that ultimate fines and penalties
could be above BP''s current financial provisioning, Syme
wrote. </p>
<p>The company is counting on $5 billion in fines and $7
billion in compensation. If BP is found to be grossly negligent,
its costs may rise by another $10 billion, Syme said. </p>

<p>Commodities show limited potential
for gains in 2012 as the global economy slows and risk aversion
boosts the dollar, according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>A comprehensive solution to Europe''s debt crisis remains
elusive, while economic indicators signal a slowdown and
deleveraging and fiscal austerity should impair growth,
providing a myriad of headwinds for expansion, said analysts
led by Hussein Allidina in a report. </p>
<p>Commodities had their worst quarter since 2008 in the three
months to Sept. 30 on concern that Europe''s debt crisis was
spreading, while 18 of 24 commodities tracked by the Standard 
Poor''s GSCI Index dropped in November. JPMorgan Chase  Co., the
biggest U.S. bank by assets, cut its recommendation on
commodities to underweight on Nov. 22, while Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. trimmed its forecast for gains in the next 12 months
to 15 percent from 20 percent in a report Nov. 14. </p>
<p>Upside for commodities as an asset class is likely
limited given the fragile state of the OECD, said Allidina,
referring to the 34 economies in the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. The non-OECD should continue to
support global growth, but the pace is slowing. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) reiterated its call for gold as a top pick
as investors seek a store of value and haven against debt risk
and a slowing economy in Europe and the U.S. The bank expects
bullion to average $2,200 an ounce next year. Spot gold, which
rallied to an all-time high of $1,921.15 on Sept. 6 and traded
at $1,707.69 at 5:38 p.m. in Singapore, is heading for an 11th
annual gain. The bank also backed corn, soybeans and cattle as
supplies may lag behind demand. </p>
<p>Goldman''s Call </p>
<p>While Goldman pared its 12-month forecast for returns on
the SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index this month, it kept a
neutral call on commodities in three to six months, and an
overweight recommendation over 12 months, as global growth
will provide enough support to demand to drive key commodity
prices higher, said analysts led by Jeffrey Currie. </p>
<p>Commodities are beating equities for a fifth consecutive
year. While the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities has
dropped 13 percent this year and yields on Treasuries fell to
near-record lows, the SP GSCI index rose 3.1 percent. </p>
<p>Raw materials are heading for a second monthly increase as
crude oil in New York had a non-fundamental adjustment,
Societe Generale SA''s commodity strategist Jeremy Friesen said
in an interview yesterday. Fundamentally, you can''t get really
optimistic or really bullish about the commodity markets with
current state of the world, he said. </p>
<p>West Texas Crude </p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate futures rose 6.3 percent this month
after plans were announced to reverse the direction of a
pipeline to start shipping oil from the contract''s delivery
point, easing a bottleneck that weighed on prices. </p>
<p>Expectations for a stronger dollar may provide an
additional headwind for commodities, said Allidina. Dollar-
denominated commodities tend to move inversely to the currency. </p>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s GSCI Total Return Index lost 12
percent in the three months to Sept. 30, the biggest drop since
2008, as the dollar rallied 5.7 percent against a six-currency
basket including the euro. </p>
<p>Historically, we have seen periods where both the U.S.
dollar and commodities have rallied, owing to strength in the
U.S. economy, wrote Allidina. Conversely, any dollar
strength in 2012 is more likely to be a flight to quality. The
implication for the global economic environment under such a
scenario is a bearish signal for commodity demand. </p>
<p>Commodity correlations with other risky assets,
particularly equities, have been rising and are likely to
continue as long as macroeconomic concerns linger, said Allidina.
Increased volatility is likely to persist into 2012, he said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
and most-profitable U.S. bank, is damping employees'' salary and
bonus expectations as the lender wraps up year-end performance
reviews, said three executives familiar with the process. </p>
<p>Managers are telling workers at the New York-based firm
that total average compensation may be lower to unchanged from
last year and that year-end bonuses mostly will depend on the
company''s profit (JPM) and the performance of their divisions. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which posted a record $17.4 billion in net income
last year, may earn $19.1 billion in 2011 even as revenue and
profit margins shrink, according to projections by 12 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey. Average 2011 compensation for the bank''s
256,000 employees will drop or stagnate as the company resists
an industry trend of mass layoffs, the people said. Financial
companies have cut more than 200,000 jobs worldwide this year. </p>
<p>Firms are going to have to base bonuses much more on
merit than strategy, Paul Sorbera, president of Wall
Street executive search firm Alliance Consulting, said yesterday
in a phone interview. There are groups and departments that
will do well, and groups and departments not doing well, that''s
where you see challenges to the bonus pool. </p>
<p>Employees in JPMorgan''s investment bank are bracing for a
smaller-than-usual share of the bonus pool, even as net income
for the division during the first nine months of the year
climbed 18 percent to $6.1 billion from a year earlier, said one
of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the
company''s compensation practices aren''t public. </p>
<p>Paper Gains </p>
<p>The board of directors, led by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, opted to exclude certain paper gains from
its performance equations, such as a so-called debt-valuation
adjustment that added $1.9 billion of pretax profit to the
investment bank''s third-quarter results, two of the people said. </p>
<p>The unit, which had 26,615 employees at the end of
September, set aside $7.71 billion for compensation in the first
three quarters, a 2 percent drop from a year earlier. The
expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and benefits, was
enough to give each of the division''s employees $289,611 for the
first nine months of this year, compared with average
compensation of $298,866 for the same period last year. </p>
<p>While the bank isn''t planning layoffs, we always trim our
sails, Dimon, 55, told reporters during an Oct. 13 conference
call. The unit reduced its workforce 4 percent in the third
quarter from the previous three-month period. </p>
<p>JPMorgan will be squeezing a little bit here and
squeezing a little bit there to further trim staff at the
investment bank by about 1,000 people, or maybe a little bit
more, in the next 18 months, Dimon said. </p>
<p>Credit-Card Unit </p>
<p>Average bonuses for employees in JPMorgan''s asset
management division, which is projected to have weaker year-end
results, also will be lower than last year, one of the people
said. Executives in JPMorgan''s credit-card unit, where profit
more than doubled, may see bonuses rise slightly due to their
division''s stronger overall performance, the person said. </p>
<p>Average compensation figures are derived by dividing the
overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and they
don''t represent individual workers'' actual pay. Investment banks
set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and typically
decide bonuses at year-end. </p>
<p>Almost every week since August has brought news of firings
by the world''s biggest banks. HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe''s
biggest lender, announced that month it would eliminate 30,000
jobs by the end of 2013. In September, Bank of America Corp.,
the second-biggest U.S. lender, said it would cut the same
number of jobs. Both banks are trimming about 10 percent of
their employees. </p>
<p>BNP Paribas, France''s largest bank, said this month that it
will cut about 1,400 jobs at its corporate and investment-
banking unit, and UniCredit SpA, Italy''s biggest lender, said it
plans to eliminate 6,150 positions by 2015. </p>
<p>The firms that are stable and are performing well overall
have some retention strength versus firms that are struggling,
so that gives them a little flexibility on how deep they have to
go on layoffs and how much they''re able to allocate to
bonuses, Sorbera said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and HSBC
Holdings Plc forecast that China will cut interest rates in
2012, putting the banks at odds with most of their rivals, who
see elevated inflation preventing a reduction. </p>
<p>The People''s Bank of China reduced lenders'' reserve
requirements on Nov. 30 for the first time since 2008 as
Europe''s debt crisis deepened. Eleven economists of 20 in a
Bloomberg News survey conducted yesterday and today say rates
will stay unchanged through next year and another four predict
increases. Goldman and HSBC are among five that see cuts. </p>
<p>China''s challenge in loosening monetary policy is to
sustain the expansion of the world''s second-largest economy
without spurring price gains, fueling bad loans or reigniting a
real estate boom that has started to deflate. Inflation will
remain too high for the benchmark one-year deposit rate to be
lowered from the current 3.5 percent, according to Mizuho
Securities Asia Ltd. </p>
<p>The authorities should be careful that the loosening does
not go too far in order to prevent a repeat of mistakes during
the 2008 global financial crisis, said Ma Xiaoping, a Beijing-
based economist with HSBC. Ma said rates may be cut after
inflation falls below 3 percent in the second half of next year. </p>
<p>Across Asia, policy makers are moving to preserve growth.
In Tokyo, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda yesterday ordered a
fourth extra budget, a step unprecedented since postwar
reconstruction, while Thailand cut interest rates this week and
Indonesia did the same on Nov. 10. </p>
<p>Spending Cuts </p>
<p>In a signal that Japan''s post-earthquake rebound may be
fading, companies cut spending at a faster pace in the most
recent quarter, data released in Tokyo showed today. Capital
spending fell 9.8 percent from a year earlier, the Finance
Ministry said. </p>
<p>The MSCI Asia Pacific Index swung between gains and losses
and was little changed at 11:11 a.m. in Tokyo. </p>
<p>Data due today may show the U.S. jobless rate holding
steady at 9 percent, according to analysts'' median estimate.
A better-than-forecast manufacturing expansion reported
yesterday indicated the world''s largest economy is weathering
the crisis that prompted a Federal Reserve-led effort this week
to ease borrowing costs for financial firms. </p>
<p>In the euro area, a report today may show that producer-
price inflation cooled as austerity measures and weakness in
global demand threaten to trigger a recession in the region. </p>
<p>Worse Than Lehman </p>
<p>The current crisis is grimmer and more challenging than
the global financial crisis triggered by the Lehman Brothers
bankruptcy in 2008, Zhu Guangyao, a Chinese vice finance
minister, said at a forum in Beijing yesterday. So the most
imperative task now is to try our best to stimulate global
economic growth. </p>
<p>HSBC''s Ma said three more reserve-ratio cuts are likely in
the first half of next year, along with tax breaks and fiscal
stimulus, after a report yesterday indicated Chinese
manufacturing contracted for the first time since March 2009. </p>
<p>While China''s inflation has slowed to 5.5 percent from a
three-year high of 6.5 percent in July, the rate remains 2
percentage points higher than the one-year deposit rate,
discouraging saving and adding to the risk of asset bubbles. </p>
<p>Inflation will decline quickly in coming months as
cooling economic growth caps demand, said Song Yu, a Beijing-
based economist for Goldman, who says a rate reduction may come
in the second quarter of 2012, when year-on-year consumer-price
gains may fall below the level of the benchmark deposit rate. </p>
<p>HSBC sees the one-year lending rate falling by a quarter
percentage point to 6.31 percent in the second half of 2012,
with the deposit rate declining to 3.25 percent. Credit Agricole
CIB, Capital Economics Ltd. and Hang Seng Bank also see cuts. </p>
<p>Property Slowdown </p>
<p>Besides weakness in export demand, China''s real-estate
market is cooling because of a government campaign to limit the
risk of asset bubbles and make housing more affordable after
record lending in 2009 and 2010 triggered price gains. Property
risks overshadow the economy as declines in home sales threaten
to trigger developer collapses, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said this week. </p>
<p>Monetary easing and more expansionary fiscal policy is
necessary to avoid a sharp downturn as external uncertainty is
increasing and domestic growth momentum slowing, said Shen Jianguang, an economist at Mizuho who previously worked for the
International Monetary Fund. Yet, inflation remains high and
is expected to stay above 4 percent next year which could be
still too uncomfortable for an interest rate cut. </p>
<p>Benchmark rates have been on hold since July after five
increases that began in October last year. Deutsche Bank AG and
Morgan Stanley are in the majority arguing that the central
bank''s pause will continue through 2012. </p>
<p>Excessive Speculation'' </p>
<p>Credit Suisse Group AG says the reserve-ratio move is
policy fine-turning and not a reversal of a monetary stance that
the government describes as prudent. Credit Suisse, Mizuho,
Citigroup Inc. and Australia  New Zealand Banking Group predict
interest rates will rise by the end of next year, the survey
showed. </p>
<p>Deposit rates are too low, fueling excessive
speculation in financial assets and making an increase
inevitable,  Dong Tao, a Credit Suisse economist in Hong Kong,
said in a note. </p>
<p>The half percentage point reserve-requirement cut that
takes effect on Dec. 5 may pump about 350 billion yuan ($55
billoin) into the financial system, according to an estimate by
UBS AG. In yesterday''s survey, Capital Economics forecast five
more reductions in reserve ratios before the end of next year. </p>
<p>The speed at which the euro-zone crisis is escalating
suggests external conditions will be more challenging over the
next year than previously seemed likely, Mark Williams, a
London-based economist for Capital Economics, said in a note.
In turn, policymakers are likely to respond more forcefully. </p>

<p>Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC) agreed to
operate a 360-room London hotel that will be the first Mondrian
location in Europe as the company expands its management
business. </p>
<p>The hotel will be at Sea Containers on the South Bank near
the River Thames, New York-based Morgans said in a statement
today. The 412,000-square-foot (38,000-square-meter) office
building is being converted into a mixed-use development, with
the hotel scheduled to open in early 2014. </p>
<p>Morgans, operator of Delano South Beach in Miami Beach,
Florida, and Royalton New York, has been selling some properties
and using proceeds to expand its management business. The
company last month acquired control of Light Group, an operator
of restaurants and nightclub bars, for about $46.5 million to
enhance its hotel-management business. </p>
<p>Sea Containers is an exceptional property in a key
gateway city, Chief Executive Officer Michael Gross said in
the statement. We believe the Mondrian brand has unique appeal
and significant potential for global expansion." </p>
<p>Morgans plans to invest about $15 million in the London
development, which will be the sixth Mondrian. The hotelier has
a 25-year management agreement and two 10-year extension options
for the property. </p>

<p>Walton Street Capital LLC hired CBRE
Group Inc. to sell 95 industrial properties that it acquired for
about $2.8 billion in 2007, when commercial real estate prices
peaked, as a debt payment on the buildings comes due in June. </p>
<p>The properties are 82 percent leased, according to a CBRE
marketing document, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg
News. Occupancy was 91 percent when Chicago-based Walton Street
bought the buildings, known as the CalWest portfolio, Real
Estate Alert reported at the time. </p>
<p>Property owners have had difficulty refinancing debt amid
the decline in U.S. real estate values from their highs and
upheaval in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market
since July. Walton Street has a $2.45 billion loan repayment
deadline in June. Blackstone Group LP (BX), the world''s largest
private-equity firm, has acquired almost $600 million of debt on
the buildings, putting it in a position to take control if the
borrower defaults. </p>
<p>Walton Street would have to come up with a lot more money
to hang onto this, said Dan Fasulo, managing director at Real
Capital Analytics Inc., a property-research firm in New York.
The problem is they bought this portfolio very much at the
height of the market, and I''m not sure these assets are worth
that anymore. </p>
<p>Commercial real estate prices in the U.S. have fallen 42
percent from their peak in October 2007, according to an index
compiled by Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<p>California Properties </p>
<p>Walton Street paid about $120 per square foot for the
CalWest properties, which total 23.4 million square feet (2.2
million square meters) and are mostly located in California.
While it''s difficult to generalize, Fasulo estimates industrial
assets are now valued at about $80 to $100 per square foot. </p>
<p>They''re actually fortunate that most of the assets are in
California, where there is significant demand, Fasulo said.
They''re hoping someone will come along and see the value and
help them work out of a difficult situation. </p>
<p>Eric Mogentale, managing principal at Walton Street, didn''t
respond to telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment.
Christy Ingle, a spokeswoman for CBRE, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The portfolio is made up of single-building and
multibuilding warehouses and business parks. There are 527
buildings in all and one land parcel, according to the CBRE
document. </p>
<p>Port Cities </p>
<p>Many of the properties are located in or near port cities,
including in Orange County, California; Los Angeles; Oakland,
California; San Diego; Seattle; and Portland, Oregon. </p>
<p>Walton Street bought the assets from a joint venture of the
California Public Employees'' Retirement System and Deutsche Bank
AG''s RREEF unit. The acquisition was funded with the $2.45
billion loan from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Barclays
Capital Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. About $275 million of
debt was packaged into bonds and sold to investors. </p>
<p>Some industrial property owners tried unsuccessfully to
sell assets earlier this year, Fasulo said. </p>
<p>After the market got hot earlier in the year, there were
a handful of major industrial offerings that came to market and
the buyers basically pushed back, he said. A lot of stuff
fell apart. </p>

<p>Turkey has the highest rates in
emerging Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) said, after it started following the country''s overnight
money market rates instead of the central bank''s benchmark. </p>
<p>Goldman showed Turkish rates as the highest regionally
after switching from forecasting the one-week repo lending rate,
which the central bank labels as its benchmark rate, according
to the e-mailed report today. Goldman expects the overnight
rate, which it says is now the policy rate for Turkey, to
decline to 9.5 percent by the end of next year compared to the
current 11.27 percent, it said. </p>
<p>We expect overnight Istanbul Stock Exchange interest
rates to hover around 13 percent over the next six months,
Goldman economist for the region Ahmet Akarli said in the report
from London. However, if we are right about Europe, the
central bank would likely ease policy once again in the second
half of 2012, as balance of payments pressures subside and the
lira finds better fundamental support. Between six to 12 months
therefore we expect the bank to ease overnight ISE rates to
around 9.5 percent. </p>
<p>Turkey''s central bank introduced a more flexible interest
rate policy on Oct. 26, lending to banks at rates between the
5.75 percent one-week repo rate and overnight rates of as much
as 12.5 percent. Governor Erdem Basci labeled the move as a rate
increase, though he said the 5.75 percent rate was still his
benchmark. </p>
<p>Turkey now has the highest interest rates in the region
followed by Hungary on 6.5 percent and South Africa on 5.5
percent, Goldman said in the report. </p>
<p>The central bank may widen its so-called interest rate
corridor to between 5 percent and 14 percent from between 5
percent and 12.5 percent to reinforce tight monetary
conditions, Goldman said. </p>
<p>Yields on Turkey''s two-year lira bonds fell 7 basis points
to 10.32 percent at 5 p.m. in Istanbul. The yield was 9.62
percent before the central bank switched to its more flexible
policy in October. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and six others may be
questioned under oath by lawyers for the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Rajat Gupta, who was charged with insider trading
as part of the Galleon Group LLC investigation. </p>
<p>Lawyers for Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs director, sought
to depose Blankfein and other firm executives including Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar, President Gary Cohn, Managing
Director David Loeb and John Bryan, as part of a related suit
brought by the SEC. While U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New
York authorized the questioning of Blankfein before the April 9
criminal trial, he said depositions of the other officers must
be conducted afterwards. </p>
<p>Gupta, who also sat on the board of Procter  Gamble Co.
and led McKinsey  Co., was indicted by a federal grand jury in
October on five counts of securities fraud and one count of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud for passing inside
information to Galleon co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. Rakoff is
presiding over Gupta''s criminal case as well as the SEC lawsuit. </p>
<p>In addition to Blankfein, Rakoff granted SEC requests to
question Gary Rosenbach, Galleon''s co-founder, and Ian Horowitz,
a former trader who worked for Rajaratnam and was recorded on a
U.S. wiretap. The judge said lawyers may also depose three other
individuals associated with Galleon -- Ananth Muniyappa, Brock
Vandervliet and Leon Shaulov. Also to be deposed is Greg Ormond
of Exemplar Wealth. </p>
<p>The court sees no material argument whatsoever for
delaying the depositions, Rakoff said in his ruling. </p>
<p>Gupta, 62, of Westport, Connecticut, was a close friend and
business associate of Rajaratnam, prosecutors said. He made
multimillion-dollar investments with the hedge fund manager and
also passed him inside information after attending Goldman Sachs
board meetings from 2008 through January 2009, according to the
indictment. </p>
<p>David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on Rakoff''s ruling. John Nester, a spokesman
for the SEC, declined to immediately comment on the judge''s
decision. </p>
<p>Raj Rajaratnam was sentenced to 11 years in prison, the
longest ever for insider trading, after he was convicted earlier
this year. He is set to surrender to prison officials Dec. 5. </p>
<p>The cases are U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, and SEC v. Gupta,
11-cv-07566, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>Appeals Panel to Review Bid to Return BofA Accord to State </p>
<p>Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) persuaded a federal appeals
court to review its request to return an $8.5 billion bond
settlement with Bank of America Corp. to state court from
federal court for a judge''s approval. </p>
<p>The Manhattan-based U.S. Court of Appeals in New York
yesterday granted the petition for expedited review. BlackRock
Inc. (BLK) had also asked the court to reverse U.S. District Judge
William Pauley''s ruling in October keeping the accord in federal
court for review, rather than remanding it to New York State
Supreme Court. </p>
<p>The proposed agreement, first filed in New York state
court, would settle claims from investors in the mortgage bonds
of Countrywide Financial Corp., which Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America (BAC) bought in 2008. The deal was reached with
an institutional investor group that includes BlackRock and
Pacific Investment Management Co. and would apply to 530
mortgage-securitization trusts. </p>
<p>Delay in the resolution of this appeal will prejudice the
institutional investors and other beneficiaries of the trusts,
New York-based BlackRock said in papers filed with the appeals
court on Nov. 1. </p>
<p>Bank of New York, the trustee for the mortgage-bond trusts,
filed the settlement in state court and planned to seek approval
at a November hearing. Under the state proceeding, approval
would bind investors outside the group that negotiated the
agreement. </p>
<p>An investor group, Walnut Place LLC and related entities,
moved the case to federal court and is fighting a bid by Bank of
New York to return it to state court. </p>
<p>The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-4554, 11-4571, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>News Corp. (NWSA) Defeats Lawsuit Over Shine Group Acquisition Records </p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch and his News Corp. persuaded a judge to
throw out an investor lawsuit seeking information about the $675
million purchase of a U.K.-based television production company
owned by Murdoch''s daughter. </p>
<p>Delaware Chancery Court Judge John Noble concluded that a
suit filed by an Illinois-based pension fund seeking to inspect
News Corp. documents about the purchase of Elisabeth Murdoch''s
Shine Group Ltd. was moot since it and other shareholders had
also sued the company''s directors over the deal. </p>
<p>Lawyers for Central Laborers Pension Fund can no longer
tender a proper purpose for pursuing efforts to inspect the
books and records of News Corp. on the acquisition, Noble
ruled yesterday. </p>
<p>The ruling comes as New York-based News Corp. continues to
be investigated and sued over claims that thousands of people''s
phones were hacked by its News of the World tabloid, which was
shuttered in July. </p>
<p>Teri Everett, a News Corp. spokeswoman, didn''t return a
call for comment on Noble''s decision to throw out the investor
suit. </p>
<p>News Corp. officials announced in February the media
company would acquire Shine Group, which supplies television
content to U.K. TV companies including the British Broadcasting
Corp., in an all-stock deal valued at about $675 million. </p>
<p>The case is Central Laborers Pension Fund v. News Corp, CA

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Ally Financial Units Sued by Insurer Over Mortgage Loans </p>
<p>Ally Financial Inc., the auto and home lender that received
a government bailout, was sued by Financial Guaranty Insurance
Co., which claims Ally misrepresented the quality of mortgage
loans underlying securities that Financial Guaranty insured. </p>
<p>In lawsuits filed Nov. 29 in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan, Ally Financial''s GMAC Mortgage and Residential
Funding units are accused of breach of contract in connection
with policies issued by New York-based Financial Guaranty
related to about $3.8 billion worth of residential mortgage-
backed securities. </p>
<p>GMAC Mortgage fraudulently induced FGIC''s agreement to
provide this insurance through willful and material
misrepresentations and omissions concerning the nature of its
business practices and the credit quality of tens of thousands
of mortgage loans that provided the collateral for securities,
Financial Guaranty said in court papers. </p>
<p>There are substantial legal and factual defenses related
to the FGIC claims and we intend to defend our position
aggressively, Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based
Ally, said in an e-mail. We have reviewed loan level put-
back'' claims from FGIC in the normal course as contractually
required and have met our contractual obligations at all times,
including repurchasing loans where a claim was valid. </p>
<p>FGIC Corp., the holding company for Financial Guaranty
Insurance Co., sought bankruptcy protection from creditors in
August 2010 after suffering losses from the drop in the U.S.
housing market. </p>
<p>The cases are Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. v. GMAC
Mortgage LLC, 653302/2011; Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. vs.
Residential Funding Co. LLC, 653303/2011; and Financial Guaranty
Insurance Co. vs. Residential Funding Co., 653304/2011, New York
State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Penn State Sued by Man Alleging Years of Sandusky Sex Abuse </p>
<p>Pennsylvania State University and its former assistant
football coach Jerry Sandusky were sued by an unidentified man
who claims Sandusky sexually abused him more than 100 times over
four years. </p>
<p>The plaintiff sued yesterday as a John Doe in the
Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, saying he met Sandusky
through the Second Mile youth charity at the age of 10 and was
sexually abused from 1992 to 1996. The abuse occurred in and out
of Pennsylvania, including on university property, according to
the complaint. Second Mile, which Sandusky founded, is also a
defendant. </p>
<p>Sandusky, 67, is charged with 40 criminal counts tied to
alleged sexual molestation of eight boys from 1994 to 2009. He
has denied wrongdoing. The plaintiff in yesterday''s suit, the
first against Penn State stemming from the Sandusky case,
accused Second Mile and the university of negligence in failing
to protect children from sexual abuse. </p>
<p>I don''t want other kids to be hurt and abused by Jerry
Sandusky, or anybody like Penn State to allow people like him to
do it -- rape kids! the accuser said yesterday in a statement.
I never told anybody what he did to me over 100 times at all
kinds of places until the newspapers reported that he had abused
other kids, and the people at Penn State and Second Mile didn''t
do the things they should have to protect me and the other
kids. </p>
<p>Joseph Amendola, an attorney for Sandusky, didn''t return a
phone call seeking comment on the suit </p>
<p>Lisa Powers, a spokeswoman for the State College,
Pennsylvania-based university, declined to comment on the suit,
saying the school hadn''t received the court documents. </p>
<p>We will review the lawsuit and respond appropriately when
we have done so, Eric Herman, a spokesman for Second Mile,
said in an e-mail. The Second Mile will adhere to its legal
responsibilities throughout this process. As always, our
thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. </p>

<p>Trials </p>
<p>BTA Bank (BTAS) Seeks Jail for Ex-Chairman Ablyazov at U.K. Trial </p>
<p>BTA Bank, the Kazakh lender that defaulted on $12 billion
of debt before restructuring last year, asked a U.K. judge to
jail its former chairman, Mukhtar Ablyazov, for contempt of
court in a fraud lawsuit. </p>
<p>Ablyazov, who fled Kazakhstan to escape prosecution and
lives in the U.K., violated a 2009 court order freezing his
assets by failing to reveal ownership in a Moscow skyscraper
project and more than 600 shell companies used to conceal his
wealth, BTA''s lawyer said yesterday at the start of a two-week
trial in London. Ablyazov attended the hearing with an
interpreter. </p>
<p>There hasn''t quite been a case like this before, BTA''s
lawyer, Stephen Smith of New Square Chambers, said at the
hearing. The bank''s primary purpose is to coerce Ablyazov into
complying with the court order. </p>
<p>BTA, based in Almaty, filed a series of U.K. lawsuits
against Ablyazov and Roman Solodchenko, its former chief
executive officer, claiming they took more than $5 billion from
the bank using fake loans, back-dated documents and a web of
offshore companies. The men deny the claims, while BTA has said
its accountants are still unwinding the transactions behind the
alleged theft. </p>
<p>Ablyazov claims the bank''s case is politically motivated
because he was part of the democratic opposition to Kazakhstan''s
president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the country for
more than two decades and was re-elected in April with 95.5
percent of the vote. </p>
<p>The bank''s true motive for seeking to put Ablyazov in
jail during the case is to win a knockout blow in order to
impact Ablyazov''s ability to operate commercially or politically
or to defend himself, his lawyer Duncan Matthews said at
yesterday''s hearing. </p>

<p>Deutsche Bank Lawyer Says HMRC Warning Didn''t Change Trade </p>
<p>A Deutsche Bank AG tax lawyer said that in 2009 the lender
considered its German carbon-trading businesses safe and wasn''t
prompted to change its policies by a warning from British tax
authorities. </p>
<p>After talking with a German tax investigator in December
2009 and January 2010, he had no indication that the bank''s
trades were linked to fraud, Goetz Weitbrecht, Deutsche Bank''s
head of tax for continental Europe, said at a Frankfurt criminal
trial yesterday. That assessment was backed by the fact a tax
review by German officials wasn''t continued and Value Added Tax
refunds were paid out at the time, he said. </p>
<p>I personally had an all-clear signal, Weitbrecht said.
Had we gotten the indication that something was wrong, we
would have stopped the trades. </p>
<p>Six managers at emissions-trading companies are on trial in
Frankfurt in what prosecutors call an international scheme to
evade VAT when trading the certificates with Deutsche Bank.
Neither the bank nor Weitbrecht are accused of wrongdoing at the
trial. </p>
<p>The U.K. Revenue  Customs office, or HMRC, told Deutsche
Bank tax managers in London at a Nov. 18, 2009, meeting that 90
percent of emission trading in some countries was done to commit
VAT fraud, according to a memo read in the court by a defense
lawyer yesterday. </p>
<p>Weitbrecht said yesterday that, while he may have been
informed about the London HMRC meeting, he doesn''t remember it.
He relied on information he received from Harald Gebbers, a
German tax investigator with whom he spoke twice on the phone in
December 2009 and January 2010, and on the fact that tax
authorities paid out VAT refunds to Deutsche Bank at the time,
Weitbrecht said. </p>
<p>We had a good and trusting relationship with the
authorities, so I relied on the information I got there,
Weitbrecht said. </p>
<p>German prosecutors formally started their probe of the
trading on Nov. 19, 2009. Tax investigators had already looked
earlier into the issue. Prosecutors are probing 170 suspects,
including seven Deutsche Bank employees. </p>
<p>Presiding Judge Martin Bach said yesterday he expects
closing arguments to start tomorrow. A verdict may come before
Christmas. </p>

<p>Verdicts/Settlements </p>
<p>SocGen Wins Defamation Suit Over Report Questioning Solvency </p>
<p>Societe Generale SA (GLE) won a defamation suit against an online
news site over a September report that France''s second biggest
bank was shut out of the interbank lending market. </p>
<p>ElectronLibre.info, published by Paris-based EL Publishing
SAS, must pay 1 euro ($1.35) to Societe Generale for publishing
the report, a Paris court ruled yesterday. </p>
<p>EL Publishing and director Emmanuel Torregano were ordered
to pay Societe Generale legal costs and to remove the Sept. 7
article from the site within three days or risk an additional
1,000-euro-a-day fine. The site must also run a paragraph on its
homepage saying the court condemned it for running the article
and to pay for that to appear in a publication of Societe
Generale''s choosing. </p>
<p>Europe''s sovereign-debt crisis has hit French banks hard.
Societe Generale has fought to maintain customer confidence as
shares have dropped almost 46 percent since Aug. 1 and its
third-quarter profit fell 31 percent on a 333 million-euro
pretax writedown on Greek sovereign debt and lower trading
revenue. The bank sued Associated Newspapers Ltd.''s Mail on
Sunday in London in October for an August report that it was in
a perilous state and possibly on the brink of disaster. </p>
<p>Given the current situation and all that we have
learned about banks during the sovereign-debt crisis, I will
advise my client to appeal, ElectronLibre lawyer Hasna Boulet
said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam Asks Court to Let Him Remain Free During Appeal </p>
<p>Raj Rajaratnam, the former Galleon Group LLC hedge fund
manager convicted of directing the biggest insider-trading ring
in a generation, asked a federal appeals court to let him remain
free while he challenges the government''s use of wiretaps in his
trial. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam, 54, scheduled to begin an 11-year sentence in a
Massachusetts prison next week, claims improper wiretapping of
his phone conversations will lead to reversal of his May
conviction and that he should remain free in the meantime. A
panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York declined to rule
immediately after a 20-minute hearing yesterday. </p>
<p>Patricia Millett, a lawyer for Rajaratnam, told the court
his appeal presents a substantial question of law and said
he''s unlikely to flee to his native Sri Lanka before the appeal
is decided. </p>
<p>His passport was surrendered ages ago. All his family are
here, Millett told a three-judge panel of the court.  He has
nothing to go to in Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell, who presided over the
case and sentenced Rajaratnam in October, rejected his request
for bail pending the appeal. Rajaratnam claims a March 7, 2008,
wiretap application by FBI special agent B.J. Kang contained
glaring omissions that would likely lead the appeals court
to reverse his conviction, justifying his release on bail. </p>
<p>Millett argued the omissions violated Rajaratnam''s
constitutional rights and the legal requirement that the
government show wiretapping is necessary before getting a
warrant. </p>
<p>There is no substantial question of law likely to result
in a new trial, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan

<p>Ex-Ropes  Gray Lawyer Gets 6 Months in Goffer Tipping Case </p>
<p>Brien Santarlas, a former lawyer at Ropes  Gray LLP, was
sentenced to six months in prison for passing information on
pending mergers to stock traders. </p>
<p>Santarlas, 34, pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges in
December 2009 and cooperated with the U.S. investigation of
illegal tips to hedge funds. </p>
<p>Calling that cooperation very, very important, U.S.
District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan yesterday said that
as a lawyer, Santarlas should be held to a high standard and his
sentence should send a message to other attorneys. </p>
<p>It''s important that those legal professionals understand
they breach those duties at their peril, Sullivan said before
he handed down Santarlas''s sentence. You don''t get a pass. </p>
<p>Santarlas and Arthur Cutillo, a fellow attorney at Ropes 
Gray, passed tips about two pending mergers that the firm was
working on to Cutillo''s college roommate, Jason Goldfarb, who
passed along the information to Zvi Goffer, a former trader at
Galleon Group LLC. The deals were Bain Capital Partners''
acquisition of 3Com Corp. and TPG Capital''s purchase of Axcan
Pharma Inc. </p>
<p>Santarlas pleaded guilty to securities fraud and agreed to
forfeit $32,500. </p>
<p>I''ll never forgive myself, Santarlas told the judge
yesterday. I violated my oath as an attorney. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its
three, six and 12-month price forecasts by 9.3 percent on the
growing potential for supplies to outpace demand in the 2011-12
season started last month. </p>
<p>Cocoa will be at $2,450 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New

of $2,700 a ton, Goldman said in a report dated today. </p>
<p>In November, cocoa prices fell to their lowest levels since
March 2009. </p>
<p>The growing likelihood that global cocoa production
exceeds demand for a second year in the 2011-12 season that

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its
estimate for Turkey''s gross domestic product growth next year to
0.5 percent from 1.5 percent, according to an e-mailed statement
today. </p>
<p>Turkey is likely to experience a sharp economic slowdown
on the back of tightening domestic and external financing
conditions, Goldman said in a report on central and eastern
Europe and the Middle East by analysts including Ahmet Akarli
dated Nov. 30. The Euro-area crisis has recently taken a turn
for the worse, the analysts said, adding that the crisis
will culminate in output losses, especially in the periphery. </p>
<p>Balance sheet strength and economic interconnectivity will
be key factors for emerging economies in weathering the crisis,
with interconnections being detrimental as it leaves economies
exposed to ripple effects throughout the region. </p>
<p>A resolution of the European crisis could lead to a
significant recovery in asset prices in Turkey, the analysts
said, which could be the trigger for recovery through 2013. </p>
<p>The Turkish economy may rebound in the second half of 2012
as external conditions normalize, Goldman said. There is
limited scope for appreciation of the lira, the world''s
second worst-performing currency this year after the South
African rand, over the next six to 12 months, it said. </p>
<p>Turkey''s recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis was
strong though not particularly well-balanced; it was primarily
driven by domestic demand, which led to a significant
deterioration in Turkey''s external imbalances, the analysts
wrote. </p>
<p>Sticky Inflation </p>
<p>The coming year may be one of two halves for Turkey,
according to the report, with the first half of the year
characterized by economic challenges and the second possibly
bringing a solid rebound, depending on Europe''s response to
the debt crisis, it said. </p>
<p>Inflation is likely to remain sticky at around 10
percent through the middle of next year, pushing Turkey''s
central bank to reinforce tighter monetary conditions, which
will contribute to a slowdown in economic activity, the report
said. </p>
<p>Goldman also adjusted its forecasts for the lira downward,
predicting it weakening to 1.95 per dollar in three months. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) forecast
that commodities may rally 15 percent in the next 12 months,
sticking with an overweight recommendation on raw materials
and predicting Brent crude may surge to highest level since 2008. </p>
<p>Commodities may gain as the global economy avoids recession
next year and in 2013, analysts led by London-based Jeffrey Currie said in a report today. Brent, the benchmark used to
price two-thirds of global oil supplies, may jump to $127.50 a
barrel at the end of next year and $135 in 2013, it said. </p>
<p>Goldman''s bullishness contrasts with the view from JPMorgan
Chase  Co., which cut commodities to underweight on Nov. 22
citing policy failures in the U.S. and crisis-hit Europe. Data
today showed manufacturing in China, the largest user of energy
and base metals, shrank for the first time since February 2009. </p>
<p>The European debt crisis remains a significant downside
risk in 2012, Goldman said. However, as long as the risks
manifest themselves in economic weakness and not in financial
stress that would likely precipitate a global recession, it is
unlikely to severely impact commodity markets. </p>
<p>Commodities as measured by the SP GSCI Spot Index are
beating equities for a fifth consecutive year, signaling that
demand from developing economies is sustaining global growth.
The gauge rallied 9.6 percent in October and 1.6 percent last
month even as the euro-zone debt crisis intensified. </p>
<p>Large Driver'' </p>
<p>The risks to this view are skewed to the upside,
particularly given the return of significant backwardation to
the oil market that could become a very large driver of
returns, Goldman said, referring to a pattern where near-term
prices are higher than those further out. </p>
<p>Brent for January delivery, the most-active contract,
traded at $110.95 at 2:19 p.m. in Singapore as the December 2012
contract was at $105.73. Brent peaked this year at $127.02 in
April, and hasn''t traded at more than $127.50 since August 2008. </p>
<p>Goldman correctly advised investors to sell oil and copper
in April and turned more bullish the next month before prices
rebounded. The New York-based bank lowered its commodity gain
forecast from 20 percent for the SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity
Index earlier this month. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase cut its commodity outlook citing Europe''s
worsening debt crisis and slowing growth across emerging markets,
according to the report last month. Raw materials show limited
potential for gains in 2012 as the global economy slows and risk
aversion boosts the dollar, Morgan Stanley analysts led by New
York-based Hussein Allidina said in a report yesterday. </p>
<p>Potential Shortages'' </p>
<p>Goldman economists reduced their forecast for global
economic growth next year to 3.2 percent from 3.4 percent, the
report said. This reduced outlook, but avoidance of global
recession, makes it more likely that commodity markets can
maintain a central course between the whirlpool of a world
economic recession and the rocks of potential shortages. </p>
<p>The 12-month target for copper was retained at $9,500 per
metric ton on China''s demand growth, the Goldman report said.
The metal for three-month delivery fell as much as 1.3 percent
to $7,781.50 on the London Metal Exchange today. </p>
<p>The forecast for Comex gold was held at $1,940 an ounce in
12 months, the report said. Futures traded at $1,746.90 at 2:15
p.m. Chicago-traded corn may rise to $6.85 per bushel in three
months, before sliding to $5.50 in 12 months, the bank said,
expecting large supplies from non-U.S. countries. </p>
<p>In China, the Purchasing Managers'' Index fell to 49 in
November from 50.4 in October, the China Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing said. That was below the median estimate of 49.8
in a Bloomberg survey of 18 economists. A level above 50
indicates expansion. </p>

<p>A $242.9 million portion of top-ranked debt with a

<p>OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) fell the most

equal to the cost of the acquisition. </p>
<p>American depositary receipts of the Russian mobile-phone
provider known as MTS fell 3.8 percent to $16 in New York, the
biggest drop since Nov. 9. </p>
<p>MTS said in a statement on its website yesterday that it
had acquired CJSC Sistema-Inventure, which owns 29 percent of
Moscow City Telephone Network, for 10.6 billion rubles ($342
million). The Moscow-based company also agreed to repay 10.4
billion rubles of CJSC Sistema debt owed to AFK Sistema, CJSC
Sistema''s former owner and the controlling shareholder in MTS,
by the end of the year, the statement said. </p>
<p>While the price of the acquisition seems adequate, MTS
had to take on a debt load equal to the purchase price, and this
is concerning the investors, said Kirill Bakhtin, an analyst
at Moscow brokerage TKB Capital. Sistema was faced with this
debt load and through this sale is taking off that debt load and
transferring it to MTS. </p>
<p>MTS declined 1.9 percent to close at 209.02 rubles, or the
equivalent of $6.76, on Russia''s Micex index. One ADR is equal
to two ordinary shares. </p>
<p>AFK Sistema is Russian billionaire Vladimir Yevtushenkov''s
holding company. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) were among five banks sued by
Massachusetts for allegedly conducting unlawful foreclosures and
deceiving homeowners. </p>
<p>Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley filed the
lawsuit yesterday against the three banks, as well as Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC) and Ally Financial Inc., in state court in Boston.
The banks are accused of engaging in unfair and deceptive trade
practices in violation of state law, according to the attorney
general. </p>
<p>We believe the stakes could not be higher at this stage
of the game, Coakley said at a press conference in Boston.
The foreclosure crisis continues to be at the root of the
economic mess that we find ourselves in and our inability to
turn it around. </p>
<p>State attorneys general across the country have been
negotiating a possible settlement with the five banks that would
resolve a probe into foreclosure practices that began more than
a year ago following disclosures that faulty documents were
being used to seize homes. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John
Stumpf said in a CNBC interview yesterday that he is
disappointed the lawsuit was filed. Wells Fargo is based in San
Francisco. </p>
<p>We''ve worked hard to come to an agreement that I think
would be good for the country and good for housing, he said.
We can work through that better together than working it out
in court. </p>
<p>Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based Ally, said its
GMAC Mortgage unit, which was named as a defendant, will
vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit and has worked
in good faith with Coakley''s office during the past year to
discuss mortgage servicing and ways to assist borrowers. </p>
<p>Tom Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan, said
the bank is disappointed Coakley filed the lawsuit while
negotiations with state and federal officials continue. </p>
<p>We continue to believe that collaborative resolution
rather than continued litigation will most quickly heal the
housing market and help drive economic recovery, Lawrence
Grayson, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Citigroup hasn''t had time to review the lawsuit, Mark
Rodgers, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said in an e-
mail. The bank has been cooperating with the attorney general,
he said. </p>

<p>Wells Fargo Sues U.S. Claiming $350 Million in Excess Taxes </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. sued the U.S. government claiming it''s
owed more than $350 million in refunds for tax overpayments. </p>
<p>Some excess payments were caused by computational and
data entry errors by the Internal Revenue Service, and the
government hasn''t acted on its claim for a refund, Wells Fargo
said yesterday in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. Court of Federal
Claims in Washington. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, says the overpayments
involve the interest rates on taxes paid and stem from
acquisitions by the bank from 1996 through 2008. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
predecessors whose assets and liabilities were assumed by Wells
Fargo filed claims for refunds based on application of a net
zero rate of interest, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Ancel Martinez, a Wells Fargo spokesman, declined to
comment immediately on the lawsuit. Sara Eguren, an IRS
spokeswoman, said the agency doesn''t generally comment on
litigation. </p>
<p>The case is Wells Fargo  Co. v. U.S., 11-808, U.S. Court
of Federal Claims (Washington). </p>
<p>Barclays Sued Over Competing Bid for Carbon Trader </p>
<p>A Barclays Plc (BARC) unit was accused of using its role as a deal
adviser to a carbon-trading firm to get confidential data about
a takeover target and then buying the company itself, according
to a lawsuit filed by CF Partners (U.K.) LLP. </p>
<p>CF Partners hired Barclays to work on its plan to buy
Tricorona AB, a Sweden-based emissions trader, in 2008. When the
deal stalled, Barclays began secret negotiations with Tricorona,
according to papers filed by CF Partners'' lawyers. </p>
<p>Barclays, based in London, completed a $173 million deal
for 85 percent of Tricorona in July 2010. Barclays spokeswoman
Aurelie Leonard declined to comment on the dispute. </p>
<p>The bank used confidential research from CF Partners about
the value of Tricorona''s portfolio, according to the lawsuit. CF
Partners wants damages of least 82.4 million euros ($111
million) from Britain''s second-largest bank for breach of
confidence. </p>
<p>James McRobbie, general counsel of CF Partners, declined to
comment. </p>

<p>Ex-Millennium Global Manager Charged With Securities Fraud </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors charged Michael Balboa, a former
portfolio manager at Millennium Global Investments Ltd., with
participating in a securities fraud scheme involving Nigerian
sovereign debt. </p>
<p>A criminal complaint unsealed yesterday in federal court in
Manhattan alleges that Balboa and his co-conspirators sent
multiple e-mails to an independent valuation agent who inflated
month-end market prices for Nigerian warrants. </p>
<p>The complaint, filed by U.S. Postal Inspector Jessica
Brown, charges that Balboa engaged in an eight-month scheme in
2008 to commit securities and wire fraud with two unidentified
co-conspirators who are cooperating with the government. </p>
<p>Millennium Global in 2008 liquidated Balboa''s hedge fund,
which buys emerging-market debt, after lenders withdrew credit,
two people familiar with the situation said in October 2008.
Millennium Global, a London-based money manager, was founded by
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive Michael Huttman in
1994. </p>
<p>Balbao was also sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. </p>

<p>Lawsuits/Pretrial </p>
<p>Greenberg''s AIG Bailout Suits Pursue Unique Theories </p>
<p>Maurice R. Greenberg, the former American International
Group Inc. (AIG) chief executive officer, seeks to break new ground in
lawsuits challenging the U.S. takeover of the insurer in a
bailout that reached $182 billion. </p>
<p>Greenberg''s Starr International Co. sued the government
Nov. 21, calling the public assumption of 80 percent of stock in
the insurer in 2008 an unconstitutional taking of property
that requires $25 billion in compensation. </p>
<p>Starr also sued the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
saying it breached its duty to AIG shareholders by loaning $85
billion at 14.5 percent while offering better terms to banks in
a backdoor bailout. AIG almost collapsed after bets tied to
the housing market soured, and the bailout was revised at least
four times before reaching $182 billion. </p>
<p>Both complaints were filed by attorney David Boies, who
represented the U.S. in its Microsoft Corp. 1999 antitrust trial
and Al Gore in the Florida presidential recount litigation in
2000. </p>
<p>Any time David Boies is asking for $25 billion, I would
say this is not a normal case, said Robert H. Thomas of the
Honolulu firm Damon Key Leong Kupchak Hastert. </p>
<p>He takes cutting edge cases in unexplored areas of law,
said Thomas, who specializes in land-use and eminent domain.
It''s audacious. As someone who represents plaintiffs in these
kinds of cases, I''d say more power to him. But it''s a stretch. </p>
<p>Boies didn''t respond to requests for comment on his chances
of success in the Starr cases. </p>
<p>Jack Gutt, a spokesman for the New York Fed, said the
allegations have no merit. </p>
<p>AIG''s board of directors had an alternative choice to
borrowing from the Federal Reserve, and that choice was
bankruptcy, Gutt said. Bankruptcy would have left all AIG
shareholders with worthless stock. The Federal Reserve''s actions
with regard to AIG helped to restore financial stability in the
United States during a period of intense volatility and
vulnerability in the U.S. economy. </p>

<p>Online Gambling Trial Judge Unlikely'' to Dismiss Indictment </p>
<p>A federal judge said he''s unlikely to dismiss an illegal
gambling case involving the three largest Internet poker
companies doing business in the U.S. </p>
<p>I think it extraordinarily unlikely the entire indictment
will be dismissed, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in
Manhattan said at the end of a hearing yesterday on a request to
dismiss the case. He said he would rule later on the motion and
that a trial, if held, would begin March 12. </p>
<p>Eleven defendants were accused in April of bank fraud,
money laundering and illegal gambling through the online
companies PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker. </p>

unlawful Internet gambling doesn''t apply to poker. </p>

<p>Madoff Trustee Can Appeal $19 Billion JPMorgan Ruling </p>
<p>The liquidator of Bernard L. Madoff''s firm, who lost the
right to demand $19 billion in damages from JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM), can appeal the ruling to a higher court, a judge said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan last month won dismissal of trustee Irving
Picard''s damage claims in his lawsuit alleging the biggest U.S.
bank aided Madoff''s fraud. Picard can''t sue for common-law
damages on behalf of the defunct Madoff firm''s customers, U.S.
District Judge Colleen McMahon ruled in New York. </p>
<p>The judge directed a clerk to enter a final judgment
dismissing eight claims from Picard''s complaint and said he can
appeal the ruling under a deal struck with JPMorgan, according
to court papers. Her decision followed a telephone conference
Nov. 30, she said. </p>
<p>Picard agreed to put his remaining claims against JPMorgan
on hold while he appeals. He told McMahon in a filing last month
he has no choice but to appeal the order. </p>
<p>Permitting an immediate appeal would provide much-needed
finality for the trustee and the BLMIS estate as to the
viability of these claims, he said. BLMIS refers to Madoff''s
firm. </p>
<p>Rulings by district judges McMahon and Jed Rakoff have
knocked more than $28 billion off of Picard''s claims against
banks and may cost him as much as $11 billion in recoveries from
other cases to benefit investors who lost money in the Ponzi
scheme, according to the trustee''s estimates. </p>
<p>The amount sought from JPMorgan, Madoff''s primary banker,
represented Picard''s estimate of principal lost by all Madoff
investors by the time the Ponzi scheme collapsed in December
2008, according to a complaint filed in June. The bank could
have stopped the fraud if it had passed on its suspicions to
regulators, he alleged. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said it didn''t know about or in any way become a
party to the fraud and couldn''t be held responsible for a scheme
orchestrated by Madoff alone. </p>
<p>Madoff pleaded guilty and is serving a 150-year prison
term. Picard and his firm have made about $224 million in fees
since Madoff''s 2008 arrest. </p>
<p>The McMahon cases are Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 11-
cv-913; Picard v. UBS Fund Services (Luxembourg) SA, 11-cv-4212,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Lindsey Manufacturing Wins Dismissal of Foreign Bribery Case </p>
<p>Lindsey Manufacturing Co., the first corporation to go to
trial on charges it violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act, won dismissal of its conviction after the judge found the
prosecution had engaged in flagrant misconduct. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Howard Matz in Los Angeles yesterday
threw out the convictions of the Azusa, California-based maker
of emergency electricity towers; Keith Lindsey, the closely held
company''s president; and Steve Lee, its finance chief, and he
dismissed the indictment. </p>
<p>Matz said it was with deep regret that he was compelled
to find that the government had allowed an Federal Bureau of
Investigation agent to testify untruthfully before a grand jury,
inserted falsehoods in requests for search warrants, improperly
reviewed e-mails between a defendant and her lawyer, and made
misrepresentations to the court, among other misconduct. </p>
<p>Dr. Lindsey and Mr. Lee were put through a severe
ordeal, the judge said in his ruling. Charges were filed
against them as a result of a sloppy, incomplete and notably
over-zealous investigation, an investigation that was so flawed
that the government''s lawyers tried to prevent inquiry into
it. </p>
<p>At a Nov. 29 hearing, where the judge had issued his
tentative decision to dismiss the case, Jeffrey Goldberg, a
Justice Department lawyer, argued that the government had made
only honest mistakes that didn''t warrant a finding of
misconduct. </p>
<p>The government is appealing the ruling, according to a
notice of appeal filed yesterday. </p>
<p>A jury in May found the company and the two executives
guilty of paying bribes, through an intermediary, to executives
with a state-owned Mexican utility to win contracts. Lindsey and
Lee faced as long as five years in prison for each of five
counts of bribing a foreign official, as well as five years for
a conspiracy count. </p>

11-year sentence. He has been ordered to surrender Dec. 5. </p>
<p>The defendant shall surrender at such time and place as
shall be instructed by the district court, a panel of U.S.
appeals court judges in New York said, denying him a chance to
remain free on bail. Terence Lynam, a lawyer for Rajaratnam,
declined to comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>In a 20-minute hearing Nov. 30 before the appeals court in
Manhattan, a defense lawyer said improper wiretapping of
Rajaratnam''s phone conversations would lead to reversal of his
May conviction and that he should remain free in the interim. </p>
<p>Patricia Millett, another lawyer for Rajaratnam, told the
three-judge panel that the appeal presented a substantial
question of law and that Rajaratnam was unlikely to flee to
his native Sri Lanka before a ruling. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell, who presided over the
case and sentenced Rajaratnam in October, had rejected a request
for bail pending the appeal. </p>
<p>The appeals court panel included U.S. Chief Judge Dennis
Jacobs and Circuit Judges Robert Katzmann and Peter Hall. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 11-4416, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). The lower-court case
is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-01184, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Roomy Khan''s Sentencing Delayed as Cooperation Continues </p>
<p>Roomy Khan''s sentencing for her role in the Galleon Group
LLC insider-trading case was postponed after U.S. prosecutors
said she''s still helping them investigate at least one person
who hasn''t been charged. </p>
<p>Khan, a former Intel Corp. (INTC) executive and stock trader, was
among the first people to plead guilty and cooperate with the
U.S. against Raj Rajaratnam, Galleon''s co-founder. She was
scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 5. Yesterday, U.S. District Judge
Richard Berman, who is presiding over her case, granted the
government''s request and set her sentencing for March 1. </p>
<p>While Khan didn''t testify at Rajaratnam''s trial, she played
a crucial role for the U.S. as prosecutors and agents with the
FBI used her information to obtain a court-authorized wiretap of
Rajaratnam''s phone, according to testimony from a pretrial
hearing in his case last year. </p>
<p>Khan is continuing to cooperate in connection with the
investigation of at least one individual who has not yet been
charged, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Michaelson said. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam, 54, was convicted in May of directing the
biggest insider-trading ring in a generation and sentenced to
serve an 11-year prison term. He lost a bid yesterday to remain
free pending his appeal and was ordered by a panel of judges at
the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York to surrender to U.S.
prison officials on Dec. 5. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Khan, 09-cr-991, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Del Monte Wins Approval of Settlement of KKR Buyout Suits </p>
<p>Del Monte Foods Co. (DLM) and Barclays Plc won a judge''s approval
of a $89.4 million settlement of investor lawsuits over the
buyout of the pet-food maker by a group of private-equity firms
led by KKR  Co. </p>
<p>The accord, which gave Del Monte investors about 50 cents
more a share, provides excellent consideration, Delaware
Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster said before approving the
settlement yesterday at a hearing in Wilmington. </p>
<p>Investors in San Francisco-based Del Monte, maker of Meow
Mix cat food and Milk Bone dog biscuits, alleged they were
shortchanged in KKR''s buyout, for which London-based Barclays
provided some financing. Shareholders received a total $19.50 a
share as a result of the accord, according to court filings. </p>
<p>Kristi Huller, a KKR spokeswoman, couldn''t immediately
comment on Laster''s decision to approve the settlement yesterday
and Kerrie-Ann Cohen, a Barclays spokeswoman, declined to
comment. Chrissy Stengel, a Del Monte spokeswoman, didn''t
immediately return a call seeking comment. </p>
<p>The accord resolves claims that Barclays, which also served
as Del Monte''s financial adviser, had conflicting interests in
the $5.3 billion deal because of its financing for the buyers.
The private-equity group led by New York-based KKR included
Vestar Capital Partners and Centerview Partners LLP. </p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Laster yesterday approved a
total of $22.3 million to cover Del Monte investors'' legal fees
and costs in bringing the case. </p>
<p>The case is In re Del Monte Foods Co. Shareholder
Litigation, CA6027, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>
<p>Ingersoll-Rand Reaches Settlement in Employee Payout Dispute </p>
<p>Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR) reached a settlement with 130 employees
who sued for as much as $72 million in pay under an incentive
plan tied to the sale of the company''s Dresser-Rand Group Inc. (DRC)
unit. </p>
<p>Terms weren''t disclosed in court documents. The accord was
reached on Nov. 29 during the third week of a trial in federal
court in Newark, New Jersey. U.S. District Judge Dickinson
Debevoise dismissed jurors before they could weigh whether
Ingersoll-Rand owed from $11 million, as the company argued, to
$72 million, as workers claimed. </p>
<p>This was a good settlement, attorney Mark Lanier, who
represented a group of employees, said in a telephone interview.
We were excited to finish the case. But by settling at this
time, we eliminated the risk of an adverse verdict or a two-year
appeal. </p>
<p>Ingersoll-Rand, a Swords, Ireland-based maker of heating
and ventilation equipment, offered the plan, dated in 2000, to
retain workers when it began trying to sell Dresser-Rand. After
Dresser-Rand, which makes oilfield equipment, was sold in 2004
for $1.2 billion, Ingersoll-Rand said the 2000 plan no longer
applied. Workers sued and Debevoise ruled the plan remains in
effect, setting up the trial. </p>
<p>Misty Zelent, a spokeswoman for Ingersoll-Rand, didn''t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the settlement. </p>
<p>The case is Nye v. Ingersoll Rand Co., 08-cv-03481, U.S.
District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). </p>

<p>Litigation Departments </p>
<p>Two Rothstein Employees Charged in Lawyer''s Ponzi Scheme </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors charged two more associates of Scott
Rothstein, the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, attorney who last year
admitted to selling investors interest in bogus settlements in
sexual-harassment and whistle-blower cases. </p>
<p>William Boockvor, 66, was charged yesterday with one count
of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and helping Rothstein''s
scheme by preparing false documents purportedly from TD Bank (TC),
where Rothstein''s firm held about 38 trust accounts, prosecutors
said in a statement. </p>
<p>The statements were used to convince investors that
Rothstein''s law firm was holding money in trust when in fact the
money was being spent on his lavish lifestyle and political and
charitable contributions. Boockvor worked for the firm doing a
variety of administrative tasks, according to prosecutors. </p>
<p>Marybeth Feiss, 42, one of Rothstein''s administrative
assistants, was charged with violating federal election campaign
laws and conspiring to defraud the U.S. by helping to bundle
more than $1 million in contributions to the presidential
campaign of U.S. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican. </p>
<p>The government said Feiss organized political fundraisers
where contributions were solicited for McCain''s campaign. The
law firm allegedly reimbursed its associates and employees for
their contributions, disguising those payments as bonuses or
expense reimbursements. </p>
<p>Feiss, reached at home, declined to comment on the charges.
No attorney was listed in federal records for Boockvor, and he
couldn''t immediately be reached for comment. </p>
<p>Boockvor used unidentified co-conspirators who worked for
TD Bank to convince potential investors that the bank statements
were legitimate, the government said. </p>
<p>The latest cases bring to eight the number of people
charged in the scheme. We are not done yet, U.S. Attorney
Wifredo A. Ferrer in Miami said yesterday in a statement. </p>
<p>The cases are U.S. v. Boockvor, 0:11-cr-60281, and U.S. v.
Feiss, 0:11-cr-60282, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
Florida (Fort Lauderdale). </p>

<p>Investment banks are cutting traders
and analysts in climate-related businesses as a slump in shares
and carbon emission permits coincides with a deadlock in
international climate talks. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Managing Director for Environmental
Markets Odin Knudsen left his post in New York by mutual accord
after his team was shrunk, while UBS Securities LLC fired Vice
Chairman Jon Anda and his Climate Policy Group co-workers, Anda
and Knudsen said in interviews. Ben Lynch left his London job as
an alternative-energy analyst for Commerzbank AG (CBK) and it was
taken over by a utilities analyst, company spokeswoman Claire
Tappenden said. The departures took place since September. </p>
<p>The biggest banks, trying to recover from trading losses
and a clampdown on investing their own money, are clipping
resources from emissions-related businesses as United Nations
talks have failed for years to extend Kyoto Protocol greenhouse-
gas curbs beyond their expiration in 2012. The International
Emissions Trading Association, the main carbon-market trade
group, has seen its membership slide about 6 percent this year. </p>
<p>People are leaving the industry because they''ve been
fired or because they see no prospects, said Emmanuel Fages,
head of energy research for Europe at Societe Generale SA in
Paris. That is the sad story. </p>
<p>Climate Talks </p>
<p>Fages said he used to work full-time on carbon at the
French bank''s emissions trading unit Orbeo and the industry now
occupies about 20 percent of his time. </p>
<p>JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment. </p>
<p>UBS officials confirmed Anda''s departure and declined to
give details about his department. Jon Anda has left the bank
and is seeking new opportunities, UBS''s New York-based
spokesman Christiaan Brakman said in an e-mailed response to
questions. UBS remains committed to address climate change. </p>
<p>The Kyoto emissions caps for industrialized nations, which
underpin carbon trading, are set to end in December 2012 unless
United Nations-led talks under way in South Africa produce an
extension. </p>
<p>Clean-power stocks and emission permits have plunged as the
European Union, the biggest advocate for climate action among
developed nations, is ravaged by its own sovereign debt crisis. </p>
<p>Benchmark EU carbon permits lost 44 percent in the year
through yesterday and fell to a record last week while the
Bloomberg Industry solar energy index (BISOLAR) plunged 65 percent,
damping investor demand for research and advisory services. </p>
<p>EU allowances for delivery this month fell 0.4 percent to
7.90 euros a metric ton today as of 8:14 a.m. on Londons ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The Bloomberg Industry Global Leaders
Large Solar Energy index     fell 0.6 percent, headed for its first
decline this week. </p>
<p>Shakeouts, Departures'' </p>
<p>There are shakeouts and departures happening as you would
expect to be the case during any market that was a little bit
unsure about where it was going, Henry Derwent, president of
the International Emissions Trading Association, said in a
telephone interview. Carbon trading is currently suffering, as
so many other markets are, from low economic activity in the
main area which is the European Union. </p>
<p>About 10 institutions have withdrawn from the Geneva-based
trade group this year, cutting membership to about 150
companies, spokeswoman Noria Mezlef said. </p>
<p>EU countries, which subsidize clean energy and bought more
than 80 percent of solar panels last year as well as running the
biggest carbon market, are facing pressure to rein in budget
deficits as investors dump their sovereign debt. The turmoil
wracking the bloc has hurt photovoltaic equipment stocks and
businesses that service that industry. </p>
<p>Little Companies'' </p>
<p>It been a tough time for everyone doing solar, John Hardy, who lost his job in New York as an alternative energy
analyst at Gleacher  Co. in August, said in an interview.
Market capitalizations have dropped to a point where funds
can''t touch these little companies. </p>
<p>He said he expects some of his colleagues and competitors
will also be let go because the market valuation of the industry
can no longer sustain their research. </p>
<p>Dennis Mignon left his job as a carbon trader at First
Climate in Bad Vilbel, Germany, to trade government bonds at DZ
Bank AG in Frankfurt, he said last week. </p>
<p>The value of carbon trading fell 8 percent to 23.7 billion
euros ($32 billion) in the third quarter from the previous three
months as the price of European emission permits tumbled,
according to New Energy Finance data. </p>
<p>ClimateCare </p>
<p>UBS shut its climate-change advisory practice and fired its
staff after theSwiss bank lost $2.3 billion from unauthorized trading this year. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which sold its ClimateCare carbon offset
developer to the unit''s management in August, tied for second
place producing new credits last year, behind Vitol Group and
alongside Climate Change Capital Ltd., according to Bloomberg
New Energy Finance data. </p>
<p>The New York bank cut back its environmental markets team
to just a few people compared with several tens of
people around the world at its height, Knudsen said in an
interview. </p>
<p>Societe Generale said Nov. 25 it agreed to sell its 50
percent stake in carbon trading joint venture Orbeo to its
partner Solvay SA. The Paris-based lender will develop emissions
trading as part of its gas and power business, deputy head of
commodities Jonathan Whitehead said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The emissions market, whatever shape or form it ends up
continuing in, is going to be an important part of our offering
for our clients, he said Nov. 25. The emissions market goes
hand in hand with the power market in Europe. </p>
<p>A record 1.5 billion tons of EU carbon permits was traded
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange from July to September even
as the price slump cut the value of the transactions, exchange
data show. Trade in UN carbon credits was a record 348 million
tons in the same period. </p>

<p>Edward C. Forst, co-head of the
investment management division at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), will
leave at the end of the year and cede his role to Eric S. Lane,
according to internal memos obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Forst, 50, who first joined Goldman Sachs in 1994, is the
third member of the New York-based bank''s management committee
to resign since the beginning of November, after Kevin W. Kennedy, who ran the business in Latin America, and Yusuf A. Alireza, co-head of the Asia-Pacific business outside Japan. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein has said that building the investment management
division, which oversees private equity and hedge funds and also
handles money for wealthy individuals, is a priority for the
firm. Timothy O''Neill, who has served as a co-head of the unit
since 2008, will remain in the role alongside Lane, the memos
said. </p>
<p>Lane, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1996 and was promoted to
partner in 2002, is a longtime employee of the investment
management division, known as IMD. In that sense he represents a
change from recent leaders of the business, including Forst,
O''Neill and former managers such as Marc A. Spilker and Peter S. Kraus, who were transferred from positions in trading or
investment banking. </p>
<p>Leader, Clients </p>
<p>As a long-tenured leader in IMD, Eric has demonstrated
dedication to our clients and a deep understanding of markets,
Blankfein and Gary D. Cohn, Goldman Sachs''s president and chief
operating officer, said in one of the memos to staff yesterday.
His extensive experience in the division positions him
well to lead IMD with Tim. </p>
<p>Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New
York, confirmed the memos'' contents and declined to comment
further. The New York Times wrote about the changes yesterday. </p>
<p>Forst, who worked at Bankers Trust before joining Goldman
Sachs, started his Goldman Sachs career in capital markets and
later held senior roles in the equities and fixed-income,
currencies and commodities, or FICC, trading divisions. </p>
<p>He became co-head of investment management in 2007 and then
left the firm in 2008 for a role at Harvard University. A year
later, he returned to Goldman Sachs as the firm''s senior
strategy officer and in 2010 returned to his current role at the
investment management division. </p>
