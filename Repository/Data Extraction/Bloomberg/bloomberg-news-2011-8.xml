<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to lend its
Quigley unit as much as $65 million in cash to extend the
subsidiary''s bankruptcy, potentially giving Pfizer further
protection against claims for asbestos-related health issues. </p>
<p>Quigley asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein for
permission to borrow the money in court papers filed July 29 in
Manhattan. The cash would extend Quigley''s $20 million loan
agreement from 2004, when the unit entered bankruptcy, and
finance the case until Feb. 24, 2012, Quigley said. </p>
<p>The additional money and time will free Quigley to work
with Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, and a committee of
creditors toward confirmation and consummation of a
reorganization plan, Quigley said. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice
Department, asked in December to end Quigley''s bankruptcy.
Creditors alleging asbestos-related health issues have been
unable to sue New York-based Pfizer during the case, and many of
them have died, the U.S. Trustee said. </p>
<p>Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company
looks forward to working through a bankruptcy plan with Quigley
and creditors, which the extension of the credit agreement will
allow. </p>
<p>In 30 years of asbestos litigation, Pfizer has never been
found to be derivatively liable for Quigley''s liabilities,
Loder said. Quigley''s products were made for decades before
Pfizer acquired it, he said. </p>
<p>Reorganization Hearing </p>
<p>A hearing on a request to dismiss Quigley''s bankruptcy or
approve proposed terms of its reorganization, set for Aug. 4,
was adjourned without being rescheduled, according to court
papers. </p>
<p>Quigley Co., founded in 1916, made three products for the
steel industry from the 1940s to the 1970s that contained
asbestos. Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968, and the company stopped
most operations in 1992. Pfizer said it never made or sold any
Quigley products, and some claimants hadn''t released Pfizer from
alleged derivative liability. </p>
<p>Bernstein refused to allow Quigley to exit Chapter 11 court
protection in September, saying Pfizer had manipulated the
process to benefit itself. Pfizer and a committee of asbestos
claimants won his approval of an agreement that will support the
new Chapter 11 plan, which still requires court approval. </p>
<p>A committee of creditors known as the Ad Hoc Committee of
Tort Victims asked in October 2010 to have Quigley''s
bankruptcy dismissed so it could bring tort claims, which are
otherwise blocked by bankruptcy law. </p>
<p>Asset-Less Dummy'' </p>
<p>In court papers, the group called Quigley an asset-less
dummy entity that was resurrected, handed Pfizer''s money-losing
claims handling unit, and then propped up by Pfizer pursuant to
a non-arm''s-length contract of limited duration -- all in order
to provide Quigley''s extremely well-heeled non-debtor parent
Pfizer with a channeling injunction against present and future
asbestos claims. </p>
<p>The group said Quigley has depleted insurance assets to
sustain $54 million in operating losses and $34 million in
professional fees. </p>
<p>Quigley''s sixth outline of a plan to reorganize, filed in
April, would have resolved disputes over how much Pfizer should
contribute by having it turn over a 281,581-square-foot building
leased to a brewery to help pay asbestos claims. The terms of
that reorganization also required Pfizer to forgive a secured
claim of $86 million, a $12.6 million bankruptcy loan and
unsecured claims of $33 million. The drugmaker would also
contribute $81 million in insurance proceeds, according to court
papers. </p>
<p>Asbestos Claims </p>
<p>Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
during the next 42 years, according to testimony cited by
Bernstein in September. In November, Pfizer reported a $701
million third-quarter charge for asbestos litigation related to
Quigley. </p>
<p>The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley''s fixed-income trading revenue would likely be crimped
if the U.S. credit rating is downgraded, according to Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst. </p>
<p>A downgrade will bring a never before experienced
environment with changing rates, currency-market volatility and
widening credit spreads, Hintz wrote in a note to investors
today. This environment will negatively impact trading
revenue, repo financing and debt capital markets activity, he
said. Both firms have liquidity and capital to navigate
challenging market conditions successfully. </p>
<p>President Barack Obama and Congressional leaders are
rushing to push through a compromise to raise the U.S. debt
limit by at least $2.1 trillion and slash government spending by
$2.4 trillion or more. Ratings companies including Standard 
Poor''s have warned that the nation may lose its top AAA
sovereign grade depending on the contents of the debt deal. </p>
<p>While a downgrade is likely to happen soon, firms have had
time to prepare for the event, Hintz said. That means the
decline in Wall Street''s fixed-income trading revenue will
likely be less than the 36 percent drop that followed the 1998
Russian default, he wrote. </p>
<p>Wall Street''s fixed-income trading units are positioning
themselves in anticipation of a downgrade and are minimizing
their inventory positions, Hintz wrote. These events tend to
be painful but relatively short lived. </p>
<p>Viewed as Manageable'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which are based in New
York, may each have to post $5.2 billion in additional
collateral for so-called repurchase agreements, Hintz wrote.
Banks and other financial companies use U.S. Treasuries as
collateral for loans in repurchase-agreements, or repos, and the
prospect of a downgrade has raised questions about whether such
loans would become more expensive. </p>
<p>Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Mary Claire Delaney at Morgan Stanley (MS) declined to comment on the
note. </p>
<p>Goldman''s senior executives view a potential downgrade of
the U.S.''s credit rating as manageable, Citigroup Inc.
analysts led by Keith Horowitz wrote in a note to investors last
week. The analysts said that they met with Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar, Co-Head of Securities Harvey M. Schwartz, and Co-Head of Investment Banking David M. Solomon. </p>
<p>Management noted that they have run through various
scenarios and implied the risk of a U.S. debt downgrade seems
manageable, with the important caveat that there is always the
possibility of more severe knock-on effects, the Citigroup
note said. Goldman Sachs noted that collateral agreements
related to Treasuries are not dependent on Treasury ratings. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is not rushing to raise collateral
requirements ahead of a potential downgrade, David Hilder, an
analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group LLP, wrote in a note to
clients last week, citing a meeting with Ken deRegt, who helps
lead Morgan Stanley''s fixed-income trading group. </p>
<p>Only a small number of investors are required to own AAA-
rated securities, limiting the impact of a downgrade, deRegt
said, according to Hilder''s note. </p>

<p>Thailand''s Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn will use his personal funds to recover an
airplane seized by German liquidators in Munich last month as
part of a bankruptcy dispute. </p>
<p>Werner Schneider, the insolvency administrator for builder
Walter Bau AG (WTB), seized a Boeing 737 belonging to the crown prince
on July 11 to force payment on a 30 million-euro ($43.3 million)
claim against the Thai state, the company said last month. </p>
<p>The crown prince has no connection with the dispute
between the Thai government and Walter Bau, and didn''t cause the
dispute, the crown prince''s secretariat said in a statement
late yesterday. To avoid any impact to the good relationship
between Thailand and Germany and to end the dispute on good
terms and in an expeditious manner, the crown prince will
provide his personal funds to end the dispute. </p>
<p>A 2009 decision by the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law, or Uncitral, ordered Thailand to pay
Walter Bau more than 30 million euros for breaching a bilateral
investment treaty between Germany and Thailand. The order found
that Thailand''s government breached the terms of a toll road
concession operated by a venture partly owned by Walter Bau. </p>
<p>A Berlin court ruled on July 20 that Thailand must deposit
20 million euros to secure the release of the aircraft,
according to the crown prince''s statement.
The crown prince''s statement didn''t say how much will be paid.
He is the only son of head of state King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Thai law imposes a jail sentence of up to 15 years for defaming,
insulting or threatening the king, queen, heir apparent or
regent. </p>
<p>Marco Polo Seatrade Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in New York </p>
<p>Marco Polo Seatrade BV, a manager of funds, trusts and
foundations, filed for bankruptcy court protection in New York. </p>
<p>The Amsterdam-based company listed both assets and debt of
$100 million to $500 million in Chapter 11 documents filed July
29 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>Affiliates Seaarland Shipping Management BV, Magellano
Marine CV and Cargoship Maritime BV also sought court
protection. </p>
<p>Falm International Holding BV owns 100 percent of the
equity of Marco Polo, court papers show. </p>
<p>The case is In re Marco Polo Seatrade BV, 11-bk-13634, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Bundesbank Loses U.K. Bid to Seize Assets in Lehman CDO Deal </p>
<p>Germany''s central bank lost its bid to take control of a
2.9 billion-euro ($4.2 billion) securitization set up by Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) just before its collapse. </p>
<p>Judge Michael Briggs on July 29 ruled Excalibur Funding No.
1 wasn''t in default for long enough to allow the senior
noteholder, the Bundesbank, to wrest control away from Lehman. </p>
<p>Excalibur was created by Lehman in May 2008 when the U.S.
bank packaged together a group of loans and collateralized debt
obligations. New York-based Lehman filed for bankruptcy three
months later listing assets of $639 billion. </p>
<p>Under the rules of the Excalibur agreement, if the special
purpose vehicle was found to be in default, management of its
assets would pass to the Bundesbank as holder of 2.1 billion
euros of its senior debt. Lawyers for Lehman, which holds 722
million euros of Excalibur''s junior debt, argued Excalibur had
enough cash to meet its obligations. </p>
<p>Magnus Makela, a spokesman for the Bundesbank, said the
central bank came to own the Excalibur notes because they were
used as collateral on a loan for a German subsidiary of Lehman,
which followed its parent into bankruptcy. </p>
<p>The central bank won''t comment further until it''s examined
the ruling in detail, Makela said. </p>
<p>Kimberly Macleod, a spokeswoman for Lehman, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>While there was a default on Jan. 25, it didn''t continue
beyond Jan. 28, Justice Briggs said in his ruling. He granted
all parties permission to appeal his decision. </p>
<p>Standard  Poor''s Financial Services LLC, which gave
Excalibur''s senior notes an A'' rating when the security was
issued in 2008, warned in November the vehicle didn''t have
enough income to pay interest on the junior notes held by Lehman
and that senior noteholders were unlikely to be repaid in full. </p>
<p>In the latest of a series of downgrades, it lowered
Excalibur''s rating to D'' in March. </p>

<p>Fiyaz''s investment company ALFI joined Czech Penta

<p>Tokyo Electric Power Shouldn''t Enter Bankruptcy, Kaieda Says </p>
<p>Japan''s Trade Minister Banri Kaieda said it isn''t

proceedings. Tokyo Electric isn''t expected to become insolvent
for now, Kaieda told upper house lawmakers in Tokyo. There are
various possibilities in dealing with the company in the

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read said he won''t seek large deals to replace falling
revenue, as the world''s biggest drugmaker loses patent
exclusivity to drugs responsible for 60 percent of yearly sales. </p>
<p>We are not going to chase revenue at the destruction of
capital, Read said today in a telephone interview. We have
geographic breadth, we have portfolio breadth, we have
technology breadth. We never say never, but I don''t see why we
would need that. </p>
<p>Read has been shrinking the company by selling units and
buying back shares, in contrast to his predecessors Jeffrey Kindler, who bought Wyeth for $64 billion in 2009, and Henry McKinnell, who bought Pharmacia for about the same price in
2002. Pfizer will still form partnerships and pursue companies
with treatments in mid- to late-stage testing, Read said. </p>
<p>Pfizer, based in New York, faces competition from cheaper
generic medicines to at least 19 drugs from 2010 through 2015,
led by the cholesterol pill Lipitor, the world''s best-selling
drug, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors have
rewarded Read''s strategy for dealing with the acquisitions, with
shares climbing about 14 percent since he took over on Dec. 5,
more than double the return of the company''s U.S. peers. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
No. 2 U.S. shopping-mall owner, fell the most in more than a
year after reporting lower-than-estimated funds from operations
before items and saying that it plans to spin off 30 properties. </p>
<p>Second-quarter core FFO fell to $199.6 million, or 20
cents a share, from $206.1 million, or 63 cents, a year earlier,
the Chicago-based real estate investment trust said in a
statement today. Analysts expected 23 cents a share, the average
of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, said late yesterday that it plans a spinoff of the 30
malls to shareholders through a special dividend. They will be
transferred to a new publicly traded REIT, Rouse Properties
Inc., the company said. General Growth spent $11.3 billion to
buy commercial-property developer Rouse Co. in 2004. </p>
<p>They''re probably malls that don''t have the same kind of
growth prospects, Craig Guttenplan, an analyst at CreditSights
Inc. in London, said in a telephone interview, of the malls to
be spun off. It''s not where GGP wanted to focus its
investment. </p>
<p>The company''s shares fell $1.45, or 8.7 percent, to $15.32
at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It
was the biggest loss since May 7, 2010. </p>
<p>Bankruptcy Filing </p>
<p>General Growth, which owns Water Tower Place in Chicago and
Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston, filed for Chapter 11
protection in April 2009 after weighing itself down with debt
from the Rouse purchase that it was unable to refinance because
of the credit crisis and collapse of the commercial mortgage-
backed securities market. </p>
<p>FFO, a measure of a property company''s ability to generate
cash, was hurt in the second quarter by lower income from lease
terminations, General Growth said. Core FFO excludes items such
as discontinued operations and costs related to debt retirement. </p>
<p>The malls to be spun off have lower occupancy and are in
smaller markets, according to Guttenplan. They may need
substantial investment, he said. </p>
<p>There''s only a couple of properties that were legacy
Rouse properties, Guttenplan said. It''s kind of almost
ironic that they''re bringing back the Rouse name. </p>
<p>Malls in Plano, Texas, and Taylor, Michigan, are the only
ones acquired in the Rouse deal that will be in the new REIT,
according to a comparison of Rouse''s last annual report in 2003
and the list of General Growth''s planned malls to be spun off. </p>
<p>166 Malls </p>
<p>General Growth has ownership and management interest in 166
shopping malls in 43 states. The properties proposed to be spun
off account for 7 percent of the company''s net operating income,
according to yesterday''s statement. </p>
<p>The decision to spin off the malls suggests that the
market for B quality regional mall assets is not strong, Rich Moore, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Solon, Ohio, said in
a note to investors today. General Growth''s operational results
were lighter than those produced by its peers, Moore wrote. </p>
<p>Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), the only U.S. mall owner larger
than General Growth, last week reported second-quarter FFO that
beat analysts'' estimates on higher rents and occupancies. The
Indianapolis-based company raised its full-year forecast. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, reported second-quarter profit that topped analyst
estimates as sales of pain medicines offset declining revenue
from expired patents. </p>
<p>Profit excluding some items was 60 cents a share, beating
by a cent the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Revenue fell 0.9 percent to $16.98 billion, matching
estimates. Sales of the New York-based company''s Lyrica pain
pill and Enbrel arthritis medicine topped analyst predictions. </p>
<p>Pfizer is selling its animal health and infant formula
units and trimming its workforce to prepare for the loss in
November of exclusive rights to Lipitor, the world''s best-
selling drug with $10.7 billion in annual sales. Pfizer has
three late-stage experimental medicines that analysts estimate
may bring in more than $3.5 billion annually by 2015. </p>
<p>Investors are shifting their focus back to the pipeline,
shifting back to the cost cutting and the share repurchases,
said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., in a
telephone interview. We probably have one more quarter where
the divestitures will be of high interest, but people are going
back to the core business. </p>
<p>Net income rose 5.2 percent to $2.61 billion, or 33 cents a
share, from $2.48 billion, or 31 cents, a year earlier, the
company said. Pfizer reiterated its 2011 profit forecast range
of $2.16 to $2.26 a share. It also maintained its guidance for
2012, the first full year of generic competition to Lipitor. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-largest U.S. mall operator, plans to spin off 30 of its
malls to shareholders through a special dividend. </p>
<p>General Growth will issue the dividend in the form of
common stock in Rouse Properties Inc., a recently formed company
into which General Growth will transfer the shopping centers,
the Chicago-based company said in a media release. </p>
<p>The group, which came out of bankruptcy in November, has
sold about $300 million of properties since then, has another
$387 million under contract for sale, and plans to dispose of
another $350 million of assets by the end of this year, Chief
Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani said on June 9. The spin-off
was one of the options considered for the properties, the group
said in a statement distributed through PR Newswire. </p>
<p>The transaction enables General Growth shareholders to
participate in Rouse''s significant growth potential as a
standalone entity and efficiently streamlines General Growth
into a highly focused, premier mall operator, Mathrani said in
the statement. </p>
<p>The distribution will be made on a pro-rata basis to
holders of General Growth common stock on the dividend record
date in the fourth quarter, the company said. The properties in
Rouse, which accounts for about 7 percent of General Growth''s
net operating income, are about 87.7 percent leased, the group
said. </p>
<p>Rouse will be listed on the New York stock exchange as a
real estate investment trust, General Growth said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its forecast
for U.S. economic growth in the third quarter by a percentage
point to 1.5 percent, partly because of a slowdown in consumer
spending, chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note today. </p>
<p>Feroli also lowered the forecast for fourth-quarter growth
to 2.5 percent from a prior estimate of 3 percent. The world''s
largest economy will expand 2 percent in the first six months of
2012, less than a previous projection of 2.5 percent. </p>
<p>With the economy expanding at that pace, the jobless rate
will hold at 9 percent or above until the third quarter of 2012,
he said. Recent production data wasn''t setting up well for
the current quarter, while early surveys suggested activity
may have stalled amid wrangling over the debt-ceiling
extension, Feroli said. </p>
<p>The revised forecast implies very little improvement in
the unemployment rate, he said. Anticipated drag from higher
taxes and lower federal outlays was behind the lower estimates
for next year, Feroli wrote. </p>
<p>JPMorgan also pushed back its estimate for the first
increase in the Federal Reserve''s overnight lending rate until
mid-2013 from a prior forecast for the beginning of the year.
The Fed will undertake further measures to deliver monetary
stimulus to the economy, even though they may not be
particularly powerful, he said. </p>
<p>We don''t see more asset purchases forthcoming but we do
think the committee will take incremental steps to signal
increasingly accommodative policy, Feroli wrote, referring to
the Federal Open Market Committee. </p>
<p>The economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second
quarter following revised growth of 0.4 percent in the first
three months of the year that was less than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department reported last week. Consumer
spending grew 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since the second
quarter of 2009, the final months of the recession. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) puts were the most
active in the U.S. equity-options market after an investor
bought a block of contracts with a strike price 25 percent below
yesterday''s closing level. </p>
<p>A trader purchased 34,532 October $16 puts to sell the
owner of the world''s largest retail brokerage for 28 cents each,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The October $16 put
contract had an open interest of 193 before today, the data
show. This was the biggest trade in New York-based Morgan
Stanley''s puts since January 2010, according to Henry Schwartz,
president of Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based provider of
options-market data and analytics. </p>
<p>It''s a pretty impressive trade, said Schwartz in a
telephone interview. It''s a downside hedge into the fall.
Somebody is maybe getting seriously nervous. It does show some
significant concern or desire to hedge risk of a move lower. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has been trading below book value, or the
value of its assets, and the shares are near the lowest level
since March 2009. Revenue climbed to $9.28 billion from $7.96
billion a year earlier, the highest since the end of the
financial crisis, the company said July 21. The stock jumped 11
percent that day. It has dropped 14 percent since, as financial
companies in the SP 500 retreated 6.8 percent amid concerns the
U.S. recovery is weakening and the European sovereign-debt
crisis will spread. Morgan Stanley shares fell 2.7 percent to
$20.74 at 2:52 p.m. in New York. </p>
<p>Right to Sell </p>
<p>The 34,532-option trade would give the right to sell
3,453,200 Morgan Stanley shares at $16. The company hasn''t
closed below $16 since January 2009. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s September $20 puts were the sixth-most-

37.11 yesterday. </p>
<p>More than 90,000 Morgan Stanley puts changed hands, 6.1
times the four-week average and 3.5 times the numbers of calls
to buy. Volume of the bearish options rose to its highest level
since April 2010. The October $16 puts were the most traded and
accounted for more than a third of all put volume. The
contracts, which expire Oct. 21, gained 65 percent to 33 cents

<p>Three companies are dropping European
Union antitrust complaints against International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) over its mainframe computers. </p>
<p>T3 Technologies Inc. and Neon Enterprise Software LLC have
or will withdraw separate complaints filed with the European
Commission, IBM said in a regulatory filing last month.
TurboHercules SAS has also withdrawn its complaint, said Carina
Oliveri, a spokeswoman for the company in Paris. </p>
<p>The European Commission declined to comment on the status
of its investigation into allegations IBM linked sales of its
mainframe computers to its software and that it discriminated
against competing sellers of services for the computers. </p>
<p>EU antitrust regulators often end investigations into
companies after complaints from rivals or customers are
withdrawn. The European Commission ended a four-year-old probe
into Qualcomm Inc. in 2009 after all complaints were withdrawn. </p>
<p>IBM, the biggest computer-services company, declined to
comment beyond its regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Austin, Texas-based Neon said in May that it settled its
legal dispute with IBM and would stop selling its zPrime
software and request customers to remove and destroy their
copies. Two calls and two e-mails to the company today weren''t
immediately answered. </p>
<p>Dropped Appeal </p>
<p>T3 withdrew its EU complaint in May after dropping an
appeal to a U.S. court ruling dismissing its claims against IBM,
according to IBM''s filing. T3 didn''t respond to a telephone
message and e-mail to its Tampa, Florida offices. </p>
<p>The European Commission opened two separate investigations
into Armonk, New York-based IBM last year over possible anti-
competitive behavior that may have blocked competition for rival
mainframe software and on maintenance contracts for the systems
by restricting or delaying access to spare parts. </p>
<p>While IBM has shifted its focus away from hardware toward
its more profitable software and services businesses, the
mainframe operations have high gross margins and helps pull in
revenue for other IBM divisions. IBM began developing mainframe
computers in the 1940s and 1950s and is now among the few
companies to offer the systems. </p>
<p>Reuters reported the IBM regulatory filing earlier today. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world''s fourth-
largest energy company, said its Nigerian Escravos gas-to-
liquids plant is more than 70 percent complete and on course to
start production in 2013. </p>
<p>The facility, which will refine natural gas to produce
33,000 barrels a day of fuels including diesel, is set to be
completed at the end of 2012, Andrew Fawthrop, chief executive
officer of the company''s Nigerian unit, said in an interview
yesterday in Abuja, the capital. </p>
<p>Chevron holds a 75 percent interest and will operate the
estimated $8.4 billion project jointly developed with the state-
owned Nigeria National Petroleum Corp., he said. </p>
<p>Nigeria, holder of Africa''s largest gas reserves of about
187 trillion cubic feet, burns off, or flares, most of the fuel
it produces along with oil because it lacks the infrastructure
to process it. At least $3 billion in revenue is lost annually
due to flaring, according to the Petroleum Ministry. The country
flared 15.2 billion cubic meters last year, according to the
World Bank''s Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership. </p>
<p>Chevron''s daily production in Nigeria averaged 524,000
barrels of crude, 206 million cubic feet (5.8 million cubic
meters) of natural gas and 5,000 barrels of liquefied petroleum
gas in 2010 as security improved in the oil-rich Niger River
delta, according to the company. </p>
<p>The company holds interests in 10 deepwater oil blocks in
Nigeria, including its 250,000 barrels per day Agbami field
located 70 miles (113 kilometers) off the country''s coast. A 10-
well development program within the next three years is expected
to boost output to offset declining production in the field. </p>
<p>We''re continuing the development of the Agbami field and
we''re looking for new opportunities in deepwater continuously,
Fawthrop said. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Europe''s
third-biggest insurer, may say second-quarter profit declined 24
percent on higher writedowns and taxes. </p>
<p>Net income will probably fall to 262 million euros ($372
million) from 346 million euros a year earlier, according to the
average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
estimates ranged from 81 million euros to 387 million euros. </p>
<p>Impairments on Greek bonds and higher taxes hurt
second-quarter results, Cristian Galizzi, an analyst at
Intermonte SIM SpA, who has an outperform recommendation on
the stock, wrote in a July 29 report. Results net of those
one-offs should remain operationally sound. </p>
<p>Generali said on July 5 that it will participate in a plan
to roll over part of its 3 billion euros of Greek debt, the most
held by any Italian financial institution. The insurer, led by
Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto, has net exposure,
which refers to bonds in its own portfolio, of 500 million
euros. </p>
<p>Generali''s quarterly earnings may also include about 80
million euros of writedowns of the stake held in Telco SpA, the
holding company that controls Telecom Italia SpA. </p>
<p>The insurer''s combined ratio, a measure of profitability,
may have improved to 97.1 percent in the first half from 98.8
percent a year earlier, the survey shows. Operating profit at
the Trieste, Italy-based insurer probably rose 2 percent to 1.03
billion euros in the quarter. </p>
<p>The insurer is scheduled to report earnings on Aug. 5 and
to hold a conference call at 4 p.m. the same day. Following is a
table of the analysts'' estimates and the year-earlier results
calculated by Bloomberg by subtracting published first-quarter
figures from the first-half results. The figures are in millions

<p>James Gorman, chief executive officer
of Morgan Stanley, purchased $2.06 million of stock in the firm
as the shares touched their lowest level since March 2009. </p>
<p>Gorman bought 100,000 shares today at a weighted average
price of $20.62, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. The stock tumbled $1.32 on the New York
Stock Exchange, or 6.3 percent, giving Gorman a $92,000 one-day
loss on the transaction. </p>
<p>The purchase, which was larger than his cash bonus for
2010, increased Gorman''s holdings to 955,370 shares, worth about
$18.8 million at today''s closing price of $19.70. It was
Gorman''s first outright purchase since he became CEO of the New
York-based firm at the start of 2010. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 28 percent this year, making its shares
worth 35 percent less than book value. The bank''s puts were the
most active in the U.S. equity-options market yesterday after an
investor bought a block of contracts with a strike price 25
percent below the previous day''s closing level. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley shares dropped to $19.70 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest level since
March 9, 2009. </p>
<p>Gorman said in May that the market was assuming worst-case
scenarios for financial companies, which may get a boost if a
notable value investor were to step in and take a large
position. Gorman said in an internal memo in December that the
stock, then trading at $26.86, was meaningfully undervalued. </p>
<p>Gorman''s Stake </p>
<p>Gorman''s net worth has dropped with Morgan Stanley''s plunge
this year as the firm tries to raise its market share in fixed-
income trading and increase profitability at the retail
brokerage. His shareholdings were worth about $26.2 million when
he received his annual stock award in January. That figure had
dropped to about $18 million yesterday. Gorman also holds more
than 800,000 options, all of which are more than 30 percent out
of the money. </p>
<p>The stock jumped 11 percent on July 21 after Morgan Stanley
reported a smaller loss than analysts estimated on higher
trading revenue. It has dropped 19 percent since then, as
financial companies in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index retreated
amid concern the U.S. recovery is weakening and the European
sovereign-debt crisis will spread. </p>
<p>A trader yesterday purchased 34,532 October puts to sell
Morgan Stanley shares at $16, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was the biggest trade in Morgan Stanley''s puts
since January 2010, according to Henry Schwartz, president of
Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based provider of options-market
data and analytics. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), seeking to
placate buyers and guard its reputation, is compensating
investors for losses they incurred after a $1.5 billion
commercial-mortgage bond deal was pulled last week. </p>
<p>The bank is paying clients that purchased the securities
and entered into contracts that protect against changes in
interest rates and prices for the debt, according to two people
familiar with the transaction who declined to be identified
because the talks are private. The investors will be paid for
contracts that lost money between when the deal was placed and
its withdrawal five days later. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Inc. (C) were forced to scuttle the
deal on July 28 after Standard  Poor''s withdrew its grades
because the rating company spotted an error in its process. The
banks already had to boost yields and restructure the
transaction, tied to loans on everything from shopping centers
to student housing, as investors pushed back on deal terms. </p>
<p>The bankers have enterprise value to protect, said
Richard Jones, a partner in the real estate group at law firm
Dechert LLP. Once something goes this fundamentally wrong, it
doesn''t matter who is responsible. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Mark Costiglio of Citigroup, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Losses were likely relatively small because markets
weren''t volatile between the time the deal priced and when SP
pulled its ratings, said Richard Parkus, a commercial-mortgage
debt analyst at Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>The issuers did the right thing by absorbing investors''
hedging losses, he said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reduced its
estimate for U.S. end-summer natural gas inventories by 1
percent after a heatwave, while forecasting prices will remain
under pressure as temperatures ease. </p>
<p>A surge in demand amid the hottest July in U.S. history
contributed to the bank revising its forecast for inventories at
the end of the Northern Hemisphere summer to 3,770 billion cubic
feet, down from an earlier outlook of 3,807, Johan Spetz and
Samantha Dart, London-based analysts at the bank, wrote in an
Aug. 3 report. </p>
<p>Incremental gas demand for power generation more than
doubled in July to 105 billion cubic feet from 43 billion in
June, according to the bank''s estimates. Temperatures surpassed
100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) in cities from New York to
Houston in June and July, diverting more gas to plants to
generate electricity for air conditioners. </p>
<p>Natural gas futures have dropped since the middle of July
after temperatures subsided and hydroelectricity generation
increased, reducing the need for the fuel, the report said.
Goldman said it sees a structural oversupply in the U.S. as
a result of shale production. </p>
<p>We expect the underlying balance to remain soft in coming
months, although less so as the transient effect of strong
hydro-generation subsides, the analysts wrote, saying they
maintained a moderately bearish outlook for prices. </p>
<p>The bank forecasts gas will average $4 per million British
thermal units for the third quarter and $4.25 per million Btu in
the October-to-December period. </p>
<p>Natural gas futures for delivery in September traded at
$4.09 per million Btu today on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped 10 percent since July 15. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, is studying whether its Lipitor cholesterol pill can
be sold as an over-the-counter medicine, according to a person
familiar with the discussions. </p>
<p>The company hasn''t determined whether the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration would allow the drug to be sold without a
prescription, the person said. Pfizer has assembled a team to
examine the feasibility of a switch to over-the-counter sales,
as well as other options for the medicine, said the person, who
asked not to be named because the deliberations are private. </p>
<p>Lipitor, the best-selling drug in the world with $10.7
billion in sales last year, loses U.S. patent exclusivity in
November. Previous attempts to sell over-the-counter versions of
cholesterol-lowering drugs, including Merck  Co.''s Mevacor and
Zocor, were unsuccessful because of the side effects. Patients
using Lipitor need regular tests of their cholesterol and liver
functioning, according to the drug''s label. </p>
<p>There is no reason to think that somehow where Mevacor
and Zocor failed, Lipitor would be successful, David Maris, an
analyst with CLSA in New York, said in an e-mail. This also
would not be a savings to consumers, just to insurance
companies, managed-care plans and the government, he said. </p>
<p>MacKay Jimeson, a spokesman for New York-based Pfizer,
declined to comment on the company''s plans to pursue an over-
the-counter version of Lipitor. </p>
<p>Strategic Plans'' </p>
<p>We can confirm that we have strategic plans in place for
Lipitor''s loss of exclusivity, Jimeson said. </p>
<p>Pfizer gained 13 cents to $17.49 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The drugmaker has gained 8
percent in the past 12 months. </p>
<p>In order to sell Lipitor without a prescription, Pfizer
must show that patients can safely diagnose themselves and use
the drug properly, said Shelly Burgess, a spokeswoman for the
FDA. No cholesterol-lowering drug, or statin, has been able to
do that, she said. </p>
<p>They would have to provide data to show that consumers
understand the treatment and recognize that cholesterol-
monitoring is required, Burgess said. In previous studies
most study participants made mistakes and chose to take the
proposed over-the-counter statin when they should not have done
that. </p>
<p>Drugs with U.S. sales of more than $1 billion a year
typically lose 73 percent of revenue in the first three months
after generic copies are introduced, according to an analysis by
Bloomberg Industries. Pfizer successfully took its allergy
medicine, Zyrtec, over-the-counter in 2008 before selling its
consumer unit that year to Johnson  Johnson for $16.6 billion. </p>
<p>Pfizer last month completed a review of four business units
for possible sale or divesture. The company decided to keep the
consumer unit that it gained in the 2009 acquisition of Wyeth
and its established products unit, which makes generic drugs and
branded versions of drugs with expired patents. The company said
it plans to sell its animal health and baby formula units. </p>

<p>Taubman bought 50,000 shares yesterday at a weighted-
average price of $20.3847, worth $1.02 million, according to a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today.
Porat purchased 25,000 shares at $20.50, worth $512,500,
according to a separate filing. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley rose 1.6 percent today, the second-largest
gain in the 81-company Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials Index,
after earlier touching the lowest price since March 2009. The
shares have fallen 26 percent this year. The bank''s puts were
the most active in the U.S. equity-options market on Aug. 3

price 25 percent below the previous day''s closing level. </p>
<p>Taubman, 50, who has worked at the New York-based firm for

at today''s closing price. Porat, 53, owns 695,667 shares, worth
$13.9 million. Board member Hutham Olayan purchased 5,000 shares
at $20, worth $100,000, according to a filing today. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley rose 32 cents to $20.02 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. It was the largest
increase in more than two weeks and made the firm one of only 10
companies in the SP 500 Financials Index (S5FINL) to climb. </p>
<p>Gorman''s Purchase </p>
<p>Gorman, 53, bought 100,000 shares yesterday at a weighted
average price of $20.62, according to a filing yesterday. The
purchase, which was larger than his cash bonus for 2010,
increased Gorman''s holdings to 955,370 shares, worth about $18.8
million at yesterday''s closing price. It was Gorman''s first
outright purchase since he became CEO last year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said today
it saw a one-in-three chance of a renewed recession in the U.S.
within the next nine months as it cut its growth forecast to 2
percent through the first quarter of 2012, chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients. </p>
<p>Goldman now sees growth averaging 1.7 percent this year,
from a prior 1.8 percent forecast, Hatzius said. The world''s
largest economy will expand 2.1 percent in 2012, down from a
previous estimate of 3 percent, he wrote. </p>
<p>The U.S. unemployment rate will rise to 9.25 percent by the
end of 2012, reflecting the weaker pace of growth, Hatzius said.
A worsening of the European debt crisis, failure to extend the
U.S. payroll-tax cut beyond 2011 and further increases in
unemployment were cited as key risks to the outlook. </p>
<p>Even our new forecast is subject to meaningful downside-
risk, Hatzius wrote. Increases in the U.S. unemployment rate
have historically had a tendency to feed on themselves, and this
could happen again. </p>
<p>Goldman expects the Federal Reserve will provide more
guidance about the future size of its balance sheet at next
week''s policy meeting, Hatzius wrote. Goldman anticipates no

<p>The unemployment rate fell to 9.1 percent in July from 9.2
percent in June, the Labor Department reported today. Payrolls
rose by a more-than-forecast 117,000 after a 46,000 increase in
June, the report said. </p>
<p>The economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second
quarter following revised growth of 0.4 percent in the first
three months of the year that was less than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department reported last week. Consumer
spending rose 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since the second
quarter of 2009, when the recent recession ended. </p>

<p>Days after the second-largest takeover this year, Medco

identified as Medco advisers. Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) worked with Express Scripts. </p>
<p>During the discussion between Goldman Sachs and Medco, a
Goldman Sachs banker reminded Medco of the firm''s past work for
the company and Medco''s role as a manager of pharmacy benefits
for some Goldman employees, the people said. Medco considered
the discussion of its business relationships as pressure to put
Goldman Sachs on the deal and was concerned the bank would yank
the benefits contract if it weren''t credited, the people said. </p>
<p>People close to Goldman Sachs said the banker was
highlighting its relationship with Medco, and the firm deserved
recognition for previous work related to the transaction. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), sued for
$8.6 billion by bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), said the
defunct firm''s common-law claims against it must be decided by a
U.S. district court judge rather than a bankruptcy judge. </p>
<p>In a court filing yesterday in Manhattan, the New York-
based bank said the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Anna Nicole
Smith case limited the power of bankruptcy judges to rule on
such claims. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, has been fighting
Lehman''s suit in bankruptcy court, fending off demands for the
return of $8.6 billion in collateral, plus tens of billions
in damages for allegedly accelerating the former investment
bank''s demise. After the ruling in the Smith case, a district
judge must determine damage claims brought under New York state
law, JPMorgan said in the filing. </p>
<p>Those claims, through which plaintiffs seek to augment
the estate by recovering damages for JPMorgan''s alleged
misconduct in precipitating LBHI''s bankruptcy filing, are
legally indistinguishable from the state-law tortuous
interference counterclaim in Stern, the bank said, referring
to the Supreme Court case known as Stern v. Marshall. </p>
<p>Recent rulings by higher courts have left bankruptcy cases
in disarray. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff threw out demands by
the liquidator of Bernard Madoff''s firm for billions of dollars
in damages from London-based HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) The Supreme
Court''s June decision limited bankruptcy courts'' ability to rule
on state-law claims as well as ending any chance for heirs of
Smith, a former Playboy model, to collect a $449 million
judgment against the estate of J. Howard Marshall, the Texas
billionaire to whom she had been married. </p>
<p>Collateral Demand </p>
<p>According to JPMorgan, Lehman''s demand for return of the
collateral can''t be decided by a bankruptcy judge either. Those
claims were made to pad out bankrupt Lehman''s estate, and fall
outside the claims-allowance process that is the business of a
bankruptcy court, it said. </p>
<p>Lehman disagreed about the impact of Stern v. Marshall. </p>
<p>The Stern court left untouched the bankruptcy courts''
authority to enter final judgments on common-law claims that
stem from the bankruptcy, it said in a filing. </p>
<p>Lehman claimed in the lawsuit filed last year that JPMorgan
demanded loan guarantees that fatally weakened the firm.
JPMorgan, which lent about $70 billion to Lehman''s brokerage
around the time of the September 2008 bankruptcy, responded by
suing Lehman, alleging it defrauded its lender into making the
loan. </p>
<p>The Lehman suit is: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Mexican traders are postponing bets
for interest-rate increases to August after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Bank of America Corp. lowered the country''s growth
forecast amid concern the U.S. may relapse into recession. </p>
<p>Yields on futures for the 28-day interbank due in August,
known as TIIE, sank 15 basis points in the past week to a record
low 5.02 percent. The contracts indicate traders expect Banco de
Mexico to leave its key rate unchanged at 4.5 percent until that
month. They have delayed their estimates for a rate boost 14
times this year. In Brazil, traders are pricing in the
possibility the central bank may lower borrowing costs by
December after betting on an increase three weeks ago. </p>
<p>Mexico''s growth prospects are dimming after the economy in
the U.S., the Latin American country''s biggest trade partner,
grew less than forecast in the second quarter. Mexico is more
likely to cut interest rates than raise them next year, Goldman
Sachs economist Alberto Ramos wrote in a research note. Mexico
is the only major Latin American country to keep its key rate
unchanged in the past year as inflation holds near a five-year
low. </p>
<p>With the data where they are and inflation so benign,
some are betting there could be an even longer pause, Gabriel Casillas, chief Mexico economist at JPMorgan Chase  Co. in
Mexico City, said in a telephone interview. We expected a long
pause. </p>
<p>The yield on Mexico''s benchmark peso bonds due in 2024 fell
56 basis points, or 0.56 percentage point, in the past month to
6.5 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In Brazil,
yields on similar-maturity government debt fell 13 basis points,
or 0.13 percentage point, in the past five sessions while those
on Colombian debt fell eight basis points. </p>
<p>Highly Dependent'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs on Aug. 5 reduced its Mexican growth forecast
for this year to 4.1 percent from 4.4 percent and its estimate
for 2012 to 3.9 percent from 4.5 percent, citing weakening
demand from the U.S. A day earlier, Bank of America cut its 2012
growth projection to 4 percent from 4.5 percent, while leaving
its forecast for this year at 4 percent. </p>
<p>Given the logistical proximity to the U.S., Mexico will
always be an economy that is highly dependent on the U.S.,
Goldman Sachs''s Ramos said in a telephone interview. There is
not much they can do. When the U.S. is doing well, they benefit
handsomely. When the U.S. is not doing so well, they are more
exposed than other economies. </p>
<p>Remain Cautious'' </p>
<p>The U.S. economy, the destination for 80 percent of Mexican
exports, grew at a less-than-forecast 1.3 percent pace in the
second quarter following revised growth of 0.4 percent in the
first three months of the year that was less than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department said July 29. U.S. consumer
spending grew 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since the second
quarter of 2009, the final months of the recession. </p>
<p>Press officials at Mexico''s central bank didn''t return
telephone calls seeking comment. </p>
<p>The Finance Ministry maintained its forecast of 4.3 percent
growth this year and 4.2 percent in 2012, Miguel Messmacher,
chief economist, said in an Aug. 5 phone interview. </p>
<p>The different indicators of economic activity aren''t for
the moment sounding any alarms, even though we have to remain
cautious, Messmacher said from Mexico City. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to hold Mexican government
dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose 19 basis points to
160 at 6:01 p.m. New York time, according to JPMorgan Chase 
Co. </p>
<p>The peso weakened 2.7 percent to 12.3253 per U.S. dollar.
It''s up 0.1 percent this year. </p>
<p>Default Swaps </p>
<p>The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
five years rose 24 basis points to 152, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities or the cash equivalent if a government
or company fails to adhere to its debt agreements. </p>
<p>Mexico''s economy will weather the slump in the U.S. and
grow 4.8 percent this year, said Sergio Luna, head of economic
research at Citigroup Inc. in Mexico City. Central bank Governor
Agustin Carstens will raise the benchmark rate from 4.5 percent
in January, Luna said. </p>
<p>The market reaction has been disproportionate to the data
in the U.S., Luna said in a telephone interview. We don''t
see a deterioration in the data that indicates any more
difficulty for the U.S. markets. The data in Mexico has also
been much better than that in the U.S. </p>
<p>Rate Outlook </p>
<p>Economists expect Banxico, as Mexico''s central bank is
known, to stay on hold until May, according to the median
forecast of 21 economists in a survey distributed Aug. 4 by
Citigroup Inc.''s Banamex unit. </p>
<p>Inflation slowed in Mexico to 3.28 percent in June from
3.69 percent a year earlier. It touched a five-year low of 3.04
percent in March. </p>
<p>The Mexican economy is still struggling to rebound from its
2009 recession, Goldman Sachs''s Ramos said. Mexico''s economy
shrank 6.1 percent that year, the worst since 1995. </p>
<p>The recovery from the brutal 2009 recession has been very
moderate, Ramos said. Things never accelerated to gain a lot
of momentum. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest publicly traded oil company, said it''s trying to sell
its interests in some Indonesian natural-gas operations that are
part of an ongoing lawsuit. </p>
<p>The properties include the Arun field and satellite fields,
and the North Sumatra Offshore field, David Eglinton, a
spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said in an e-
mailed statement today. The assets had annual average net
production of 215 million cubic feet a day of gas last year, as
well as some liquids, Eglinton said. </p>
<p>In July, a U.S. appeals court reinstated a lawsuit thrown
out by a lower court, ruling that Exxon must face allegations
that it aided and abetted murder, torture and sexual assault by
its security forces in Indonesia''s Aceh province. At the time,
Exxon said it has fought these baseless claims for many
years. Today, the company asked the full appeals court to
review the three-judge panel''s decision. </p>
<p>The attempt to sell assets in Indonesia is consistent with
the company''s long-standing practice of continually reviewing
assets for their contribution to Exxon Mobil''s operating and
financial objectives, as well as their potential value to
others, Eglinton said in the statement today. </p>
<p>The asset sale has nothing to do with the Aceh lawsuit,
he said. Eglinton said the sales process doesn''t involve other
Exxon projects in Indonesia. Exxon and predecessor companies
have operated in Indonesia for more than 100 years and will
retain an active presence in the country, he said. </p>

<p>General Maritime Corp. (GMR) led declines
by oil-tanker stocks in New York as the threat of a second U.S.
recession in three years increased the risk that energy imports
into the world''s largest economy may fall. </p>
<p>General Maritime fell 29 cents, or 39 percent, to 45 cents
in New York Stock Exchange trading. The six-member Bloomberg
Tanker Index (TANKER) dropped 11 percent, the most since March 5, 2009,
to the lowest level since May 9, 2003. </p>
<p>The stock market is discounting problems ahead, Andreas Vergottis, research director at Tufton Oceanic Ltd., manager of
the world''s biggest shipping hedge fund, said by phone. It
will be very bad for tankers. </p>
<p>The U.S. economy is heading into a double-dip
recession, Nouriel Roubini, the co-founder and chairman of New
York-based Roubini Global Economics LLC, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television. </p>
<p>Tanker shares retreated as equities slumped globally. The
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index dropped 6.7 percent to 1,119.46, the
lowest level since September. The MSCI World (MXWO) Index slid 5.1
percent, extending its drop from this year''s high to 19 percent. </p>
<p>A return to recession in the U.S. would delay any rebound
in charter rates for tankers until after 2013, said Jonathan Chappell, an analyst at Evercore Partners Inc. in New York. Hire
costs for very large crude carriers, each able to haul 2 million
barrels of oil, are at the lowest level in 10 years, according
to the analyst. </p>
<p>34% Decline </p>
<p>What this could do is delay the recovery out further,
Chappell said. </p>
<p>Hire costs on the industry''s benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-
Japan route fell 1.7 percent to 46.09 industry-standard
Worldscale points today, according to the Baltic Exchange in
London. The decline was the 12th in a row. Rental rates are down
34 percent this year. </p>
<p>Seaborne shipments of oil into the U.S. were forecast to
reach 6.9 million barrels a day, or 17 percent of all crude
shipped this year, an 11-year low, according to Clarkson
Research Services Ltd., a unit of the world''s largest
shipbroker. The country is the world''s biggest oil importer. </p>
<p>Owners are facing a glut of ships after ordering the most
in almost three decades in 2007 and 2008 before the world
economy entered its worst recession since World War II. Supply
and demand in the tanker market probably would only return to
balance later than 2013 if demand were to weaken further,
Chappell said. </p>
<p>Negative Rates </p>
<p>Average quarterly rates for VLCCs carrying crude to the
U.S. from the Middle East have been unprofitable since October,
according to data from the exchange. It assesses freight costs
on more than 50 international maritime routes. </p>
<p>Unprofitable, or negative, rates mean tanker owners
effectively are paying some of charterers'' costs because agreed
daily hire rates fail to cover all fuel and operating expenses
for a journey. </p>
<p>Tankers will ship an estimated 40.9 million barrels of
crude oil, Clarkson said. </p>
<p>Trade will slow down, and I wouldn''t be surprised if we
see negative growth, Tufton''s Vergottis said. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CVX) and
other energy companies fell the most in more than two years on
concern that a cut in the U.S. debt rating signals lower crude
oil prices, investors and analysts said. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas, dropped $4.63, or 6.2
percent, to $70.19 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, wiping out its gain this year. Chevron, based
in San Ramon, California, fell $7.36, or 7.5 percent, to $90.25.
The one-day declines were the steepest since Dec. 1, 2008. </p>
<p>The downgrade of U.S. debt by Standard  Poor''s Aug. 5
crystallized recession concerns based on rising U.S. and
European debt and a U.S. government report last week that those
out of work 27 weeks or more comprise 50 percent of the
unemployed, said James Glickenhaus, who manages about $2 billion
at Glickenhaus  Co. in New York. </p>
<p>People are calling up mutual funds, saying, Get me out
of stocks,'' Glickenhaus, said today in an interview. </p>
<p>Widely owned and easily traded stocks like Exxon are part
of the general selloff, he said. </p>
<p>This is contagion, Donald Coxe, who manages $500
million at Coxe Advisors in Chicago, said in an interview.
Gold is going up because of fear the financial system is going
to implode. </p>
<p>Oil Falls </p>
<p>Gold rose $61.40 to a record $1,713.20 an ounce, up 3.7
percent at today''s close in New York. Crude oil for September
delivery fell $5.57, or 6.4 percent, to $81.31, on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the lowest price since Nov. 23. </p>
<p>The SP downgrade confirmed everybody''s fear, Fadel Gheit, a New York-based energy analyst for Oppenheimer  Co.
said today in a telephone interview. Less confidence in the
U.S. economy alone will bring the outlook for consumption lower.
We''ll use less oil. </p>
<p>Quicksilver Resources Inc. (KWK), based in Fort Worth, Texas,
fell $2.65, or 23 percent, to $9.10, the lowest price in more
than two years. The oil and natural-gas producer said it will

quarter production target. </p>
<p>Every company that''s had the big increase in capital
spending has generally taken it on the chin, said David M. Heikkinen, an analyst at Tudor, Pickering, Holt  Co. in Houston
who rates Quicksilver accumulate and owns none. </p>
<p>Lowering U.S. credit one level to AA+ won''t hurt Exxon

<p>(Corrects currency from euros to dollars in ninth paragraph
of story that ran Aug. 5.) </p>
<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Europe''s
third-biggest insurer, said second-quarter profit fell 45
percent, hurt by writedowns of Greek bonds and its stake in
Telco SpA. </p>
<p>Net income declined to 190 million euros ($269 million)
from 346 million euros a year earlier, missing the 261 million-
euro estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The second-
quarter figures were calculated by Bloomberg by subtracting
first-quarter numbers from the first-half results. </p>
<p>We are confident that we will reach our full-year target
of an operating result of between 4 billion euros and 4.7
billion euros, Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto
said in a statement today. </p>
<p>Generali joined insurer Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI) and
Italian banks in writing down Greek debt after signing the
Institute of International Finance''s rescue plan last month. The
company wrote down 140 million euros of its 500 million-euro net
exposure, which represents Greek bonds in its own portfolio. </p>
<p>The company wrote down bonds expiring by 2020, which
account for 70 percent of its holdings. Quarterly earnings at
the Trieste, Italy-based insurer were also hurt by a 143
million-euro writedown of the stake held in Telco, the holding
company that controls Telecom Italia SpA (TIT), as well as the
increase of an Italian regional tax, known as IRAP. </p>
<p>Operating Margins </p>
<p>Generali expects higher operating margins both in the life
and non-life segments this year. We continue our strategy of
expansion in markets with high growth potential and our focus on
efficiency improvements in the core European countries, the
CEO said. </p>
<p>Quarterly operating profit rose 20 percent to 1.15 billion
euros on growth of its non-life business. The insurer''s non-life
premiums climbed 2 percent to 5.2 billion euros, while the
combined ratio, a measure of profitability, improved to 96.5
percent in the first half from 98.8 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>Operating results beat expectations, Werner Eisenmann,
an analyst at DZ Bank AG, wrote in a note to clients. New
business in life was still sluggish, he said. </p>
<p>The insurer, which gets about 13 percent of its operating
income in central and eastern Europe, is in talks with VTB Group
to form a joint venture to sell its products in Russia,
Perissinotto said in May. Generali expects to increase assets
under management in Asia and eastern Europe to $30 billion by
2015. </p>
<p>Generali fell 3.3 percent to 11.6 euros in Milan, giving
the company a market value of 18 billion euros. The Bloomberg
Europe 500 Insurance Index, which was down 3 percent today, has
dropped 24 percent in the past six months, compared with
Generali''s 31 percent decline. </p>
<p>Europe at Risk </p>
<p>The euro region is at serious risk of breaking up,
Perissinotto said. Europe faces a serious risk of breaking up
into its constituent parts and finding itself and its various
member states impoverished, he said. Unfortunately we have
not seen yet a coordinated response and I urge our central
authorities, such as the ECB, to act in a decisive way. </p>
<p>Generali cut its exposure to corporate bonds and Italy''s
financial industry in the first half, while it boosted the
weight of Italian government bonds from 49 billion euros at the
end of March to 51 billion euros. </p>
<p>The CEO also said that the company aims to grow internally
because it''s no time for acquisitions. </p>

to 1.09 billion pounds. Pretax profit dropped 9 percent to 16.7
million pounds as challenging market conditions affected
margins. </p>
<p>Morgan Sindall bought Connaught''s maintenance business out
of administration last year, helping to boost revenue for its
affordable housing unit 32 percent to 228 million pounds. The
company also reduced the effect of government spending cuts by
reducing its share of public-sector work, which now accounts for
50 percent of business, compared with 60 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>In February, Chairman John Morgan said the company expected
the private sector to pick up some of the slack from
spending cuts. </p>
<p>In the last few downturns we''ve increased our market
share and we expect to do the same this time, Morgan said in a
phone interview today. Our biggest challenge at the moment is
how do we make the most of this so that we can look back in four
years time and say we had a good recession. Margins are very
tough but we''re in a strong place </p>
<p>Morgan Sindall shares slipped 0.9 percent to 612 pence as
of 11:34 a.m. in London. The stock has dropped 13 percent this
year, giving the company a market value of 264.3 million pounds. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world''s biggest
theme-park operator, posted third-quarter sales and profit that
beat analysts'' estimates as pay-TV fees to the ESPN sports
network countered flat cable advertising sales. </p>
<p>Net income rose 11 percent to $1.48 billion, or 77 cents a
share, from $1.33 billion, or 67 cents, a year ago, Burbank,
California-based Disney said today in a statement. Profit
excluding some items was 78 cents, beating the 73-cent average
of 22 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Cable-network profit rose 10 percent, with ESPN enjoying
gains in fees from pay-TV systems. Theme-park profit advanced
8.8 percent, fueled by higher admission prices at U.S. resorts
and this year''s later Easter break. The consumer products unit
boosted profit with sales of Cars and Marvel merchandise. </p>
<p>This is a little better than expected, but there was
really nothing that''s remarkable in these numbers, said
Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities in
Denver who recommends the stock. The affiliate fees at ESPN
were a little unexpected, and the parks were able to take
advantage of the Easter holiday. </p>
<p>Disney may consider new discounts at its domestic theme
parks if the economy weakens, Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said on a conference call with analysts, adding We''re not
thinking of doing that any time soon. </p>
<p>Attendance at Disney''s domestic theme parks increased by 2
percent, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on the call,
and per-capita spending by 8 percent. </p>
<p>Seeking Acquisitions </p>
<p>Disney will continue to make acquisitions, Iger said,
without identifying potential targets. Since becoming CEO in
2005, the company has acquired Pixar and Marvel. Last month,
Disney offered to buy the 49.6 percent of India''s UTV Software
Communications Ltd., a production company, it doesn''t own for
$454 million. </p>
<p>We''re going to continue to deploy capital in this
direction, Iger said. He estimated that the $13 billion Disney
has spent to acquire companies in the last five years
represented about $23 billion in enterprise value. </p>
<p>Disney fell 45 cents to $34.25 in extended trading. The
shares gained $1.67, or 5.1 percent, to $34.70 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading and have declined 7.5
percent this year. </p>
<p>Sales in the period ended July 2 gained 6.7 percent to
$10.7 billion, exceeding analysts'' projections of $10.5 billion. </p>
<p>Cable Revenue </p>
<p>Cable revenue advanced 7.2 percent to $3.52 billion, with
fees from pay-TV systems countering ad sales at ESPN that were
little changed, the company said. </p>
<p>ABC''s profit rose 20 percent to $250 million, benefiting
from lower production costs and higher network advertising.
Total revenue from broadcasting decreased 1 percent to $1.43
billion, reflecting lower ad sales at local television stations,
Disney said. </p>
<p>Profit at Disney''s consumer products division increased 32
percent to $155 million, buoyed by merchandise from the Cars
animated movies and the Marvel character line. Revenue rose 13
percent to $685 million. </p>
<p>Revenue at Disney''s parks division increased 12 percent to
$3.17 billion. </p>

<p>The cost to protect against a default
by U.S. banks plunged after soaring yesterday by the most in
almost three years, as the Federal Reserve vowed to keep
interest rates near zero through mid-2013. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan
Stanley (MS), which decline as investor confidence improves, dropped
by the most since at least May 2010, according to data provider
CMA. A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk also fell by the most
since that month. </p>
<p>Traders pushed the cost of protecting corporate and
financial debt lower after the Fed discussed a range of policy
tools to bolster the economy. Investor confidence in bank and
corporate creditworthiness improved after deteriorating
yesterday at the fastest pace in a year following Standard 
Poor''s cut of the U.S. government''s credit rating on Aug. 5. </p>
<p>While we appreciate the uncertainty regarding the
economy, confidence, mortgage putbacks and Europe contagion, we
firmly believe that yesterday was way overdone in the credit
markets, Jonathan Hatcher, a credit strategist at Jefferies
Group Inc. in New York, wrote in a note to clients. U.S.
financial companies today have better balance sheets and
stronger capital and are no longer reliant on overnight
liquidity, he said. </p>
<p>Swaps on New York-based JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, declined 19 basis points to 116 basis points,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. </p>
<p>Citigroup, Goldman </p>
<p>Contracts linked to Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) each decreased 25 to 185. Swaps tied to Morgan Stanley debt
dropped 30 to 250 and those on Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) declined 20 to
115, the data show. Contracts on Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the
largest U.S. bank by assets, fell 17 to 278, the data show. </p>
<p>The average credit swap price on the six biggest U.S. banks
fell 23 to 188 after jumping 51 yesterday to 211, the largest
gain since September 2008 when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
filed for bankruptcy and caused credit markets to seize up. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
fell 7.6 basis points to a mid-price of 107.5 as of 5:30 p.m. in
New York, according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. </p>
<p>The index of default swaps climbed 12.1 basis points
yesterday to reach 115.1 points, the highest level since July 7,
2010, Markit data show. </p>

<p>The Manhattan Chamber of Commerce''s
chairman illegally transferred more than $2.5 million to his own
accounts while running the Albert Ellis Institute, the nonprofit
said in a lawsuit claiming JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) let it happen. </p>
<p>Jeffrey Bernstein, the former president of Albert Ellis''
board of trustees, secretly and without authority or the
knowledge of its other trustees moved institute funds into
personal bank accounts he owns or controls, the organization
said in the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Bernstein was first elected to the institute''s board of
trustees in March 2006 and was chosen as president of the board
in July 2006, the institute said in the lawsuit. He was named
acting director of administration in January 2010 and appointed
to the permanent post the following month. Bernstein resigned
from all offices he held at the institute after the fraud was
discovered in February 2011, lawyers for the group said in the
complaint, which was filed today in federal court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has been provided with a list of 65 unauthorized
transactions by Bernstein and has refused to restore the funds
to the institute''s account, lawyers for the institute said in
the lawsuit, which seeks more than $2.3 million in damages. </p>
<p>U.S. Investigation </p>
<p>The institute contacted Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance''s office about the alleged fraud, and the U.S. Attorney''s
Office in Manhattan is investigating, David Blasband, an
attorney representing the institute, said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Vance''s office, declined to
comment on whether the district attorney is investigating. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, didn''t
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. Patrick J. Smith, an
attorney representing Bernstein, didn''t return a telephone
message left at his office seeking comment on the complaint.
Bernstein isn''t named as a defendant in the suit. </p>
<p>The institute, located on East 65th Street in Manhattan, is
a not-for-profit psychotherapy organization founded in 1959 by
its late namesake, Dr. Albert Ellis. It is committed to
alleviating emotional disturbances and enhancing emotional well-
being through the study, teaching and application of rational
emotive and cognitive behavioral therapy, according to the
lawsuit. </p>
<p>Chart Our Course'' </p>
<p>The Manhattan Chamber of Commerce has no information about
the matter, President Nancy Ploeger said in an e-mailed
statement. Bernstein has resigned as the chamber''s chairman
effective immediately, and the organization''s board will meet as
soon as possible to chart our course going forward, Ploeger
said in the statement. </p>
<p>Bernstein serves as chairman of the New York-based
Archstone Group, a corporate management consulting group, and
was the founder of TruFoods Systems Inc., a company that
operated more than 100 restaurants until 2007 when it was sold
to Trufoods LLC, according to a biography posted on the
Manhattan Chamber of Commerce''s website. </p>
<p>TruFoods began in 1998 when Bernstein acquired Pudgie''s
Famous Chicken at a bankruptcy court auction, according to the
biography. Digital Creative Development Corp. (DCDC), which operated
the Arthur Treacher''s Fish  Chips chain, bought Pudgie''s in
October 2000 and named Bernstein chief executive officer of the
combined company. </p>
<p>Stalking Horse Bidder </p>
<p>Digital Creative sold its interest in the combined company
to an affiliate of Bernstein''s in March 2002. TruFoods also
participated as a stalking horse bidder in bankruptcy
transactions, according to Bernstein''s biography. </p>
<p>Bernstein previously served as president and CEO of
Consolidated Services Inc., a management consulting firm that
was retained by debtors, creditor committees and secured lenders
in more than 100 Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases, according to the
biography. Bernstein has also served as chief restructuring
officer and an examiner in several Chapter 11 cases, the
biography says. </p>
<p>Bernstein told the institute shortly after he was appointed
director of administration that an operating account it had
maintained at JPMorgan had been closed, the institute said in
the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The institute discovered in February that the account
hadn''t been closed and started an investigation that revealed
that the funds in question had been used by Bernstein for his
personal benefit, the institute claims in the complaint. </p>
<p>When questioned about the allegedly closed Chase Bank
account, Bernstein refused to provide any information, failed to
explain his actions or account for the monies misappropriated
from the institute, lawyers for the institute said in the
lawsuit. However, as noted, Bernstein resigned all offices he
held at the institute. Bernstein''s fraud was immediately
reported to law enforcement authorities. </p>
<p>The case is Albert Ellis Institute v. JP Morgan Chase Bank
NA, 11-cv-5504, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, was sued over its sale of mortgage-
linked securities to now-failed credit unions hours after it
disclosed a list of other potential complaints. </p>
<p>The National Credit Union Administration filed a lawsuit in
California today and said it''s seeking more than $491 million of
damages from Goldman Sachs. American International Group Inc. (AIG),
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are among firms that have also
threatened to take legal action against the bank over mortgage-
related securities, Goldman Sachs said in a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>The bank was already facing active mortgage-linked lawsuits
from companies and investors that the firm estimated had
experienced cumulative losses of $485 million as of June 30. The
new potential claims aren''t included in that estimate or in the
firm''s $2 billion estimate of reasonably possible losses
from legal cases. </p>
<p>The list of entities, which also includes the Federal
Housing Finance Agency and insurance companies Allstate Corp. (ALL)
and John Hancock, threatened to assert claims against the firm
in connection with various mortgage-related offerings, New
York-based Goldman Sachs said in the quarterly filing. The
company has reached agreements with some of the entities to toll
the relevant statute of limitations. </p>
<p>Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. The stock rose $5.07, or 4.3 percent, to
$122.73 in New York Stock Exchange Composite trading after
falling as low as $111.60 earlier in the session. Goldman Sachs
is down 27 percent so far this year. </p>
<p>Lawsuit Targeting JPMorgan </p>
<p>The NCUA''s suit against Goldman Sachs, which relates to the
collapse of U.S. Central and Western Corporate federal credit
unions, follows a complaint against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and two
against Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. (RBS) </p>
<p>Those who caused the problems in the wholesale credit
unions should pay for the losses now being paid by retail credit
unions, NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz said in a statement. </p>
<p>AIG, the insurer rescued by U.S. bailouts during the 2008
financial crisis, yesterday sued Bank of America Corp. (BAC) In that
case, AIG claimed that Bank of America caused more than $10
billion in losses at AIG, which specialized in investments and
insurance tied to mortgage bonds. Bank of America rejected the
assertions of New York-based AIG. </p>
<p>Possible Losses </p>
<p>Mark Herr, a spokesman for AIG, declined to comment on the
company''s potential suit against Goldman Sachs, as did Maryellen Thielen, a spokeswoman for Allstate. Laurie Lupton, a
spokeswoman for Toronto-based Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC), which
owns John Hancock, had no immediate comment. </p>
<p>Spokespeople for the FHFA and Freddie Mac also declined to
comment, while Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae,
didn''t immediately return a call seeking comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs reduced its estimate of reasonably
possible losses from lawsuits to $2 billion as of June 30 from
$2.7 billion on March 31, according to the quarterly filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the SEC told corporate finance chiefs in October that they
should disclose such costs when there is at least a reasonable
possibility that they may be incurred, even if the risk is too
low to require reserves. </p>
<p>The estimate, the third of its kind made by Goldman Sachs,
is the upper end of losses in matters where the risk is
more than remote but less than likely, the New York-based
firm said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-

employees are the target of a criminal complaint in South Korea
related to sales of collateralized debt obligations. </p>
<p>Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. filed a criminal complaint
against certain past and present employees of the firm in South
Korea relating to its purchase of a CDO securitization from
Goldman Sachs, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today. </p>

<p>The Korean companies have seen losses from purchasing
collateralized debt obligations in 2007 from Goldman Sachs, Lee
said, without elaborating. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs confirmed the complaint for the first time
publicly in today''s quarterly submission to the SEC. </p>
<p>The complaint does not represent any judgment by a
governmental entity, but starts a process whereby the prosecutor
investigates the complaint and determines whether to take
action, Goldman Sachs said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank that makes more than half its revenue from trading, lost
money in that business on 15 days during the second quarter, the
most daily losses since the fourth quarter of 2008. </p>
<p>The firm''s traders lost more than $100 million on one of

<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, last

<p>A former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) manager
fired for allegedly kissing a colleague at a conference, and
then lying about the incident, sued the company in a London
court. </p>
<p>Simon Negus, a partner and general manager at Microsoft''s
U.K. unit until he was dismissed in September, filed the lawsuit
on Aug. 3. The complaint followed one made by Microsoft in April
against Negus, now chief operating officer of Upstream Systems,
seeking to reclaim holiday pay and part of his signing on bonus. </p>
<p>The dispute relates to an incident at Microsoft''s annual
conference in Atlanta in July 2009. Negus, a U.K. board member,
may have been seen kissing a female colleague in full view of
other attendees, Microsoft said in a court filing. </p>
<p>Negus denied the kissing incident had taken place and
when further information came out suggesting it had, he was
dismissed for dishonesty, the Redmond, Washington-based company
said in its claim. </p>
<p>Negus didn''t respond to calls and e-mails for comment. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s disciplinary panel found Negus had behaved
dishonestly, and thereby acted in a manner calculated or likely
to destroy trust and confidence between him and Microsoft,
according to court documents. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman at Edelman, a public relations firm employed
by Microsoft, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Microsoft is seeking the return of 75,000 pounds
($122,600), part of a signing bonus paid to Negus when he joined
from Dell Inc. in 2008 that required him to remain at Microsoft
for three years. The company is also claiming 2,563 pounds of
holiday pay. </p>
<p>Negus joined Upstream, a mobile-marketing technology
company, on July 20. In a press release issued at the time,
Upstream said Negus led Microsoft''s U.K. Enterprise and Partner
Group, and the U.K. unit had won Microsoft Subsidiary of the
Year'' in 2010. </p>
<p>The cases are: Simon Negus v. Microsoft Limited,

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world''s largest
theme-park company, fell the most since 2008 on concern that
slowing consumer spending and rising costs at the ESPN sports
network may crimp profit growth. </p>
<p>Among the largest media companies, including Time Warner
Inc. (TWX), News Corp. and Viacom Inc., Disney is the most exposed to
consumer spending through its theme parks, as well as broadcast
and cable-TV units, said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg
Industries. Increasing costs to broadcast sports on ESPN and a
declining DVD market may also hurt earnings, according to
Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities. </p>
<p>Certainly there are cost pressures at ESPN and at the
parks, but they were a little worse than I would have thought,
said Harrigan, who cut his rating on the shares to hold from
buy after the company reported quarterly earnings. </p>
<p>The stock dropped 9.1 percent to $31.54 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the most since Dec. 1,
2008. With today''s decline, the shares have fallen 16 percent
this year. </p>
<p>Net income rose 11 percent to $1.48 billion in the fiscal
third quarter ended July 2, the Burbank, California-based
company said in a statement yesterday after the markets closed. </p>
<p>ESPN Affiliate Fee </p>
<p>While earnings of 78 cents beat the 73-cent average of
analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg, they included 6 cents
in deferred ESPN affiliate revenue that analysts expected in the
fourth quarter. Without that fee, earnings would have fallen
short, Harrigan said. </p>
<p>U.S. personal spending fell 0.2 percent in June, the fourth
consecutive monthly decline. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke vowed yesterday to keep borrowing costs at an all-time
low to revive an economic recovery that''s considerably
slower than expected. </p>
<p>Higher costs at ESPN and lower syndication sales at the ABC
broadcasting network will lower this quarter''s earnings by 7
cents a share, Chief Financial Officer James Rasulo said
yesterday on the conference call. The ESPN expenses are
associated with new contracts to broadcast college sports, Major
League Baseball, and the National Football League, he said. </p>
<p>Earnings upside was less than met the eye, Barton Crockett, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets in New York, said
in a note to investors. The fiscal fourth-quarter oulook is
muddied, said the analyst, who rates the stock neutral. </p>
<p>Studio Costs </p>
<p>Studio entertainment operating income fell 60 percent to
$49 million in the quarter. While Pirates of the Caribbean: On
Stranger Tides earned more than $1 billion at the box office
worldwide, increased revenue was largely offset by higher
marketing and distribution costs, said Rasulo, the financial
chief. </p>
<p>The costs just need to be trimmed, said Harrigan, the
Wunderlich analyst. </p>
<p>Time Warner last week reported a 14 percent increase in
second-quarter net income as revenue from its cable-TV, movie
and magazine businesses rose. </p>
<p>News Corp. (NWSA) reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of 35
cents, excluding some items, beating the average estimate of

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read said his company, the world''s biggest drugmaker, will
fight attempts to cut Medicare payments for medicines after the
industry helped underwrite the U.S. health-care overhaul. </p>
<p>Drug companies contributed $112 billion in discounts and
refunds to last year''s health-care law, helping Democrats make
up for new spending in the bill. U.S. drugmakers led by Pfizer
and Merck  Co. (MRK) are concerned they will be asked to give more in
the debt-limit deal President Barack Obama signed Aug. 2 that
requires further negotiated cuts in government expenditures. </p>
<p>We made a contribution to the Affordable Care Act that
was substantial and fundamental, New York-based Pfizer''s Read
said in a telephone interview. We are only 10 percent of the
health-care spend in the United States, and we are the most
efficient part of that. </p>
<p>Squeezing drug savings from Medicare, the U.S. health
program for the elderly and disabled, may cost makers $20
billion and eliminate 260,000 jobs, according to the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America in
Washington. Obama endorses a proposal to discount drugs for
Medicare patients who also qualify for Medicaid, the federal-
state health program for the poor. </p>

<p> Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world''s
largest theme-park company, is seeking acquisitions, a year and
a half after completing its $4.2 billion takeover of Marvel
Entertainment''s cast of film and comic-book characters. </p>
<p>We don''t have what I''d call a strategic hole, Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger said yesterday on a conference
call after the company''s third-quarter earnings release. But
we''ve looked expansively at opportunities across the world to
buy either new characters or businesses that are capable of
creating great characters and great stories. </p>
<p>Iger didn''t specify any targets. He cited international as
an area of interest, and India as another example of a high-
growth market. We think investing in it, at least in today''s
world, is a smart move, Iger said. </p>
<p>Disney is in the middle of a regulatory review of its
proposal to buy the 49.6 percent of UTV Software Communications
Ltd. (UTV), a Mumbai-based film and TV production company, that it
doesn''t own for as much as 20.1 billion rupees ($445 million). </p>
<p>From fiscal 2006 to 2010, Burbank, California-based Disney
has spent $13 billion on acquisitions, Iger said. The company
now puts a $23 billion enterprise value on those purchases, he
said. </p>
<p>He''s been smart about buying assets that contribute to
the core of the company, said Bill Smead, chief investment
officer of Seattle-based Smead Capital Investment, which owns
57,813 shares of Disney. He hasn''t overpaid, and he has
created value. </p>
<p>Pixar Purchase </p>
<p>Disney acquired Pixar Animation for $8.06 billion in stock
in 2006, a deal announced three months after Iger assumed the
CEO''s job. The company completed the Marvel acquisition in
January 2010 and acquired the Internet casual game company
Playdom in August 2010 for $563 million in cash. </p>
<p>Iger spoke after Disney posted third-quarter sales and
profit that beat analysts'' estimates as pay-TV fees to the ESPN
sports network countered flat cable advertising sales. </p>
<p>Net income rose 11 percent to $1.48 billion, or 77 cents a
share, from $1.33 billion, or 67 cents, a year ago, Disney said
yesterday in a statement. Profit excluding some items was 78
cents, beating the 73-cent average of 22 analysts'' estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Cable-network earnings rose 10 percent, with ESPN enjoying
gains in fees from pay-TV systems. Theme-park profit advanced
8.8 percent, fueled by higher admission prices at U.S. resorts
and this year''s later Easter break. The consumer products unit
boosted profit with sales of Cars and Marvel merchandise. </p>
<p>Sales in the period ended July 2 gained 6.7 percent to
$10.7 billion, exceeding analysts'' projections of $10.5 billion. </p>
<p>Disney fell 5 cents to $34.65 at 7:34 a.m. before the open
of the New York Stock Exchange, after gaining 5.1 percent to
$34.70 yesterday. The shares had declined 7.5 percent this year
before today. </p>

<p>The National Credit Union
Administration has sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), accusing the
Wall Street firm of violating federal and state laws in the sale
of securities to now-failed corporate credit unions. </p>
<p>NCUA is seeking damages in excess of $491 million from
Goldman Sachs in the lawsuit filed yesterday in California. The
suit is the fourth in a series aimed at recovering almost $2
billion from sellers and underwriters of questionable
securities, NCUA said in a statement yesterday announcing the
suit. </p>
<p>Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the NCUA lawsuit. </p>
<p>NCUA claims that Goldman Sachs misrepresented securities in
offering documents, causing the credit unions to believe the
risk of loss was minimal when in fact it was substantial,
according to its statement. The regulator previously filed a
complaint against JPMorgan Chase  Co. and two against Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc. </p>
<p>The complaint against Goldman Sachs relates to the
collapses of the U.S. Central and Western Corporate federal
credit unions, two of the five liquidated under NCUA
conservatorship, the regulator said in the statement. </p>
<p>Compliance Action </p>
<p>Ex-Point Blank Chief to Plead to Tax Charges, Lawyer Says </p>
<p>David Brooks, a founder and former chief executive officer
of military contractor Point Blank Solutions Inc. (PBSOQ), will plead
guilty to tax charges today, his lawyer said. </p>
<p>A federal jury found Brooks guilty last year of committing
a $185 million fraud and looting the company, formerly called
DHB Industries Inc., to pay for personal expenses. Three tax
counts were separated from the other charges he was convicted
of, including insider-trading, fraud and obstruction of justice.
He has asked for a new trial on those charges. </p>
<p>We are channeling our efforts into the other counts,
Brooks''s lawyer Gerald L. Shargel said in a phone interview
yesterday. </p>
<p>Brooks, 56, and former Chief Operating Officer Sandra
Hatfield were convicted last September in Central Islip, New
York. Point Blank, which makes body armor for the military and
police, filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2010. Brooks
and Hatfield lied about the inventory of Interceptor combat
vests that were shipped to the U.S. armed forces and falsely
inflated the company''s value and their own stock, the government
said. </p>
<p>Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch
in Brooklyn, New York, declined to comment on the plea hearing. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Brooks, 06-CR-550, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Central Islip). </p>
<p>HR Block Unit Settles Mortgage Lawsuit with Massachusetts </p>
<p>The HR Block Inc. (HRB) mortgage lender formerly known as Option
One Mortgage and Massachusetts reached a $125 million settlement
of a state lawsuit over allegedly risky and discriminatory
lending, the state said. </p>
<p>The unit, Sand Canyon Corp., agreed to pay $9.8 million to
Massachusetts and will direct American Home Mortgage Servicing
Inc., which services Option One loans in the state, to establish
a loan-modification program for struggling borrowers, state
Attorney General Martha Coakley said in a statement. </p>
<p>Option One was sued by Massachusetts in 2008 and accused of
making risky loans that were doomed to fail and discriminating
against black and Latino borrowers by charging more for their
loans, Coakley said. The company''s practices were deceptive and
illegal, she said at a press conference yesterday. </p>
<p>The settlement will provide an estimated $115 million in
loan modifications to homeowners, Coakley''s spokeswoman Melissa
Karpinsky said. The modifications will give Massachusetts
homeowners writedowns of principal balances and interest rate
reductions depending on features of their loans, according to
Coakley''s office. </p>
<p>We are pleased with the final outcome and believe this is
good for all parties involved, Dale Sugimoto, president of
Sand Canyon, said in a statement. </p>
<p>The settlement comes as state attorneys general and federal
officials are negotiating a settlement with the five largest
mortgage servicers in the U.S., including Bank of America Corp. (BAC)
and JPMorgan Chase  Co., over their foreclosure and mortgage-
servicing practices. </p>
<p>Some attorney generals, including Coakley, have raised
concerns about liability releases in any agreement that would
protect the banks from state and federal claims. Coakley has
said that any agreement shouldn''t provide banks with releases
tied to the packaging of mortgages into securities and conduct
related to a mortgage database known as MERS. </p>

<p>Citigroup Resolves Claims That Assistant Defrauded Clients </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C) will pay $500,000 to resolve Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority claims that it failed to stop
fraud by an employee who abused accounts belonging to elderly
and ill clients as well as her own father. </p>
<p>Tamara Moon misappropriated almost $750,000 from 22
customers over eight years while working as a sales assistant at
a branch office in Palo Alto, California, Finra said yesterday
in a statement. Moon, who was barred from the securities
industry for the misconduct in 2009, was indicted by a federal
grand jury on related criminal charges in June. </p>
<p>Citigroup failed to investigate red flags including
suspicious trades as Moon targeted customers she believed would
be unable to monitor their accounts, Finra said. The Palo Alto
branch didn''t have adequate systems to prevent Moon from
falsifying records, the Washington-based regulator said. </p>
<p>In one instance, Moon created an account in the name of a
dead customer even after Citigroup had been notified that the
person had died, Finra said. She then created a fraudulent
account in the name of the customer''s widow, using it to funnel
$7,500 to her own personal account, according to the statement. </p>
<p>When Citigroup discovered Moon''s suspicious activity in
2008, the firm immediately notified the authorities,
terminated her employment and reimbursed impacted clients, the
company said in an e-mailed statement. We will provide any
assistance necessary to ensure that the former employee is
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. </p>
<p>A phone call to Geoffrey Hansen, a federal public defender
representing Moon in the criminal matter, wasn''t immediately
returned. </p>
<p>Moon was employed by Citigroup''s Smith Barney unit,
Elizabeth Fogarty, a bank spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Says EU Accuses Firm in Cable Price-Fixing </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the European Commission told
the firm it may have to pay fines in a case relating to price
fixing by power-cable companies. </p>
<p>The European Commission issued a statement of
objections that proposed making the firm liable for some or
all of any fine levied against an Italian cable company in which
Goldman Sachs funds held stakes, the New York-based bank said in
a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
yesterday. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s private-equity funds bought the power-cable
unit and a telecommunications cable business from Milan-based
Pirelli  C. SpA in 2005 and renamed the business Prysmian
Cables  Systems, which became Prysmian SpA (PRY) in an initial public
offering in 2007. </p>
<p>Prysmian stock dropped in February 2009 after the company
disclosed that it was cooperating with antitrust regulators''
investigation of the cable market. Goldman Sachs funds sold
shares in Prysmian later that year. </p>
<p>Last month the European Commission sent complaints to 12
companies that may have colluded to allocate markets and
customers for underground and submarine power cable projects and
fix prices, the Commission said in a statement on July 6.
Prysmian said on July 5 that it had received an antitrust
complaint and that it would defend itself. </p>
<p>The Commission has proposed holding Goldman Sachs liable
under the concept of parental liability under EU competition
law, Goldman Sachs said in yesterday''s filing, referring to
the European Union. </p>
<p>Compliance Policy </p>
<p>Muni Issuers Should Face Disclosure Penalties, MSRB Says </p>
<p>U.S. states and cities should face sanctions for failing to
provide updated financial information after they sell bonds, the
municipal market''s regulator said, challenging the lax
disclosure that has unnerved investors. </p>
<p>The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which writes
regulations for the tax-exempt debt industry, made the comments
in a letter to Securities and Exchange Commissioner Elisse
Walter, who is leading an agency review into how to improve the
municipal bond market. </p>
<p>Public borrowers aren''t penalized if they don''t provide
annual financial reports and other disclosures on time after
issuing debt. The failure by some borrowers to make timely
disclosures has long rankled municipal-bond investors. </p>
<p>There seem to be no significant regulatory repercussions
for non-compliance, the board wrote in the Aug. 8 letter,
which was released yesterday. The board said the SEC should take
steps necessary to impose consequences for non-compliance with
continuing disclosure undertakings. </p>
<p>The SEC doesn''t directly regulate disclosures made by
municipalities after bonds are sold, as it does with
corporations that sell securities to the public. Instead, the
agency requires underwriters that sell the securities to be
assured by the municipalities that they will provide to
investors annual financial statements and other information that
could affect the value of the bonds. </p>
<p>The SEC has stepped up its enforcement of standards for
municipal securities by establishing a unit to police fraud and
last year settled a case against New Jersey for masking the
state of its pension plans as it raised money from investors. </p>
<p>Walter has been holding hearings on the $2.9 trillion
municipal bond market with the intention of recommending
improvements. The SEC also is updating its 1994 guidance
covering the disclosure obligations for the municipal industry,
a review the MSRB was seeking to influence with its
recommendations. </p>
<p>Banks Should Make Living Wills to Plan for Failure, FSA Says </p>
<p>Banks should prepare so-called living wills setting out how
they may be broken up with the least possible disruption to the
economy if they collapse, the U.K. Financial Services Authority
said yesterday. </p>
<p>Lenders should be able to be shut down without roiling
markets or requiring public support, according to the FSA.
Failed lenders'' bondholders should also bear part of the costs
of closure, the regulator said, as part of plans to shield
taxpayers published on its website. </p>
<p>Banks are warning that rules considered by global
regulators to limit the need for bailouts may harm the economic
recovery. Michel Barnier, the European Union''s financial
services chief, published draft proposals in January to impose
losses on failing lenders'' bondholders -- a step that firms
including Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have said
may make it more expensive for banks to raise funds. </p>
<p>Living wills are largely untested, because the U.K.
hasn''t had a major bank collapse since they have come under
consideration by regulators, Darren Fox, a financial services
lawyer at Simmons  Simmons LLP, said in a telephone interview.
They require quite a bit of work and possibly restructuring to
design and implement and consequently can be intensive in terms
of the level of financial and human resources that they
absorb. </p>

<p>NYSE to Raise Hurdle for Reverse Merger Listings Amid Scrutiny </p>
<p>NYSE Euronext (NYX), the U.S.''s biggest operator of exchanges,
said it will tighten the listing requirements for reverse merger
companies following allegations of accounting fraud, according
to a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>The operator of NYSE Amex and the New York Stock Exchange
will implement a seasoning period for companies that seek
listing after completing a reverse merger, according to the
proposal, which is subject to approval by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. In a reverse-merger process, a closely held
firm buys a publicly traded shell company, gaining a stock
listing without the scrutiny of an initial public offering. </p>
<p>Significant regulatory concerns, including accounting
fraud allegations, have arisen with respect to a number of
reverse merger companies in recent times, said the filing
dated July 22. Because of these concerns, the exchange
believes it is appropriate to codify in its rules specific
requirements with respect to the initial listing qualification
of reverse merger companies. </p>
<p>Chinese companies trading in the U.S. through reverse
mergers such as China MediaExpress Holdings Inc. (CCME) have faced
investor scrutiny this year after disclosing financial
irregularities or auditor resignations, raising concern there
may be widespread fraud. Carson Block, a short seller at Muddy
Waters LLC, helped fuel that speculation with bearish reports on
corporations including Rino International Corp. (RINO) and Sino-Forest
Corp. (TRE), which trades in Canada. </p>
<p>NYSE is proposing a waiting period of at least one year of
trading on the U.S. over-the-counter market or other national
market, or a foreign exchange, before companies can list on the
bourse. </p>
<p>Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ), the second-biggest operator of U.S.
stock exchanges, has also proposed to evaluate reverse-merger
companies more closely, according to filings to the SEC from
April and May. </p>

<p>Ex-Primary Global Manager Loses Bid to Throw Out Wiretaps </p>
<p>A former sales manager at expert networking firm Primary
Global Research LLC lost his bid to bar government wiretaps at
his insider trading trial later this month. </p>
<p>James Fleishman had argued that the wiretaps of more than
100 callers to two Primary Global conference lines were illegal.
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected Fleishman''s request in a
two-page order made public in Manhattan federal court yesterday
and also declined to hold an evidentiary hearing on the matter. </p>
<p>Primary Global, based in Mountain View, California, is at
the center of a nationwide probe of insider trading at hedge
funds, technology companies, banks and consulting firms.
Winifred Jiau, a former Primary Global consultant, was convicted
of securities fraud and conspiracy on June 20 after a trial
before Rakoff. </p>
<p>Of the 14 people charged in the investigation by Manhattan
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara''s office, 12 have pleaded guilty and
one, Jiau, was convicted at trial. Fleishman has pleaded not
guilty and is scheduled to go on trial before Rakoff on two
counts of conspiracy Aug. 29. </p>
<p>Ethan Balogh, a lawyer for Fleishman, didn''t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Fleishman, 11-CR-32, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Rajaratnam Sentence of More Than 24 Years Sought by U.S. </p>
<p>Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, labeled by
prosecutors as the face of illegal insider trading, should
spend as long as 24 years and five months in prison, the U.S.
told the judge who will sentence him. </p>
<p>Lawyers for Rajaratnam, in a separate court filing
yesterday, asked U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell in
Manhattan for a prison term substantially below what federal
guidelines recommend. Rajaratnam''s attorneys, citing their
client''s poor health, urged Holwell not to force him to die in
prison. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam, 54, was convicted in May of all 14 criminal
counts of conspiracy and securities fraud he was charged with.
He''s scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 27. Prosecutors said he
should serve at least 19 years, seven months in prison. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam repeatedly leveraged the power of money and
his position as the head of a $7 billion hedge fund to induce
friends, employees and associates to participate in his criminal
activities, Justice Department lawyers said in their
sentencing memorandum yesterday. He is the modern face of
illegal insider trading. </p>
<p>Prosecutors called Rajaratnam the most egregious
violator of insider-trading laws ever to be caught. He engaged
in a seven-year conspiracy to trade on inside information from
corporate executives, bankers, consultants, traders and
directors of public companies including Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., they said. He gained $63.8 million as a result of the
scheme, according to the government. </p>
<p>Prosecutors and defense lawyers are awaiting a pre-
sentencing report from the federal probation office to help
determine a range under U.S. sentencing guidelines, according to
yesterday''s filing by John Dowd, the lead lawyer for Rajaratnam.
Holwell is free to disregard the guidelines, which are advisory. </p>
<p>Mr. Rajaratnam is not a healthy man, his lawyers wrote,
citing significant and challenging medical issues that are
known to the court''s probation department. His death will be
hastened by a term of imprisonment, they said. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam''s lawyers submitted letters on his behalf from
his family members, former business associates, ex-employees and
even his apartment doorman. Some of the letters detail what the
defense said is more than $45 million in charitable donations by
Rajaratnam in the U.S. and abroad, including millions of dollars
to help victims of a tsunami that devastated his native Sri
Lanka. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, is being probed about its
compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the firm
said in a filing yesterday. </p>
<p>The bank and some of its units are subject to a number of
probes and reviews, some of which also involve other firms,
according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Goldman Sachs officials in London couldn''t immediately comment. </p>
<p>Regulators are probing Goldman Sachs''s dealings with the

today, citing people familiar with the investigation. </p>
<p>The SEC opened an investigation in January into whether
banks, hedge funds and private-equity firms paid placement
agents to win access to the government-run funds, people
familiar with the matter said at the time. </p>
<p>An agent working with a sovereign wealth fund may be
considered a government official, making interactions with that

<p>Jerry Wood is relying on skills that
helped him recruit and develop top talent at Morgan Stanley (MS) in
his latest endeavor: coaching the men''s golf team at Manhattan
College. </p>
<p>Wood, 57, has spent 30 years at Morgan Stanley, where he''s
a senior adviser after holding managerial roles including global
head of sales for fixed income and equities. </p>
<p>While the duties of part-time college golf coach may not
seem to dovetail with that of an executive at the world''s top
merger adviser, Wood says he sees similarities. </p>
<p>You recruit kids from schools, you try to get the best
talent, you give them the tools to learn the business, then
basically mentor them, and hopefully they come through in a big
way, Wood, of Huntington, New York, said in a telephone
interview. A lot of the kids I hired as MBA''s and analysts are
now managing directors running the business. It''s very rewarding
seeing somebody who you kind of picked. </p>
<p>Wood never has coached golf before but brings a competitive
background to his new job. </p>
<p>He was captain of the golf team in 1975 as a senior at
Manhattan, which plays in the Metro Atlantic Athletic
Conference, and has memberships at Huntington Country Club and
Garden City Golf Club on New York''s Long Island. He finished
ninth at last year''s Long Island Senior Open at Fresh Meadow
Country Club against professionals and amateurs. He has a 2.3
handicap index and said he''s played all but six or seven of Long
Island''s 140 golf courses. </p>
<p>Golf Management </p>
<p>If you talk to anybody who played golf in college or high
school at the competitive level, they''ll tell you that as they
got older they learned a lot more about the game and their
swing, Wood said. That''s what I can bring to the table for
these kids: How do you manage yourself around the golf course as
opposed to just getting up and ripping it? </p>
<p>After graduating from Manhattan with an accounting degree,
Wood started his career at Ernst  Ernst, then spent one year at
Merrill Lynch before joining Morgan Stanley in 1978 as a
municipal bond trader. He got his MBA in 1980 after taking night
classes with his wife. </p>
<p>Wood left in 2003, going to Credit Suisse Group AG and
working with John Mack, Morgan Stanley''s current chairman. Wood
returned to Morgan Stanley in 2005 and a year or so later
resumed playing competitive golf in senior tournaments. In his
current advisory position, Wood helps with Morgan Stanley''s
charity efforts and client relationships. </p>
<p>Wood''s ability to manage -- in the boardroom and on a long
par-5 -- appealed to Manhattan Athletic Director Bob Byrnes. The
two were introduced within the last year by a mutual golf
partner, school chaplain Rev. George Hill, and Byrnes contacted
Wood when his previous coach retired. </p>
<p>Bunker Lesson </p>
<p>Wood invited Byrnes out for a round at Huntington and
offered an impromptu lesson when the athletic director was
struggling in a bunker. Wood accepted the coaching vacancy soon
after, his flexibility at Morgan Stanley allowing him the chance
to pursue the new role. Manhattan College, in New York City''s
Riverdale section, is about an hour''s drive from his home. He''s
donating his $11,000 salary back to the golf program. </p>
<p>A lot of this is weekend and some mid-week tournaments,
and some time with practice, so it''s a full-time job that''s part
time, so to speak, Byrnes said. But once you meet Jerry, you
see why he''s such a successful businessman because he quickly
gets to the subject and heart of the matter. He''s a terrific
player himself and is going to be a great teacher. </p>
<p>Perfect Score </p>
<p>Wood, who is married with three children between the ages
of 23 and 27, got a perfect score on the National Collegiate
Athletic Association''s recruiting test for coaches and has
already arranged team travel for the season that begins Sept. 9
with the Central Connecticut State Blue Devil Fall Invitational.
He can''t meet or practice with his players until classes start
at the end of this month. </p>
<p>I''m excited because a lot of the kids on our team are
business students or engineering students and I think that not
only will he help them in golf, but really in their future
lives, Byrnes said. This is a unique hire for me, and I''m
not a rookie. This is my 24th year. It''s very energizing for me
that Jerry will be with us. </p>
<p>Swing Tips </p>
<p>Steve D''Antonio, Morgan Stanley''s global head of
securitized products, has seen Wood''s competitive drive, on and
off the course. D''Antonio, who said it''s a rare but wonderful
moment when he takes Wood''s money in a match, predicts his
colleague and golfing buddy will be as successful with college
players as he has been with clients. </p>
<p>He''s had leadership roles, he''s a very good communicator
and he gets along with a very wide range of people, D''Antonio,
who''s known Wood since his first day at Morgan Stanley 25 years
ago, said by phone. He had relationships with a very broad set
of people and clients. </p>
<p>Byrnes said Wood has a natural knack for communicating
and that''s really what coaching is. </p>
<p>While Wood has a lot of experience to impart, D''Antonio
joked that it''s unlikely he''ll be sharing too many swing tips
with his players when they step to the tee. </p>
<p>I can tell you one thing, his kids will have much better
looking swings than his, said D''Antonio, 51. He has an ugly
swing, it just works. He just repeats it. The kids on the team
will have a good time with that, but he gets it done. He''s in
the fairway all day long. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s Charles LeCroy said the key to landing bond deals in Jefferson County,
Alabama, was finding out whom to pay off. In one example, that
meant a $2.6 million payment to Bill Blount, a local banker and
longtime friend of County Commissioner Larry Langford. </p>
<p>It''s a lot of money, but in the end it''s worth it on a
billion-dollar deal, LeCroy told a colleague in 2003, according
to a complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>That''s because in the $2.9-trillion market for state and
local government debt, where 80 percent of all financings are
negotiated in private, conflicts of interest prevail. While
Langford and Blount are in jail, LeCroy is fighting an SEC
action. JPMorgan, which provided most of the toxic debt that
devastated Jefferson County, has suffered no loss of business as
the nation''s third-largest underwriter of municipal bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Just 21 months ago, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million SEC
settlement to end a case over secret payments to friends of
Jefferson County commissioners. The financings arranged by
JPMorgan, a package of floating-rate debt and derivatives,
exposed taxpayers to the 2008 credit crisis and dealt a blow
that may lead the county to approve the biggest U.S. municipal
bankruptcy as soon as today. </p>
<p>As an outsider looking in, it just certainly appears to me
that JPMorgan ravaged this county, said Robert Brooks, a
finance professor at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and
the author of a textbook on derivatives. They convinced
Jefferson County to pursue a strategy they never would have
followed to generate a lot of fees. </p>
<p>Deals Backfired </p>
<p>Jefferson County''s financing shows how Wall Street peddled
complex bond-and-derivative deals that backfired on taxpayers,
from small Pennsylvania school districts to California''s state
government. Banks may have charged $20 billion in hidden fees on
the derivatives alone, Andrew Kalotay, a New York-based
financial consultant who specializes in such agreements, told an
SEC hearing in Jefferson County last month. The agreements
allowed lenders to earn fees that were rarely, if ever,
disclosed, while exposing municipalities to unexpected increases
in borrowing costs. </p>
<p>Yet while JPMorgan''s deals denuded Jefferson County, the
company has emerged with its municipal-debt underwriting
business unscathed. During the past two years, public officials
from California to Massachusetts hired the New York-based bank
to arrange $64.7 billion of bond offerings, making it the third-
largest underwriter in the market for state and local
securities, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Very Aggressive'' </p>
<p>The issuers need the bankers, said Christopher Whalen,
managing director of Torrance, California-based Institutional
Risk Analytics, which assesses banks. Morgan''s a big house and
they''re very aggressive and they''re out there looking for
business everywhere. So people tend to forget. </p>
<p>Last month, without admitting or denying wrongdoing,
JPMorgan agreed to pay $211 million in a separate settlement
with state and federal regulators over charges that its
municipal-derivatives unit participated in an industry-wide
scheme to fix prices and overcharge local governments on
investment contracts. The bank blamed former employees and said
it has increased oversight of its public finance business. </p>
<p>In a motion to dismiss a lawsuit by Jefferson County,
JPMorgan said the county was inappropriately attempting to lay
blame for the debt crisis at the bank''s feet. </p>
<p>The simple fact is that the county took on too much debt
and vastly underestimated the cost of building out its sewer
system, lawyers for JPMorgan argued. These problems were
only exacerbated by the county''s poor management of its sewer
system and the current credit crisis. </p>
<p>Dodd-Frank Law </p>
<p>JPMorgan spokesman Justin Perras declined to comment for
this story and said Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who
joined JPMorgan after the Jefferson County deals were done,
wasn''t available for an interview. William B. Harrison Jr., the
bank''s CEO at the time it sold the contracts, didn''t return
phone calls seeking comment. </p>
<p>The county''s collapse has loomed over the municipal bond
market for more than three years and inspired provisions in the
Dodd-Frank law seeking to protect localities from complex
financial trades involving derivatives. Officials are asking
JPMorgan and other creditors to forgive about $1 billion of the
bonds or may decide as soon as today to file for bankruptcy
protection to escape the debts. </p>
<p>Money-Saving Plan </p>
<p>In Jefferson County, JPMorgan pitched a money-saving plan
that converted almost all the county''s $3 billion of sewer-
system debt into floating-rate securities coupled with
derivatives. The deals comprised the largest transactions in
municipal swaps and auction-rate bonds, a form of floating-rate
borrowing, in the bank''s history, according to the SEC. </p>
<p>Like homeowners who turned to exotic mortgages, officials
refinanced 93 percent of the sewer bonds into securities with
adjustable interest rates. They bought interest-rate swaps, in
which two parties make periodic payments based on an underlying
measure of borrowing costs. The contracts were supposed to
offset the floating rates the county paid and give it a fixed
rate that was lower than on traditional bonds. </p>
<p>The county paid JPMorgan, Bear Stearns Cos, Bank of America
Corp. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. $120 million in fees for
swap trades. Those fees were as much as six times the prevailing
rate, according to a report by former county financial adviser
Porter White  Co. of Birmingham, Alabama. </p>
<p>The money-saving strategy backfired. JPMorgan''s financings
unraveled in early 2008 as the subprime mortgage-market meltdown
sent ripples through Wall Street, undermining the credit ratings
of the companies that insured Jefferson County''s bonds. </p>
<p>Interest Costs Soared </p>
<p>The county''s interest costs soared as investors dumped the
bonds. After banks demanded early payoffs, the county defaulted.
The swaps exposed the county to hundreds of millions in fees to
refinance. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s Dimon has moved to put the municipal crisis
behind him. </p>
<p>In 2008, the bank said it got out of the business of
selling interest-rate swaps to state and local governments. In
November 2009, it settled with the SEC over allegations that
LeCroy and former JPMorgan colleague Douglas MacFaddin funneled
$8 million of secret payments to bankers, including Blount, who
had ties to Jefferson County politicians. </p>
<p>It looks like they''ve done the right things to limit the
reputational damage, said Matt Fabian, who tracks the state
and local government securities industry for Municipal Market
Advisors Inc. in Concord, Massachusetts. </p>
<p>In the Jefferson County case, much of the blame for the
collapse has been cast on corrupt politicians. </p>
<p>Hasn''t Hurt'' </p>
<p>It hasn''t hurt them a bit because the whole thing has
been sold that they were dealing with corrupt officials, said
Christopher Taylor, the executive director of the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board from 1978 until 2007. But the
truth of the matter is they were in bed with the issuer. </p>
<p>Larry Langford, the former commissioner in charge of
finance, was found guilty on U.S. criminal charges of accepting
bribes from Blount, who pleaded guilty in the case. </p>
<p>LeCroy and MacFaddin, the former head of municipal
derivatives for the bank, are fighting SEC civil claims that
they failed to disclose payments to Blount and others. JPMorgan
fired LeCroy in 2004 and terminated MacFaddin in 2008. No one
from JPMorgan is accused of criminal wrongdoing. </p>
<p>MacFaddin and LeCroy have argued that the SEC lacks
authority to pursue them under federal anti-fraud statutes
because the interest-rate swaps aren''t securities. </p>
<p>Richard Lawler, MacFaddin''s attorney, declined to comment.
LeCroy''s lawyer, Lisa Mathewson, also declined to comment. </p>
<p>21 People </p>
<p>In Jefferson County, 21 people, including four county
commissioners, were convicted or pleaded guilty to charges
related to the sewer construction or financing. </p>
<p>Former County commissioner Langford, 63, a longtime friend
of Blount''s who was responsible for finance, was convicted of
taking $242,000 in bribes in exchange for steering business to
Blount. Langford lost an appeal of his convictions, according to
a notice posted Aug. 5 by the federal appeals court in Atlanta. </p>
<p>According to the SEC, LeCroy also paid fees to two other
local firms to win the support of another former commissioner. </p>
<p>LeCroy joked about the tactics with a fellow JPMorgan
banker in 2003. We have to pick the partners who are going to
get free money from us this time, he said, according to the
SEC complaint. </p>
<p>Deals Raised Questions </p>
<p>Bond insurer Syncora Guarantee Inc., which backed about $1
billion of the bonds, said in a lawsuit that JPMorgan knew that
the county wouldn''t have enough revenue to pay its debts in a
few years but kept a report documenting that secret. </p>
<p>A least one banker at JPMorgan, Charles Giffin, raised
internal questions about the risk. </p>
<p>Do these guys know the risks they are taking (in large
doses)? Giffin wrote in a May 12, 2003, e-mail to a colleague,
when asked to prepare materials explaining why the county should
buy more derivatives, according to SEC records. Shouldn''t we
be pitching diversification arguments? </p>

<p>Nathan Myhrvold -- the former chief
strategist and chief technology officer at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) --
opens a bottle of wine and pours it into a kitchen blender. </p>
<p>Decanting is about doing two things, Myhrvold, 52, says
before flipping on the power switch. It''s about mixing oxygen
in with the wine and about taking dissolved gasses out of the
wine. So, if a little bit of decanting works, why not a lot? </p>
<p>We''re in an industrial unit in suburban Seattle, the home
of Myhrvold''s company, Intellectual Ventures. He''s giving a
PowerPoint presentation before a 30-course dinner made up of
dishes from Modernist Cuisine, The Art and Science of
Cooking, the six-volume, 2,438-page book he''s produced. </p>
<p>(Myhrvold is also a columnist for Bloomberg View.) </p>
<p>To say the dishes are unusual would be an understatement.
The first consists of watermelon chips with spicy pickles. Thin
slices of fruit and pickle are mixed with modified starch
slurry, compressed in vacuum bags and then deep fried. </p>
<p>I figured that if I could make chips out of watermelon, I
could do it for anything, Myhrvold explains as we sip hyper-
decanted wine. (I wouldn''t have guessed it was from a blender.) </p>
<p>Next up? Corn and green-pea butter spread on brioche and
walnut-bread toasts. Run through a centrifuge, the corn and peas
yield three distinct layers: juice, starch and a small quantity
of a substance that has 20 times the flavor intensity of the raw
ingredient and the texture of soft butter, Myhrvold says. </p>
<p>MasterChef Contestant </p>
<p>Fifteen people from around the world are attending the
dinner. My table includes a journalist from Germany, an academic
from New York, a food technologist who works for Mars Inc. and
Alvin Schultz, a Houston-based contestant from chef Gordon Ramsay''s Fox TV show, MasterChef. Myhrvold divides his time
between providing a commentary and helping prepare the food. </p>
<p>We''re sitting in the laboratory with chefs working along
one side. Heading the kitchen is Maxime Bilet, co-author of
Modernist Cuisine. He graduated with highest honors from the
Institute of Culinary Education in New York and also worked at
the Fat Duck, outside London. </p>
<p>The courses keep coming: Puffed Chicken Skin, Peking
Flavors involves the skin being cooked sous vide -- in an
airtight bag in a water bath -- then puffed in oil with hoisin
sauce, scallion oil emulsion, cucumber and shaved scallions.
Liquid Caprese is a cold, emulsified soup of olive oil and
tomato water. The equipment required? A rotor-stator
homogenizer, a pressure cooker and a centrifuge. </p>
<p>Baked Potato Soup consists of wafer-thin potato ravioli
filled with shallots melted in bacon fat, and dressed with an
intense broth of potato juice infused with roasted potato skins. </p>
<p>Kansas Ribs </p>
<p>The recipe for the Hot-Smoked Spare Ribs, Barbecue Sauces
from Kansas City, South Carolina, requires an Enviro-Pak cold
smoker, an ultrasonic bath, centrifuge, liquid nitrogen, vacuum
sealer and a water bath. The ribs are cooked sous vide for 48
hours, then dry rubbed, smoked and vacuum sealed. The chefs then
warm them in a bath and cryofry by dipping them in liquid
nitrogen and then deep-frying them. This process creates an
intense crust without overcooking the meat below. </p>
<p>You may be asking by this stage: How does the food taste?
The answer is great. The flavors are intense, the textures
distinct, the aromas enticing. Many courses evoke memories of
childhood, when a simple strawberry may be a mouthful of heaven
and chocolate more fun than playing in the park. </p>
<p>Yet somewhere in multicourse modernist meals -- and 48
dishes at El Bulli was my limit -- I tend to tire of perfection.
I want a piece of meat that hasn''t been cooked for days, I don''t
need my vegetables uniform and I might even accept the
occasional lump in my gravy. It''s hardly a fly in the soup. </p>
<p>Lemongrass Egg </p>
<p>Myhrvold is such an entertaining host, sharing funny
stories and being completely un-precious about his food, that an
evening at his laboratory is a delight. Even the food has wit.
The waitresses said that one dish, Raw Quail Egg, came from
birds kept on the roof of the building. The yolk turned out to
be passion fruit, the white a gel of lemongrass. </p>
<p>Myhrvold was a postdoctoral fellow in the department of
applied mathematics and theoretical physics at Cambridge
University in the U.K. and worked with Professor Stephen Hawking
on research in cosmology, quantum field theory in curved space
time and quantum theories of gravitation. He doesn''t keep all
his eggs in one basket. </p>

<p>A Pfizer Inc. (PFE) patent for the
impotence pill Viagra is valid, a U.S. judge ruled, blocking
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) from marketing a generic
version until 2019. </p>
<p>The decision, protecting Pfizer''s $1 billion a year in U.S.
Viagra sales for most of the next decade, was handed down Aug.
12 after a two-week non-jury trial that began June 15, according
to court papers. </p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry will take note of the
ruling, Navid Malik, a London-based analyst with Matrix
Corporate Capital LLP, said in a telephone interview. The
generic companies are still going to be aggressive, but the
pharmaceutical companies aren''t going to be easy touches,
they''re fighting back. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith in Norfolk,
Virginia, ruled against Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, which
claimed the patent wasn''t valid and couldn''t be enforced. </p>
<p>Teva has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that
the patent is invalid, Smith said in a 110-page opinion.
There is utterly no evidence to support Teva''s claim that
that Pfizer intentionally withheld documents from the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, Smith wrote. </p>
<p>Denise Bradley, a Teva spokeswoman, declined to comment on
the ruling. </p>
<p>Viagra sales increased 1 percent in the second quarter from
a year earlier to $495 million, Pfizer said this month. New
York-based Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, posted net
income of $8.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, last year on sales of
$67.8 billion. </p>
<p>Innovative Core'' </p>
<p>Protecting the intellectual property rights of our
innovative core is critical, Amy Schulman, Pfizer''s general
counsel, said in a statement. Friday''s court decision
acknowledges Teva''s clear violation of our patent rights. </p>
<p>Teva fell 3 percent to 138.30 shekels in Tel Aviv. The
company''s American depositary receipts, each representing one
ordinary share, rose 79 cents, or 2 percent, to $40.49 at 2:55
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. </p>
<p>Pfizer gained 41 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $18.27 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>The ruling is worth about 3 cents to Pfizer''s 2012 per-
share earnings and 6 cents to the company''s annual per-share
earnings through 2019, Christopher Schott, a New York-based
analyst for JPMorgan Chase  Co., said in a note to clients
today. Teva will probably appeal, he wrote. </p>
<p>The ruling was a surprise, Bloomberg Industries analyst
Asthika Goonewardene said in an interview. </p>
<p>The patent was a method-of-use patent, and usually these
don''t hold up that well in court for small molecular drugs,
Goonewardene said. The court''s decision to uphold this patent
means other filers wanting to enter in 2012 are not likely to do
so then. </p>
<p>The case is Pfizer v. Teva, 10-cv-128, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Virginia (Norfolk). </p>

<p>(Corrects date of memo in second paragraph.) </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said Glenn Earle, chief operating officer of its European, Middle East and
African unit, will retire after almost 25 years with the firm. </p>
<p>Earle, 53, will be replaced by Robin Vince, global head of
operations, the bank said in a memorandum to employees last
month. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London confirmed the
contents of the document today. </p>
<p>Earle''s judgment regarding reputational and suitability
matters was invaluable in meeting the needs of our clients and
protecting the firm''s global franchise, New York-based Goldman
Sachs said in the memo. </p>
<p>The bank was last year accused by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and a Senate subcommittee of misleading
customers in a 2007 mortgage-linked investment. Goldman Sachs
paid $550 million in July 2010 to settle the SEC''s lawsuit,
without admitting or denying guilt, and said it made a mistake
in the marketing materials. </p>
<p>Earle, who received a master''s in business administration
from Harvard Business School, joined the firm in 1987 and became
a partner in 1996. Between 1996 and 1999 he helped the firm
develop its operations in central and eastern Europe, the Middle
East and Africa. He was co-head of the European advisory group
within the investment banking unit from 1999 to 2004 before
being named chief operating officer for the region in 2006. </p>
<p>In the first half of 2011, Goldman Sachs''s operations in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, known as EMEA, contributed
$4.63 billion of revenue, 24 percent of the total, down from 28
percent in the same period a year earlier, according to the
firm''s quarterly 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The region contributed $1.57 billion toward pretax
profit in the first half, 27 percent of the total. </p>
<p>Vince, who will remain global operations head, will be
based in London. He became a managing director in 2002 and a
partner in 2006. Financial News reported Earle''s retirement
earlier today. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is selling $1.85
billion of bonds, including its first 30-year debt in almost a
decade, as the Federal Reserve pledges record-low interest rates
through mid-2013. </p>
<p>The world''s largest theme-park company plans to sell $750
million each of five- and 10-year notes and $350 million of 30-
year bonds, said a person with knowledge of the transaction.
Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, said the
person, who declined to be identified because terms aren''t set. </p>
<p>Disney is selling bonds for the second time in 2011 even as
Standard  Poor''s said the company already has exceptional
liquidity that could cover its uses by more than two times
during the next two to three years. Investors are seeking
longer-term bonds for relatively higher yields after the Fed''s
pledge last week while companies are taking advantage of about
the lowest borrowing costs on record. </p>
<p>Yields on corporate debt maturing in 15 years or more fell
to 5.42 percent yesterday, compared with the 1.72 percent on
company debentures due in one to three years, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index data. Overall investment-grade

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. sued the U.S.
Interior Department, asking a judge to set aside the agency''s
decision to cancel offshore leases that may yield billions of
barrels of oil. </p>
<p>The department overstepped its authority in a ruling on
Gulf of Mexico leases for the so-called Julia Unit, Exxon Mobil
said in a complaint filed Aug. 12 in federal court in Lake
Charles, Louisiana. Statoil ASA (STL), a partner of Exxon Mobil''s in
the Julia fields, filed a similar lawsuit in the same court on
Aug. 15. </p>
<p>The Interior decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse
of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law, and deprives
Exxon Mobil of property without due process of law, the
Irving, Texas-based company said in its complaint. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil, the world''s largest publicly traded oil
company, said federal regulations allow oil producers to suspend
production in their fields, partly to facilitate proper
development of a lease. Because of drilling complexity, Exxon
Mobil said, it asked for a suspension for Julia in 2008. </p>
<p>The Interior Department denied the request in 2009, stating
that the company had not demonstrated a commitment to
production, according to court papers. Unsuccessful appeals
followed. </p>
<p>The Interior Department is reviewing the Exxon Mobil
complaint, Melissa Schwartz, spokeswoman for the department''s
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement,
said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Safe Development'' </p>
<p>Our priority remains the safe development of the nation''s
offshore energy resources, which is why we continue to approve
extensions that meet regulatory standards, Schwartz said. The
government must respond to the Exxon suit within 60 days of
receiving the Aug. 15 summons, according to a court filing. </p>
<p>The lawsuits were reported earlier by the Wall Street
Journal. </p>
<p>Analysts Fadel Gheit at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York and
Brian Youngberg at Edward Jones in St. Louis said they
ultimately expect Exxon Mobil to reach an agreement with the
government to keep the leases. Both said they hadn''t heard of
the Julia discovery before the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Exxon''s not just going to walk away from it, said
Gheit, who rates the shares outperform and owns an
undisclosed number of them. </p>
<p>Shares Drop </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil fell $3.24, or 4.4 percent, to $70.92 at 2:49
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading as crude oil
slumped the most in a week after Morgan Stanley and Deutsche
Bank AG cut their forecasts for global economic expansion.
Statoil''s American depositary receipts, each representing one
ordinary share, declined $1.68, or 7 percent, to $22.40. </p>
<p>Wyn Hornbuckle, a U.S. Justice Department spokesman,
declined to comment on the dispute. Jonathan A. Hunter, lead
attorney on the suit for Exxon, couldn''t immediately be reached
for comment. </p>
<p>President Barack Obama stopped deep-water oil and natural-
gas drilling early last year after a BP Plc (BP/) well blew out off
the Louisiana coast, claiming 11 lives and causing the largest
U.S. oil spill. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the ban in
October. </p>
<p>Exxon alleges that the Interior Department terminated the
Julia leases to gain new leases and make more money. </p>
<p>Cancellation of the original Julia leases would give
Interior the opportunity to collect millions of dollars in
bonuses and royalties that it otherwise would not be entitled to
collect, Exxon said in court papers. </p>
<p>If the agency''s decision stands, Exxon Mobil and Statoil
will lose the enormous value of those leases and their
hundreds of millions of dollars in investments, Statoil said
in its complaint. </p>
<p>Ola Morten Aanestad, a spokesman for Stavanger, Norway-
based Statoil, had no immediate comment on the complaints. </p>
<p>The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) v. Kenneth Salazar, 11CV1474,
U.S. District Court, Western District of Louisiana (Lake
Charles). </p>

<p>Bank of America Corp. may face
billions of dollars more in liability for faulty mortgages if a
judge agrees with insurer MBIA Inc. (MBI) that the lender must buy
back loans even if the errors didn''t cause a borrower''s default. </p>
<p>If New York Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten and
judges in similar cases across the country rule that the issue
of causation doesn''t apply -- meaning it''s enough to show
that the loan was improperly made -- it could significantly
impact Bank of America''s potential costs, the bank said in a
regulatory filing this month. </p>
<p>Such court defeats may add as much as $9 billion to what
Bank of America owes bond insurers, according to hedge fund
Branch Hill Capital, which is betting against its stock and has
invested in MBIA. A victory for Armonk, New York-based MBIA may
also strengthen claims by mortgage-securities investors that
want the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank to pay more than
the $8.5 billion it''s offered them as a settlement. </p>
<p>You don''t have to wait until you''re in a severe accident
before you return the car with bad brakes, said David Grais, a
partner in New York at Grais  Ellsworth LLP who represents
investors objecting to the bank''s proposed settlement with
Countrywide Financial Corp. mortgage-bond holders. </p>
<p>Any ruling on the issue, which was to be the subject of a
hearing today in state court in Manhattan, may come later than
anticipated because the proceeding was postponed until October.
The decision may intensify settlement talks between bond
insurers like MBIA and other banks that issued securities based
on faulty mortgages, according to the head of insurer Assured
Guaranty Ltd. (AGO), which is demanding money from lenders including
UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG. (CSGN) </p>
<p>If they lose that case, then our certainty of getting
reimbursed becomes a lot higher, Dominic Frederico, Assured''s
chief executive officer, said in an interview. Bank of America
agreed in April to a deal it valued at $1.6 billion with
Hamilton, Bermuda-based Assured Guaranty to settle its mortgage
claims. </p>
<p>It could change the playing field, MBIA Chief Executive
Officer Jay Brown said on an Aug. 10 conference call with
analysts and investors when asked about the causation issue. It
could have a very significant effect on the ability to rescind
or obtain recessionary damages, he said. So, it can affect
the view of both parties as to the likely outcome of the
trial. </p>
<p>Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, said in
an e-mail that Branch Hill Capital consistently has overstated
Bank of America''s representation and warranty repurchase
exposure. </p>
<p>Their motives are not nuanced, he said. Less than a
year ago, they had estimated repurchase losses for Bank of
America of approximately $74 billion. They were wrong then, and
we believe that they are wrong now. </p>

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>CIFG Sues Goldman Sachs Over $275 Million in Securities </p>
<p>CIFG Assurance North America Inc. sued Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) for fraud over $275 million in residential mortgage-backed
securities. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs made misrepresentations in connection with
the securitization of a portfolio of 6,204 mortgage loans,
according to the lawsuit filed Aug. 16 in New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan. CIFG insured about $275 million of
securities from the portfolio. </p>
<p>The investment bank duped investors and insurers into
assuming its market risk, even as Goldman Sachs profited from
underwriting fees, trading opportunities and bets on a decline
in the subprime market, New York-based CIFG said. </p>
<p>While Goldman Sachs aggressively sought to liquidate its
position in residential mortgage-backed securities, it also
sought to exploit the crisis, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Michael Duvally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the lawsuit. </p>

<p>Apple Sued by South Korean IPhone Users Over Location Data </p>
<p>A group of South Korean users of Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPhone sued
the company in a local court, claiming it invaded their privacy
by allowing the smartphone to collect location data without
their consent. </p>
<p>About 27,000 people joined a class-action lawsuit against
Apple''s South Korean unit and headquarters, seeking 1 million
won per person ($930) in damages, according to a notice posted
online by Mirae Law, which represents the plaintiffs. The suit
was filed in Changwon, south of Seoul, where the law firm is
located. </p>
<p>Apple was fined by South Korea''s telecommunications
regulator on Aug. 3 and ordered to encrypt location data of
people using iPhones to address privacy concerns. The company
also came under scrutiny from regulators around the world after
an April report by publisher O''Reilly Radar said iPhones record
information about users'' whereabouts, adding to legal disputes
the company is involved in over patent infringements. </p>
<p>Apple was fined 3 million won for collecting such data even
when some users turned off location-recognition features on
their iPhones, the Korea Communications Commission said Aug. 3.
Google Inc., which didn''t gather data in the same way, wasn''t
fined and was only ordered to make the information unreadable,
it said. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, Apple was sued in the U.S. by two iPhone
and iPad users who claimed the devices secretly collected
information on their movements. </p>
<p>Steve Park, a Seoul-based spokesman for Apple, declined to
comment on the case. </p>

<p>Madoff Trustee Amends UBS Case, Says Bank Misled Regulators </p>
<p>The trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff''s firm amended his
lawsuit seeking $2 billion from UBS AG (UBSN), claiming the Swiss bank
misled regulators in the U.S. and Luxembourg to help hide
Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>UBS misled the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier in
Luxembourg about Madoff, the trustee, Irving Picard, said
yesterday in a filing in Manhattan federal court, according to a
copy of the complaint posted on his website. The filing couldn''t
immediately be confirmed in court records. </p>
<p>UBS, based in Zurich, hid Madoff''s role as the true
custodian of two so-called feeder funds that attracted investors
to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities before his arrest in
December 2008, according to the complaint. Madoff pleaded guilty
to running a Ponzi scheme and is serving 150 years in federal
prison. </p>
<p>Madoff''s scheme could not have been accomplished unless
the UBS defendants had agreed to look the other way and to
pretend that they were truly ensuring the existence of assets
and trades when in fact they were not and never did, according
to the amended complaint. </p>
<p>Peter McKillop, a spokesman for UBS, said the bank denies
the trustee''s allegations. </p>
<p>UBS was not aware of any wrongdoing by Mr. Madoff and
will take all appropriate steps to demonstrate that the
allegations are false and unfounded, he said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The case is Picard v. UBS AG, 11-cv-04212, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Facebook Says Ceglia E-Mailed Authentic Contract'' to Lawyer </p>
<p>Paul Ceglia, the western New York man claiming part-
ownership of Facebook Inc., e-mailed the authentic contract
disproving his claim to a law firm in 2004, a lawyer for the
company told a judge. </p>
<p>Orin Snyder told U.S. Magistrate Judge Leslie Foschio at a
hearing in Buffalo, New York, yesterday that Ceglia sent the
contract, which made no mention of Facebook, to a lawyer at the
firm Sidley Austin LLP the year after Ceglia claims he signed a
contract with Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg giving him an
equal share in the company. </p>
<p>The contract Facebook says is genuine was found both on
Ceglia''s computer and Sidley Austin''s e-mail server, Snyder told
Foschio. Snyder said the evidence proves Ceglia fabricated the
contract on which he bases his claim. </p>
<p>The noose is tightening around the neck of the plaintiff
in this case and he knows it, Snyder told Foschio. </p>
<p>Foschio said Ceglia must allow Facebook''s experts to
examine his Web-based e-mail accounts, which he said he used to
communicate with Zuckerberg in 2003 and 2004, before Zuckerberg
will be required to turn over 175 e-mails from his Harvard
University account. Ceglia claimed he copied e-mails with
Zuckerberg from his Web-based accounts into word-processing
documents he saved on floppy disks. </p>
<p>Facebook said the Harvard e-mails involve Zuckerberg and
Ceglia and others at StreetFax.com, Ceglia''s former company. </p>
<p>Ceglia''s lawyer, Jeffrey Lake, said the contract attached
to Ceglia''s complaint is the genuine one. Ceglia''s version of
the contract includes terms giving him a share of The Face
Book in exchange for a $1,000 investment, in addition to terms
referring to Zuckerberg''s StreetFax work. </p>
<p>After yesterday''s hearing, Lake said he plans to demand
computers, e-mails and instant messages from Zuckerberg, in
addition to early source code for the site. Ceglia claims
Zuckerberg used code from StreetFax in building Facebook. </p>

<p>BNY Mellon Opposes N.Y. Move to Intervene in BofA Accord </p>
<p>Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) asked a judge to reject a bid
by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to intervene in a
proposed $8.5 billion mortgage-bond settlement involving Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) </p>
<p>Schneiderman this month asked the New York state-court
judge overseeing the case to reject the deal, calling it unfair
to investors. Bank of New York, the trustee for the mortgage-
securitization trusts covered by the settlement, violated New
York law, Schneiderman said. </p>
<p>The settlement calls for Bank of America to pay $8.5
billion to resolve claims from investors in Countrywide
Financial Corp. mortgage bonds. Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America acquired Countrywide in 2008. Bank of New York,
along with 22 institutional investors, claim Schneiderman has no
standing to intervene in the case. </p>
<p>The current settlement process allows for all investors -
-supporters and objectors -- to make their case before the
court, including those with even the smallest economic
interests, Kevin Heine, a Bank of New York spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The attorney general''s claims about whether Bank of New
York acted in good faith would hijack what should be an
expedited proceeding, the bank said. Those claims could take
years to resolve, the bank said. </p>
<p>No intervenor has demonstrated that the trustee was
presented with -- or could have achieved -- a better outcome
than the settlement the trustee obtained, the investors said.
That is precisely why all 22 of institutional investors chose
to support it. </p>
<p>The bank, and the institutional investors, said the
proposed settlement proceeding isn''t the appropriate forum to
address the attorney general''s claims. </p>
<p>Given that those who stand to be significantly affected
include New York State investors and pensioners, as well as
distressed homeowners residing throughout the state and country,
the state of New York has a broad and crucial interest in these
proceedings, Danny Kanner, a Schneiderman spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement responding to the opposition to his motion
to intervene. </p>
<p>The case is In the matter of Bank of New York Mellon,
651786/2011, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>Computer Hacking to Become News Corp. (NWSA) Scandal,'' Watson Says </p>
<p>Revelations that U.K. tabloid journalists may have
graduated to hacking computers in addition to mobile phones may
form the next scandal facing Rupert Murdoch''s News Corp., a U.K.
lawmaker investigating privacy violations by the now-defunct
News of the World said. </p>
<p>Police and parliament have mostly focused their probes on
how journalists illegally accessed the voice mails of
celebrities, politicians, and crime victims, and who at the
company knew about it. More revelations of computer hacking and
other forms of spying could emerge, Tom Watson, a Labour Party
lawmaker, said yesterday. </p>
<p>My own concerns are that this will lead to other forms of
covert surveillance and I think the next scandal will be
computer hacking and we''re going to be living with this for
weeks and months to come, said Watson, a member of the
Culture, Media and Sport Committee that is investigating phone
hacking. Watson made the comments after the committee published
additional statements from News Corp. deputy chief operating
officer James Murdoch and others beyond what they offered in
their initial testimony July. </p>
<p>London''s Metropolitan Police opened a third investigation
into reporting tactics at the end of July which focuses on
computer hacking, while not specifically targeting News Corp.
The probe, dubbed Operation Tuleta, is considering a number of
allegations regarding breach of privacy and computer hacking
that they have received since January, police said. </p>
<p>The allegations are outside the scope of the two other
police probes opened earlier this year into phone hacking and
police bribery. </p>
<p>Tuleta began following allegations by Ian Hurst, a former
British Army intelligence officer. Hurst on Aug. 1 sued News
Group, the unit of the New York-based company that publishes the
Sun and formerly the News of the World, claiming it hired a
computer expert to hack into his e-mail, according to his
lawyer, Mark Lewis. </p>
<p>News International declined to comment via e-mail when
asked about computer hacking. Regarding the statements to
parliament, the company said, We recognize the seriousness of
materials disclosed to the police and parliament and are
committed to working in a constructive and open way with all the
relevant authorities. </p>
<p>In the U.S., Manhattan federal prosecutors have joined the
inquiry into allegations that News Corp.''s American marketing
arm hacked a password-protected website at Floorgraphics Inc.,

<p>BofA Said to Weigh Foreclosure Accord Allowing New York Probe </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. may settle a state and federal probe
of foreclosure practices in a deal that lets New York proceed
with an inquiry into securitizations, according to two people
with direct knowledge of the talks. </p>
<p>The firm may pursue an accord with most of the 50 state
attorneys general, even if it omits New York''s Eric Schneiderman
and at least two other states that are opposed because a deal
would impede related inquiries, said one of the people.
Negotiations on a broad settlement stalled after Schneiderman
indicated he wouldn''t let it block his probe into the bundling
and sale of mortgages, said the people, who declined to be
identified because talks are private. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan, seeking to
reverse a 44 percent stock slide this year, has booked about $30
billion in settlements and writedowns to clean up mortgage
liabilities at the biggest U.S. bank since the start of 2010.
One of the largest legal matters still pending is the multi-
state probe into whether firms servicing mortgages used bogus
documents to justify foreclosures. </p>
<p>They need to resolve this because it''s looming out there
as an unknown liability, said Brian Chappelle, a partner at
mortgage-finance consultancy Potomac Partners LLC in Washington
and former executive at the Mortgage Bankers Association. It''s
harming the housing recovery because the large institutions are
reluctant to originate new loans because of the uncertainty. </p>
<p>Bank of America executives, concerned that a delay in
resolving the case is hurting the firm''s stock, are open to a
deal that would resolve most of it, even if some mortgage
investigations continue, said one of the people. The bank has
been pushing for liability releases for loan activities besides
servicing, such as securitization and lending. </p>
<p>Attorneys general from Delaware, Massachusetts and Nevada
have also voiced concern that a proposed settlement would
protect banks from mortgage investigations that aren''t yet
finished. Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, whose
office sued Bank of America and is conducting civil and criminal
foreclosure probes, said in an interview this week that she will
be very cautious about agreeing to a settlement that hinders
those inquiries. </p>
<p>Danny Kanner, a spokesman for Schneiderman, and Melissa
Karpinsky, a spokeswoman for Massachusetts Attorney General
Martha Coakley, declined to comment on Bank of America''s
settlement talks. Edie Cartwright, a spokeswoman for Masto,
didn''t comment. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Delaware Attorney
General Beau Biden, didn''t respond to an e-mail. </p>

<p>Judge to Review Madoff Trustee''s Anti-Class Action Lawsuit </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said he will decide if the
liquidator of Bernard Madoff''s firm may stop a class-action
lawsuit against directors and advisers of so-called feeder fund
Thema International Fund Plc, according to a court filing Aug.
16 in Manhattan. </p>
<p>Trustee Irving Picard sued the class-action plaintiffs in
April, claiming they were undermining the U.S. bankruptcy
court''s jurisdiction over Madoff''s estate. They said Picard was
trying to commandeer their claims by suing some of the same
defendants and wouldn''t share any recoveries with them. </p>
<p>The case is Picard v. Repex, 11-cv-03477, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Mining Executive Kuhn Declared Fugitive by EPA over Dumping </p>
<p>Former mining-company executive Peter Kuhn was declared a
fugitive by the Environmental Protection Agency after he failed
to turn himself in for his role in a conspiracy to illegally
dispose of arsenic and lead. </p>
<p>Kuhn, former president of Reno, Nevada-based French Gulch
Nevada Mining Corp. and Bullion River Gold Corp. (BLRVQ), engaged in a
conspiracy to dump mining wastes on a hillside, county road and
stream near a company mine, the EPA said yesterday in a
statement. If convicted, Kuhn faces a possible prison term of 20
years. </p>
<p>On July 1, 2010, a U.S. District Court grand jury in the
Eastern District of California returned an indictment charging
Kuhn with one count of conspiracy and other crimes. Kuhn, 56,
becomes the 18th fugitive listed by the agency, according to the
EPA''s website. </p>

<p>Gundlach Denies DoubleLine Fund Is Turbo-Charged'' With Risk </p>
<p>DoubleLine Capital LP''s Jeffrey Gundlach denied that his
total-return fund is turbo-charged with risky securities,
saying his management strategy is similar to what he used at TCW
Group Inc. before he was fired in 2009. </p>
<p>Under questioning by TCW''s lawyer in his fourth day of
testimony at a jury trial in Los Angeles, the money manager said
yesterday the way the different kinds of securities are put
together in the bond fund determines what risk there is rather
than the type of security by itself. </p>
<p>With respect sir, you don''t know what you''re talking
about, Gundlach told lawyer John Quinn. </p>
<p>Los Angeles-based TCW fired Gundlach, 51, in December 2009
and sued him the following month after more than half of its
fixed-income professionals joined his new firm. TCW, a unit of
Paris-based Societe Generale SA, seeks $375 million in damages,
claiming Gundlach stole its trade secrets, including client
portfolio data, to start DoubleLine. </p>
<p>Gundlach, who had worked at TCW for 25 years and who was
named Morningstar''s Fixed Income Manager of the Year in 2006,
countersued, saying TCW fired him to avoid having to pay
management and performance fees for the distressed-asset funds
his group managed and that went through the roof. Gundlach
seeks about $500 million. </p>

<p>Wells Fargo Reaches Accord With Connecticut Over Home Loans </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) will consider about 1,535 Connecticut
mortgages for modification as part of an agreement with the
state on adjustable-rate loans, the state''s attorney general
said. </p>
<p>The accord resolves claims that Wachovia Corp. and Golden
West Financial Corp. violated state consumer protection laws,
Attorney General George Jepsen said yesterday in a statement.
The banks failed to adequately inform borrowers that minimum
payments on pick-a-payment-type mortgages wouldn''t cover
interest due, causing the balance to grow, Jepsen said. </p>
<p>I want to stress that Wells Fargo inherited this problem
when it acquired Wachovia and Golden West, Jepsen said. San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo bought Wachovia and its Golden West
unit in 2008. </p>
<p>To resolve the investigation, the bank also agreed to pay
Connecticut $741,465 to support the state''s foreclosure-
prevention efforts, Jepsen said. </p>
<p>The Connecticut accord is the 11th such agreement by the
lender, which has also settled with California, Texas, Florida,
Illinois, New Jersey and five other states. </p>
<p>Jiau Loses Bid to Reverse Conviction in Insider-Trading Case </p>
<p>Winifred Jiau, a former consultant with expert networking
firm Primary Global Research LLC, lost a post-trial bid to
overturn her convictions on charges related to insider-trading. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff denied Jiau''s motion for an
acquittal or a new trial in federal court in Manhattan, where
she was convicted June 20 of conspiracy and securities fraud. </p>
<p>The jury found her guilty of passing information regarding
earnings and other matters on Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Marvell
Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) to hedge fund managers Noah Freeman, a
former SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio manager, and Samir
Barai, founder of New York-based Barai Capital Management LP. </p>
<p>Jiau, of Fremont, California, faces as long as 25 years in
prison when she is sentenced by Rakoff. </p>

director of JPMorgan in Johannesburg, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. The lender, which has been in South Africa
since 1998, already offers clients services such as advice on
mergers and acquisitions and on debt and stock offerings. It
doesn''t plan to compete with South African banks, he added. </p>
<p>We''re broadening our products and services, von Glehn
said. We have lots of big multinationals doing business all
over Africa and in South Africa and we''re in Africa so it makes
enormous sense to be their partners. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has made expanding
overseas a priority as growth in the U.S. and Europe stalls.
South Africa''s economy is forecast to grow 3.7 percent this
year, according to the central bank. JPMorgan, the top-ranked
adviser on mergers globally, is also trying to add clients as
its share of South Africa''s market for stock offerings shrinks. </p>
<p>The bank, the top-ranked adviser on stock offerings in
South Africa between 2001 and 2004, fell every year to ninth
position last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This year it doesn''t feature at all in the equity rankings. In
mergers, JPMorgan worked with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) on its
acquisition of a 16.5 billion-rand ($2.32 billion) stake in
South African retailer Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM), a deal which
started last year and was approved in May. </p>
<p>Gaining Market Share </p>
<p>Competitors such as BNP Paribas (BNP) SA and Citigroup Inc. (C) are
gaining market share and are the two top-ranked stock
underwriters in Africa''s largest economy this year.
Johannesburg-based Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) has worked with parent
Barclays Plc (BARC) to net 37 debt underwriting assignments in 2011. </p>
<p>Transactions may come from working more closely with South
African companies, Von Glehn said. Banks, retailers and mining
companies are all expanding across the continent with South
Africa home to some of the world''s biggest metals producers
including Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Gold Fields Ltd. </p>
<p>The mining sector is certainly an area we''re going to be
focusing on, he said. We''ll be looking at the blue chips, the
top 40.'''' </p>
<p>Companies have held nine share sales for a combined total
of $1.4 billion in South Africa this year, according to
Bloomberg data. That compares with 21 offerings valued at $4.5
billion in total last year. In the year to date South African
companies have also proposed 156 takeovers valued at 81.8
billion rand, compared with 195 mergers in the first three
quarters of 2010 which were valued at almost 130 billion rand. </p>
<p>A lot of deals are taking longer to close than we had
hoped but it probably means next year will be exciting, Von
Glehn said. The difficulty closing is a function of markets
being wobbly, concerns about economic growth and a lack of
confidence. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for
global growth this year, citing an insufficient policy
response to Europe''s sovereign debt crisis, weakened confidence
and the prospect of fiscal tightening. </p>
<p>The bank estimates expansion of 3.9 percent, down from a
previous forecast of 4.2 percent, according to an e-mailed
report dated today. Morgan Stanley cut its China growth forecast
for next year and Deutsche Bank AG reduced its estimates for the
nation for 2011 and 2012. </p>
<p>The threat to the global economy from the debt burdens of
developed nations from the U.S. to Europe has roiled world
markets this month and wiped trillions of dollars off the value
of equities. At the same time, slowing expansions in countries
including Germany, the key driver of European growth, are
hurting confidence. </p>
<p>The U.S. and Europe are dangerously close to
recession, Morgan Stanley analysts including Chetan Ahya said
in the note. Recent policy errors, especially Europe''s slow
and insufficient response to the sovereign crisis and the drama
around lifting the U.S. debt ceiling, have weighed down on
financial markets and eroded business and consumer confidence. </p>
<p>The MSCI All-Country World Index slid 0.7 percent to 305.64
as of 4:24 p.m. in Hong Kong, set for the steepest drop since
Aug. 10. </p>
<p>Stagnating'' Economies </p>
<p>In the euro area, broadly stagnating growth later this
year and in early 2012 will mean that it won''t take much to
tip the balance towards recession, especially as a final
resolution of the debt crisis -- in the form of fiscal transfers
or common bond issuance -- is likely to be very slow in
coming, the Morgan Stanley economists wrote. </p>
<p>The bank cut an estimate for China''s growth next year to
8.7 percent from 9 percent. Deutsche Bank trimmed a prediction
for this year to 8.9 percent from 9.1 percent, and a forecast
for 2012 to 8.3 percent from 8.6 percent, in a report dated
yesterday. </p>
<p>In the near term, the single most important shock to the
Chinese economy will be the likely slowdown -- or even recession
-- of the EU and U.S. economies, Deutsche Bank economist Ma
Jun said in a note. </p>
<p>Hong Kong will have a shallow recession with the
economy contracting in the third quarter from the previous three
months after already shrinking in the second quarter, Morgan
Stanley said in another e-mailed note today. </p>
<p>Western demand will shrink as they need to tighten their
fiscal policies, Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said in
Hong Kong yesterday. </p>
<p>Merkel, Sarkozy </p>
<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy this week ruled out steps such as the issuance
of euro bonds or expanding a bailout fund to counter the
European debt crisis. Pacific Investment Management Co., the
world''s biggest bond fund manager, said that European
politicians should let Greece, Ireland and Portugal default
while taking steps to ensure Italy and Spain won''t. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley cut its estimate for growth in the Group of
10 nations to 1.5 percent this year and next, down from previous
forecasts of 1.9 percent in 2011 and 2.4 percent in 2012,
today''s report showed. </p>
<p>A negative feedback loop between weak growth and soggy
asset markets now appears to be in the making in Europe and the
U.S., the analysts said. This should be aggravated by the
prospect of fiscal tightening in the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>France''s growth stalled in the second quarter, while the
German economy gained 0.1 percent from the first quarter. In the
U.S., the Federal Reserve has pledged to keep interest rates at
a record low through mid-2013, indicating that the world''s
biggest economy will continue to need support. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), ranked by Global
Custodian magazine as the second-largest prime broker worldwide,
named Mehdee Reza as Asia head of the business that provides
services to hedge funds. </p>
<p>Reza, currently Hong Kong-based head of Asian generalist
cash sales at the New York-based bank, will take up the new job
in late September, Morgan Stanley confirmed in an e-mailed
response to a Bloomberg News query. </p>
<p>Global investors added $2.6 billion to hedge funds focused
on Asia, pushing regional industry assets to $89.5 billion at
the end of the second quarter, a post-2007 high, according to
Chicago-based data provider Hedge Fund Research Inc. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. each had 179
hedge fund mandates in Asia with the former''s estimated $23.4
billion of client assets closing gap with Goldman Sachs'' $23.7
billion, said an AsiaHedge survey published in May. </p>
<p>In his new role, Reza will take charge of prime brokerage
sales, capital introduction and client services in the region
which includes Japan and Australia, the e-mail said. Prime
brokers'' capital introduction teams link hedge funds with
potential investors. </p>
<p>Reza will report to Alex Ehrlich, Morgan Stanley''s global
head of prime brokerage in New York, and to Ed Sisterson,
regional head of equity financing products in Hong Kong, the e-
mail said. </p>
<p>Global Franchise </p>
<p>Reza joined Morgan Stanley''s London office as a generalist
sale person in 2005 after a stint as a partner of an
unidentified London-based hedge fund, according to the e-mail.
He had spent eight years with Credit Suisse Group AG in Hong
Kong before that, heading the regional banks research team, it
added. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s Asian prime brokerage business is a
critical part of our growing global franchise, Ehrlich said in
the e-mail. Mehdee''s wealth of experience in Asia and
specifically with Asian hedge funds will help ensure we continue
to offer the very best services to our global and regional
client base. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley commanded nearly 12 percent of the global
prime brokerage market by assets, second to Goldman Sachs'' 13
percent, with Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank AG trailing by
about 1 percentage point, according to the survey by Global
Custodian released in June. </p>

<p>The European Central Bank may cut
interest rates next year amid a dire economic outlook,
Morgan Stanley economists said after reducing their euro-area
growth forecasts. </p>
<p>Slower growth, falling capacity utilization and rising
unemployment will likely put a dampener on underlying inflation
in the euro area, economists including Elga Bartsch wrote in a
research note to clients. A benign inflation outlook would
allow the ECB to reverse the course of its monetary action and
start to cut interest rates in early 2012 when inflation falls
meaningfully below 2 percent. </p>
<p>At the same time, the possibility of the ECB raising
rates once more in October cannot be completely dismissed yet,
they said. President Jean-Claude Trichet has indicated the bank
is still in tightening mode and stressed that interest rates can
change independently from liquidity measures, the economists
wrote. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley predicted the ECB will lower its benchmark
rate -- currently at 1.5 percent -- to 1 percent by the end of
2012. The economists cut their euro-area growth forecasts to 1.7
percent for this year and 0.5 percent for next year from 2
percent and 1.2 percent respectively. </p>
<p>While not our base case at this stage, we see a material
risk of outright recession, they said. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) has developed a computer chip inspired by the human brain
that may predict tsunamis and highlight risks in financial markets. </p>
<p>The technology, called cognitive computing, is programmed
to recognize patterns, make predictions and learn from mistakes,
human-like capabilities not possible using today''s best
computers. It''s a sharp departure from traditional chip design
concepts, IBM said in a statement today. </p>
<p>Systems built with the new chip can synthesize events
currently occurring and make decisions in real time, the Armonk,
New York-based company said. Sponsored by the U.S. Department of
Defense, IBM has received $21 million more in funding after
today''s developments to bring the technology to applications.
The advancement marks the end of a conceptual phase and
initiates the first step to find out how to bring the chips to
scale for production, said Kelly Sims, an IBM spokeswoman. </p>
<p>We''re inventing a new system, changing the game,
Dharmendra Modha, the project''s leader, said in an interview.
It''s a new generation of computers, bypassing the hurdles
faced by today''s computers. </p>
<p>While current computers handle commands individually on a
linear if/then basis, Modha said machines equipped with the new
chips will rewire themselves on the fly. Without any set
programming, the devices reach decisions through integrated
memory, computation and communication cores that resemble
synapses, neurons and axons, respectively, in the brain''s
nervous system. The sensor network is three times larger than
any ever created, he said. </p>
<p>Reacting to Surroundings </p>
<p>Cognitive computers may react to taste, touch, smells and
sound, Modha said, while consuming less power and volume than
today''s technology. </p>
<p>The core of the device has 3.8 million transistors in a 4.2
millimeters square of silicon, a tiny scale for what the chip
accomplishes, said Richard Doherty, research director at
Seaford, New York-based Envisioneering Group, a technology
assessment firm. </p>
<p>Research like this has been going on for decades, but
this marks the beginning of commerce, industry and profits for
cognitive computing, Doherty said in an interview. They''re
going to be more like humans and primates than ever before. </p>
<p>Current chips using 2 billion transistors couldn''t perform
similar tasks, he said, and they''d have to be 10 times as large. </p>
<p>We''re giving birth to a new type of architecture-enabling
applications to ask computers to help us with today, Modha
said. </p>
<p>Potential Uses </p>
<p>Some of that help may come, for example, in the form of
predicting tsunamis or creating financial opportunities, he
said. By constantly recording and reporting temperature,
pressure, wave height and ocean tides, such a system could issue
a warning for giant waves based on its decision making. </p>
<p>In a financial sense, it would be looking not for micro
opportunities, but a macro pattern that spots anomalies, risks,
and creates new possibilities, he said. </p>
<p>The technology also might be used in a doctor''s glove,
providing real-time patient data during surgery based on the
body''s texture, smell and temperature. </p>
<p>The impact of this is inevitable, but the timing is
unpredictable, Modha said. As a civilization we''re computing
with half a brain, and now we''re bringing forth that other half
to complement it. </p>

<p>A one-atom-thick layer of carbon may
one day help International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and the U.S.
military build more precise radar and computers that operate at
near the speed of light. </p>
<p>Physicists Konstantin Novoselov, 36, and Andre Geim, 52, at
the University of Manchester in the U.K., have found a way to
manipulate how graphene, the thinnest and toughest material ever
produced, conducts electricity, a breakthrough that opens the
door to its use in digital electronics. </p>
<p>Because graphene conducts electricity 30 times faster than
silicon -- approaching the speed of light, according to the
researchers -- the finding may be used by companies such as IBM
to speed up computers. The material was first isolated by the
two Russian-born scientists in 2004, and they were awarded a
Nobel Prize last year. The latest research was published last
week in the journal Science. </p>
<p>They''ve observed a phenomenon that was unattainable
previously, said Yu-Ming Lin, an IBM researcher who developed
the first integrated circuit from wafer-size graphene in June.
The Armonk, New York-based company, which funded the study along
with Samsung Electronics Co. and the U.S. Air Force and Navy,
will now consider how to use graphene in semiconductors and
computers, he said. </p>
<p>Until recently, use of graphene was limited to development
of more-efficient batteries and foldable touch screens, items
that didn''t require scientists to be able to stop and start the
movement of electrons in the material. Novoselov and Geim were
able to control the current by suspending two layers of graphene
in a vacuum, reordering the electronic structure. </p>
<p>New-Type Transistors'' </p>
<p>The finding may lead to completely new types of
transistors, Novoselov said in a telephone interview. You
can probably start using it for computer chips, but we believe
we have something different, bigger here. </p>
<p>The finding is bringing people''s attention back to
graphene, and spurring a new look at whether the material is
usable in digital widgets, IBM''s Lin said. </p>
<p>The international market for graphene-based products may
reach $675 million by 2020, Wellesley, Massachusetts-based BCC
Research LLC estimated in February, when the material''s use as a
semiconductor was considered impossible. If the new research
leads to semiconductor devices, graphene would be entering what
the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association said was
a $298.3 billion industry worldwide in 2010. </p>
<p>Within the next couple years you will hear a lot about
transistors based on bilayer graphene, Geim said in an e-mail.
It will be a very long road to graphene integrated circuits. </p>
<p>Mobile Phones, Radar </p>
<p>IBM, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense''s Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, is researching the material''s
ability to create more-efficient mobile phones, clearer wireless
signals, and better radar, Lin said. The material''s magnetic
traits may also enable IBM to utilize high frequency waves for
medical devices that would spot diseases early on, Lin said. </p>
<p>Novoselov and Geim are part of a $1.4 billion effort put
together by nine European organizations, including the
University of Cambridge and Finland-based Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), to research
graphene. Geim and Novoselov discovered graphene by extracting
the material from a piece of graphite such as is found in
ordinary pencils, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said
last year when announcing the scientists won the Nobel in
Physics. </p>
<p>Nokia Research </p>
<p>Nokia, the world''s largest maker of mobile phones by
volume, is investigating the material''s potential use in cell
phones, touch screens, and printed electronics. Graphene as a
cheap replacement for current touch screen technology is right
around the corner, said Jani Kivioja, a research leader at Nokia
whose team develops graphene''s electronic sensing ability. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and other employees hired
attorneys this year when the U.S. began a probe of matters
raised by the Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. </p>
<p>Attorney General Eric H. Holder said on May 3 that the
Justice Department was reviewing an April report on the
financial crisis by the Permanent Subcommittee, led by Carl M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat, and Thomas A. Coburn, Republican of
Oklahoma. The report accused Goldman Sachs of misleading clients
about complex mortgage-related investments in 2007, and Levin
alleged that Blankfein misled Congress. </p>
<p>As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other
individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection
with the Justice Department''s inquiry into certain matters
raised in the PSI report hired counsel at the outset, the
company said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs fell 4.7 percent in New York trading on
concern that Blankfein''s hiring of a criminal defense attorney
could mean the firm will face more legal woes. He has been
represented by Reid H. Weingarten, a partner at Steptoe 
Johnson LLP in Washington, since the Justice Department inquiry
began, according to a person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Weingarten is a friend of Holder''s, with whom he helped
found the nonprofit See Forever Foundation, according to
Weingarten''s biography on Steptoe  Johnson''s website. </p>
<p>Wall Street''s Role </p>
<p>Blankfein, 56, hasn''t been charged with wrongdoing amid
federal probes of Wall Street''s role in the housing boom and
credit crisis. Goldman Sachs is paying Blankfein''s legal costs,
according to the bank. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has said the testimony its employees gave to
the Permanent Subcommittee was truthful and accurate and this
is confirmed by the subcommittee''s own report. </p>
<p>Reuters reported yesterday that Blankfein had hired
Weingarten, citing an unidentified government source. The report
contributed to the decline in Goldman Sachs''s stock, which
closed at $106.51 on the New York Stock Exchange and has dropped
37 percent this year. </p>
<p>The fact that the attorney was hired months ago rather
than recently moderates the impact and implications of the
story, William Tanona, an analyst at UBS AG who has a buy
rating on the stock, wrote in a note yesterday. Still these
continued distractions increase the probability of a management
reshuffle over the next few years, which will undoubtedly cause
some investor angst. </p>
<p>Built a Reputation </p>
<p>Weingarten won the acquittal in May of Lauren Stevens, a
former GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) attorney accused of impeding a U.S.
Food and Drug Administration investigation. He also represented
Elizabeth Monrad, the former chief financial officer at General
Reinsurance Corp. who was convicted in an accounting fraud
scandal. She won a retrial earlier this month. </p>
<p>Weingarten previously represented former WorldCom CEO
Bernard Ebbers, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison after he
was convicted of an $11 billion fraud. He defended former Enron
Chief Accounting Officer Richard Causey, who was sentenced to 5
1/2 years in prison. </p>
<p>Alisa Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment. Weingarten didn''t respond to e-mail and phone
messages requesting comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
subpoenaed earlier this year by the Manhattan District
Attorney''s office for information related to the Permanent
Subcommittee''s report, a person familiar with the matter said in
early June. </p>

<p>As markets convulsed in September
2008, Morgan Stanley (MS) Treasurer David Wong briefed the Federal
Reserve on a dark scenario in which the U.S. firm would need
at least $10 billion of emergency loans from the central bank. </p>
<p>It got 10 times darker by month''s end. Morgan Stanley
borrowed $107.3 billion, the most of any bank, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg News using information released in
response to Freedom of Information Act requests, related court
orders and an act of Congress. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s borrowing -- more than twice the amount
all banks got from the Fed in the market squeeze that followed
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- peaked after hedge funds
pulled $128.1 billion from the firm in two weeks, documents
released by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission show. </p>
<p>The first comprehensive examination of the Fed''s emergency
lending reveals how close the New York-based bank came to
running out of cash because of a run on its prime brokerage, the
unit that finances hedge funds'' trades and holds their cash and
securities. The Fed loans also show the degree to which Morgan
Stanley and other banks depended on such brokerage accounts for
funding, even though clients could close them on short notice. </p>
<p>These were like hot-money deposits that could flee in an
instant, said Tanya Azarchs, a former Standard  Poor''s
analyst who covered Morgan Stanley during the crisis and is now
a consultant in Briarcliff Manor, New York. The firm never
thought that the hedge funds would get that spooked. </p>
<p>29,346 Pages </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s Fed loans -- tallied in a Bloomberg News
database assembled from government records of more than 21,000
transactions and 29,346 pages -- open a window on Wall Street''s
secretive, lucrative and risky dealings with hedge funds. </p>
<p>(View the Bloomberg interactive graphic to chart the Fed''s
financial bailout.) </p>
<p>The bank never told investors about the extent of its Fed
borrowings, even as they rose to the most in the 97-year history
of emergency lending by the U.S. central bank. Citigroup Inc. (C),
the New York-based lender whose balance sheet is more than twice
the size of Morgan Stanley''s, was the second-largest Fed
borrower, with a balance of $99.5 billion in January 2009. </p>
<p>At the peak of Morgan Stanley''s Fed borrowings, on Sept.
29, 2008, the firm reported that liquidity was strong,
without mentioning how dependent its cash stores had become on
the government lifeline. Liquidity refers to the daily funds a
bank needs to operate, including cash to cover withdrawals. </p>
<p>Black Box'' </p>
<p>Neither Morgan Stanley nor its competitors in prime
brokerage -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
Citigroup and Credit Suisse Group AG -- disclose the size of
their hedge-fund balances, leaving shareholders dependent on
regulators who previously failed to rein in the risks. </p>
<p>It remains a black box, said Adam Hurwich, a former
member of the Financial Accounting Standards Board''s Investors
Technical Advisory Committee who''s now a portfolio manager at
New York-based investment firm Ulysses Management LLC. They
don''t give you the information to be able to decipher whether
they have changed anything. </p>
<p>Prime brokers facilitate short trades, the sale of borrowed
stock in the hope of buying it back later at a lower price. They
also make margin loans to finance stock purchases. In exchange,
hedge funds usually keep their cash and stock in accounts at the
prime-brokerage companies. </p>
<p>Frozen Assets </p>
<p>Few analysts understood how dependent the brokerages had
become on such balances as a cheap source of funding, said Frank Suozzo, a former head of growth financial-services research at
AllianceBernstein LP. </p>
<p>Prime brokerage was presumed to be a pretty secure
business, where the funding was not actually part of the
liquidity of the bank, said Suozzo, now president of advisory
firm FXS Capital LLC in Goldens Bridge, New York. So if
clients pulled their money out, the view was that money had not
been lent out, so the cash would have been sitting there able to
hand over. It turns out that that was not entirely correct. </p>
<p>In reality, prime brokers were able to reuse clients''
assets to raise cash for their own activities, the financial
crisis commission wrote in its final report, published in
January. Azarchs said that in her years covering Morgan Stanley
for SP she never heard executives discuss the risk that the
funding might evaporate. </p>
<p>Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.''s bankruptcy changed matters
when it froze at least $65 billion of assets held by that firm''s
London-based prime brokerage. For hedge funds, it was a lesson
not to bank with companies perceived to be at risk of failure,
according to the commission report. So hedge funds moved quickly
to pull their money from Morgan Stanley, viewed as the next
weakest securities firm after Lehman, according to the report. </p>
<p>Unregulated, Unrated </p>
<p>Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to
disclose the bank''s current hedge-fund balances. </p>
<p>The financial crisis of 2008 causedthe industry to
fundamentallyre-evaluate the way it manages liquidity, Lake
said. We have taken the lessons we learned from that period
and applied them toour liquidity-management program to protect
both our franchise and our clients going forward. </p>
<p>Lake wouldn''t say what practices the firm has changed. </p>
<p>Hedge funds are mostly private, unregulated and unrated
investment pools that often try to increase trading returns by
supplementing their own capital with stock and cash borrowed
from Wall Street''s prime-brokerage divisions. </p>
<p>Prime-Brokerage Revenue </p>
<p>The world''s 10 largest investment banks garnered about $10
billion in revenue from prime brokerage in 2010, almost as much
as they made trading stocks, according to London-based research
firm Coalition Development Ltd. The top 25 hedge-fund managers
earned $22.1 billion in 2010, according to AR magazine. </p>
<p>Prior to the crisis, prime brokerage was one of Morgan
Stanley''s most profitable businesses, generating at least $2
billion of revenue a year, according to Brad Hintz, a former
Morgan Stanley treasurer who now follows the firm as an analyst
at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. The bank doesn''t
disclose how much revenue it gets from the business. </p>
<p>Any requirement that prime brokers keep more cash on hand
to survive a hedge-fund run may cut into the profitability of
the business. That''s because cash and Treasury securities that
can be liquidated easily in a squeeze are less profitable to
hold than loans and bonds that pay higher interest rates. Also,
prime brokers may have to issue more long-term debt, which would
force them to pay higher interest rates, said Richard Lindsey, a
former prime-brokerage chief at Bear Stearns Cos. </p>
<p>Infinitely Lived Borrowing'' </p>
<p>The safest way to fund something is to take out long-term
debt or, even better, equity, which is essentially infinitely
lived borrowing, said Lindsey, now principal of Callcott Group
LLC in New York, which advises pension funds and endowments on
portfolio risks. The problem of course is that those are the
most expensive forms of financing. </p>
<p>In July 2008, Morgan Stanley said in a regulatory filing
that its policies were designed to ensure adequate funding
over a wide range of market environments. The firm''s
contingency plan anticipated a potential, prolonged
liquidity contraction over a one-year time period, according
to the filing. Resources included a $5 billion credit line from
a group of banks that could be used in an emergency. </p>
<p>At the end of August, Morgan Stanley had $179 billion of
liquidity, filings show. The firm had $2 billion of Fed loans
outstanding on Aug. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>As of Sept. 29, its liquidity had shrunk 44 percent to
$99.8 billion, according to internal reports released by the
crisis commission. By then, the firm had $107.3 billion of Fed
loans outstanding, the Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Adverse Funding Flows'' </p>
<p>The bank didn''t mention the Fed loans in a press release
about its financial condition that day. Two weeks later, in
another filing, the firm disclosed it was benefiting from
expanded sources of funding and liquidity resulting from the
Fed''s current policies, without specifying the amount. </p>
<p>Staffers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were
astonished at how quickly Morgan Stanley''s cash dwindled, e-
mails released by the crisis commission show. </p>
<p>At 11:05 p.m. on Sept. 15, 2008, William Brodows, a bank
supervision officer at the New York Fed, wrote to colleagues
that Wong, 44, the Morgan Stanley treasurer at the time, and two
other executives had called him at home that night. They wanted
to express their concern that MS had experienced some adverse
funding flows late in the day from prime brokerage accounts,
Brodows, 61, wrote. </p>
<p>Free Credit </p>
<p>Executives had already begun estimating Morgan Stanley''s
potential use of the Fed''s Primary Dealer Credit Facility, a
program created that year to supply emergency funds to
securities firms. Such companies lacked access to the central
bank''s discount window, its last-resort lending program. </p>
<p>In their dark'' scenario, they felt their PDCF usage
would increase to $10-$15 billion, Brodows wrote in the e-
mail. </p>
<p>At 6:59 a.m. the next morning, the concerns were echoed in
an e-mail by Matthew Eichner, 46, then an assistant director at
the Securities and Exchange Commission, to Brodows and other New
York Fed employees. </p>
<p>Definitely some major outflows of PB balances at both GS
($5 b) and MS ($7 b), Eichner wrote, referring to prime-
brokerage balances at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Not
pretty. </p>
<p>It got uglier. At 10:18 p.m. that night, a New York Fed
on-site primary dealer update stated that Morgan Stanley''s
prime brokerage had suffered free credit withdrawals of $20
billion over the last two days, contributing to a $23 billion
decline in the parent company liquidity pool to $106 billion.
Free credit is an industry term for hedge-fund cash balances,
according to Lindsey. </p>
<p>Catastrophic Scenario'' </p>
<p>Two hours later, at 12:30 a.m. on Sept. 17, New York Fed
Senior Vice President Til Schuermann forwarded the update to
Brodows. Under Morgan Stanley''s catastrophic scenario,
Schuermann wrote, they expect to lose $21.5 bn over the first
2 weeks -- not 2 days -- from PB! </p>
<p>Jack Gutt, a spokesman for the New York Fed, declined to
comment. Eichner now works for the Fed in Washington. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s shares fell 24 percent that day, and then-
Chief Executive Officer John Mack sent a memo to the firm''s
46,000 employees saying there is no rational basis for the
movements in our stock. </p>
<p>We''re in the midst of a market controlled by fear and
rumors, and short-sellers are driving our stock down, Mack,
66, wrote, adding that we have talked to Henry Paulson, U.S.
Treasury secretary at the time, and then-SEC Chairman
Christopher Cox about the issue. He reiterated that the firm had
$179 billion of liquidity as of Aug. 31. He didn''t mention that
the figure had since dwindled to $117.7 billion, even as the
firm drew an additional $38.5 billion from the Fed. </p>
<p>Chanos Withdrawal </p>
<p>Jim Chanos, president and founder of New York-based hedge
fund Kynikos Associates LP, which specializes in short selling,
decided to pull $1 billion out of Morgan Stanley because he was
angry that Mack had put out a memo demonizing short sellers, a
person with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>Chanos, 53, has since returned to Morgan Stanley as a
prime-brokerage client, partly because the firm in September
2009 announced that Mack would give up his daily operational
role as CEO, while remaining chairman, the person said. </p>
<p>On Sept. 19, 2008, Citigroup representatives told Fed
staffers that Goldman and Credit Suisse are actively pursuing
Morgan''s prime business clients, according to an internal
report that afternoon. The flows from Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs were coming in so quickly that Citigroup barely had time
to vet the new clients, the report said. </p>
<p>Counterparty Risk </p>
<p>Within a week of Lehman''s bankruptcy, Morgan Stanley had
lost $84.8 billion of prime-brokerage free credits, according to
a Morgan Stanley treasurer''s report released by the crisis
commission. The next week, $43.3 billion more flowed out. </p>
<p>By Sept. 29, the bank was borrowing $61.3 billion from the
PDCF through units in the U.S. and London and getting $36
billion from the Term Securities Lending Facility. The TSLF
allowed broker-dealers to swap mortgage bonds for liquid
Treasuries that could then be sold or pledged for cash close to
their face value. Morgan Stanley also received $10 billion from
the Fed''s single-tranche open-market operations, another
emergency-lending program for broker-dealers. </p>
<p>The firm, which routinely demands collateral from hedge
funds to guard against default, faced a bigger risk when clients
suddenly began worrying the bank might not survive. </p>
<p>This was a world turned on its head, said Bernstein''s
Hintz. Who would have guessed that hedge funds would have
worried about the counterparty risk of Morgan Stanley? Morgan
Stanley worried about the counterparty risks to hedge funds, not
the other way around. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi Stake </p>
<p>The bank''s draws from the Fed began to ebb after Sept. 29,
2008, when the firm announced an agreement for Tokyo-based
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. to invest $9 billion in
Morgan Stanley for a 21 percent equity stake. </p>
<p>This $9 billion investment will further bolster Morgan
Stanley''s strong capital and liquidity positions, the firm
said in a press release that day. </p>
<p>Colm Kelleher, 54, Morgan Stanley''s chief financial officer
at the time, disclosed on Dec. 18, 2008, that the firm''s prime-
brokerage balances had tumbled 46 percent to about $150 billion
as of Nov. 30 from $280 billion on Aug. 31. On a conference call
that day, Kelleher said the erosion was clearly a function of
the downsizing of the hedge-fund business. </p>
<p>Safer Place'' </p>
<p>While many hedge funds have since returned to Morgan
Stanley, the firm doesn''t provide detailed updates on its prime-
brokerage balances. </p>
<p>Prime-brokerage revenues were up significantly over the
previous quarter, while client balances continued to grow
modestly, Ruth Porat, 53, who replaced Kelleher as CFO, said
on a call with investors on July 21, without disclosing amounts. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s liquidity stood at $182 billion as of June
30 and represents 22 percent of total assets, up from 18 percent
just before the crisis. </p>
<p>Nobody could withstand a run on liquidity, except, of
course, the government, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, 53,
said in a May 24 speech in New York. Hopefully we''re in a much
safer place as a result of it. </p>
<p>In a brief interview afterward, Gorman declined to comment
on what changes the firm had made in its prime brokerage. </p>
<p>We give out as much as we feel is appropriate on that
business, he said. </p>
<p>A new rule adopted in December by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision, an international panel of regulators,
requires global banks to keep enough cash or cash-like reserves
on hand to survive a 25 percent run-off of balances in
clearing, custody or cash-management accounts during a
crisis lasting 30 days. The rule doesn''t take effect until 2015. </p>
<p>Almost Impossible'' </p>
<p>While Morgan Stanley''s liquidity has increased, it''s
almost impossible to judge whether it''s enough, Hintz said. </p>
<p>You don''t know whether the liquidity pool is required by
the ratings agencies, or whether it is required by the Federal
Reserve, Hintz said. I suspect there''s something of both.
But it''s a recognition that the old contingency funding plans
had a flaw, and that these events can happen very quickly. </p>
<p>Hedge funds have changed their business practices to
protect themselves from the collapse of a prime broker, limiting
the amount of funding that securities firms can get from such
relationships, said Allan Yip, a former in-house prime-brokerage
lawyer for Bear Stearns. </p>
<p>Repledging Assets </p>
<p>Many funds now restrict the ability of securities firms to
repledge assets to obtain funding, a process known as
rehypothecation, Yip said. More funds stipulate that their
cash must be held in separate bank accounts. </p>
<p>This has been a market-driven change, in terms of what
liquidity can be obtained by the banks, said Yip, who now
advises hedge funds on prime-brokerage and trading documentation
as a partner in London at law firm Simmons  Simmons LLP. </p>
<p>Not that the funds have to worry. It''s probable the central
bank would again lend to a big firm such as Morgan Stanley if
another crisis hit, said Viral Acharya, a New York University
finance professor who serves as an academic adviser to the Fed,
according to the university''s website. </p>
<p>For hedge funds, it''s basically like you get the too-big-
to-fail benefit from being connected to a large financial
firm, Acharya said. If you dealt with a small prime broker,
say a boutique investment firm, it''s unlikely to be bailed
out. </p>

<p>Investor confidence in U.S.
corporate credit deteriorated to the worst level since June 2010
and the cost to protect Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) debt jumped
following a report that Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
hired a defense attorney. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 4 basis points to a
mid-price of 126.8 basis points as of 5:35 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. Credit-
default swaps on Goldman Sachs jumped 40 basis points to 255.4
basis points, the highest level since April 2009, according to
data provider CMA. </p>
<p>Traders earlier pushed down the benchmark gauge of
investment-grade debt risk, which typically falls when investor
confidence improves and rises when it deteriorates, before the
Federal Reserve holds its annual symposium in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming this weekend. The index reversed as credit risk at
finance companies including Bank of America Corp. (BAC) gained. </p>
<p>Monday saw a tug-o-war of themes that pitted financial
sector concerns against bullish sentiment tied to speculation
Bernanke''s speech on Friday will deliver a message of further
stimulus, Adrian Miller, fixed-income strategist at Miller
Tabak Roberts Securities LLC in New York, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The index has soared from 96.3 at the end of July as
investor concern mounted that the global economic recovery is
slowing. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said Blankfein and other people hired
attorneys in relation to a U.S. probe of matters raised by the
Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. </p>
<p>Justice Department </p>
<p>As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other
individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection
with the Justice Department''s inquiry into certain matters
raised in the PSI report hired counsel at the outset, the New
York-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Contracts linked to the debt of Bank of America, based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, added 38.6 basis points to 380.6, the
data show. </p>
<p>Investor confidence in high-yield, high-risk debt plunged
for a third day to the lowest level in almost two years. The
Markit CDX North America High Yield Index, which falls as
investor confidence deteriorates, dropped 0.6 percentage point
to 91.8 percent of face value, the lowest level since Sept. 10,
2009. High-yield, high-risk bonds and loans are rated below Baa3
by Moody''s Investors Service and lower than BBB- by SP. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s largest
software maker, began arguing its U.S. trade case that Android-
based smartphones made by Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. use
technology derived from Microsoft inventions. </p>
<p>In a trial that began today before the International Trade
Commission in Washington, Microsoft accused Motorola Mobility of
infringing seven of its patents and requested a halt to imports
of certain Motorola phones. The ITC has the power to stop
imports of products that violate U.S. patent rights. </p>
<p>The case is the first smartphone dispute to be heard by the
agency since Google Inc. (GOOG) said Aug. 15 it would buy Motorola
Mobility for $12.5 billion to obtain patents that could be used
as a bulwark against a surge of lawsuits targeting handsets and
tablet computers that use Google''s Android operating system. </p>
<p>We have a responsibility to our employees, customers,
partners and shareholders to safeguard our intellectual
property, David Howard, Microsoft''s corporate vice president
and deputy general counsel for litigation, said in an e-mail.
Motorola is infringing our patents and we are confident that
the ITC will rule in our favor. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility is vigorously defending itself
against Microsoft''s patent attack business strategy,
Jennifer Erickson, a Motorola Mobility spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail. We have also brought legal actions of our own in the
U.S. and in Europe to address Microsoft''s large scale of
infringement of Motorola Mobility''s patents. </p>
<p>Smartphone Market </p>
<p>Microsoft''s claim against Libertyville, Illinois-based
Motorola Mobility is one of more than a dozen smartphone cases
before the ITC, as companies seek to use patents to gain a
bigger share of a market projected by researcher IHS Inc. to
reach $206.6 billion this year. Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft makes its own mobile operating system, Windows Phone
7, which competes with Android and Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPhone. </p>
<p>The Android platform accounted for 43.3 percent of the
smartphone market last quarter, according to Stamford,
Connecticut-based research firm Gartner Inc. (IT) Microsoft, with
less than 2 percent of the market, is counting on an agreement
with Espoo, Finland-based Nokia Oyj (NOK) to put Windows Mobile on its
phones to increase market share. </p>
<p>Cases brought by Microsoft and Cupertino, California-based
Apple are targeting devices that run on Android. Microsoft,
which contends all Android devices use its technology, also has
a case against Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS), targeting the Nook reader. </p>
<p>Testimony in today''s Motorola Mobility trial focused on
details about functions that Microsoft calls essential to the
smartphone user experience, including ways to synchronize e-
mail, calendars and contacts; schedule meetings; and notify
applications of changes in signal strength and battery power. </p>
<p>Block Imports </p>
<p>Microsoft has asked the agency to block imports of Motorola
phones including the Droid 2, Droid X, Cliq XT, Devour, Backflip
and Charm. Administrative Law Judge Theodore Essex is scheduled
to release his findings in the case Nov. 4, and the commission
has a target to complete its investigation by March 5, according
to information on the agency''s website. </p>
<p>Mountain View, California-based Google, which wasn''t named
in the complaint, accused Microsoft of disclosing Google''s
source code to a Microsoft expert without first letting Google
know. Essex on Aug. 15 denied Google''s request that sanctions be
imposed on Microsoft, saying Google had failed to provide any
information that it has made a reasonable, good-faith effort
to resolve the matter with Microsoft. </p>
<p>The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Mobile Devices,
Associated Software and Components Thereof, 337-744, U.S.

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s Nigerian unit is
awaiting an arbitration ruling to end its dispute with the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. over entitlements to lift
crude oil from the Erha offshore field. </p>
<p>We can confirm that the arbitration hearing ended in
Abuja on March 2, Nigel Cookey-Gam, an Exxon spokesman in
Nigeria, said today in an e-mailed statement. The parties are
currently awaiting an award by the tribunal. </p>
<p>Exxon, the world''s biggest company, sought arbitration in
2009 after talks with the Nigerian government and the state oil
company, known as NNPC, had been unsuccessful, the statement
said. There''s no specific date yet for the ruling, said Cookey-
Gam. Levi Ajuonuma, a NNPC spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The Erha field, located about 97 kilometers (60 miles)
offshore Nigeria, started production in 2006 and has the
capacity to pump about 190,000 barrels of crude a day. Exxon
Mobil, operator of the field, holds a 56.25 percent interest and
Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Co., a local unit of
Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), holds 43.75 percent. </p>
<p>Nigeria, Africa''s top oil producer, is the fifth-biggest
source of U.S. imports of the fuel. Shell, Exxon, Chevron Corp.,
Total SA and Eni SpA run joint ventures with state-owned NNPC,
which pumps about 90 percent of the country''s crude. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest oil company by market value, estimated the cost to clean
up a July 1 oil spill into the Yellowstone River in Montana will
be $42.6 million, according to a filing with federal regulators. </p>
<p>The company''s emergency response to the spill from the
Silvertip pipeline will cost $40 million and property claims
will be $2.5 million, the company said in a July 29 filing with
the Transportation Department''s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration. Exxon also lost about $100,000 of oil and
other commodities in the spill, according to the document,
obtained by Bloomberg News through a Freedom of Information Act
request. </p>
<p>Exxon''s 69-mile (111-kilometer) Silvertip line spilled an
estimated 1,000 barrels of crude into a flood-swollen
Yellowstone River near Laurel, Montana. The pipeline runs from
Elk Basin, Wyoming to Exxon''s refinery in Billings, Montana. </p>
<p>More than 1,000 people were working to clean up the site as
of Aug. 12, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, which is leading the response effort. Sampling results
for air, water, soil and sediment around the river show no
levels of concern for water supplies or air quality, the
agency said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lowered its
forecast for U.S. economic growth in 2011 on signs the recovery
in the world''s largest economy lost momentum. </p>
<p>The U.S. will expand 1.5 percent this year, down from a
previous forecast of 1.7 percent, Goldman economists in New York
including Jan Hatzius said in a note published on Aug. 19.
Credit Suisse was also among banks lowering growth forecasts this 
month. </p>
<p>Federal Reserve surveys showed manufacturing in
Philadelphia and New York contracted in August, while a Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment
plunged to a three-decade low. Goldman''s change comes amid a
monthlong drop in global equities and as Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke prepares to speak at the bank''s annual symposium in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming this week. </p>
<p>The data are pointing to even weaker growth ahead, the
economists said. While Bernanke is likely to be downbeat about
recent developments, we expect that he will still argue that the
conditions for an acceleration later this year and in 2012
remain in place. </p>
<p>Goldman forecasts third-quarter growth of 1 percent and a
fourth-quarter expansion of 1.5 percent, down from an earlier
projection for 2 percent growth in each quarter. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse lowered its forecast for U.S. third-quarter
growth to 1.5 percent from from 3.3 percent, and for the fourth
quarter to 2.2 percent from 3.1 percent, according to a research
note dated Aug. 18. The bank cut its projection for global
growth to 3.9 percent in 2011 from 4.1 percent. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) predicts 1 percent growth in U.S.
gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, down from an
earlier projection of 2.5 percent, the bank said last week.
Citigroup Inc. (C) lowered its 2011 growth forecast to 1.6 percent
from 1.7 percent. </p>

<p>Charlotte Roche likes to shock. Her
first book, whose teenage heroine is hospitalized with an anal
lesion after an intimate shaving accident, sold more than 2
million copies in German. </p>
<p>Roche, a sparky 33-year-old brunette who combines tattoos
and floral dresses, used to be a music and entertainment
television presenter. </p>
<p>Her second novel, which entered Der Spiegel''s fiction
bestseller list at slot No. 1 this week, is also not for the
fainthearted. It''s titled Schossgebete, a made-up word that
is a play on Stossgebet -- a desperate prayer -- and Schoss,
which can refer to the female reproductive organs though more
generally means the lap area. </p>
<p>Schossgebete opens with 15 pages of pornography,
describing a married couple having sex with the electric
blankets on and the windows closed, as the heroine prefers. </p>
<p>Yet like its predecessor Wetlands, whose yuckiness
cloaks the story of a lost girl trying to reunite her divorced
parents, Schossgebete presents an exhaustively intimate
psychological portrait of a very disturbed young woman. </p>
<p>The reader is forced into voyeurism -- and not just of the
sexual variety -- as Roche bares all in this relentlessly frank,
often funny novel about a troubled 33-year-old traumatized by a
tragedy in her past. The author admitted in an interview with
Spiegel that it is dangerously close to autobiography. </p>

overshadowed concern that banks will be forced to raise capital. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 1.3 basis points to a
mid-price of 125.5 basis points as of 5:27 p.m. in New York,
Markit Group Ltd. data show. The index earlier jumped as much as
4.9 basis points. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) credit swaps declined
after earlier soaring to a record. </p>
<p>Corporate and financial company debt is being whipsawed
before central bankers meet this week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
The credit risk benchmark, which rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, dropped even after a
magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck Virginia and shook buildings in
Washington and New York. </p>
<p>Investor confidence in corporate credit decreased earlier
on concerns about the sovereign situation, concerns about our
own domestic macro situation, John Guarnera, a financial
analyst at Societe Generale SA in New York, said in a telephone
interview. The rise signaled investors were ignoring the fact

where we were coming out of the credit crisis. </p>

points to 378.5 as of 5 p.m. in New York, according to data
provider CMA. That pared an earlier surge to at least 445 basis
points, which exceeded the peak during the financial crisis in
March 2009, JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts wrote in a report. </p>
<p>Irrational'' Valuations </p>
<p>Valuations are becoming irrational, JPMorgan analysts
Kabir Caprihan and Matthew Hughart based in New York wrote in
the report. They changed their view on the debt to neutral
from underweight. </p>
<p>Bank of America credit swaps have more than doubled from
178 basis points at the end of July as concern mounts that the
lender may face larger losses tied to mortgages and will need to
raise additional capital. </p>
<p>Henry Blodget, the former Internet stock analyst turned
blogger, wrote on Business Insider that charges and loan costs
may force the bank to raise as much as $200 billion. </p>
<p>The bank has no reason to raise capital, Rochdale
Securities analyst Richard Bove said in an interview today on
Bloomberg Television''s InBusiness With Margaret Brennan. </p>
<p>Bank of America has so much cash on its balance sheet
that it could pay back all of its short-term debt and a big
chunk of its long-term debt, Bove said. </p>
<p>Goldman Swaps </p>
<p>Contracts on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, fell 10 basis points to 245, according to
data provider CMA. The swaps earlier rose to 283, the highest
level since April 2009. The contracts rose 40 basis points
yesterday, after Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and
others hired attorneys in relation to a U.S. probe of matters
raised by the Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. </p>
<p>U.S. bank bonds are very attractive investments after
declining this month, according to Pacific Investment Management
Co.''s Mark Kiesel. </p>
<p>This is a sector that makes money, has improved
capital, Kiesel, Pimco''s global head of corporate bond
portfolios, said today in a Bloomberg Television interview. </p>
<p>Pimco, the Newport Beach, California-based manager of the
world''s largest bond fund, has been wagering on U.S. bank debt
since at least April 2008, when Kiesel said that big banks would
slim down by raising capital and cutting leverage. Lenders
have improved their balance sheets, making them a safe bet,
Kiesel told Scarlet Fu on the network''s In the Loop program. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), leader of a
group of lenders owed $381.7 million on a bankrupt homebuilding
project in Henderson, Nevada, sued Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH) to
recover the builder''s share of a guarantee. </p>
<p>JPMorgan and other lenders agreed in 2004 to advance as
much as $535 million to builders including Meritage and Beazer
Homes USA Inc. (BZH), taking repayment guarantees from each builder,
according to a complaint filed yesterday in Las Vegas. The share
of Meritage for the loans advanced to date is $13.3 million,
JPMorgan said in the filing as it asked a judge to compel
payment. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has made due demand under the repayment
guaranty, and the defendants have failed and refused to pay
their liabilities, the bank said. </p>
<p>South Edge LLC, which is owned by the builders, is in
bankruptcy court in Nevada. The bankruptcy triggered the
repayment guarantee, JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>Meritage sued the bank Aug. 19 in state court in Ohio,
where the JPMorgan unit that is the trustee for the lenders is
based. Meritage asked a judge to rule the homebuilder doesn''t
have any obligations to the lenders and seeks $8 million in
damages. </p>
<p>Meritage claims that it tried to pay the lenders in April
2008 but JPMorgan refused to accept the payment. </p>
<p>Meritage''s claim for damages is based on losses related to
the drop in value of the property and legal fees, company Chief
Financial Officer Larry W. Seay said today in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>The case is JPMorgan v. Meritage Homes, 11-cv-01364, U.S.
District Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas). </p>

<p>General Motors Co. (GM), the maker of the
plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt, and LG Group have agreed to form
a partnership to design and engineer future electric cars, a
high priority of Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson. </p>
<p>GM, 32 percent owned by the U.S., brings expertise in
vehicles and Seoul-based LG knows how to develop and build
lithium-ion batteries. Closely held LG supplies batteries for
the Volt and the mechanically identical Opel Ampera sold in
Europe. The deal does not involve an exchange of equity, the
companies said today in a statement. </p>
<p>The agreement should help Detroit-based GM stay current on
battery technology and ensure that the company has close
relations with a supplier that can help engineer electric-power
systems, said Michael Robinet, a Northville, Michigan-based vice
president of research firm IHS Automotive. </p>
<p>In tomorrow''s vehicles, customers will look at technology
as a differentiator, Robinet said. Vehicle manufacturers
will be looking to link up with major battery players to ensure
that they have new technology. There will be an interesting
round of musical chairs. </p>
<p>Akerson boosted Volt production plans for next year to
60,000 from 45,000 after exploring an increase to 120,000 of the
plug-in hybrids. This partnership will not make batteries for
the next-generation Volt, Kevin Kelly, a GM spokesman, said in a
telephone interview. </p>
<p>GM slipped 11 cents to $22.26 at 12:02 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 33
percent since a $33 initial public offering in November. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells Fargo
 Co. (WFC) are among banks that made final bids to buy portions of
Anglo Irish Bank Corp.''s $9.65 billion of U.S. property loans,
according to three people with knowledge of the sales. </p>
<p>The lenders are looking to acquire pieces of the $4.52
billion of performing loans the Dublin-based bank is shedding,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
talks are private. Investor groups led by private-equity firms
Blackstone Group LP (BX), working with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), and Lone
Star Funds also submitted offers for parts of the portfolio,
which include $5.13 billion of subperforming and non-performing
debt, the people said. </p>
<p>Banks like Wells and JPMorgan can afford to pay more than
a nonbank for the performing loans, said Ben Thypin, director
of market analysis for Real Capital Analytics Inc., a property-
research firm in New York. Private-equity firms like
Blackstone and Lone Star can bid aggressively on the
nonperforming pieces because they have a large workout
infrastructure in place. </p>
<p>Anglo Irish is seeking to unload loans after being seized
by the Irish government in January 2009 amid a surge in souring
debt. The offering includes loans backed buildings from
Manhattan to Beverly Hills, California. The competition
underscores the appetite for real estate loans by private-equity
firms and banks looking to grow their assets even amid signs
that the global economic recovery is stalling. </p>
<p>Martha Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Anglo Irish, declined to
comment on the bids, as did spokesmen for New York-based
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. </p>
<p>Board to Discuss </p>
<p>Final bids were submitted this week and a winner is
expected to be chosen by early next week, according to the
people. Anglo Irish''s board of directors is likely to discuss
the final bids at a meeting today in advance of tomorrow''s
release of first-half results, according to a person familiar
with the matter, who asked not be identified because the
information is private. </p>
<p>JPMorgan and Wells Fargo may hold the loans for their own
books or package them for sale as bonds if investor demand for
commercial-mortgage backed securities, or CMBS, is sufficient,
said one of the people. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo bought a
$1.4 billion portfolio of 25 loans from Bank of Ireland Plc on
properties in Boston, New York and Washington, according to Alan Elias, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based bank. The lender
also bought part of Allied Irish Banks LLC''s $1 billion loan
portfolio, Elias said. Blackstone purchased the other piece. </p>
<p>Financing Possible </p>
<p>JPMorgan and Wells Fargo may finance the purchase of the
some pools, the people said. A syndicate of lenders including
Bank of America Corp., RBC Capital Markets, Citigroup Inc. and
Macquarie Bank Ltd. are also vying for the assignment, the
people said. </p>
<p>Eastdil Secured LLC and FTI Consulting Inc. (FCN) are advising
Anglo Irish on the sale, the people said. The portfolio has been
divided into eight pools, according to an offering document from
Eastdil. </p>
<p>Representatives of Blackstone, Lone Star, Deutsche Bank,
Citigroup, Bank of America, RBC Capital and Macquarie declined
to comment on the deal. Calls to Eastdil weren''t returned. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) and Lone Star Funds won the bidding for Anglo Irish Bank
Corp.''s $9.65 billion portfolio of U.S. real estate loans,
according to three people briefed on the auction''s results. </p>
<p>JPMorgan and Wells Fargo each won pools of mainly
performing loans, said one of the people, who asked not to be
named because the results haven''t been made public. Lone Star,
the Dallas-based investor in distressed mortgages, will buy
subperforming and nonperforming loans that account for about
half of the portfolio, the person said. </p>
<p>The auction, which included loans backed by buildings from
Manhattan to Beverly Hills, California, underscores the appetite
for property in higher-quality locations by private-equity firms
and banks seeking to expand their assets. The winning bids for
the loans averaged about 80 cents on the dollar, said two of the
people who were told of the results. </p>
<p>If you''re looking at quality assets in good, strong
markets, I''d say 80 cents on the dollar sounds pretty
reasonable, said Tom Craig, founder of TSC Realty Partners, a
commercial-property broker in Seattle who wasn''t involved in the
sale. One of the barriers to entry on a big deal like this is
how many people can put the capital together to buy this and
close quickly. </p>
<p>Blackstone Bid </p>
<p>Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York, and
Alan Elias, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo,
declined to comment, as did Andy Brimmer, a spokesman for Lone
Star. Martha Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Anglo Irish in Dublin,
also declined to comment. </p>
<p>A message for Martha Wallau, a spokeswoman for Eastdil
Secured LLC, the Wells Fargo unit that conducted the auction,
wasn''t returned. </p>
<p>Blackstone Group LP (BX) was a final bidder for at least a
portion of the loans, according to people with knowledge of the
situation. Peter Rose, a spokesman for the New York-based
private-equity firm, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Anglo Irish is seeking to unload loans after being seized
by the Irish government in January 2009 amid a surge in souring
debt. The U.S. loans are backed by properties including the
Apthorp apartments in Manhattan, Chicago''s Palmer House Hilton
hotel and the Two Rodeo Drive shopping center in Beverly Hills. </p>
<p>Anglo Irish expects to complete the U.S. portfolio sale by
year''s end, Tom Hunersen, the bank''s head of corporate
development, said at a press briefing yesterday. </p>
<p>We had a large group of interested parties, Hunersen
said, declining to disclose details of the auction. The bank
achieved the best possible value, he said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley is advising on the
sale of Portugal''s 1.65 billion euro ($2.4 billion) stake in
utility EDP-Energias de Portugal SA, two people with knowledge
of the matter said. </p>
<p>The sale is one of the measures that the government pledged
in exchange for a 78 billion-euro bailout from the European
Union and the International Monetary Fund. With the country''s
borrowing costs surging, Portugal followed Greece and Ireland in
April in seeking a rescue. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho said on June 30 he
planned to sell the stake in EDP in the third quarter. Portugal
holds 25 percent of EDP, although only 20.9 percent of the
utility will be up for sale, as 4.14 percent has been exchanged
for bonds that mature in 2014, Joaquim Reis, chairman of
Portuguese state holding company Parpublica, said in a July 22
interview. The utility was valued at 7.9 billion euros at the
close of trading today. </p>
<p>The utility''s shareholders in a meeting yesterday ended the
state''s golden share veto rights and changed the limits on
voting rights to 20 percent of the company''s stock. EDP''s rules
previously prevented any one investor from voting with more than
5 percent of shares. </p>
<p>Newspaper Expresso reported in July that State Grid Corp.
of China, another Chinese company and Centrais Electricas
Brasileiras SA, a Brazilian electricity company known as
Electrobras, were interested in buying a stake in EDP. </p>
<p>Eletrobras on March 31 had said it was in the technical and
economic analysis stage of a possible investment in EDP. </p>
<p>Newspaper Diario Economico also reported in May that China
Power was interested in EDP. On Aug. 10, China Power
International Development Ltd. said its parent company currently
had no plan to acquire shares in the utility. </p>

<p>The U.S. Treasury Department
announced an $88.3 million settlement with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
for apparent violations of international sanctions programs,
including Cuban assets control and anti-terrorism regulations. </p>
<p>The Treasury said that JPMorgan through its correspondent
banks maintained prohibited financial transactions with
sanctioned entities in countries including Cuba and Iran. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan payment agreed upon by the Office of Foreign
Assets Control, known as OFAC, involves egregious violations
for five years, according to a Treasury Department statement. </p>
<p>The civil settlement resolves a number of OFAC
allegations dating back to 2005, none of which involved any
intent to violate OFAC regulations, Jennifer R. Zuccarelli, a
JPMorgan spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. These
rare incidents were unrelated and isolated from each other. The
firm screens hundreds of millions of transactions and customer
records per day and annual error rates are a tiny fraction of a
percent. </p>
<p>The OFAC enforcement action covers actions from December
2005 to March 2011 involving multiple violations of sanctions
programs, the Treasury said. The violations include processing
1,711 wire transfers totaling $178.5 million from December 2005
to March 2006 involving Cuban persons and a trade loan of $2.9
million with a blocked affiliate to the Islamic Republic of Iran
Shipping Lines. </p>
<p>OFAC said the $88.3 million payment from JPMorgan is based
on the bank''s cooperation, transaction review and the absence of
an OFAC notice or finding of violation during the five years of
the transactions. </p>
<p>Compliance Policy </p>
<p>EPA Delays Mandate to Report Products Leading to Carbon Releases </p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency said it would put off
reporting requirements for manufacturers and power plants on the
products they use that lead to greenhouse-gas emissions. </p>
<p>In a Federal Register notice yesterday, the EPA said that
companies would have until at least 2013 to submit information
about the raw materials. Representatives of chemical makers, oil
refiners and other manufacturers have tried to scuttle the EPA''s
proposal, saying it would force them to disclose confidential
information. </p>
<p>The rules were set to take effect this year. The EPA
proposed in December that they be deferred and yesterday''s
notice makes that decision final. The rules will be delayed
until March 31, 2013, for some substances and two years later
for others. </p>
<p>Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more a year of
greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, are required to submit
annual reports to the EPA on those releases. On Aug. 22, the EPA
started a new program that lets 7,000 power plants, refiners and
other manufacturers file their emissions data electronically.
The information must be submitted by the end of September. </p>
<p>Employers Must Tell Workers of Right to Unionize, NLRB Says </p>
<p>U.S. employers must post notices informing workers about
their legal rights to form a union and bargain on contracts, the
National Labor Relations Board said in a rule that may help
efforts to organize employees. </p>
<p>Companies that use posters to tell employees about
personnel rules or policies must add a notice about their
collective bargaining rights, according to a statement yesterday
from the NLRB. The posting must be completed Nov. 14. </p>
<p>The notice does make it easier for labor to make
inroads, Doreen Davis, a partner in the labor and employment
practice at Morgan, Lewis  Bockius LLP in New York and
Philadelphia, said in an interview. </p>
<p>The board proposed the rule to spell out for employees
their rights under federal laws that let workers choose to form
and join a labor union. Business groups protested the proposal
and said the rule shows that the agency favors unions. </p>
<p>It''s arbitrary, it''s capricious, Peter Schaumber, a
former NLRB chairman appointed by Republican President George W.
Bush, said in an interview. It shows just how activist they''re
prepared to be. </p>
<p>The NLRB rule simply brings the National Labor Relations
Act in line with other workplace laws that require employers to
post a notice in the workplace of their employees'' rights,
Peter Colavito, director of government relations at the 2.2
million-member Service Employees International Union, said in a
statement. </p>

<p>U.S. Banks Said to Seek Relief From Regulators as Deposits Swell </p>
<p>U.S. regulators have asked some banks to take more deposits
from large investors even if it''s unprofitable, and lenders in
return are seeking relief on insurance premiums and leverage
ratios, according to six people with knowledge of the talks. </p>
<p>Deposits are flooding into the biggest U.S. banks as
customers seek shelter from Europe''s debt crisis and falling
stock prices. That forces lenders to raise capital for a growing
balance sheet and saddles them with the higher deposit insurance
payments. With short-term interest rates so low, it''s hard for
financial firms to reinvest the new money profitably. </p>
<p>Regulators have asked banks to take the deposits anyway,
three people said, with one lender accepting $100 billion. The
regulators want lenders to take the deposits because it improves
the stability of the financial system, according to one of the
people, who said U.S. banks are viewed as places of strength. </p>
<p>Some of the largest ones have talked with regulators about
softening rules for ratios that measure capital and assets,
according to the people, who declined to be identified because
talks are private. At least one asked for a waiver on paying
higher premiums to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which is
less likely to be granted, one of the people said. </p>
<p>If the helicopter comes raining money on your bank and
it''s only temporarily there, it could be excessively costly and
disruptive, said Robert Litan, a vice president of research
and policy at the Kansas City, Missouri-based Kauffman
Foundation, which promotes entrepreneurial business practices. </p>
<p>The extra deposits are problematic because they''re subject
to withdrawal, so banks have to park the money in low-yielding
short-term investments, Litan said. With few other choices
available, banks have stashed their excess deposits at the Fed,
which means the cash gets counted as assets. </p>
<p>This expands their balance sheets and thus pushes down
their leverage ratio, which measures Tier 1 capital divided by
adjusted average total assets; the lower the ratio, the weaker
the bank, at least in theory. In reality, regulators regard U.S.
lenders as relatively strong with sufficient capital cushions,
the people said. </p>
<p>Lenders have held discussions with officials at the Fed,
FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Treasury
Department, according to four of the people. Spokesmen for the
four agencies declined to comment. </p>
<p>Shannon Bell, a Citigroup spokeswoman, Howard Opinsky at
JPMorgan, Ancel Martinez at Wells Fargo and Bank of America''s
Jerry Dubrowski declined to comment. </p>
<p>Relaxing the rules or enforcement could be a slippery
slope, said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP LLC,
a Jersey City, New Jersey-based unit of London-based ICAP Plc,
the world''s largest inter-dealer broker. </p>
<p>Asking for a free pass on the leverage ratio for bank
deposits by itself isn''t something that regulators would
consider, Crandall said. The question is whether banks
should be able to exclude reserve balances since they are a
risk-free asset. </p>

<p>Facebook Faces Confusion From Multiple Privacy Agencies, EU Says </p>
<p>Facebook Inc. and other Internet companies face legal
confusion from local and national European regulators with
different approaches to data protection, the European Commission
said. </p>
<p>These differences show the risk that the same company and
services will be treated in an inconsistent manner by different
authorities, said Matthew Newman, a spokesman for the European
Commission, in an e-mail. The Brussels-based regulator will
propose draft rules later this year for all data protection
agencies across the 27-nation bloc to follow. </p>
<p>Facebook''s like button and facial-recognition features were
criticized by two German regional regulators this month, with
officials in Schleswig-Holstein saying the like button may
violate European Union and German data protection law while
Hamburg''s data protection agency said the company may break
privacy rules by recording biometric data. </p>
<p>Facebook is among U.S. companies that have faced scrutiny
in the EU for possible privacy breaches. Google Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) and Yahoo! Inc. have been pushed by European data-
protection officials to limit the amount of time they store
online users'' search records. The group of regulators, known as
the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, has also
criticized Facebook for policy changes that could harm users''
privacy. </p>

<p>National Century''s Poulsen Conviction, 30-Year Term Upheld </p>
<p>A federal appeals court upheld the 30-year prison term of
Lance Poulsen, founder of National Century Financial Enterprises
Inc., as well as his convictions at separate trials on
obstruction of justice and fraud charges. </p>
<p>Poulsen was found guilty by jurors in federal court in
Columbus, Ohio, in October 2008 of fraud, conspiracy and money
laundering for defrauding investors of $2.9 billion. Seven
months earlier, a separate jury convicted him of trying to bribe
the main witness against him. U.S. District Judge Algenon
Marbley sentenced him to 30 years in the fraud case. </p>
<p>The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati
yesterday rejected Poulsen''s claims that Marbley made several
improper rulings at each trial and that his prison term was too
long. Poulsen had said he shouldn''t get a longer sentence than
the chief executive officers of WorldCom Inc. and Enron Corp.,
who got 25 and 24 years, respectively. </p>
<p>Poulsen cites a number of sentences given to those whom
he refers to as the most notorious financial fraudsters in
corporate America,'' according to the opinion by a three-judge
panel of the appeals court. Poulsen presents no coherent
argument as to why his sentence is substantively unreasonable. </p>
<p>Poulsen, 68, is incarcerated at the Williamsburg Federal
Correctional Institution in South Carolina, according to the
U.S. Bureau of Prisons website. His release date is listed on
the site as Dec. 4, 2033. </p>
<p>The appeals panel ruled that Marbley properly determined
the loss to investors as $2.89 billion, even though prosecutors
had said once to jurors that the loss was only over $2
billion. </p>
<p>Poulsen''s attorneys William Terpening and Peter Anderson
didn''t immediately return a call seeking comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>Poulsen''s 30-year term for the fraud case is concurrent
with his earlier 10-year term for the obstruction case. </p>
<p>The appeals are U.S. v. Poulsen, 08-4218 and 09-3658, 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Cincinnati). </p>

<p>Drimal Should Get 70- to 80-Month Prison Term, U.S. Says </p>
<p>Craig Drimal, the former Galleon Group LLC trader who
pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges, should get a prison
term of 70 to 80 months, which is within federal sentencing
guidelines, the U.S. said in a memo. </p>
<p>Drimal pleaded guilty last month in federal court in New
York charges of conspiracy and securities fraud. Drimal admitted
that he and others at Galleon traded on inside information
obtained from lawyers working on transactions involving 3Com
Corp. and Axcan Pharma Inc. in 2007. Drimal said the information
was obtained from Arthur Cutillo and Brien Santarlas, lawyers at
Boston-based Ropes  Gray LLP. </p>
<p>Drimal has suggested that the court impose community
service or home confinement in lieu of a substantial prison
term, prosecutors said. The request should be denied in order to
send a strong message of deterrence to others in the hedge
fund community and because the nature and extent of his
criminal conduct doesn''t warrant community service,
prosecutors said. </p>
<p>Drimal is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge
Richard Sullivan on Aug. 31. Drimal''s attorney, Jane Anne
Murray, said she filed a memorandum last week asking the judge
to impose a sentence below the federal guidelines. </p>
<p>We''re not surprised by their position; it''s been
consistent, Murray said in a telephone interview. We
disagree with the government on a number of issues including the
applicable guidelines. And we''re seeking a sentence that is
substantially lower than the one the government is seeking. </p>
<p>Prosecutors also asked the court to obtain a judgment
against Drimal to recover the amount of the proceeds of his
crimes, which they said are at least $7 million. </p>

to a court filing. </p>
<p>The investors blamed Lehman officers and directors for
losses on Lehman stock and options from June 12, 2007, to Sept.
15, 2008, according to the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. Fuld, 65, was chief executive officer of New York-
based Lehman, once the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank,
before its 2008 bankruptcy. </p>
<p>A bankruptcy examiner said Lehman foundered because of too
much debt, which it tried to hide from investors, and risky real
estate investments. </p>
<p>Patricia Hynes, a lawyer for Fuld, didn''t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>Lehman said in November that Fuld would get $10 million
from insurers as part of an officers-and-directors program
paying for the costs of lawsuits. It also said insurers would be
asked to pay as much as $90 million in costs for unidentified
defendants in civil, criminal and regulatory proceedings. </p>
<p>Lehman has asked the judge to modify bankruptcy law on nine
previous occasions to tap its directors-and-officers insurance,
according to the Aug. 24 filing. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Bank of America Depressed Libor Rates, Schwab Says in Suit </p>
<p>Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW), the largest independent brokerage by
client assets, sued Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. (C) and
other banks claiming they manipulated the London interbank
offered rate, or Libor, starting in 2007 in violation of U.S.
antitrust law. </p>
<p>The lawsuit filed Aug. 23 in federal court in San
Francisco, where Schwab is based, claims the banks conspired to
depress Libor rates by understating their borrowing costs,
thereby lowering their interest expenses on products tied to the
rates. The banks reaped hundreds of millions, if not billions,
of dollars in ill-gotten gains, Schwab wrote. </p>
<p>In separate suits in April, three European asset-management
firms and the Carpenters Pension Fund of West Virginia sued the
banks claiming they manipulated Libor. U.S. and U.K. officials
are cooperating in a probe of possible Libor manipulation, a
person close to the investigation said in March. </p>
<p>The Schwab suit seeks unspecified damages, which may be
tripled under antitrust law. It also includes claims for
racketeering and securities fraud. </p>
<p>Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, and Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a
spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, didn''t immediately
return calls for comment. </p>
<p>The case is Schwab Money Market Fund v. Bank of America
Corp. (BAC), 11-cv-4186, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco). </p>
<p>Guaranty Financial Trustee Suit Accuses KBW of Short Sales </p>
<p>The liquidation trustee for Guaranty Financial Group Inc. (GFGFQ)
sued KBW Inc. (KBW), claiming that the investment bank used inside
information about the Texas lender to short its stock before KBW
collapsed. </p>
<p>Kenneth Tepper, the trustee, is seeking to recover $20
million in fees KBW obtained as Guaranty Financial''s investment
banker, profit it received from betting against the company''s
shares and other damages, according to a suit filed Aug. 24 in
New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>KBW''s disregard of its contractual obligations and
illegal and improper use of GFG''s and the bank''s material, non-
public, confidential, inside information undermined GFG''s
efforts to raise capital, one of the very purposes for which KBW
had been engaged, Tepper alleged. </p>
<p>Guaranty Financial, based in Austin, Texas, filed for
bankruptcy protection in 2009. </p>
<p>Krista Eccleston, a spokeswoman for New York-based KBW,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>The trustee on Aug. 22 sued cardboard-box maker Temple-
Inland Inc., which spun off Guaranty Financial in 2007. </p>
<p>The case is Tepper v. Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Inc.,
652349-2011, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Rouse Properties Inc., the mall
owner that will be spun off from General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP),
plans to spend $230 million on improvements to its malls through
2015 as rents and occupancies fall. </p>
<p>Rouse expects the investment will lift its occupancy rate
to 93 percent and annual net operating income to more than $200
million, the Chicago-based company said in a regulatory filing
today. The occupancy rate was 87.7 percent at the end of June,
down from 88.2 percent at the end of 2010. Average rent fell to
$39.09 a square foot from $39.74. </p>
<p>General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, said Aug. 1 it planned a spinoff of 30 malls to
shareholders through a special dividend. They will be
transferred to a new publicly traded REIT, Rouse. General Growth
spent $11.3 billion to buy commercial-property developer Rouse
Co. in 2004. </p>
<p>Our mission is to own and manage dominant Class B
regional malls in secondary and tertiary markets, and to

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG are among 13 financial institutions
that submitted bids to advise Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial
Bank for Industry  Trade on its planned $500 million overseas
bond sale, according to Deputy General Director Le Duc Tho. </p>
<p>Others that sent in bids include HSBC Holdings Plc,
Standard Chartered Plc, Australia  New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. and BNP Paribas SA, Tho said in a telephone interview
today. </p>
<p>The sale would be the first international offering of
Vietnamese notes this year and will test investor confidence in
the country, which has struggled to damp Asia''s fastest
inflation as its currency slid to the worst-performing in Asia. </p>
<p>They need a good, recognizable name to help them with the
bond sale, said Francois Chavasseau, Ho Chi Minh City-based
head of fixed income research at Sacombank Securities Joint
Stock Co. Vietnam is still viewed as quite a risky place at
the moment by foreign investors. Whether a big name will be
enough to win more confidence, I''m not sure. </p>
<p>The country''s second-largest listed lender by market value,
commonly known as VietinBank, has sought approval from the
country''s central bank to sell $500 million of bonds overseas
later this year, Tho said earlier this month. The sale would be
the first of dollar-denominated notes for the bank, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Non-Performing Loans </p>
<p>Vietnam''s banking system is weak and non-performing loans
are heavily understated in official data, Fitch Ratings said
in an Aug. 8 note. The extra yield investors demand to own
dollar debt sold by Vietnam instead of similar-maturity
Treasuries has risen 110 basis points this quarter to 445 basis
points, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s Asia Credit Index. </p>
<p>VietinBank is rated at B by Fitch, the fifth-highest non-
investment grade rating, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Tho said in May the lender planned to sell between
$500 million and $1 billion of bonds late in the third quarter
or early in the fourth quarter of the year. It opted for a lower
amount after reassessing its financial needs and due to global
market conditions, Tho said Aug. 22. </p>
<p>The lender''s shares gained 2 percent to 25,900 dong at
close on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange today. The dong,
has slid 6.4 percent this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was devalued by about 7 percent in February, the
most since at least 1993. </p>
<p>Vietnam''s inflation accelerated to 23 percent this month,
the highest rate among 17 Asian economies tracked by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>VietinBank has the equivalent of $374 million of bonds and
loans outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) has replaced BP
Plc in a partnership with Russia''s OAO Rosneft to drill in the
Arctic, one of the last untapped oil frontiers in the world. </p>
<p>In exchange for access to potentially billions of barrels
of crude in the Arctic Ocean, Exxon will grant Rosneft stakes in
Texas shale fields and deep-water projects in the Gulf of
Mexico, the companies said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Exxon and Rosneft plan to spend an initial $3.2 billion
exploring Russia''s Arctic offshore and the Black Sea. In turn,
Rosneft may become the first major Russian oil producer to
develop U.S. deposits, gaining experience in deep-water and
shale oil. </p>
<p>Russia is seeking access to more international technology
to help it exploit complex crude deposits in increasingly harsh
environments as traditional resources, such as western Siberian
fields, are declining. The Exxon agreement will help Rosneft
meet Putin''s challenge that Russian producers maintain the
country''s world-leading output of 10 million barrels a day for
at least a decade. </p>
<p>Russia''s government will support the Exxon-Rosneft alliance
in every way, said Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who
presided over the deal today in Sochi on Russia''s Black Sea
coast. </p>
<p>Life Blood'' </p>
<p>Exxon beat out its biggest international oil rivals to win
a piece of the Russian Arctic. Exxon replaces BP Plc (BP/) as
Rosneft''s partner in the Arctic Kara Sea after the U.K.
explorer''s billionaire partners in the TNK-BP Holding (TNBP) venture
blocked the agreement this year. </p>
<p>Access to new resources is the life blood of oil
companies, said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co.
in New York. Russia is one of the largest resources that''s
still available. It''s like Exxon is now dating the girlfriend BP
had a few months ago. </p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp. also have said they
wanted to explore partnerships with Rosneft in the Arctic. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest oil companies are competing for new
reserves as crude-rich countries shut out foreign operators and
the easiest-to-reach hydrocarbons are exhausted. </p>
<p>Mark Salt, spokesman for London-based BP, declined to
comment on the agreement. </p>
<p>100 Billion Barrels </p>
<p>The three blocks in the Kara Sea fields that are part of
this agreement are about the size of the U.K. North Sea and may
hold as much as 100 billion barrels of oil equivalent, according
to BP. </p>
<p>Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson attended the
signing with Neil Duffin, the company''s president for
development, and Rosneft CEO Eduard Khudainatov. Duffin oversaw
Exxon''s deepwater Angolan projects, such as Kizomba, which have
been big some of the company''s biggest producers in the past
decade. </p>
<p>I take it as a strong statement of Russian intentions to
create competitive conditions to attract investments,
Tillerson told reporters. </p>
<p>The agreement allows Rosneft a chance to participate in
Exxon''s unconventional fields in the U.S., where oil and gas are
extracted by cracking open rocks with sand, water and chemicals.
The two companies said they''ll study the potential for similar
fields in western Siberia. </p>
<p>Deep Pockets </p>
<p>As one of the largest oil companies in the world, Exxon
brings experience and deep pockets to the alliance, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis who has a
hold on Exxon shares and owns none. </p>
<p>To partner up with a AAA-rated energy company makes sense
for Rosneft as they seek to diversify outside of Russia,
Youngberg said. Credit agencies rate Exxon AAA, their highest
grade. </p>
<p>Putin said the investment needed to develop all the fields
involved and associated infrastructure may reach as much as $500
billion. </p>
<p>It''s scary to utter such huge figures, he said. Exxon,
based in Irving, Texas, will be a reliable, strategic and good
partner, he said. </p>
<p>Exxon and Rosneft on Jan. 27 signed a preliminary accord
for a $1 billion exploration project in the Black Sea''s
deepwater Tuapse Trough. </p>
<p>Shell, Chevron </p>
<p>Shell, Europe''s largest oil company, was described by Putin
in May as a potential comfortable partner to replace BP in
the Kara Sea. Shell, which works with state-controlled OAO
Gazprom in Siberia and Sakhalin Island, agreed to further expand
cooperation with the gas producer in June. </p>
<p>Chevron pulled out as Rosneft''s partner in the Val
Shatskogo exploration project in Russia''s Black Sea this year.
Chevron is looking to partner with Rosneft on other
opportunities in the Arctic or elsewhere in Russia, said Kurt
Glaubitz, a company spokesman. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, will spend as much as $76.3 million to explore and
develop shale oil and natural gas in Argentina with Americas
Petrogas Inc. (BOE) </p>
<p>Exxon will gain a 45 percent stake in Americas Petrogas''s
Los Toldos blocks, which cover 163,500 acres in the Neuquen
Basin, Calgary-based Americas Petrogas said in a statement
today. </p>
<p>Americas Petrogas plans to drill a well in the fourth
quarter at its blocks, targeting the unconventional Vaca Muerta
formation, which may hold as much as 240 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration. </p>
<p>We believe the next major shale development outside of
North America will be in the Neuquen Basin, Guimar Vaca Coca,
managing director for Americas Petrogas in Argentina, said in
the statement. </p>
<p>Vaca Muerta has characteristics similar to reservoirs such
as the Eagle Ford and Haynesville formations in North America,
the company said. YPF SA, Argentina''s largest crude producer,
announced in May it discovered the nation''s biggest oil find in
two decades at Vaca Muerta. </p>
<p>From a geological resource point of view, I think
Argentina''s future is positive, Jorge Pinon, a research fellow
at Florida International University in Miami, said in a
telephone interview. </p>
<p>Regulatory uncertainty and a lack of continuity in fiscal
terms and conditions are larger concerns for foreign oil
companies working in Argentina, said Pinon. </p>
<p>Looking For Niches </p>
<p>I think some of the major oil companies are looking for
niche areas in which they can position themselves to take
advantage of future opportunities, he said. </p>
<p>Exxon will have more than 310,000 net acres in the Neuquen
Basin following its deal with Americas Petrogas, Patrick McGinn,
a spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said in an
interview. </p>
<p>Americas Petrogas climbed 40 cents, or 24 percent, to
C$2.10 on the TSX Venture Exchange, Canada''s junior stock
exchange, at 3:59 p.m. Exxon fell 21 cents to $73.91 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:15 p.m. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) stands to lose
its top spot among takeover advisers this year if ATT Inc. (T)
isn''t able to complete its $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA
Inc., the biggest deal of 2011. </p>
<p>A collapse would move Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) into the No.
1 ranking with $346.8 billion in deals this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan has $341.5 billion,
excluding the ATT transaction, the data show. </p>
<p>ATT said today it will vigorously contest the U.S.
government''s lawsuit to block the proposed acquisition of T-
Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom AG. If those efforts fail,
ATT''s advisers, JPMorgan, Greenhill  Co. and Evercore Partners
Inc. (EVR), aren''t likely to get any significant fees for their work,
according to estimates by New York-based research firm Freeman 
Co. </p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom''s advisers, Morgan Stanley (MS), Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Citigroup Inc., may have to share
as little as $7 million to $9 million, or about one-tenth of an
original $70 million to $90 million in estimated fees, said Lam Nguyen, a Freeman vice president. It''s also possible, though
unlikely, that the Deutsche Telekom advisers could collect as
much as $60 million, or 1 percent of the estimated value of a $6
billion reverse breakup fee, Nguyen said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, Greenhill and Evercore would get $60 million to
$80 million in fees only if ATT is able to proceed with the
purchase, according to Nguyen. JPMorgan and other lenders are
still getting $20 million from committing to provide ATT a $20
billion loan to finance the purchase, Nguyen said. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for the banks advising Dallas-based ATT and
Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom declined to comment. </p>
<p>Greenhill Falls </p>
<p>Greenhill, which draws most of its revenue from providing
advice, fell 3.5 percent to $35.53 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, the day''s worst performance in
the 75-company Standard and Poor''s Midcap Financials Index.
Evercore gained 1.6 percent to $26.23. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs had been an adviser to Sprint Nextel Corp.,
which had been in talks to buy T-Mobile USA before ATT agreed
to a takeover, people familiar with the matter said in March.
The New York-based bank held the top spot in global MA advisory
every year from 2001 to 2008, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Excluding transfers of government assets, the ATT deal is
the largest takeover proposed anywhere in the world since BHP
Billiton Ltd., the world''s largest mining company, offered $40
billion for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan last August. BHP''s bid
was blocked by the Canadian government. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said it won a $96 million judgment against
Ecuador in an international arbitration case stemming from a
1990s oil-export dispute with the Latin American nation. </p>
<p>The ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The
Hague resolved seven commercial claims over crude sales by the
Ecuadorian government from 1991 to 1993 from wells operated by
Texaco Inc., Kent Robertson, a spokesman for the San Ramon,
California-based company, said today in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Ecuador overstated domestic crude demand to boost its share
of production from the Texaco-operated wells, and then sold the
oil on the international market, depriving Texaco of profits,
Robertson said. Texaco was acquired by Chevron in 2001. </p>
<p>Ecuador rejects the final sentence given by the
arbitration court and considers that it has no legal validity
and represents a grave injustice, Diego Garcia, Ecuador''s
attorney general, said today to reporters in Quito. </p>
<p>Garcia said the panel didn''t have jurisdiction to decide
the case because a bilateral investment treaty between the U.S.
and Ecuador wasn''t in effect when Texaco quit the country. </p>
<p>Ecuador plans to ask a district court in the Netherlands
within 90 days to invalidate the arbitration ruling, Garcia said.
Ecuador is prepared to appeal the case all the way to the
Netherlands''s highest court, he said. </p>
<p>In a separate case, Chevron is awaiting a ruling from the
Permanent Court of Arbitration on whether it''s liable for
environmental damage in Ecuador''s Amazon River basin. The
company was ordered in February by an Ecuadorian court to pay
$18 billion in damages and penalties for chemical-laden
wastewater dumped in the river when Texaco operated there from
1964 to 1992. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest oil company, sold offshore crude wells and other assets
from its XTO Energy unit for $182.5 million to Dynamic Offshore
Resources LLC. </p>
<p>The XTO assets, located in the Gulf of Mexico, will add the
equivalent of 13.5 million barrels of crude to Dynamic''s
reserves, the equivalent of a 31 percent increase, Houston-based
Dynamic said in an e-mailed statement today. Dynamic, a closely
held oil explorer backed by Riverstone Holdings LLC, filed a
prospectus last week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for an initial share sale. </p>
<p>The properties produce the equivalent of 7,000 barrels of
oil a day, Dynamic said. The reserves are comprised of 40
percent oil and the rest is natural gas, according to the
statement. </p>
<p>Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, has said it''s selling lower
profit assets acquired in last year''s $34.9 billion acquisition
of XTO. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, settled a patent-infringement lawsuit with the Indian
generic-drug maker Dr. Reddy''s Laboratories Ltd. over the
cholesterol treatment Lipitor. The terms weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>Pfizer, based in New York, sued Dr. Reddy''s in December
2009 to block generic copies of Lipitor from coming out before
Pfizer''s patent for the tablets expires in 2017. The companies
settled on Aug. 19, and U.S. District Judge Leonard P. Stark in
Wilmington, Delaware, dismissed the case Aug. 29, according to
court records. </p>
<p>We have closed our litigation with Pfizer, but the date
of entry into the market is not yet confirmed, Kedar Upadhye,
a spokesman for Dr. Reddy''s, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Dr. Reddy''s, of Hyderabad, India, announced the settlement
today in a statement. The agreement is subject to review by the
U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, the
company said. </p>
<p>We can confirm that we have reached an agreement with Dr.
Reddy''s regarding a patent case involving Lipitor, Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. Terms
of the agreement are confidential. </p>
<p>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Mylan Inc. also
have reached settlements with Pfizer to sell generic forms of
Lipitor, known chemically as atorvastatin. </p>
<p>Ranbaxy Plans </p>
<p>Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY), the first company to seek
regulatory approval for its version, had planned to enter the
market on Nov. 30 -- with Teva, Mylan and other generic makers
beginning sales six months later as part of its deal with
Pfizer. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration investigation into
quality standards at two Ranbaxy plans and a federal probe of
its testing practices have delayed approval. </p>
<p>Analysts including Edward J. Kelly of Credit Suisse AG have
said that Ranbaxy may have to sell its rights to be the only
approved generic on the market if it can''t pass regulatory
muster by November. </p>
<p>Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) has a separate agreement with
Pfizer that would let it sell Lipitor without the brand label as
a so-called authorized generic beginning Nov. 30. The Watson-
sold drug doesn''t require FDA approval and wouldn''t be affected
by the Ranbaxy deal. </p>
<p>The case is Pfizer v. Dr. Reddy''s, 1:09-cv-00943, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and OAO Rosneft,
Russia''s biggest oil producer, will announce joint international
projects by early next year, an official for the Moscow-based
company said today during a conference call. </p>
<p>We will be entering on friendly terms, on a non-
discriminatory basis, Ruslan Svirshchevsky, Rosneft''s head of
business development, said on a conference call with investors
today. We will complement our reserve base by quite
significant number. </p>
<p>Exxon, the world''s biggest company by market value, and
state-run Rosneft yesterday agreed on an alliance that would
give the U.S. company access to Russia''s Arctic resources by
exploring three blocks in the Kara Sea, while allowing Rosneft
to gain experience in deep-water and tight oil deposits in the
U.S. and other areas. </p>
<p>Rosneft and Exxon agreed to get access to several select
high-quality exploration and production opportunities in the
U.S., Canada and other countries, Svirshchevsky said, declining
to identify any projects. These include areas in the Gulf of
Mexico and onshore Texas, deep-water and tight oil fields, and
some projects are in the development stage, he said. </p>
<p>It was one of the aspects why the proposals from Exxon
Mobil was especially attractive to us, Svirshchevsky said.
Exxon''s Hibernia project was listed in a presentation on
Rosneft''s website today. The Kommersant newspaper reported
earlier today that Rosneft may enter that development. </p>
<p>BP Deal Collapsed </p>
<p>Rosneft''s original plan to develop its Kara Sea blocks in
the Arctic with BP Plc collapsed after the British oil
producer''s local billionaire partners blocked the deal, which
also involved a $7.8 billion share swap. </p>
<p>U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland described
the deal, which she valued at $3.2 billion, as another example
of the expanding relationship between the U.S. and Russia.
Nuland said that President Barack Obama and President Dmitri Medvedev have been working on broadening economic and trade
ties. </p>
<p>She declined to comment on whether the deal would draw
scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States, the inter-agency government group that reviews
transactions that may affect U.S. national security. </p>

<p>Human behavior is increasing the
frequency and severity of natural disasters, according to
Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia University economist. </p>
<p>I''m not saying Hurricane Irene is an example of that, but
I am saying that when you look around the planet, every month
you are seeing more shocks, more frequently, more severe than at
any time in modern history, Sachs said in a Bloomberg
Surveillance radio interview with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt.
We are definitely in the midst of human-made natural
disasters. </p>
<p>Hurricane Irene killed at least 40 people as it moved from
the Caribbean through New England, left an estimated $2.6
billion in damage and cut power to almost 8 million homes and
businesses along the U.S. East Coast. Tropical Storm Katia,
about 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers) from the southernmost Cape
Verde Islands, may be declared a hurricane later today,
according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. </p>
<p>Can one say that Katrina, or Irene or the massive floods
in Pakistan or drought in the horn of Africa are examples in
that instance of the long-term human induced change? Sachs
said. That is extremely difficult but on occasion it can be
done because the event is so extreme that one can say with a
very high assurance that that is human induced -- like the
massive heat waves that hit Europe a few years ago. </p>
<p>Prices of raw materials will not spur investors to finding
alternatives to commodities that cause climate change, said
Sachs, the director of Columbia''s Earth Institute and the
Quetelet Professor of Sustainable Development at the New York-
based university. </p>
<p>Odd Reality'' </p>
<p>We have the odd reality that we can dig up enough coal or
shale gas to wreck the planet before price scarcity itself is
going to choke this off, Sachs said. So we''re going to have
to make real, conscience choices rather than letting the market
itself decide. </p>
<p>The Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm
of the U.S. Energy Department, estimates global coal reserves at
909 billion tons, a 129 year supply. Benchmark European coal
prices rose 50 cents or 0.4 percent, to $129.50 a metric ton
today in London. The five-year average price is $100.48 per
metric ton. </p>
<p>We''ve transitioned globally into a human-led environment
where human''s effects on carbon flows, energy flows, water flows
are so dominant now that we have changed the probability
distribution of when extreme droughts or hurricanes or heat
waves are hitting the planet, he said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), federal
regulators and investors are seeking more information about Bank
of America Corp.''s effort to resolve mortgage liabilities with
an $8.5 billion settlement. </p>
<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Federal Housing
Finance Agency, Goldman Sachs and pension funds are among those
who have objected to the agreement, saying they don''t have
sufficient information to evaluate the deal. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs can''t determine whether all investors who
are similarly situated will be treated equally under the
settlement, the company said in a court filing late yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. A group of homeowners separately
sued Bank of America in federal court, seeking to block the
accord, claiming terms related to the servicing of mortgage
loans will accelerate home foreclosures. </p>
<p>The objections create more obstacles for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America as it seeks court approval for
the settlement to resolve claims from investors in Countrywide
Financial Corp. mortgage bonds. It acquired Countrywide in 2008. </p>
<p>The deal was negotiated with a group of institutional
investors, including BlackRock Inc. and Pacific Investment
Management Co., and would apply to investors outside that group. </p>
<p>The Trustee </p>
<p>Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), the trustee for the
mortgage-securitization trusts covered by the agreement, asked a
New York state judge to approve the settlement. A hearing on the
matter was initially scheduled for November. New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman asked the judge to reject the accord
and said in court papers that he has potential claims against
Bank of America. An investor group is seeking to move the case
to federal court. </p>
<p>We believe that the trustee acted reasonably in entering
into the settlement, and that there are compelling reasons why
the agreement should receive judicial approval. Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, said in an e-mail. He
declined to comment on the homeowner lawsuit. BNY Mellon
spokesman Kevin Heine declined to comment on the objections. </p>
<p>The agreement, which must be approved by a judge, is
important for Bank of America to put its mortgage liabilities
behind it, Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said
in an interview. </p>
<p>I think there''s a possibility it gets thrown out, he
said. But I don''t know to handicap that. </p>
<p>Filed Objections </p>
<p>Those filing objections include American International
Group Inc. (AIG), the Federal Home Loan Banks of Boston, Chicago and
San Francisco, the Maine State Retirement System, and the
National Credit Union Administration, a federal agency that is
the liquidating agent for five corporate credit unions. </p>
<p>Investors are unable to evaluate the fairness of the
allocation of the settlement proceeds, the Maine retirement
system said. </p>
<p>The FDIC, the receiver for failed banks, said it owns
securities covered by the settlement. Andrew Gray, an FDIC
spokesman, said in an e-mail that the filing is a notice to
preserve its right to make claims as a part of the settlement
and seeks additional information. </p>
<p>It is not an evaluation or opinion on the settlement
itself, he said. </p>
<p>The FHFA, which regulates mortgage finance companies Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, said in a statement that it was also
seeking more information and is aware of no basis upon which
it would raise a substantive objection to the proposed
settlement at this time. </p>
<p>Federal Judge </p>
<p>Yesterday, Nevada asked a federal judge in Reno to
terminate an earlier settlement with Bank of America which
involved home-loan modifications tied to its Countrywide unit,
saying the company hasn''t complied with terms of the accord. </p>
<p>Bank of America increased consumer interest rates and
monthly payments in violation of a consent decree and required
homeowners to provide extensive documentation to qualify for
modifications even though the settlement calls for a
streamlined approach, the state said yesterday in a
statement. </p>
<p>The state is seeking to file an amended complaint against
the bank with additional claims. </p>
<p>After two and a half years of lost implementation -- of
borrowers denied modifications, discouraged by repeated and
futile efforts to obtain help, or already subject to foreclosure
-- the state no longer can get the benefit of its original
settlement with defendants, Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto said yesterday. </p>
<p>The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-cv-5988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The homeowner lawsuit is Iesu v. Bank of New York
Mellon, 11-6078, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). The Nevada case is State of Nevada v. Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), 11-cv-00135, U.S. District Court, District of
Nevada (Reno). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
pay future Federal Reserve penalties and write down $53 million
of mortgage loans in New York to gain approval for its sale of
Litton Loan Servicing LP. </p>
<p>The Fed ordered Goldman Sachs to conduct an independent
review of Litton''s foreclosures in 2009 and 2010 to address a
pattern of misconduct and negligence, the regulator said
today in a statement. Litton''s sale to Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) was
completed today after reaching accords with the Fed and New York
state regulators, according to a Goldman Sachs statement. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs leaves mortgage servicing after Litton was
accused of robo-signing, in which foreclosure documents are
signed by company officials who vouch for their accuracy without
personally verifying the contents. The practice raised concern
that some borrowers may have been wrongfully evicted and
triggered calls for more staffing and oversight. </p>
<p>Our agreement sets a new higher standard for the
residential mortgage-servicing industry, whose troubling
foreclosure and servicing practices we have been investigating
along with other regulators across the country, Benjamin Lawsky, superintendant at the New York State Department of
Financial Services, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Mortgage servicers send out bills, collect payments and
handle foreclosures. New York-based Goldman Sachs acquired
Houston-based Litton with 1,000 employees in 2007, took a
writedown of about $200 million earlier this year and agreed in
June to sell the unit to Ocwen for $263.7 million. The value of
mortgage servicing companies has been eroded as record U.S.
foreclosures and delinquencies drove up costs. </p>
<p>Review Findings </p>
<p>Ocwen, based in West Palm Beach, Florida, will also pay
about $337.4 million to retire some of Litton''s debt. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs agreed to provide the Fed with findings of
the independent review as well as its plans to reimburse
customers for fees or losses stemming from improper
foreclosures, according to the settlement. The firm also agreed
to improve compliance and borrower communications should it re-
enter the business. </p>
<p>The review is intended to provide remediation to
borrowers who suffered financial injury as a result of wrongful
foreclosures or other deficiencies identified in a review of the
foreclosure process, according to the Fed''s statement. </p>
<p>Future Penalties </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs also agreed to pay any penalty the Fed
imposes on Litton based on today''s enforcement action. The
regulator said it plans penalties for Litton as well as other
large servicers, including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), which received enforcement actions in April. </p>
<p>Attorneys general from all 50 states last year announced
their investigation into bank foreclosure practices after
reports that faulty or manufactured documents were being used to
seize homes. Since then, a group of attorneys general and
officials from federal agencies, including the Justice
Department, have been negotiating a settlement with the nation''s
five largest mortgage servicers. </p>
<p>The New York agreement requires the companies to withdraw
pending foreclosures with robo-signed affidavits and compensate
borrowers whose homes were wrongfully foreclosed, according to
the statement. The $53 million represents 25 percent of unpaid
principal for all 60-day delinquent home loans serviced by
Litton. </p>
<p>Ocwen is getting a portfolio of loans with about $41.2
billion in unpaid principal balance as of March 31, most of them
non-prime home mortgages, according to a June filing. </p>
<p>Possible Pattern </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s agreement to reduce unpaid principal in the
New York accord is the most specific we''ve seen, said Guy
Cecala, publisher of Bethesda, Maryland-based trade publication
Inside Mortgage Finance. While the need for sale approval and
small size of Litton may limit the comparability with other
potential settlements, the deal may give some insight to how
future deals could be structured, he said. </p>
<p>In Goldman''s case, this is a cost of doing business in
terms of getting this deal done, Cecala said. This is a
blueprint for what the states are looking for: potentially some
lump sum that they can use to help out borrowers who are in
trouble, regardless of whether or not they''ve suffered any
foreclosure abuse. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said its Windows
Phone operating system may capture more than 20 percent of the
smartphone market over the next two to three years with the help
of hardware manufacturers and increased marketing efforts. </p>
<p>Forecasts by researchers Gartner and IDC, which expects a
market share of about 20 percent in 2015, are conservative, said
Achim Berg, head of Windows Phone marketing, in Berlin today. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, is betting
that Windows Phone will retake market share lost to Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s
iPhone and handsets running Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android software. The
company will start offering the enhanced Mango version of
its operating system, with functions including better social-
media offerings, for the first time in Europe on two HTC Corp.
phones, set to go on sale by Oct. 1. </p>
<p>HTC and other partners will run advertisement campaigns for
the Titan and Radar phones, and the company has joined Microsoft
in training hundreds of salesmen worldwide to better
demonstrate the product, Berg said at the IFA consumer
electronics fair. Microsoft plans to build on Windows Phone''s
initial success with female consumers as well as with young and
first-time users to win market share, he said. </p>
<p>We''re seeing an extremely positive response to the
Windows Mobile system, HTC''s President for Europe, the Middle
East and Africa, Florian Seiche, said in an interview. We''re
now thinking that this year is a great time to get that momentum
accelerated, to reach out to a broader group of customers. </p>
<p>The Titan, which has an 8-megapixel camera with dual-led
flash and a wide-angle lens, will sell for 599 euros ($855),
while the Radar costs 399 euros. HTC is in talks with retailer
and operators, Seiche said, adding that the phones will be
broadly available in Europe. </p>
<p>New Functions </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, announced Windows
Phone in February 2010, jettisoning an earlier system called
Windows Mobile. The newest version, announced in May, adds more
functions such as face detection in photos, extended voice
recognition for writing, and support for 15 additional European
and Asian languages. Mango also lets users synchronize Microsoft
Office documents with cloud versions in Microsoft''s Office 365
and SkyDrive, and improves integration with corporate
directories and e-mail systems. </p>
<p>Nokia Oyj, the world''s biggest mobile-phone maker by
volume, adopted Windows Phone 7 as its primary smartphone
platform in February, saying that it will give the Finnish phone
company and its developers more opportunities to produce
distinctive products than Google''s Android, which was also
considered. Microsoft on May 24 announced handset agreements
with Acer Inc., Fujitsu Ltd. and ZTE Corp., as well as 500
features to be added in the fall release of Windows Phone 7. </p>
<p>It Takes Times'' </p>
<p>This is a completely new platform, it takes time, said
Berg. It took time with Android, it took time with Apple. We
have to show that we''re very capable and that we have the
fastest and easiest phone. </p>
<p>In April, Gartner forecast that the Android operating
system will have the largest smartphone market share during the
next four years, rising from 23 percent in 2010 to 49 percent in
2015. Apple''s iOS is predicted to grow from 16 percent to 17
percent, while Microsoft''s share will go from 4.2 percent in
2010 to 19.5 percent in 2015. IDC in June predicted that
Microsoft may hold a 20.3 percent market share in 2015. </p>
<p>Windows Phone''s base of application developers will also
increase following Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)''s decision to stop
selling devices with its WebOS software, Berg said. Hewlett-
Packard said last month that it''s considering licensing or
selling off WebOS, which it acquired in its purchase of Palm
Inc. last year. </p>
<p>Third-party applications helped make Apple''s iPhone the
most profitable smartphone as users flocked to a handset with a
slick touch screen and an online store that has grown to more
than 425,000 games and other programs. Google''s Android system,

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) was sued by a mobile
phone user claiming the company illegally tracks location
information from mobile devices in violation of state and
federal privacy laws. </p>
<p>The company has designed its mobile operating software
Windows Phone 7 to track users'' location deceptively even after
users choose to disable the feature, according to a complaint
filed in federal court in Seattle today. The software is in
mobile devices made by Samsung Electronics Co., HTC Corp. (2498) and LG
Electronics Inc. (066570), and transfers the location data to company
server computers, the complaint shows. </p>
<p>Michigan resident Rebecca Cousineau filed the lawsuit on
behalf of tens of thousands of consumers who use phones with the
Microsoft software and had their location data tracked after
they disabled the feature. The complaint seeks a court order
barring the company from tracking users'' phone locations, $1,000
for each violation, and unspecified punitive damages. </p>
<p>Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman, didn''t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment about the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The case is Cousineau v. Microsoft, 11-1438, U.S. District
Court, District of Washington (Seattle). </p>

<p>Economists at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said the slow pace of hiring recently in the U.S. led them
to cut their August payroll forecast to a 25,000 gain. </p>
<p>The new estimate is down from a prior projection of a
50,000 increase, the economists said. Their forecast for the
unemployment rate was unchanged at 9.1 percent. </p>
<p>The main reason is the accumulation of evidence of weak
hiring in late July and August, the economists, led by Jan Hatzius, wrote in a note to clients today. The recent pickup
in layoff announcements is a concern. </p>
<p>Among the reports citing weak employment figures are the
Conference Board''s consumer confidence survey and its separate
gauge of online help-wanted advertising for August, yesterday''s
ADP Employer Services report that measures private payroll data
and today''s employment component in the Institute for Supply
Management''s factory index, the New York-based economists wrote. </p>
<p>The cut in the payrolls forecast contrasts with Moody''s
Analytics Inc. economists, who raised their estimate today to an
increase of 50,000 from a previous projection of a 30,000 gain. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) has agreed to buy Algorithmics, a supplier of risk
analytics software, for $387 million. </p>
<p>The purchase will add 900 employees to IBM''s team of more
than 8,000 consultants in the business analytics unit, Armonk,
New York-based IBM said in a statement today. Algorithmics,
based in Toronto, is a member of Fitch Group, which is majority
owned by Paris-based holding company Fimalac (FIM) SA. </p>
<p>IBM said its analytics offerings are backed by more than
$14 billion spent on acquisitions in the past five years,
including OpenPages Inc., a maker of compliance and risk
management systems. IBM has forecast its business analytics and
optimization activities will reach $16 billion in revenue by
2015 as companies sift their data for insights. Chief Executive
Officer Sam Palmisano last year said he would spend $20 billion
on acquisitions within five years. </p>
<p>Combining Algorithmics'' expertise with IBM''s deep
analytics portfolio will allow clients to take a more holistic
approach to managing risk and responding to economic change
across their enterprises, said Rob Ashe, IBM''s general manager
of business analytics. </p>

<p>Executives from Morgan Stanley and
Catalyst Capital Investors are among new members of an advisory
panel for the Climate Bonds Initiative, formed to help put
together a new $300-million bond by an unspecified issuer. </p>
<p>The new bond, issued in Australian dollars, will probably
be a refinancing of a group of wind-energy loans and will use a
standard being established by the London-based Climate Bonds
Initiative, said Sean Kidney, chairman of the initiative. He
declined to be more specific because the bond was not yet public
knowledge. </p>
<p>The initiative is seeking to encourage investors to use the
new standard to help encourage projects that curb emissions
blamed for climate change, Kidney said today by phone. </p>
<p>The four new advisory panel members are Imtiaz Ahmad,
carbon trader and executive director at Morgan Stanley in
London, Jonathan C. Bianco, Houston-based managing director of
Catalyst Capital Investors, Henry Derwent, chief executive
officer of the Geneva-based International Emissions Trading
Association, and Anthony Hobley, Sydney-based global head of
climate change at lawfirm Norton Rose LLP, Kidney said. </p>
<p>Public and private sector partnerships for climate
finance initiatives will be of growing importance as we
approach United Nations climate talks in Durban, South Africa,
in November, Ahmad said today by e-mail. </p>
<p>Leveraging private-sector finance in an environment of
scarce public-sector resources is crucial in order to
achieve the large-scale of investment needed to protect the
climate, he said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley in May last year urged developing nations to
consider selling green bonds to spur investment in climate-
protection policies and projects. </p>
<p>A lack of certainty on regulation of greenhouse-gas
emissions worldwide may otherwise result in a massive scaling
down of spending, Ahmad said at the time. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) may get a reprieve from
generic competition to its $11 billion Lipitor cholesterol pill
as Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) fights regulatory breaches that 
threaten to derail its push to produce the first U.S. copies. </p>
<p>Ranbaxy, India''s third-largest drugmaker by revenue, plans
to introduce its copy of Lipitor, the world''s best-selling
medicine, on Nov. 30. It must first persuade the Food and Drug
Administration that its copy is equivalent to the original and
that approval shouldn''t be thwarted by violations cited in 2009
at a plant identified in Ranbaxy''s drug application. </p>
<p>Failure to resolve the issue could prevent the FDA from
clearing Ranbaxy''s Lipitor version by that date, said Ira Loss,
an analyst with Washington Analysis. A delay also may stall
plans by other generic-drug companies to introduce their
versions of the $11 billion-a-year medicine, he said. </p>
<p>I don''t remember another case where timely approval of
the first generic on a big drug appears dependent upon cleaning
up a mess in their manufacturing situation, said Loss, who has
followed the FDA for more than three decades. Ranbaxy has
repeatedly expressed confidence that this will all get resolved
in time, but I''m not sure I believe them. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. (GM) retained former
Vice Chairman Bob Lutz, who helped lead each U.S. automaker
during the past 48 years, as a part-time consultant. </p>
<p>Lutz, 79, will be available to senior executives effective
immediately, the Detroit-based company said today in a statement
on its website. </p>
<p>The former U.S. Marine fighter pilot worked two stints at
the largest U.S. automaker, the first ending in 1970. In the
second, he led GM''s global product development and held other
management roles during a nine-year stretch until May 2010. </p>
<p>I don''t think he''ll ever retire until he''s in a coffin,
Dave Sullivan, a product analyst at Tustin, California-based
AutoPacific Inc., said in a phone interview. He''s a true car
guy and he was born to do this. It''s hard for him to cut the
cord. </p>
<p>Lutz already has informally consulted with senior leaders
including Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson and Mary Barra,
who was named head of global product development in January,
said Jay Cooney, a GM spokesman. </p>
<p>This simply formalizes those discussions, Cooney said
in a phone interview. He would be available to speak with any
senior leader at General Motors about any topic. His knowledge
and experience runs the gamut. </p>
<p>Cooney declined to comment on Lutz''s compensation. </p>
<h2>Lutz''s Models </h2>
<p>Lutz rejoined GM in September 2001 and later championed the
Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid car, which began selling late last
year. He previously held executive posts at Ford Motor Co. (F),
where he helped develop the Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle,
and the former Chrysler Corp., where he oversaw the Dodge Viper
sports car and Ram pickup, and PT Cruiser wagon. </p>
<p>He also worked at Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) starting in
1972, after his first GM stint. Lutz''s GM career began in 1963. </p>
<p>His impact at GM is probably bigger than maybe any other
automaker he''s been at, said Sullivan, who is based in Troy,
Michigan. Their product line right now is probably the best
it''s ever been. Everything that GM''s coming out with that''s new
seems to be doing very well. </p>
<p>Lutz has said he delayed his retirement from GM in 2009
when he was asked to stay as head of sales and marketing. Then-Chairman Ed Whitacre changed his role to adviser for global
design and product development in December 2009, and GM
announced three months later that Lutz would leave the company. </p>
<p>Akerson, 62, picked Barra to lead product development
earlier this year after she spent about 19 months as vice
president of global human resources. Before leading human
resources, Barra worked with Lutz as vice president of global
manufacturing engineering. </p>
<p>She has a lot of people that are still upset with GM over
getting bailed out by the government, Sullivan said. There''s
a lot riding on her shoulders to prove people wrong. It''s going
to be up to her to continue what has brought about GM''s recent
success with the next generation of vehicles. </p>
<p>GM fell 96 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $22.07 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>

<p>Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) were among 17 banks sued by the U.S. to recoup $196
billion spent on mortgage-backed securities bought by Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac. </p>
<p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency, on behalf of Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, filed 17 lawsuits yesterday in New York state
and federal courts and in federal court in Connecticut. The FHFA
accuses the banks of misleading Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about
the soundness of the mortgages underlying the securities. </p>
<p>The loans had different and more risky characteristics
than the descriptions contained in the marketing and sales
materials provided to the enterprises for those securities,
the FHFA said in a statement. </p>
<p>FHFA is seeking to rescind the transactions plus other
damages, including civil penalties and punitive damages in cases
alleging misconduct. </p>
<p>In addition to JPMorgan and Bank of America, the agency
filed complaints in federal court in Manhattan yesterday against
Citigroup Inc. (C), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Merrill Lynch  Co.,
Barclays Plc (BARC), Nomura Holdings Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Societe
Generale SA, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and First
Horizon National Corp. (FHN) </p>
<p>The FHFA sued Ally Financial Inc., Countrywide Financial
Corp., General Electric Co. (GE) and Morgan Stanley in state court in
Manhattan, according to the agency. It sued Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS) in federal court in Connecticut. </p>
<p>Fannie and Freddie </p>
<p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have operated under U.S.
conservatorship since 2008, when they were seized amid subprime
mortgage losses that pushed them toward insolvency. </p>
<p>The FHFA said in its filings that Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac bought $6 billion in mortgage-backed securities from Bank of
America; $24.8 billion from Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America
took over in 2008, and $26.6 billion from Countrywide, which
Bank of America acquired the same year. </p>
<p>The FHFA claims Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bought $33
billion in securities from JPMorgan and $30.4 billion from Royal
Bank of Scotland. According to the complaints, Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac also bought $14.2 billion from Deutsche Bank, $14.1
billion from Credit Suisse, $11.1 billion from Goldman Sachs,
$10.6 billion from Morgan Stanley, $6.2 billion from HSBC, $6
billion from Ally, $4.9 billion from Barclays, $3.5 billion from
Citigroup, $2 billion from Nomura, $1.3 billion from Societe
Generale (GLE), $883 million from First Horizon and $549 million from
GE. </p>
<p>UBS Suit </p>
<p>The FHFA sued UBS AG, Switzerland''s biggest bank, in July
over $4.5 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities sold
to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, claiming the bank misstated the
risks of the investments. </p>
<p>The claims brought by the FHFA are unfounded, said
Frank Kelly, a spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the epitome of a sophisticated
investor. </p>
<p>Ally, based in Detroit, said in a statement that it
believes FHFA''s claims are meritless and the company intends to
defend its position. </p>
<p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac acknowledged that their losses
in the mortgaged-backed securities market were due to the
unprecedented downturn in housing prices and other economic
factors, said Larry DiRita, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America. </p>
<p>Kim Cherry of Memphis, Tennessee-based First Horizon said
the company would defend itself. </p>
<p>Knew the Risks </p>
<p>The firms claimed to understand the risks, and continued
buying, even after their regulator said they lacked adequate
risk-management capabilities to do so, DiRita said. </p>
<p>Company representatives who declined to comment on the
suits yesterday included Danielle Romero-Apsilos of New York-
based Citigroup, Kerrie Cohen of London-based Barclays, Kristin Lemkau of JPMorgan in New York and Russell Wilkerson of
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE. </p>
<p>Mark Lake of New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS), Jonathan Hodgkinson of Tokyo-based Nomura, Michael DuVally, of Goldman
Sachs in New York, Steven Vames, of Zurich-based Credit Suisse,
Neil Brazil of London-based HSBC, and Jim Galvin of Paris-based
Societe Generale, also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Edinburgh-based Royal Bank of Scotland Plc will defend the
claims. We believe we have substantial and credible legal and
factual defences to these claims and will defend them
vigorously, the bank said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Some of the complaints described mortgages that were
already performing worse than investors were told at the time
securitizations were sold. Disclosures by some firms overstated
home values or misrepresented the number of homes occupied by
borrowers, according to the FHFA. </p>
<p>Under Water'' </p>
<p>An instrument underwritten by an affiliate of Merrill Lynch
was reported to have no loans larger than the value of the
house, known as the loan-to-value ratio. In reality, about 20.7
percent of the mortgages had an LTV ratio above 100 percent,
meaning they were already under-secured or under water from
the start, according to the FHFA''s complaint. Some pools
packaged by GE or its affiliates were said to have no loans with
an LTV over 100 percent, when about 13 percent did, according to
another suit. </p>
<p>In the complaint against Goldman Sachs, the FHFA claimed
the bank securitized many mortgages that failed to meet
underwriting standards even after outside firms it hired
reported high percentages of defective or at least
questionable loans. </p>
<p>Goldman simply ignored and did not disclose the red
flags, the FHFA claimed. </p>
<p>The cases are Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), 11-CV-6195; FHFA v. Barclays Bank Plc., 11-CV-
6190; FHFA v. Citigroup, 11-CV-6196; FHFA v. Credit Suisse

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) returned workers to some oil and natural gas platforms
as Tropical Storm Lee accelerated to the east-northeast, out of
the Gulf of Mexico. </p>
<p>Crews are resuming production in the western Gulf after
inspecting equipment for damage, David Eglinton, a spokesman for
Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas-based said today in an e-
mail. Exxon moved about 140 employees to shore from
approximately 20 structures ahead of Lee. Shell, based in The
Hague, confirmed it began returning staff after evacuating as
many as 858 workers. </p>
<p>About 60 percent of oil production from the Gulf,
equivalent to 843,223 barrels per day, remained shut as of 11:30
a.m. New York time, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement. Gas curtailments totaled
2.35 billion cubic feet, or 44 percent, down from 2.9 billion
cubic feet, or 55 percent, yesterday. The bureau said 239 of the
617 platforms in the Gulf were evacuated and 25 of the 70 rigs
currently drilling in the ocean. </p>
<p>The interruptions will be brief, said James Williams, an
economist at WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas. We''re not
talking about Hurricane Gustav here, moving pipelines up and
down Louisiana like it was spaghetti, Williams said in a
telephone interview. This one isn''t a big story. It''s a wet
story. Gustav struck in 2008. </p>
<p>Production Resumes </p>
<p>Production resumed at Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)''s Nansen,
Boomvang and Gunnison platforms, the operator said today on its
website. Its Constitution, Marco Polo, Independence Hub, Neptune
and Red Hawk installations will be staffed and started as soon
as possible, The Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko said. </p>
<p>Platforms become accessible as weather clears west to east,
Mike Hurst, chief pilot of PHI Inc. in Lafayette, Louisiana.
It''s the largest provider of helicopters to Gulf of Mexico oil
producers. </p>
<p>Normal flights may resume tomorrow over western and central
platforms with service to eastern platforms Tuesday, he said. </p>
<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX)''s refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi, is
operating normally, Katherine W. Swetman, a spokeswman, said
today in an e-mail. The unit can process as much as 360,000
barrels per day. More than 10 inches of rain fell in the area
the past four days, the National Weather Service said. </p>
<p>All Exxon Mobil refineries were operating normally today,
spokeswoman Claire Hassett said in an e-mail. </p>
