&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to lend its
Quigley unit as much as $65 million in cash to extend the
subsidiary&#8217;s bankruptcy, potentially giving Pfizer further
protection against claims for asbestos-related health issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein for
permission to borrow the money in court papers filed July 29 in
Manhattan. The cash would extend Quigley&#8217;s $20 million loan
agreement from 2004, when the unit entered bankruptcy, and
finance the case until Feb. 24, 2012, Quigley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional money and time will free Quigley to work
with Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, and a committee of
creditors &#8220;toward confirmation and consummation of a
reorganization plan,&#8221; Quigley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice
Department, asked in December to end Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy.
Creditors alleging asbestos-related health issues have been
unable to sue New York-based Pfizer during the case, and many of
them have died, the U.S. Trustee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company
looks forward to working through a bankruptcy plan with Quigley
and creditors, which the extension of the credit agreement will
allow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In 30 years of asbestos litigation, Pfizer has never been
found to be derivatively liable for Quigley&#8217;s liabilities,&#8221;
Loder said. Quigley&#8217;s products were made for decades before
Pfizer acquired it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reorganization Hearing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearing on a request to dismiss Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy or
approve proposed terms of its reorganization, set for Aug. 4,
was adjourned without being rescheduled, according to court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley Co., founded in 1916, made three products for the
steel industry from the 1940s to the 1970s that contained
asbestos. Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968, and the company stopped
most operations in 1992. Pfizer said it never made or sold any
Quigley products, and some claimants hadn&#8217;t released Pfizer from
alleged &#8220;derivative liability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein refused to allow Quigley to exit Chapter 11 court
protection in September, saying Pfizer had manipulated the
process to benefit itself. Pfizer and a committee of asbestos
claimants won his approval of an agreement that will support the
new Chapter 11 plan, which still requires court approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A committee of creditors known as the &#8220;Ad Hoc Committee of
Tort Victims&#8221; asked in October 2010 to have Quigley&#8217;s
bankruptcy dismissed so it could bring tort claims, which are
otherwise blocked by bankruptcy law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Asset-Less Dummy&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court papers, the group called Quigley an &#8220;asset-less
dummy entity that was resurrected, handed Pfizer&#8217;s money-losing
claims handling unit, and then propped up by Pfizer pursuant to
a non-arm&#8217;s-length contract of limited duration -- all in order
to provide Quigley&#8217;s extremely well-heeled non-debtor parent
Pfizer with a channeling injunction against present and future
asbestos claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group said Quigley has depleted insurance assets to
sustain $54 million in operating losses and $34 million in
professional fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley&#8217;s sixth outline of a plan to reorganize, filed in
April, would have resolved disputes over how much Pfizer should
contribute by having it turn over a 281,581-square-foot building
leased to a brewery to help pay asbestos claims. The terms of
that reorganization also required Pfizer to forgive a secured
claim of $86 million, a $12.6 million bankruptcy loan and
unsecured claims of $33 million. The drugmaker would also
contribute $81 million in insurance proceeds, according to court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asbestos Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
during the next 42 years, according to testimony cited by
Bernstein in September. In November, Pfizer reported a $701
million third-quarter charge for asbestos litigation related to
Quigley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying options on the SPDR Gold Trust
exchange-traded fund can help protect against financial-market
uncertainty that is likely to boost the price of the metal,
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Amyn X. Bharwani said in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should purchase October $163 calls while selling
October $177 calls, according to Bharwani, a New York-based
analyst, in a strategy known as a spread that cuts the cost of
the trade while capping potential profit. The ETF fell 0.4
percent to $157.72 at 4 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s commodities strategists predict gold will
advance to $1,800 an ounce in the fourth quarter of the year
amid the European debt crisis, emerging-market inflation and a
weak U.S. dollar, the note said. Gold fell 0.6 percent to
$1,621.70 today. Countries including India and China have been
raising interest rates to combat quickening inflation, while
Greece, Ireland and Portugal have been forced to seek external
aid to manage sovereign-debt crises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gold remains the universal thermometer of global
worries,&#8221; Bharwani quoted a July 26 report from John Bridges,
JPMorgan&#8217;s precious-metals equity analyst, as saying. &#8220;We
continue to like gold and the gold equities as hedges against
uncertainty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call spread trade can be bought for $2.71, Bharwani
said, and the maximum potential loss is the premium paid, while
profit could be as high as $11.29. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne Partners Ltd., a London-
based hedge fund that manages about $14 billion, sold its entire
stake in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in the first three months of
the year, while buying Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne sold 4.9 million shares of New York-based Goldman
Sachs between January and March, the hedge fund disclosed in a
May 16 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Lansdowne, founded by Paul Ruddock and Steven Heinz in 1998,
purchased 3.1 million shares of Morgan Stanley during the same
period, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other financial companies
face more regulation after U.S. lawmakers approved legislation
last year that restricts banks from making risky bets with their
own capital. As policy makers increase oversight, Morgan Stanley
is pursuing a business model that relies less on trading to make
money, said Douglas G. Ciocca, chief executive officer of Kavar
Capital Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the world keeps deleveraging and de-risking, then
Morgan Stanley is much better positioned,&#8221; said Ciocca, whose
Leawood, Kansas-based company owns shares of Morgan Stanley and
Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley is also &#8220;much more attractive
than Goldman on a book-value basis,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, sold its U.S. pension
advisory group to Pacific Life Insurance Co. for an undisclosed
price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit, which is being renamed Pacific Global Advisors,
will continue to be based in New York and led by David Oaten,
Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Life said today in a
statement. The group offers investment and risk-management
services to companies, defined benefit pension plans, voluntary
employees&#8217; beneficiary associations, nuclear decommissioning
trusts and institutional clients, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pacific Life&#8217;s experience and breadth of products will
now be available to PGA clients who require an expanded offering
of financial solutions,&#8221; said Khanh T. Tran, Pacific Life&#8217;s
chief financial officer and investment officer, in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennyson Oyler, a spokesman for Pacific Life, and Jennifer
Zuccarelli at JPMorgan declined to comment on terms of the
transaction. The agreement was reached April 1, and the deal
closed July 29, Oyler said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC) hired Peter Johnson, head of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s global futures, options
and over-the-counter clearing operations, for a similar role at
the biggest U.S. bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson is expected to join Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America in October, the firm said today in a statement.
He will be based in Chicago and report to Denis Manelski, head
of global short-rates trading and Stuart Hendel, head of the
global prime brokerage, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bringing him on board underscores our commitment to the
futures and OTC space at a critical time as the industry
continues to evolve,&#8221; Manelski and Hendel said in the
statement. &#8220;Peter is a highly regarded industry veteran with a
proven track record.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America is bolstering the management ranks of its
prime brokerage, which it gained in the 2009 takeover of Merrill
Lynch  Co. The department oversees hedge fund and other
institutional investor clients, offering securities lending,
financing and cash management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson spent 19 years at New York-based JPMorgan, Bank of
America said. His position at the lender is a new one, said
Kerrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for the firm. Bob Burke and Gonzalo Chocano, co-heads of the global futures and derivatives clearing
services group, will report to Johnson, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Bank of America hired several senior executives
from competitors for its prime brokerage business in London,
including Nomura Holdings Inc.&#8217;s Daniel Katz as head of stock
loan and structured marketing for Europe, the Middle East and
Africa and Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Ross McDougall as head of EMEA stock
loan trading. Hendel joined Bank of America from UBS AG in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, Bank of America&#8217;s prime brokerage business was
ranked third by hedge funds in a Global Custodian magazine
survey, behind Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley, while
JPMorgan placed sixth. In Europe, Bank of America ranked No. 1. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore" date="Aug 01, 2011 11:19 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-01/goldman-morgan-stanley-trading-would-suffer-in-u-s-downgrade-hintz-says.html"><headline>Goldman, Morgan Stanley Trading Would Suffer in U.S. Downgrade, Hintz Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s fixed-income trading revenue would likely be crimped
if the U.S. credit rating is downgraded, according to Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A downgrade will bring a &#8220;never before experienced&#8221;
environment with changing rates, currency-market volatility and
widening credit spreads, Hintz wrote in a note to investors
today. &#8220;This environment will negatively impact trading
revenue, repo financing and debt capital markets activity,&#8221; he
said. Both firms have liquidity and capital &#8220;to navigate
challenging market conditions successfully.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama and Congressional leaders are
rushing to push through a compromise to raise the U.S. debt
limit by at least $2.1 trillion and slash government spending by
$2.4 trillion or more. Ratings companies including Standard 
Poor&#8217;s have warned that the nation may lose its top AAA
sovereign grade depending on the contents of the debt deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a downgrade is likely to happen soon, firms have had
time to prepare for the event, Hintz said. That means the
decline in Wall Street&#8217;s fixed-income trading revenue will
likely be less than the 36 percent drop that followed the 1998
Russian default, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wall Street&#8217;s fixed-income trading units are positioning
themselves in anticipation of a downgrade and are minimizing
their inventory positions,&#8221; Hintz wrote. &#8220;These events tend to
be painful but relatively short lived.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viewed as &#8216;Manageable&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which are based in New
York, may each have to post $5.2 billion in additional
collateral for so-called repurchase agreements, Hintz wrote.
Banks and other financial companies use U.S. Treasuries as
collateral for loans in repurchase-agreements, or repos, and the
prospect of a downgrade has raised questions about whether such
loans would become more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Mary Claire Delaney at Morgan Stanley (MS) declined to comment on the
note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s senior executives view a potential downgrade of
the U.S.&#8217;s credit rating as &#8220;manageable,&#8221; Citigroup Inc.
analysts led by Keith Horowitz wrote in a note to investors last
week. The analysts said that they met with Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar, Co-Head of Securities Harvey M. Schwartz, and Co-Head of Investment Banking David M. Solomon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Management noted that they have run through various
scenarios and implied the risk of a U.S. debt downgrade seems
manageable, with the important caveat that there is always the
possibility of more severe knock-on effects,&#8221; the Citigroup
note said. Goldman Sachs &#8220;noted that collateral agreements
related to Treasuries are not dependent on Treasury ratings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is &#8220;not rushing&#8221; to raise collateral
requirements ahead of a potential downgrade, David Hilder, an
analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group LLP, wrote in a note to
clients last week, citing a meeting with Ken deRegt, who helps
lead Morgan Stanley&#8217;s fixed-income trading group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a small number of investors are required to own AAA-
rated securities, limiting the impact of a downgrade, deRegt
said, according to Hilder&#8217;s note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thailand&#8217;s Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn will use his personal funds to recover an
airplane seized by German liquidators in Munich last month as
part of a bankruptcy dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Werner Schneider, the insolvency administrator for builder
Walter Bau AG (WTB), seized a Boeing 737 belonging to the crown prince
on July 11 to force payment on a 30 million-euro ($43.3 million)
claim against the Thai state, the company said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crown prince &#8220;has no connection with the dispute
between the Thai government and Walter Bau, and didn&#8217;t cause the
dispute,&#8221; the crown prince&#8217;s secretariat said in a statement
late yesterday. &#8220;To avoid any impact to the good relationship
between Thailand and Germany and to end the dispute on good
terms and in an expeditious manner, the crown prince will
provide his personal funds to end the dispute.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2009 decision by the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law, or Uncitral, ordered Thailand to pay
Walter Bau more than 30 million euros for breaching a bilateral
investment treaty between Germany and Thailand. The order found
that Thailand&#8217;s government breached the terms of a toll road
concession operated by a venture partly owned by Walter Bau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Berlin court ruled on July 20 that Thailand must deposit
20 million euros to secure the release of the aircraft,
according to the crown prince&#8217;s statement.
The crown prince&#8217;s statement didn&#8217;t say how much will be paid.
He is the only son of head of state King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Thai law imposes a jail sentence of up to 15 years for defaming,
insulting or threatening the king, queen, heir apparent or
regent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marco Polo Seatrade Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in New York &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marco Polo Seatrade BV, a manager of funds, trusts and
foundations, filed for bankruptcy court protection in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amsterdam-based company listed both assets and debt of
$100 million to $500 million in Chapter 11 documents filed July
29 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affiliates Seaarland Shipping Management BV, Magellano
Marine CV and Cargoship Maritime BV also sought court
protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falm International Holding BV owns 100 percent of the
equity of Marco Polo, court papers show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Marco Polo Seatrade BV, 11-bk-13634, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bundesbank Loses U.K. Bid to Seize Assets in Lehman CDO Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s central bank lost its bid to take control of a
2.9 billion-euro ($4.2 billion) securitization set up by Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) just before its collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Michael Briggs on July 29 ruled Excalibur Funding No.
1 wasn&#8217;t in default for long enough to allow the senior
noteholder, the Bundesbank, to wrest control away from Lehman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excalibur was created by Lehman in May 2008 when the U.S.
bank packaged together a group of loans and collateralized debt
obligations. New York-based Lehman filed for bankruptcy three
months later listing assets of $639 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the rules of the Excalibur agreement, if the special
purpose vehicle was found to be in default, management of its
assets would pass to the Bundesbank as holder of 2.1 billion
euros of its senior debt. Lawyers for Lehman, which holds 722
million euros of Excalibur&#8217;s junior debt, argued Excalibur had
enough cash to meet its obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnus Makela, a spokesman for the Bundesbank, said the
central bank came to own the Excalibur notes because they were
used as collateral on a loan for a German subsidiary of Lehman,
which followed its parent into bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank won&#8217;t comment further until it&#8217;s examined
the ruling in detail, Makela said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Macleod, a spokeswoman for Lehman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there was a default on Jan. 25, it didn&#8217;t continue
beyond Jan. 28, Justice Briggs said in his ruling. He granted
all parties permission to appeal his decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s Financial Services LLC, which gave
Excalibur&#8217;s senior notes an &#8216;A&#8217; rating when the security was
issued in 2008, warned in November the vehicle didn&#8217;t have
enough income to pay interest on the junior notes held by Lehman
and that senior noteholders were unlikely to be repaid in full. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest of a series of downgrades, it lowered
Excalibur&#8217;s rating to &#8216;D&#8217; in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani Investor Fiyaz is Third A-Tec Suitor, Oesterreich Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani investor Alshair Fiyaz is the third bidder for A-
Tec Industries AG, the insolvent Austrian machinery group, daily
newspaper Oesterreich reported, citing banking sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiyaz&#8217;s investment company ALFI joined Czech Penta
Investments and hedge fund Springwater in bidding for the
company, Vienna-based Oesterreich said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Electric Power Shouldn&#8217;t Enter Bankruptcy, Kaieda Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s Trade Minister Banri Kaieda said it isn&#8217;t
&#8220;appropriate&#8221; for Tokyo Electric Power Co. to enter bankruptcy
proceedings. Tokyo Electric isn&#8217;t expected to become insolvent
for now, Kaieda told upper house lawmakers in Tokyo. There are
&#8220;various possibilities&#8221; in dealing with the company in the
future, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Benjamin Harvey" date="Aug 01, 2011  2:59 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-01/turkey-military-resignations-serve-democracy-goldman-says-1-.html"><headline>Turkey Military Resignations Serve Democracy, Goldman Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The resignations of Turkey&#8217;s four top
generals July 29 is unlikely to become a major crisis and shows
that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is consolidating
civilian control over the country, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Turkey&#8217;s civil society structures are currently being
consolidated, helping to strengthen its democracy,&#8221; Goldman
analysts including Ahmet Akarli and Clemens Grafe said in a
research report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More protest resignations may follow and vacancies will
quickly be filled by the government, making it unlikely that
&#8220;political noise&#8221; will turn to a &#8220;full blown political
crisis,&#8221; the analysts said. &#8220;What is happening here is
basically that the ruling party is making it clear that the
army, by constitution, is accountable before the civilian
authorities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest tensions between Erdogan&#8217;s government and the
military will also likely prompt him to kick-start the drafting
of a new constitution, posing numerous challenges and forcing
the ruling party &#8220;to finally take a clear stance on a number of
controversial issues, including ethnic and religious rights and
personal liberties,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erdogan&#8217;s party lacks a constitutional majority in
parliament, meaning the passage of a new constitution will
require the support of either nationalists or Kurdish
politicians, who will &#8220;try and impose their political

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read said he won&#8217;t seek large deals to replace falling
revenue, as the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker loses patent
exclusivity to drugs responsible for 60 percent of yearly sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not going to chase revenue at the destruction of
capital,&#8221; Read said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;We have
geographic breadth, we have portfolio breadth, we have
technology breadth. We never say never, but I don&#8217;t see why we
would need that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read has been shrinking the company by selling units and
buying back shares, in contrast to his predecessors Jeffrey Kindler, who bought Wyeth for $64 billion in 2009, and Henry McKinnell, who bought Pharmacia for about the same price in
2002. Pfizer will still form partnerships and pursue companies
with treatments in mid- to late-stage testing, Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, faces competition from cheaper
generic medicines to at least 19 drugs from 2010 through 2015,
led by the cholesterol pill Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-selling
drug, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors have
rewarded Read&#8217;s strategy for dealing with the acquisitions, with
shares climbing about 14 percent since he took over on Dec. 5,
more than double the return of the company&#8217;s U.S. peers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, reported second-quarter profit that topped analyst
estimates as sales of pain medicines offset declining revenue
from expired patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit excluding some items was 60 cents a share, beating
by a cent the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Revenue fell 0.9 percent to $16.98 billion, matching
estimates. Sales of the New York-based company&#8217;s Lyrica pain
pill and Enbrel arthritis medicine topped analyst predictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is selling its animal health and infant formula
units and trimming its workforce to prepare for the loss in
November of exclusive rights to Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-
selling drug with $10.7 billion in annual sales. Pfizer has
three late-stage experimental medicines that analysts estimate
may bring in more than $3.5 billion annually by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are shifting their focus back to the pipeline,
shifting back to the cost cutting and the share repurchases,&#8221;
said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., in a
telephone interview. &#8220;We probably have one more quarter where
the divestitures will be of high interest, but people are going
back to the core business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose 5.2 percent to $2.61 billion, or 33 cents a
share, from $2.48 billion, or 31 cents, a year earlier, the
company said. Pfizer reiterated its 2011 profit forecast range
of $2.16 to $2.26 a share. It also maintained its guidance for
2012, the first full year of generic competition to Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), seeking to earn
more from a sales-and-trading business acquired with Wachovia
Corp. in 2008, is building a program-trading group to serve
institutional and corporate clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank hired four executives, including JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Haresh Rana and Michael M. Lee, said Elise Wilkinson, a
Wells Fargo spokeswoman. The other additions are Kevin Kennedy
from Deutsche Bank AG and Weeden  Co.&#8217;s Chris Johnson, 40, who
will start the program-trading sales group this month. They&#8217;re
among 25 executives hired in the past 18 months across sales and
trading, which now has about 150 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo is adding specialty services to lure customers
including the largest index funds, said Christopher Bartlett,
the division&#8217;s chief. Program traders handle transactions in
baskets that contain at least 15 stocks -- for instance, to help
managers of index-linked mutual funds rebalance holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have worked on adding a number of capabilities to our
equity franchise in an effort to become more relevant to our
institutional and corporate client base,&#8221; Bartlett, 50, said in
a phone interview. &#8220;These employees will give us an ability to
do a deeper dive into the electronic-trading space with a subset
of clients that we weren&#8217;t penetrating before.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rana, 41, and Lee, 37, joined last month from JPMorgan&#8217;s
Delta One Trading Group, Wilkinson said in an e-mail. The new
hires will be based in New York and report to Matthew Brown,
head of cash trading, the San Francisco-based company said today
in a statement. Brown joined Wells Fargo in May 2009 from Bank
of America Corp. and reports to Bartlett. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Low-Touch Trading&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Program trading accounted for 28 percent of the daily
volume on the New York Stock Exchange in the week ended July 22,
and almost 46 percent a month earlier, according to the most
recent data available from exchange owner NYSE Euronext. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are competing to hire traders and other executives
with expertise in program and automated trading, said Adam Kahn,
managing partner at Odyssey Search Partners, a New York-based
executive recruiting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The world&#8217;s going more electronic,&#8221; Kahn said in a phone
interview. &#8220;Volumes are down in the equity-options and cash-
equities businesses and a lot more of the orders are coming in
on the low-touch trading side.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo must compete for those orders against rivals
including New York-based JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Morgan Stanley (MS), which was the most active program-trading firm
during the week ended July 22, moving 455.5 million shares.
Wells Fargo wasn&#8217;t among the top 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional Investors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of the firms like Goldman or JPMorgan are able to
command a lot of the order flow,&#8221; said Matthew Samelson,
founder of Woodbine Associates Inc., a Stamford, Connecticut-
based research firm and a former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
program trader. &#8220;The question for Wells Fargo is how are they
going to attract clients? It will be up to them to differentiate
themselves because these other firms aren&#8217;t going away.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way may be by offering a broader array of products and
services, Bartlett said. Wells Fargo recently launched WELX, an
off-exchange platform that uses computers to match buy and sell
orders between retail and institutional investors, and developed
11 algorithmic strategies, he said. The lender also created a
listed options business and corporate access desk, according to
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo is expanding an electronic-trading desk called
Wells Fargo Advanced Trading Solutions and hired Jason Straus in
October from Barclays Capital as a director in electronic-
trading sales, Wilkinson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have to have an electronic business to play the game
these days,&#8221; Samelson said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aspen Art Museum&#8217;s ArtCrush event
started seven years ago as a small party to get the ski haven
energized about art and wine while raising money for the
museum&#8217;s exhibitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the 350 tickets for the three-day event, which
begins tomorrow, were all gone before the announcement went out,
and there&#8217;s a waitlist of 100 hopefuls. While locals make up
many of the attendees, patrons and collectors now jet in from
Los Angeles, London and Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ArtCrush is a draw because it has a stellar exhibition
program, fun and philanthropic supporters, food and wine and, of
course, the fabulous setting of Aspen,&#8221; Heidi Zuckerman
Jacobson, the museum&#8217;s director and chief curator, said by
phone. &#8220;There&#8217;s just no place like it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of expected attendees includes David M. Solomon,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s co-head of investment banking;
Jennifer Blei Stockman, president of the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Foundation, and her husband, David A. Stockman, former budget
director under President Ronald Reagan; and Theodor Dalenson,
co-founder of the Stockholm-based venture capital firm Novestra
AB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC)&#8217;s wealth management unit found the event
attractive for its art-loving clients and agreed this month to
sponsor it for the next three years. The company will bring some
of its clients from around the U.S. to ArtCrush, Jacobson said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its forecast
for U.S. economic growth in the third quarter by a percentage
point to 1.5 percent, partly because of a slowdown in consumer
spending, chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feroli also lowered the forecast for fourth-quarter growth
to 2.5 percent from a prior estimate of 3 percent. The world&#8217;s
largest economy will expand 2 percent in the first six months of
2012, less than a previous projection of 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the economy expanding at that pace, the jobless rate
will hold at 9 percent or above until the third quarter of 2012,
he said. Recent production data wasn&#8217;t &#8220;setting up well&#8221; for
the current quarter, while early surveys suggested activity
&#8220;may have stalled&#8221; amid wrangling over the debt-ceiling
extension, Feroli said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The revised forecast implies very little improvement in
the unemployment rate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Anticipated drag from higher
taxes and lower federal outlays&#8221; was behind the lower estimates
for next year, Feroli wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also pushed back its estimate for the first
increase in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s overnight lending rate until
mid-2013 from a prior forecast for the beginning of the year.
The Fed will &#8220;undertake further measures to deliver monetary
stimulus to the economy,&#8221; even though they may not be
&#8220;particularly powerful,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t see more asset purchases forthcoming but we do
think the committee will take incremental steps to signal
increasingly accommodative policy,&#8221; Feroli wrote, referring to
the Federal Open Market Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second
quarter following revised growth of 0.4 percent in the first
three months of the year that was less than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department reported last week. Consumer
spending grew 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since the second
quarter of 2009, the final months of the recession. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the most
prolific U.S. issuer of corporate bonds this year, tapped the
market again as yields on the debt fall to the lowest on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold $1.25 billion of 4.35 percent, 10-year notes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investment-grade
corporate bond yields fell to 3.51 percent yesterday, surpassing
the previous all-time low of 3.53 percent set Nov. 4, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowing costs for companies are plunging along with
Treasury yields amid mounting evidence that the U.S. economy is
faltering. Banks have taken advantage of the decline to lock in
funding, selling about 60 percent of investment-grade corporate
bonds last month, the biggest proportion of 2011, Bloomberg data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s notes yield 175 basis points, or 1.75 percentage
points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries. The New York-
based company sold $17.6 billion of bonds in the U.S. this year
through yesterday, including $855 million of 3.15 percent, five-
year notes on July 29, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its $2 billion of 4.625 percent notes due in May 2021
traded yesterday at 103.4 cents on the dollar to yield 158 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks&#8217; issuance accounted for $31.6 billion of last month&#8217;s
$50.2 billion of investment-grade corporate bond sales in the
U.S., Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) had their supported debt ratings assigned a
negative outlook by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, which cited a
similar action it took on the U.S. government debt rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s confirmed the banks&#8217; supported ratings after they
were put on review for downgrade in July, the New York-based
ratings company said today in a statement. Moody&#8217;s yesterday
confirmed the U.S. government&#8217;s Aaa rating after President
Barack Obama signed a measure to raise the debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a very high probability that these institutions
would be supported by the U.S. government to avoid a default,&#8221;
Moody&#8217;s said in the statement. &#8220;The supported ratings have a
negative outlook not only due to the U.S. government&#8217;s negative
outlook, but also due to Moody&#8217;s view that over time&#8221;
government support for top banks may decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York has an Aa2 rating for senior debt, while
JPMorgan has an Aa3 rating, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three companies are dropping European
Union antitrust complaints against International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) over its mainframe computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T3 Technologies Inc. and Neon Enterprise Software LLC have
or will withdraw separate complaints filed with the European
Commission, IBM said in a regulatory filing last month.
TurboHercules SAS has also withdrawn its complaint, said Carina
Oliveri, a spokeswoman for the company in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission declined to comment on the status
of its investigation into allegations IBM linked sales of its
mainframe computers to its software and that it discriminated
against competing sellers of services for the computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU antitrust regulators often end investigations into
companies after complaints from rivals or customers are
withdrawn. The European Commission ended a four-year-old probe
into Qualcomm Inc. in 2009 after all complaints were withdrawn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the biggest computer-services company, declined to
comment beyond its regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin, Texas-based Neon said in May that it settled its
legal dispute with IBM and would stop selling its zPrime
software and request customers to remove and destroy their
copies. Two calls and two e-mails to the company today weren&#8217;t
immediately answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropped Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T3 withdrew its EU complaint in May after dropping an
appeal to a U.S. court ruling dismissing its claims against IBM,
according to IBM&#8217;s filing. T3 didn&#8217;t respond to a telephone
message and e-mail to its Tampa, Florida offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission opened two separate investigations
into Armonk, New York-based IBM last year over possible anti-
competitive behavior that may have blocked competition for rival
mainframe software and on maintenance contracts for the systems
by &#8220;restricting or delaying access to spare parts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While IBM has shifted its focus away from hardware toward
its more profitable software and services businesses, the
mainframe operations have high gross margins and helps pull in
revenue for other IBM divisions. IBM began developing mainframe
computers in the 1940s and 1950s and is now among the few
companies to offer the systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported the IBM regulatory filing earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian Internet companies Yandex NV
and Mail.ru Group Ltd. (MAIL) may increase their revenues as online
advertising growth accelerates from next year, JPMorgan Chase 
Co. said today, recommending that investors buy the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s advertising market is nearing the point at which
online ads may grow significantly at the expense of print and
outdoor media, Alexei Gogolev, a Moscow-based analyst at
JPMorgan, wrote today in an e-mailed report initiating coverage
of Yandex. The company, which operates Russia&#8217;s most popular
search engine, had its share-price estimate set at $46, 42
percent higher than yesterday&#8217;s traded value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mail.ru, an investor in Facebook Inc., had its price
estimate increased to $57.02 from $51.7, a premium of 68 percent
to its share value as of 11:36 a.m. in London. Last month, the
company increased its stake in Russian social networking site
VKontakte to 39.99 percent, paying $112 million for an
additional 7.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yandex, which makes most of its money through online
advertising, raised $1.3 billion in May in one of the biggest
technology initial public offerings worldwide this year. It&#8217;s
now covered by analysts at six institutions, including Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG, five of which recommend
that investors buy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s second-biggest Internet market by users generated
revenue of $19 billion, or 1.6 percent of gross domestic
product, in 2009, according to a report commissioned by Google
Inc. That may double to 3.7 percent by 2015, according to a May
report by Boston Consulting Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yandex and Mail.ru are &#8220;likely to overtake state-owned TV
channels by daily reach of population&#8221; and may see a compounded
annual growth rate of more than 40 percent between 2010 and
2013, Gogolev said in the report. Online ads accounted for 11
percent of total advertising in 2010, he said, adding that that
will increase &#8220;once the audience share reaches a certain
critical mass level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s patent complaint that
seeks to block imports of Samsung Electronics Co.&#8217;s Galaxy S
mobile phone and Galaxy Tab computer will be reviewed by the
U.S. International Trade Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC, a quasi-judicial agency in Washington that
arbitrates trade disputes, said in a notice yesterday it
instituted the investigation. The commission, which typically
takes 15 to 18 months to complete the review, has the power to
block imports of products that infringe U.S. patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple and Samsung have each lodged patent-infringement
cases against each other in the U.S., Europe, Asia and
Australia. The ITC last week said it would investigate a
complaint Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung filed to block
imports of Cupertino, California-based Apple&#8217;s iPhone and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, which has accused competitors of &#8220;widespread
imitation,&#8221; has taken particular aim at Samsung, which had been
a supplier of chips for some Apple devices. Apple contends that
the Galaxy phone and tablet &#8220;slavishly&#8221; copy the iPhone and
iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new case is In the Matter of Certain Electronic Digital
Media Devices, 337-796, and Samsung&#8217;s case is In the Matter of
Mobile Electronic Devices, including Wireless Communication
Devices, Portable Music and Data Processing Devices, and Tablet
Computer, 337-794, both U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Loses Bid to Seal Records in Patent Case With Oracle &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc., the world&#8217;s largest Internet search company,
lost a bid to seal papers in a patent-infringement lawsuit filed
last year by a unit of software maker Oracle Corp. (ORCL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claiming attorney-client privilege, Google sought to
protect parts of a transcript of a hearing about expert
witnesses containing references to a company document, U.S.
District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco said in an order
Aug. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document is &#8220;an incomplete draft of an e-mail
message&#8221; and &#8220;never was sent to anyone,&#8221; Alsup wrote in
denying Mountain View, California-based Google&#8217;s request.
&#8220;Thus, the document is not a communication of any type, much
less a communication protected by the attorney-client
privilege.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle America Inc., based in Redwood City, California,
sued Google, alleging patent infringement over the use of Java
technology in Google&#8217;s Android operating system in an Oct. 27
amended complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alsup wrote in a July 22 filing that the passage in
question was from an internal e-mail in 2010 to Google executive
Andy Rubin saying &#8220;the technical alternatives to using Java for

&lt;p&gt;Georgia-Pacific Loses Appeal in Toilet Paper Trademark Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koch Industries Inc.&#8217;s Georgia-Pacific unit lost its appeal
of a lower court&#8217;s trademark decision involving a pattern used
on its toilet paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georgia-Pacific sued Kimberly-Clark Corp. in federal court
in Chicago in April 2009, accusing the Dallas-based company of
infringing trademarks associated with a quilted diamond design
it used on its Quilted Northern toilet paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta-based Koch unit objected to the design
Kimberly-Clark was using on its Cottonelle Ultra and Scott
Kimberly-Clark Professional brands of toilet paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trial court judge agreed with Kimberly-Clark that the
design was functional and therefore not eligible for protection
as a trademark. Georgia-Pacific then filed its appeal to a
Chicago-based federal appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an opinion released by the court July 28, a three-judge
panel affirmed the lower court ruling. Senior Judge Terrence
Thomas Evans noted in the decision that 675,000 pages of
documents were produced in connection with the case and more
than a dozen witnesses were deposed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s quite a record considering, again, that this case
is about toilet paper,&#8221; Evans said in the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Who really pays attention to the design on a roll of
toilet paper?&#8221; Evans wrote. &#8220;The parties are quick to inform us
that in a $4 billion industry, designs are very important.
Market share and significant profits are at stake.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court found that Kimberly-Clark &#8220;produced
strong evidence of functionality, and Georgia-Pacific has failed
to prove that the design is incidental.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court also rejected Georgia-Pacific&#8217;s contention that
the depiction of the quilted design on the Kimberly-Clark toilet
paper&#8217;s packaging infringed. Because the design is functional
and not protectable under trademark law, the court said the
accurate depiction of that design also isn&#8217;t capable of
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court case is Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products
LP v. Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB), 1:09-cv-02263, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court case is Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products
LP v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 10-3519, 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valio Takes on Olvi, Pouttu in Finnish Trademark Disputes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valio Finnish Co., Finland&#8217;s largest dairy, is suing two
companies over the right to use the Finnish words &#8220;olo&#8221;
(feeling) and &#8220;onni&#8221; (happiness), the Helsingin Sanomat
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targets of the suits set to be tried next year are Olvi
Oyj (OLVAS), a beverage producer, and Sponsor Capital Oy&#8217;s Pouttu unit,
a meat processor, according to Helsingin Sanomat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valio is arguing to the Helsinki District Court that Olvi
hasn&#8217;t used its &#8220;Raikas Kevyt Olo&#8221; (fresh light feeling) brand
for five years, so the mark should be unlisted, the newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dairy made a similar argument with respect to Pouttu&#8217;s
Onni trademark, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abdul-Jabbar&#8217;s Film Company Settles Suit with Black Fives &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A film company headed by basketball player Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar settled a copyright-infringement lawsuit brought by a
Connecticut company that promotes the history of African-
American participation in basketball, according to a court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Fives Inc., of Greenwich, Connecticut, sued Union
Productions LLC in federal court in Manhattan in March, alleging
the film company infringed its copyright and trademarks. The
suit was occasioned by the release of &#8220;On the Shoulders of
Giants,&#8221; a film celebrating the Harlem Renaissance basketball
team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Products was accused of unauthorized use of a photo
of the late John Isaacs, a member of the Renaissance team. The
complaint also alleged that the film infringed trademarks
associated with the team -- also known as the &#8220;Rens&#8221; -- and
registered to Black Fives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to orders seeking the recall and destruction
of all infringing products and promotional materials, Black
Fives had asked the court for awards of money damages,
litigation costs and attorney fees. No terms of the settlement
were disclosed in July 28 court filing ending the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Fives was represented by Kimberly N. Reddick of
Gibbons PC of Newark, New Jersey. No counsel is listed in the
court file for Long Beach, California-based Union Productions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Black Fives Inc., v. Union Productions LLC,
1:11-cv-02148-DAB, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Wins Dismissal of &#8216;Cars&#8217; Copyright-Infringement Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) persuaded a federal judge in Los
Angeles to throw out a copyright-infringement lawsuit aimed at
its &#8220;Cars&#8221; and &#8220;Cars 2&#8221; animated films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British writer Jake Mandeville-Anthony sued Disney in
March, claiming his copyrights for &#8220;Cookie  Co.&#8221; and
&#8220;Cars/Auto Excess/Cars Chaos&#8221; were infringed. His works were
based on the true-life adventures of Michael Owen Perkins and
Brian Mullineaux, who won the 1988 London to Sydney Vintage Car
Endurance Rally, Mandeville-Anthony said in his complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a July 27 order, U.S. District Judge Valerie Baker
Fairbank dismissed the case. She determined that Disney showed
that the protectable elements of plot, sequence of events, pace,
characters, theme, mood and setting &#8220;are not substantially
similar as a matter of law&#8221; to Mandeville-Anthony&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandeville-Anthony was represented by Nicholas Allen Kurtz
of Leesburg, Virginia&#8217;s Dunlap Grubb  Weaver PLLC. Disney was
represented by in-house counsel Alexander A. Myers and David R.
Singer, and Sanford M. Litvack of Washington&#8217;s Hogan Lovells US
LLP. Litvack is Disney&#8217;s former general counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Jake Mandeville-Anthony v. The Walt Disney Co.,
2:11-sv-02137-VBF-JEM, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-TCW Employee Testifies of Search for Office Before Firing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DoubleLine Capital LP employee Barbara VanEvery testified
she started looking for office space before TCW Group Inc. fired
her and Jeffrey Gundlach in 2009, saying she was trying to be
prepared if they were terminated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was under the impression that something was going to
happen by December,&#8221; VanEvery told jurors yesterday in the
trade-secrets case being tried in state court in Los Angeles.
&#8220;It was coming to a head. I felt there was going to be some
kind of separation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach, 51, was the investment chief at TCW, the Los
Angeles-based unit of Societe Generale. (GLE) He started DoubleLine in
December 2009, within weeks of TCW firing him. TCW sued Gundlach
a month later, after half of its fixed-income professionals
joined DoubleLine. Gundlach countersued, saying he was fired so
that TCW wouldn&#8217;t have to pay him hundreds of millions of
dollars in performance fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he was at TCW, Gundlach managed or oversaw about $70
billion of the company&#8217;s $110 billion in assets, according to
the May 14, 2010, amended cross-complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW clients withdrew about $25 billion after Gundlach was
fired. TCW said in its complaint that Gundlach lied to its
clients in a series of webcasts with them in December 2009 to
incite them to join DoubleLine and to malign TCW&#8217;s newly
acquired fixed-income management unit, Metropolitan West Asset
Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DoubleLine claims TCW clients started withdrawing billions
of dollars immediately after Gundlach was fired and before any
webcasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Gundlach, BC429385,
California Superior Court, Los Angeles County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker Donelson Hires Bayer CropScience&#8217;s Top Patent Counsel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker Donelson Bearman Caldwell  Berkotitz PC hired
Richard E.L. Henderson for its intellectual-property practice
group, the Memphis, Tennessee-based firm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henderson joins from Bayer AG (BAYN)&#8217;s Bayer CropScience unit,
where he was senior patent counsel and head of the patent group.
He has also served as patent counsel for Bayer&#8217;s Industrial
Chemicals Division. Before that, he was a patent attorney at
Merck  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He does patent and trademark acquisition and IP-related
transactional work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has an undergraduate degree from the University of North
Carolina, a doctorate in organic chemistry from the University
of Illinois and a law degree from the Chicago-Kent College of
Law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chip Skowron, the ex-FrontPoint
Partners LLC hedge-fund manager charged as part of a nationwide
insider-trading crackdown, will waive his right to be indicted,
the government said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skowron, charged in April with conspiracy, securities fraud
and obstruction of justice, was in talks with federal
prosecutors to resolve the case, prosecutors said in court
papers in June. Yesterday, the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in
Manhattan filed a notice of intent to submit a criminal
information in Skowron&#8217;s case after he waives indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendants regularly waive their right to be indicted when
entering into an agreement in which they plead guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one-page filing was signed by prosecutors and by James
Benjamin Jr., a lawyer for Skowron. Benjamin declined to comment
on whether his client will plead guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. federal system, a defendant charged with a
felony has the right to be charged by an indictment, which is a
document approved by a grand jury. A defendant may instead agree
to be charged in a criminal information, which is filed by
prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government claims Skowron obtained nonpublic
information from Yves Benhamou, an expert in hepatitis drugs and
a former adviser for Human Genome Sciences Inc. The tips
concerned hepatitis C drug trials and enabled Greenwich,
Connecticut-based FrontPoint to avoid more than $30 million in
losses, the government said. Benhamou has pleaded guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the criminal case, Skowron has been sued by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Skowron, 11-MAG-00997, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asks Judge to Toss $19 Billion Madoff Trustee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) asked a judge to dismiss a $19 billion
lawsuit by the liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm, saying the
trustee lacks &#8220;standing&#8221; to bring common-law claims against
the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff last week threw out trustee
Irving Picard&#8217;s bid for almost $9 billion in damages from HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) and feeder funds, saying Picard has no right to sue
using common-law claims against parties &#8220;who allegedly violated
a duty to Madoff Securities&#8217; customers by failing to detect
Madoff&#8217;s fraud.&#8221; Citing the ruling, JPMorgan asked Judge
Colleen McMahon, who is handling its dispute with Picard, to
toss out similar demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As Judge Rakoff held in the HSBC case, the trustee has no
standing to bring customer damages claims,&#8221; the New York-based
bank said in a filing Aug. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, UBS AG (UBSN), saying Picard sued it for more than $2
billion based on common-law claims of aiding and abetting the
fraud, asked McMahon to bar the trustee from seeking such
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan and UBS filings were &#8220;expected,&#8221; said Picard
spokeswoman Amanda Remus. The Madoff trustee is preparing to sue
HSBC for $2 billion in bankruptcy court, she has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remus declined to comment on Rakoff&#8217;s remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy court case is Picard v. Katz, 1:10-ap-05287,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The review is Picard v. Katz, 11-cv-03605, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;Kohlberg Capital Wins Dismissal of Investor Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kohlberg Capital Corp. (KCAP), the investment company taken public
in 2006 by leveraged-buyout pioneer Jerome Kohlberg, won
dismissal of a lawsuit filed by an investor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kohlberg Capital was sued in federal court in Manhattan in
December 2009 by investor Dennis J. Angeleri of Muskegon,
Michigan, who accused the New York-based company of lying about
the value of its portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angeleri said in the suit that Kohlberg Capital issued a
release in November 2009 that was &#8220;materially false&#8221; because
it misstated the value of the company&#8217;s investment portfolio.
Kohlberg asked U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldbaum Cedarbaum in
June to dismiss the complaint, saying its investments are
difficult to value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cedarbaum on July 28 signed an order approving Kohlberg&#8217;s
motion, according to a court document filed yesterday. Cedarbaum
said Angeleri can file an amended complaint no later than Aug.
22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Angeleri v. Pearson, 09-cv-10609, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macquarie, Bank of Queensland Lose Bid to Throw Out ASIC Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Queensland Ltd. and two other lenders lost a bid to
dismiss a lawsuit that claims they knew Storm Financial Ltd. was
violating regulations before the fund manager and adviser
collapsed in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Court of Australia Justice John Reeves ruled
yesterday the lawsuit can proceed. Investors will be able to
claim damages from Bank of Queensland, Macquarie Bank Ltd. and
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) if a judge rules that Storm broke
the rules and they knew about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Securities  Investments Commission, which
filed the lawsuit in December, &#8220;has now made a valid and
justiciable claim for relief,&#8221; Reeves wrote in a ruling posted
on the Federal Court&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storm, which had managed A$4 billion ($4.4 billion),
induced investors to mortgage their homes, take out margin loans
and put the money into Storm Australian Index Trusts with the
promise their returns would be enough to pay the loans and live
off the proceeds in retirement, according to ASIC&#8217;s statement of
claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks didn&#8217;t exercise due diligence to determine if the
investors could afford the loans, failed to warn them of the
risks and received interest fees, possible commissions and the
prospect of further referrals from Storm, according to the ASIC
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storm got commissions from the trust investments and had an
incentive to encourage clients to put more money into the funds,
the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company collapsed in January, 2009. Storm said at the
time trading losses resulted in a decline in income which the
company couldn&#8217;t absorb any longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Australian Securities and Investments
Commission v. Bank of Queensland Ltd. (BOQ) NSD1797/2010. Federal
Court of Australia (Sydney). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York State&#8217;s Fracking Lawsuit Barred by Law, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government said it will ask a judge to dismiss a
New York lawsuit that seeks to force a fuller environmental
review of how natural-gas extraction could affect 9 million
water drinkers in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. plans to ask U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis
in Brooklyn, New York, to dismiss the case on the grounds that
the state can&#8217;t prove injury and doesn&#8217;t have the right to sue
federal agencies, according to a letter filed with the court
Aug. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York state complaint is &#8220;barred by well-settled
principles of sovereign immunity,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney
Sandra Levy wrote in the letter to the judge. Sovereign immunity
protects the U.S. from lawsuits unless it waives the right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued on May 31,
saying a commission that oversees the Delaware River Basin has
proposed regulations that will allow hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, at 15,000 to 18,000 gas wells without a full
environmental review. Fracking is the process in which water,
sand and chemicals are pumped underground to break apart rock
formations and release natural gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As our complaint makes clear, the federal government has
an obligation to undertake the necessary environmental impact
study,&#8221; Schneiderman spokeswoman Lauren Passalacqua said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman&#8217;s suit seeks to halt the regulations until the
commission complies with the National Environmental Policy Act&#8217;s
requirement for a full review of all health and safety risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is New York v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 11-
cv-2599, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York
(Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIAA Sues Deutsche Bank Over Mortgage-Backed Securities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers Insurance  Annuity Association of America sued
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) in New York state court for fraud over
residential mortgage-backed securities the Frankfurt-based bank
sold it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIAA invested in the securities unaware that the bank
internally viewed the loans and securities as &#8220;pigs&#8221; and
&#8220;crap,&#8221; according to the suit, filed Aug. 1 in New York state
Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit duplicates wording and claims that Dexia SA (DEXB), the
lender to local governments rescued by France and Belgium in
2008, made in a similar suit filed against Deutsche Bank last
month in connection with more than $1 billion in residential
mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, Germany&#8217;s biggest bank, originated,
purchased, financed and securitized &#8220;exception&#8221; loans into the
securities while betting against the U.S. housing market as far
back as 2005, ultimately developing a $10 billion short position
that paid off when the loans backing the securities failed,
according to the TIAA complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will vigorously defend ourselves against this suit
which we believe is without merit,&#8221; Renee Calabro, a
spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, said in an e-mailed statement.
The bank gave the same response to the Dexia suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Teachers Insurance  Annuity Association of
America v. Deutsche Bank AG, 652122/2011, New York state Supreme
Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-UBS Banker Martin Lack Is Indicted in Tax Conspiracy Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former UBS AG banker was indicted on a charge of
conspiring to help wealthy Americans evade taxes by hiding
accounts in a smaller Swiss regional bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Lack, a Swiss resident and independent investment
adviser, helped U.S. clients hide assets from the Internal
Revenue Service through accounts at UBS and the so-called
cantonal bank, according to an indictment in federal court in
Fort Lauderdale, Florida. That bank, not named in the
indictment, is Basler Kantonalbank, according to a person
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment cites nine U.S. customers that Lack
assisted. He helped them withdraw cash from undeclared accounts
and discouraged them from joining an IRS amnesty program,
according to the indictment. UBS, the largest Swiss bank,
avoided prosecution in 2009 by paying $780 million and admitting
it helped Americans evade taxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lack would and did solicit U.S. customers to open
undeclared accounts at UBS and Cantonal Bank because Swiss bank
secrecy would assist U.S. customers to conceal their ownership
of the accounts,&#8221; according to the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack is accused of conspiring with Renzo Gadola, a UBS
banker from 1995 until 2008. Gadola pleaded guilty Dec. 22 in
federal court in Miami, admitting that he encouraged U.S.
clients to move their undeclared UBS accounts to Basler
Kantonalbank. (BSKP) He is cooperating with prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack didn&#8217;t immediately return a call left at the firm
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Buess, a spokesman for Basler Kantonalbank, a Swiss
regional lender based in Basel, said he couldn&#8217;t confirm or deny
any &#8220;cooperation between Lack and Basler Kantonalbank.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lack case is U.S. v. Lack, 11-cr-60184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). The
Gadola case is U.S. v. Gadola, 10-cr-20878, U.S. District Court,

&lt;p&gt;Ex-News of the World Editor Said to Be Arrested in Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London police arrested former News of the World managing
editor Stuart Kuttner as part of their probe into phone hacking
and bribery at News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s now-defunct Sunday tabloid, two
people familiar with the case said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 71-year-old man was arrested by appointment at a north
London police station and later released on bail, the
Metropolitan Police said in statements yesterday. The man is
Kuttner, said the people, who declined to be identified because
they&#8217;re not authorized to name suspects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the 11th arrest stemming from police investigations
opened this year into allegations that journalists at the
tabloid hacked into the phones of celebrities, politicians, and
murder victims, and bribed police for information. The scandal
forced News Corp. (NWS) to shutter the 168-year-old News of the World
and drop its bid for British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police have previously arrested Rebekah Brooks, a former
chief executive officer of News Corp.&#8217;s News International unit,
and ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson, who was Prime
Minister David Cameron&#8217;s press chief until January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number for Kuttner couldn&#8217;t be located in public filings
or on the Internet. A police spokesman declined to comment
beyond the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;News International continues to fully cooperate with the
Metropolitan Police Service in their ongoing investigations,&#8221;
spokeswoman Daisy Dunlop said in a phone interview. She declined
to provide contact information or the name of an attorney for
Kuttner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NBA Sues Players Association to Forestall Antitrust Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Basketball Association sued its players
association, asking a court to rule that the league&#8217;s lockout of
players doesn&#8217;t violate antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit arises from the union&#8217;s &#8220;threatened use of
antitrust litigation to extract more favorable terms and
conditions of employment&#8221; in collective-bargaining
negotiations, the NBA said in a complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The union&#8217;s improper threats of antitrust litigation are
having a direct, immediate and harmful effect upon the ability
of the parties to negotiate a new collective bargaining
agreement,&#8221; the NBA said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The league said it&#8217;s seeking court orders stating that the
lockout doesn&#8217;t violate antitrust laws and that federal courts
don&#8217;t have jurisdiction to end the lockout. The case was
assigned to U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NBA and the National Basketball Players Association
made no significant progress Aug. 1 in their first formal
bargaining session on a new labor contract since the lockout
began one month ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NBA also filed an unfair labor practices charge with
the National Labor Relations Board yesterday, accusing the
players association of failing to negotiate in good faith, the
league said in a statement. In May, the union filed a complaint
against the league with the NLRB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The players&#8217; association will seek the dismissal of both
the lawsuit and the unfair labor practice charge, said William
Hunter, the union&#8217;s executive director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association &#8220;has not made any decision to disclaim its
role as the collective bargaining representative of the players
and has been engaged in good faith bargaining with the NBA for
over two years,&#8221; Hunter said in a statement. &#8220;We urge the NBA
to engage with us at the bargaining table and to use more
productively the short time we have left before the 2011-12
season is seriously jeopardized.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is National Basketball Association v. National
Basketball Players Association, 11-cv-05369, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-TCW Employee Searched New Space Before Gundlach&#8217;s Firing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DoubleLine Capital LP communications director Barbara
VanEvery said she started looking for office space months before
TCW Group Inc. fired her and Jeffrey Gundlach in December of
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VanEvery testified yesterday at a trial that pits Gundlach,
her and two other former TCW employees against the company over
claims they stole TCW&#8217;s trade secrets and proprietary
information to set up DoubleLine within weeks after they were
terminated. They have countered that TCW fired them to avoid
paying Gundlach&#8217;s group hundreds of millions of dollars in
performance fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under questioning by TCW&#8217;s lawyer, VanEvery said she
retained a real estate broker in September 2009 to find office
space because she expected that either Gundlach would get fired
or that he and his group would leave TCW through a negotiated
departure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was under the impression that something was going to
happen by December,&#8221; VanEvery told jurors yesterday in state
court in Los Angeles. &#8220;It was coming to a head. I felt there
was going to be some kind of separation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach, 51, was the investment chief at TCW, the Los
Angeles-based unit of Societe Generale. (GLE) He started DoubleLine in
December 2009, 10 days after TCW fired him. TCW sued Gundlach a
month later, after half of its fixed-income professionals had
joined DoubleLine. Gundlach countersued, saying he was fired so
that TCW wouldn&#8217;t have to pay management and performance fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VanEvery wasn&#8217;t cross-examined by DoubleLine lawyers
yesterday and she is scheduled to finish her testimony today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Gundlach, BC429385,
California Superior Court, Los Angeles County. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Gave Negligent Advice to 88-Year-Old, Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) had undue influence over 88-year-old Ie Seng
Hoan and was negligent in its investment advice to the partly
deaf client, resulting in a loss of $18.1 million, his lawyer
said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It knew full well of Pak Ie&#8217;s health problems, his
language difficulties and his lack of financial acumen and
education,&#8221; Ie&#8217;s lawyer Koh Hai Keong said in his opening
statement at a Singapore High Court trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ie, an Indonesian textile businessman, accused Citigroup&#8217;s
Singapore unit, where he was a client since 2003, of negligent
misrepresentations and hiding material facts and claimed the
bank had &#8220;undue influence&#8221; on his investment decisions. He was
also misled by his banker into believing he made a profit when
he suffered a loss after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in Sept. 2008, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup has denied wrongdoing and sent Ie a letter in
2007 confirming that he had extensive investing experience and
had an &#8220;aggressive&#8221; risk tolerance, according to the bank&#8217;s
defense filed by its lawyer Hri Kumar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank acted professionally in managing the accounts of
Ie and his company Zhen Yin at all times, Hong Kong-based
spokesman Godwin Chellam said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The litigation is wholly without merit and we will defend
it vigorously in court,&#8221; Chellam said, adding it would be
inappropriate to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Zhen Yin Co. v Citibank NA S550/2009 in the
Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world&#8217;s fourth-
largest energy company, said its Nigerian Escravos gas-to-
liquids plant is more than 70 percent complete and on course to
start production in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facility, which will refine natural gas to produce
33,000 barrels a day of fuels including diesel, is set &#8220;to be
completed at the end of 2012,&#8221; Andrew Fawthrop, chief executive
officer of the company&#8217;s Nigerian unit, said in an interview
yesterday in Abuja, the capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron holds a 75 percent interest and will operate the
estimated $8.4 billion project jointly developed with the state-
owned Nigeria National Petroleum Corp., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, holder of Africa&#8217;s largest gas reserves of about
187 trillion cubic feet, burns off, or flares, most of the fuel
it produces along with oil because it lacks the infrastructure
to process it. At least $3 billion in revenue is lost annually
due to flaring, according to the Petroleum Ministry. The country
flared 15.2 billion cubic meters last year, according to the
World Bank&#8217;s Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s daily production in Nigeria averaged 524,000
barrels of crude, 206 million cubic feet (5.8 million cubic
meters) of natural gas and 5,000 barrels of liquefied petroleum
gas in 2010 as security improved in the oil-rich Niger River
delta, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company holds interests in 10 deepwater oil blocks in
Nigeria, including its 250,000 barrels per day Agbami field
located 70 miles (113 kilometers) off the country&#8217;s coast. A 10-
well development program within the next three years is expected
to boost output to offset declining production in the field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re continuing the development of the Agbami field and
we&#8217;re looking for new opportunities in deepwater continuously,&#8221;
Fawthrop said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) countered remarks from
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) about efforts to purchase assets from Novell
Inc. (NOVL), escalating a verbal feud over technology patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft asked Google to take part in a bid for
Novell&#8217;s patents, it wanted to block the Internet-search giant
from gaining protection against the other bidding partners,
Google Chief Legal Officer David Drummond said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Making sure that we would be unable to assert these
patents to defend Android -- and having us pay for the privilege
-- must have seemed like an ingenious strategy to them,&#8221;
Drummond said this afternoon on Google&#8217;s blog, updating a
posting he wrote yesterday. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t fall for it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drummond drew flak from Microsoft yesterday, when he said
the rival company formed a coalition with Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Oracle
Corp. to keep the Novell patents away from Google. The remark
was part of a broad rebuke of Google&#8217;s competitors that accused
them of a &#8220;hostile, organized campaign&#8221; against Android, which
has emerged as the top operating system for smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s rivals are joining forces to purchase patents to
keep them out of the Mountain View, California-based company&#8217;s
hands and taking other steps to make it more expensive for
handset makers to use Android, he said yesterday. Drummond cited
Microsoft and Apple working together to acquire Novell&#8217;s patent
portfolio as an example of the campaign against Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Response &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith responded yesterday by
saying Google had been asked to participate in the Novell bid.
Microsoft also released an e-mail from Google turning down the
offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That prompted today&#8217;s update from Drummond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s objective has been to keep from Google and
Android device-makers any patents that might be used to defend
against their attacks,&#8221; Drummond said. &#8220;A joint acquisition of
the Novell patents that gave all parties a license would have
eliminated any protection these patents could offer to Android
against attacks from Microsoft and its bidding partners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, reiterated today that the company asked Google to
join the Novell partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We offered Google the opportunity to bid with us to buy
the Novell patents; they said no,&#8221; Shaw said in a series of
messages on Twitter. &#8220;Why? Because they wanted to buy something
that they could use to assert against someone else. So
partnering with others and reducing patent liability across
industry is not something they wanted to help do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nortel Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, Apple and Microsoft have been ramping up spending
on patent portfolios to gain exclusive rights to a broadening
array of technology, much of it used in the fast-growing area of
smartphones. A group that includes Apple and Microsoft beat out
Google in June with a $4.5 billion bid for patents previously
owned by Nortel Networks Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle sued Google last year, accusing it of patent and
copyright infringement over the use of Java technology used in
Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google fell $23.65 to $577.52 today on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. The shares have declined 2.8 percent this year.
Microsoft, down 7.1 percent in 2011, dropped 98 cents to $25.94. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), seeking to
placate buyers and guard its reputation, is compensating
investors for losses they incurred after a $1.5 billion
commercial-mortgage bond deal was pulled last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is paying clients that purchased the securities
and entered into contracts that protect against changes in
interest rates and prices for the debt, according to two people
familiar with the transaction who declined to be identified
because the talks are private. The investors will be paid for
contracts that lost money between when the deal was placed and
its withdrawal five days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Inc. (C) were forced to scuttle the
deal on July 28 after Standard  Poor&#8217;s withdrew its grades
because the rating company spotted an error in its process. The
banks already had to boost yields and restructure the
transaction, tied to loans on everything from shopping centers
to student housing, as investors pushed back on deal terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bankers have enterprise value to protect,&#8221; said
Richard Jones, a partner in the real estate group at law firm
Dechert LLP. &#8220;Once something goes this fundamentally wrong, it
doesn&#8217;t matter who is responsible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Mark Costiglio of Citigroup, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses were likely &#8220;relatively small&#8221; because markets
weren&#8217;t volatile between the time the deal priced and when SP
pulled its ratings, said Richard Parkus, a commercial-mortgage
debt analyst at Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The issuers did the right thing by absorbing investors&#8217;
hedging losses,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies like DirecTV (DTV) and McDonald&#8217;s
Corp. (MCD) that frequently buy back their own shares are recommended
holdings for a &#8220;balanced global portfolio,&#8221; Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s
Robert Buckland said in a note dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buybacks provide an opportunity to benefit when there is
limited equity demand, and low interest rates and cheap
valuations combine to make buybacks even more profitable,
Buckland wrote. The note listed 40 stocks that Citigroup
analysts rated &#8220;hold&#8221; or &#8220;buy&#8221; and have positive earnings
momentum, including International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and
Procter  Gamble Co. (PG) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It makes sense to incorporate contracting-supply equities
into a balanced global portfolio,&#8221; Buckland wrote. &#8220;IBM&#8217;s
share count has almost halved since the late 1990s. Even gold
doesn&#8217;t see supply dynamics as attractive as that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index companies authorized 38 percent
more buybacks in the first quarter of 2011 than a year earlier,
data compiled by Birinyi Associates Inc. Corporations are facing
&#8220;ripe&#8221; conditions for buying back shares, pursuing mergers and
acquisitions and increasing debt after hoarding cash since 2009,
Barclays Capital&#8217;s Jeffrey Meli said on July 22. Companies
amassed a record $1.9 trillion in cash after the 2008 credit
crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration appointed
today former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) executive Steven VanRoekel as the
U.S. government&#8217;s top technology official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VanRoekel, 41, worked from 2009 to 2011 as the managing
director at the Federal Communications Commission. He will
replace federal Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra, who is
leaving this month for a joint position at Harvard University&#8217;s
John F. Kennedy School of Government and the Berkman Center for
Internet and Society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama selected VanRoekel for the position
because of his career-long focus on technology, combined public
and private-sector experience, strategic ability and &#8220;track
record for execution,&#8221; Jeffrey Zients, deputy director of the
Office of Management and Budget, said during a meeting today
with reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VanRoekel, whose official first day of work at the White
House is tomorrow, will continue the cloud-computing and data-
center consolidation initiatives Kundra started, VanRoekel and
Zients said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration is not &#8220;asking someone to come in and
make radical changes&#8221; to the information-technology reform
policy outlined by Kundra during his tenure, though &#8220;Steve will
be adding to the agenda over time,&#8221; Zients said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is &#8220;of course a tremendous priority,&#8221;
VanRoekel told reporters. After being selected for the position,
VanRoekel said &#8220;my very first meeting was with Howard
Schmidt,&#8221; the White House cybersecurity coordinator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FCC Initiatives &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VanRoekel most recently served as executive director of the
citizen and organizational engagement division at the U.S.
Agency for International Development, according to a White House
statement. Before moving to USAID in June, he oversaw all
operational, technical, financial, and human resource aspects at
the FCC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VanRoekel said in a blog post last year that he had worked
to improve communication and openness among FCC employees
through technology and new media, including the creation of an
internal website that let workers comment anonymously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also promoted the use of social media and helped to
implement Kundra&#8217;s data-center consolidation and cloud
initiatives inside the agency, VanRoekel said. The FCC was the
first federal agency to have a website based on a &#8220;FISMA-
compliant cloud,&#8221; or an Internet-based web platform   that met
government security standards, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates&#8217;s Assistant &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before entering government, VanRoekel worked at Microsoft
from 1994 to 2009, including almost three years as Chairman Bill Gates&#8217;s assistant. His last post at the Redmond, Washington-
based company was as senior director for the Windows server and
tools division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Steven is a well-respected member of the tech community
and he is well positioned to carry on the great work started by
Vivek Kundra,&#8221; Microsoft said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VanRoekel received a B.A. in management of information
systems from Iowa State University, according to a White House
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks setting up bond
sales for U.S. states and cities would be required to tell
public officials about potentially costly risks and conflicts of
interest in the deals under proposed rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which writes
regulations for banks that work in the tax-exempt debt market,
said yesterday that it asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission to approve the proposed rules placing greater
disclosure requirements on bond underwriters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is part of an effort to reshape regulation of the
$2.9 trillion municipal-securities market after the 2008
financial crisis. Since then, state and local taxpayers have
been stuck with billions of dollars in unexpected costs because
complex bond deals, pitched as money-savers, backfired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules would require banks to disclose all &#8220;material
risks&#8221; of bond financings, including the floating-rate
securities coupled with interest-rate swaps that once
flourished. Banks also would have to disclose potential
conflicts of interest, including  incentives they have to
recommend such transactions, payments they may get from other
parties in the deal and whether banks are betting on derivative
contracts that only pay off if the borrower defaults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rulemaking board yesterday told financial advisers that
they may face the regulations placed on broker-dealers if they
arrange private placements of securities sometimes characterized
as bank loans, a growing niche in the public-finance market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
is drafting rules that would force banks that pitch interest-
rate derivative deals to also disclose details about the risks,
act in the customers&#8217; best interests, and ensure that they have
the financial wherewithal to handle the potential impacts of
wrong-way bets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ICE Clear Credit Lowers Member Standard Before CFTC Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intercontinental Exchange Inc., owner of the world&#8217;s
largest credit-default swaps clearinghouse, lowered its
membership standards before U.S. rules designed to expand access
to the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICE Clear Credit, the clearinghouse formerly known as ICE
Trust that was re-named last month when it came under Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange
Commission oversight, now requires broker dealers and futures
commission merchants to have $100 million in adjusted net
capital and 5 percent of their customer funds as excess net
capital, according to its rules. Previously, $5 billion in
minimum net worth was required to be a clearing member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clearing member standards have pitted the largest banks
such as JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) against smaller
independent brokers Newedge USA LLC and MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF)
A trade group representing smaller firms has lobbied Congress
and regulators since last year for access to derivatives
clearing. The largest banks have contended that clearing members
have to be large enough to absorb losses if one of them defaults
and must have the market ability to take on swaps positions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC has proposed that firms must have a minimum of $50
million in capital to become a member of swaps clearinghouses.
The regulator hasn&#8217;t yet completed that rule and is expected to
do so before the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish government doesn&#8217;t plan changes to the rate of

Elena Salgado said at a news conference in Madrid yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation will press on with its announced fiscal program

&lt;p&gt;China is considering creating a ministerial-level

unidentified people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move will strengthen central government&#8217;s supervision

&lt;p&gt;IBM European Antitrust Complaints Dropped by Three Companies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three companies are dropping European Union antitrust
complaints against International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) over
its mainframe computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T3 Technologies Inc. and Neon Enterprise Software LLC have
or will withdraw separate complaints filed with the European
Commission, IBM said in a regulatory filing last month.
TurboHercules SAS has also withdrawn its complaint, said Carina
Oliveri, a spokeswoman for the company in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission declined to comment on the status of its
investigation into allegations IBM linked sales of its mainframe
computers to its software and that it discriminated against
competing sellers of services for the computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the biggest computer-services company, declined to
comment beyond its regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin, Texas-based Neon said in May that it settled its
legal dispute with IBM and would stop selling its zPrime
software and request customers to remove and destroy their
copies. Two calls and two e-mails to the company yesterday
weren&#8217;t immediately answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T3 withdrew its EU complaint in May after dropping an
appeal to a U.S. court ruling dismissing its claims against IBM,
according to IBM&#8217;s filing. T3 didn&#8217;t respond to a telephone
message and e-mail to its Tampa, Florida offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission opened two separate investigations into
Armonk, New York-based IBM last year over possible anti-
competitive behavior that may have blocked competition for rival
mainframe software and on maintenance contracts for the systems
by &#8220;restricting or delaying access to spare parts.&#8221; EU
antitrust regulators often end investigations into companies
after complaints from rivals or customers are withdrawn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyds Banking Posts Loss on Irish Loans, Insurance Redress &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), Britain&#8217;s biggest mortgage
lender, reported a first-half net loss after Irish bad loan
provisions increased, funding costs rose and the lender set
aside 3.2 billion pounds ($5.2 billion) to compensate insurance
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net loss was 2.31 billion pounds compared with a profit
of 596 million pounds in the first half of last year, the
London-based bank said in a statement yesterday. That missed the
median loss of 2.2 billion pounds estimated by nine analysts in
a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyds, 41 percent-government owned, said its net interest
margin, the difference between what it earns on loans and its
funding cost, shrank to 2.07 percent from 2.12 percent in the
same period of 2010. The shares slumped to the lowest in more
than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyds&#8217;s funding costs are rising as Chief Executive
Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio, 47, weans the bank off low-
interest government loans and onto costlier wholesale funding.
In June, the bank announced it was cutting 15,000 jobs to help
reduce costs by 1.5 billion pounds, in addition to the 27,000
roles slashed since its acquisition of HBOS Plc in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Boerse, NYSE Euronext (NYX) Face Antitrust Concerns &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext have indicated how
they will seek to counter concerns submitted to European Union
regulators by competitors and customers over their $9 billion
merger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission must decide by today whether to
open an in-depth investigation of the buyout&#8217;s ramifications,
which can last as long as 90 working days. Regulators will weigh
complaints from the firms&#8217; biggest customers, including traders,
banks and brokers, that the combination may harm competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregor Pottmeyer, Deutsche Boerse&#8217;s chief financial
officer, last week tried to allay concerns from the Association
for Financial Markets in Europe that the exchanges won&#8217;t pass on
a &#8220;fair share&#8221; of about 400 million euros ($572 million) in
cost savings to customers, even as he said the exchange expects
a formal EU antitrust complaint about the deal by October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two &#8220;strong arguments&#8221; on how customers will benefit from
the business combination are savings from lower capital
requirements for the combined company and cross-margining to
reduce how much cash investors must post to clearinghouses to
back their trades, Pottmeyer said on a July 29 conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulatory approval is the last hurdle for the deal that
would create the largest owner of equity and derivatives
markets. Joaquin Almunia, the EU&#8217;s competition chief, said in
March a longer probe into the &#8220;complex deal&#8221; is likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of planned exchange tie-ups around the world have
run into regulatory problems this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playboy Founder&#8217;s Son-in-Law Settles SEC Inside-Trading Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The son-in-law of Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner
settled allegations of insider trading in Playboy stock,
agreeing to resolve a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission for $168,352. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William A. Marovitz, who is married to former Playboy
Enterprises, Inc. Chief Executive Officer Christie Hefner, made
$100,952 on the trades, according to the SEC complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attorney and former Illinois state senator, Marovitz,
66, has been married to Hefner since 1995, according to the
complaint. Hefner led Chicago-based Playboy from 1988 to 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Marovitz has no comment on the complaint or the
settlement agreement,&#8221; his attorney, Jim Streicker of Chicago,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;He lost substantial sums of
money on his investments in Playboy over the years,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Hefner&#8217;s husband didn&#8217;t admit or deny the SEC&#8217;s
allegations, he consented to a court order barring him from
further violation of the SEC&#8217;s regulations, according to the
commission&#8217;s statement. The settlement is still subject to court
approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Marovitz,
11cv5259, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-UBS Client Greeley Pleads Guilty to Hiding $13 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former UBS AG (UBSN) client pleaded guilty to filing a false
U.S. tax return that concealed more than $13 million in two
Swiss accounts, according to the Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert E. Greeley admitted in federal court yesterday in
San Francisco that he filed a tax return in 2008 that failed to
disclose two UBS accounts set up in the names of Cayman Islands
entities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer set Greeley&#8217;s sentencing
for Nov. 9. Greeley agreed to pay a civil penalty of $6.8
million for failing to file a Report of Foreign Bank and
Financial Accounts form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greeley, a resident of San Francisco, was a client of
former UBS banker Renzo Gadola, who pleaded guilty Dec. 22 in
federal court in Miami. Greeley is one of more than two dozen
former UBS clients accused of tax crimes since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Greeley, 11-cr-374, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Mizuho Investment Banker Charged With Insider Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Ammann, a former investment banker at Mizuho
International Plc, and two women were charged with insider
trading in shares of OCE NV (OCE), a Dutch printing-equipment maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammann and Jessica Mang were charged last week, and
Christina Weckwerth, a German national, was charged this morning
at a London court, the U.K. Financial Services Authority said
today. Ammann was charged with three counts of insider dealing,
Weckwerth two counts and Mang with one count. Ammann and
Weckwerth were also charged with money laundering, and the ex-
banker is also facing two counts of encouraging insider dealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges relate to trading in OCE shares between
February and November 2009, the FSA said. Canon Inc. agreed to
buy OCE in a 730 million-euro ($1 billion) deal in November
2009. Mizuho acted as the financial adviser to Canon, the
Japanese imaging company, in the deal, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA, which hadn&#8217;t brought an insider-trading case until
2008, is currently prosecuting 13 other individuals for the
crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mizuho said in a statement the FSA hasn&#8217;t alleged any
wrongdoing by the bank and no actions are being taken against
it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trio were released on bail and are scheduled to appear
again before a London judge on Aug. 23. A lawyer for Ammann
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levitt Says Overhaul of SEC Would Cripple Investigations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur Levitt, former U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission chairman, said a proposal to restructure the SEC
would &#8220;emasculate&#8221; the commission. He said he believes the
reorganization &#8220;is prompted by constituent pressure, mostly by
the financial community to shut down the SEC&#8217;s efforts to
inspect and examine broker-dealers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levitt talked with Bloomberg&#8217;s Ken Prewitt and Tom Keene on

&lt;p&gt;Permira Advisers LLP, manager of a
9.6 billion-euro ($14 billion) leveraged buyout fund, said it
hired Alan Chen from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as head of China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen, a nine-year Goldman Sachs veteran, was most recently
an executive director at the bank&#8217;s Asian Special Situations
Group, Permira said in an e-mailed statement today. Before that,
he worked in the Wall Street firm&#8217;s corporate finance group,
according to the release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permira, based in London, promoted former Goldman Sachs
banker Henry Chen to co-head of its Asian operations in January.
Steve Sun, a managing director at Goldman Sachs&#8217;s private-equity
unit, left in May to join TPG Capital as a China partner, people
with knowledge of the matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past five years, Permira has invested more than $2
billion in three companies in Asia: Asia Broadcast Satellite,
Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27), and Japan&#8217;s Arysta LifeScience
Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permira also hired Christian Paul, a former director at

&lt;p&gt;Investors should retain holdings in
commodities even as the global economy expands at a slower pace
as raw-material demand is strong enough to support further gains,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said, forecasting gold and copper rallies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold may jump to a record $1,800 an ounce by yearend, while
copper revisits $10,000 per metric ton, Colin P. Fenton and
Matthew Lehmann wrote in a report yesterday. The bank had raised
forecasts for both metals, they said, without giving the earlier
estimates. The bank can&#8217;t release a separate report of full
calls, said spokeswoman Polly Leung, citing compliance policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities as measured by the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Spot
Index fell for a seventh session today, the longest slump since
May 2010, on concern that the global economy is slowing.
JPMorgan cut its forecast for third-quarter U.S. growth by a
percentage point to 1.5 percent, Chief U.S. Economist Michael Feroli said yesterday. The U.S. is the world&#8217;s largest user of
oil, and is second to China in terms of copper and aluminum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Baring a material contraction in global growth, which we
do not currently expect, commodities should continue to move
higher,&#8221; said New York-based Fenton, global head of commodities
research and strategy, and London-based Lehmann, a strategist.
&#8220;Even at a now slower pace, global growth in the second half
should be enough to outpace still-constrained supply in the
major commodity markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-Half Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley last month kept
their bullish views on copper and oil, predicting a global
economic recovery in the second half. Copper was set to benefit
from Chinese restocking, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Hussein Allidina said in a July 6 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Spot Index has advanced 6.3 percent this year,
driven by gains in precious metals, lean hogs and energy. The
gauge rallied 20 percent last year and soared 50 percent in 2009
as the global economy emerged from recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In keeping with our overall portfolio strategy to put our
money as far from the current crisis spots as possible, we stay
long commodities,&#8221; with gold as a &#8220;top pick,&#8221; Fenton and
Lehmann wrote. So-called long positions are bets on gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The major commodity markets are all currently
experiencing supply issues which in spite of slowing demand are
keeping prices high,&#8221; the JPMorgan report said. &#8220;We remain
positive on commodity performance over the medium term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot gold climbed to record $1,672.80 an ounce yesterday,
taking this year&#8217;s gain to 17 percent, as investors sought haven
assets. Three-month copper traded at $9,560 per ton on the
London Metal Exchange at 4:01 p.m. in Singapore today. The metal
touched an all-time high of $10,190 on Feb. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Outstrip Supplies&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global copper market &#8220;is tight as demand continues to
outstrip supplies, which is forcing consumers to substitute
copper with other metals when possible and increase the use of
scrap supplies,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide demand for the metal used in wires is set to
exceed output by 377,000 tons this year, according to the
International Copper Study Group. A decline in average grades is
putting upward pressure on costs for the industry, Codelco, the
world&#8217;s largest copper producer, said today in a presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn and wheat, like gold, are &#8220;least sensitive to growth
shocks,&#8221; Fenton and Lehmann wrote the report. Harvests of the
grains &#8220;in the fall will likely bring much lower yields than
currently expected,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheat rallied 17 percent last month in Chicago and traded
at $7.45 per bushel today. Corn has gained almost 13 percent
this year to $7.0625 per bushel on speculation that higher
demand for ethanol and animal feed will keep stockpiles low. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reduced its
estimate for U.S. end-summer natural gas inventories by 1
percent after a heatwave, while forecasting prices will remain
&#8220;under pressure&#8221; as temperatures ease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surge in demand amid the hottest July in U.S. history
contributed to the bank revising its forecast for inventories at
the end of the Northern Hemisphere summer to 3,770 billion cubic
feet, down from an earlier outlook of 3,807, Johan Spetz and
Samantha Dart, London-based analysts at the bank, wrote in an
Aug. 3 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incremental gas demand for power generation more than
doubled in July to 105 billion cubic feet from 43 billion in
June, according to the bank&#8217;s estimates. Temperatures surpassed
100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) in cities from New York to
Houston in June and July, diverting more gas to plants to
generate electricity for air conditioners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural gas futures have dropped since the middle of July
after temperatures subsided and hydroelectricity generation
increased, reducing the need for the fuel, the report said.
Goldman said it sees a &#8220;structural oversupply&#8221; in the U.S. as
a result of shale production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect the underlying balance to remain soft in coming
months, although less so as the transient effect of strong
hydro-generation subsides,&#8221; the analysts wrote, saying they
maintained a &#8220;moderately bearish&#8221; outlook for prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank forecasts gas will average $4 per million British
thermal units for the third quarter and $4.25 per million Btu in
the October-to-December period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural gas futures for delivery in September traded at
$4.09 per million Btu today on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped 10 percent since July 15. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, is studying whether its Lipitor cholesterol pill can
be sold as an over-the-counter medicine, according to a person
familiar with the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company hasn&#8217;t determined whether the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration would allow the drug to be sold without a
prescription, the person said. Pfizer has assembled a team to
examine the feasibility of a switch to over-the-counter sales,
as well as other options for the medicine, said the person, who
asked not to be named because the deliberations are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor, the best-selling drug in the world with $10.7
billion in sales last year, loses U.S. patent exclusivity in
November. Previous attempts to sell over-the-counter versions of
cholesterol-lowering drugs, including Merck  Co.&#8217;s Mevacor and
Zocor, were unsuccessful because of the side effects. Patients
using Lipitor need regular tests of their cholesterol and liver
functioning, according to the drug&#8217;s label. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no reason to think that somehow where Mevacor
and Zocor failed, Lipitor would be successful,&#8221; David Maris, an
analyst with CLSA in New York, said in an e-mail. &#8220;This also
would not be a savings to consumers, just to insurance
companies, managed-care plans and the government,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacKay Jimeson, a spokesman for New York-based Pfizer,
declined to comment on the company&#8217;s plans to pursue an over-
the-counter version of Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Strategic Plans&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can confirm that we have strategic plans in place for
Lipitor&#8217;s loss of exclusivity,&#8221; Jimeson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer gained 13 cents to $17.49 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The drugmaker has gained 8
percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to sell Lipitor without a prescription, Pfizer
must show that patients can safely diagnose themselves and use
the drug properly, said Shelly Burgess, a spokeswoman for the
FDA. No cholesterol-lowering drug, or statin, has been able to
do that, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They would have to provide data to show that consumers
understand the treatment and recognize that cholesterol-
monitoring is required,&#8221; Burgess said. In previous studies
&#8220;most study participants made mistakes and chose to take the
proposed over-the-counter statin when they should not have done
that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugs with U.S. sales of more than $1 billion a year
typically lose 73 percent of revenue in the first three months
after generic copies are introduced, according to an analysis by
Bloomberg Industries. Pfizer successfully took its allergy
medicine, Zyrtec, over-the-counter in 2008 before selling its
consumer unit that year to Johnson  Johnson for $16.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer last month completed a review of four business units
for possible sale or divesture. The company decided to keep the
consumer unit that it gained in the 2009 acquisition of Wyeth
and its established products unit, which makes generic drugs and
branded versions of drugs with expired patents. The company said
it plans to sell its animal health and baby formula units. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amaranth Advisors LLC, the
commodities fund that collapsed in 2006, can&#8217;t proceed with a
lawsuit claiming JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) executives helped cause
its demise by sabotaging a bailout by Citadel Investment Group
LLC, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund, which lost $2 billion in September 2006 on
natural gas futures and derivatives bets that went awry, can&#8217;t
press its claim that JPMorgan officials interfered with its
Citadel deal by casting aspersions on Amaranth&#8217;s financial
condition, New York Supreme Court Judge O. Peter Sherwood
concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amaranth officials can&#8217;t prove two JPMorgan executives&#8217;
statements were the reason Citadel officials decided to cancel
the bailout effort, Sherwood said in a nine-page ruling today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We disagree with the court&#8217;s conclusion and plan to
appeal,&#8221; J.B. Heaton, a Chicago-based lawyer for Amaranth, said
in a telephone interview. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan
spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call for comment on
Sherwood&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amaranth officials alleged in the 2007 suit that JPMorgan
sought to force it into default on a margin call to obtain
collateral Amaranth had posted with the bank. Amaranth tried to
stave off its collapse by unloading its bets to other hedge
funds, including Citadel and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), according
to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Not as Solvent&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fund officials allege Steve Black and Bill Winters, two
JPMorgan officials warned Citadel offices that &#8220;Amaranth is not
as solvent as they are telling you they are,&#8221; according to
Sherwood&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amaranth executives alleged those statements amounted to
interference with an oral agreement the fund&#8217;s officials reached
with Citadel, court filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeals court threw out the rest of Amaranth&#8217;s claims in
the suit in 2009. The court sent the case back to Sherwood to
consider the so-called &#8220;tortuous interference claim.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citadel &#8220;conducted its own research in connection with the
proposed transaction with the fund and evidence of the
tenuousness of the fund&#8217;s financial condition was readily
available,&#8221; the judge said in today&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Amaranth LLC v. JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
603756/2007, New York state Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) may lead U.S.
carriers in rolling back a fare increase as federal ticket taxes
and fees are restored, ending a two-week industry windfall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collections must resume by midnight Aug. 8, the Internal
Revenue Service said today in Washington. Carriers probably will
wait to drop prices to extend gains from the temporary boost,
with Southwest, the biggest discount operator, likely to be the
first to act, according to travel website FareCompare.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be shopping for tickets this weekend,&#8221;
FareCompare.com Chief Executive Officer Rick Seaney said in an
interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s no incentive to do something right now
until someone dips their toe in first. But it&#8217;s coming.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airlines boosted fares after the Federal Aviation
Administration&#8217;s revenue-raising authority lapsed July 22,
halting collection of a 7.5 percent sales tax on domestic
tickets and a fee of $3.70 a flight segment. Increasing base
fares by the same amount produced more revenue for airlines
without consumers seeing a difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Leaving fares unchanged would translate into a healthy 10
percent fare increase, but rarely has the industry raised fares
by this magnitude in a single effort,&#8221; Jamie Baker, a JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) analyst in New York, wrote in a note to clients. He
also said Southwest will be the first to cut prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have not announced any changes and we can&#8217;t comment on
future fares,&#8221; said Brandy King, a Southwest spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate approved legislation today extending the
FAA&#8217;s funding authority through mid-September. While that law
would permit the IRS to retroactively collect taxes from
passengers who bought tickets over the past two weeks, the IRS
said it wouldn&#8217;t attempt to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passengers who purchased fares that included taxes before
collections were suspended won&#8217;t be eligible for a refund, the
IRS said. Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL), Southwest, US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)
and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU) were among the carriers that had said
they would grant refunds once the IRS issued guidelines.
The industry collected about $28 million a day from the
increase, or about $400 million total during the standoff in
Congress over funding the FAA, Baker estimated. The agency has
been operating on a series of short-term extensions since its
last multiyear authorization expired in September 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lag Time &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lag time between when the taxes return and when airlines
rescind the equivalent fare increase could result in unwary
consumers paying both, said Seaney, the CEO of Dallas-based
FareCompare.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for travel doesn&#8217;t appear to be strong enough to
support what would amount to a $40 or $50 price increase for
domestic tickets if airlines attempt to keep their higher prices
in place once the taxes resume, Seaney said. The first airline
to roll back the fare increase probably will force all the
others to do the same, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re getting toward the end of summer when things slow
down anyway,&#8221; Seaney said. &#8220;The airlines are probing two
things: the appetite of the consumer and the appetite of the
competition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southwest said yesterday that it&#8217;s slowing planned capacity
growth through 2012 to reduce operating costs after a series of
price increases appeared to discourage travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think we pushed fares about as much as we should right
now to be productive,&#8221; CEO Gary Kelly said on a conference
call. The Dallas-based airline boosted prices at least seven
times in the first quarter, an unprecedented number, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMR Corp. (AMR)&#8217;s American Airlines began trying to raise fares
today, boosting round-trip prices by $4 to $10 on many domestic
routes plus Alaska, Hawaii and Canada, and US Airways and Air
Canada started matching on some flights, Seaney said. Carriers
typically drop fare increases when others don&#8217;t follow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, had two days of trading losses last
quarter after a perfect first three months in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gains from market-related risk in the investment bank,
chief investment office and mortgage-banking unit topped $200
million on four days during the first half, New York-based
JPMorgan said today in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two days of losses didn&#8217;t exceed the firm&#8217;s value-at-
risk gauge, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Editors: [bn:PRSN=3860965] Carlos Torres []" date="Aug 05, 2011  2:08 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-05/goldman-sachs-sees-one-in-three-risk-of-u-s-recession-1-.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Sees One-in-Three Risk of U.S. Recession</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said today
it saw a one-in-three chance of a renewed recession in the U.S.
within the next nine months as it cut its growth forecast to 2
percent through the first quarter of 2012, chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman now sees growth averaging 1.7 percent this year,
from a prior 1.8 percent forecast, Hatzius said. The world&#8217;s
largest economy will expand 2.1 percent in 2012, down from a
previous estimate of 3 percent, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. unemployment rate will rise to 9.25 percent by the
end of 2012, reflecting the weaker pace of growth, Hatzius said.
A worsening of the European debt crisis, failure to extend the
U.S. payroll-tax cut beyond 2011 and further increases in
unemployment were cited as key risks to the outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even our new forecast is subject to meaningful downside-
risk,&#8221; Hatzius wrote. &#8220;Increases in the U.S. unemployment rate
have historically had a tendency to feed on themselves, and this
could happen again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman expects the Federal Reserve will &#8220;provide more
guidance&#8221; about the future size of its balance sheet at next
week&#8217;s policy meeting, Hatzius wrote. Goldman anticipates &#8220;no
rate hikes or changes in the size of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet
until 2013 or later,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate fell to 9.1 percent in July from 9.2
percent in June, the Labor Department reported today. Payrolls
rose by a more-than-forecast 117,000 after a 46,000 increase in
June, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second
quarter following revised growth of 0.4 percent in the first
three months of the year that was less than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department reported last week. Consumer
spending rose 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since the second
quarter of 2009, when the recent recession ended. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), ranked
second among takeover advisers this year, would be No. 1 if the
bank had its way after a call made to Medco Health Solutions
Inc. (MHS) following its $29.1 billion sale to Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days after the second-largest takeover this year, Medco
received a request from Goldman Sachs to be credited for helping
to arrange the deal, said four people with knowledge of the
matter, who declined to be identified because the conversation
was private. In the July 21 statement announcing the
transaction, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) were
identified as Medco advisers. Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) worked with Express Scripts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the discussion between Goldman Sachs and Medco, a
Goldman Sachs banker reminded Medco of the firm&#8217;s past work for
the company and Medco&#8217;s role as a manager of pharmacy benefits
for some Goldman employees, the people said. Medco considered
the discussion of its business relationships as pressure to put
Goldman Sachs on the deal and was concerned the bank would yank
the benefits contract if it weren&#8217;t credited, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People close to Goldman Sachs said the banker was
highlighting its relationship with Medco, and the firm deserved
recognition for previous work related to the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank that makes most of its money from trading, said it delayed
providing equity-market trading and clearing reports to some
clients this morning because of the high volume yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We told clearing clients that some reports might be
delayed due to the high volume of trading yesterday,&#8221; said
David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm. &#8220;Ninety-
five percent of the usual data was available by 7 a.m. and the
rest was available by the time the U.S. stock market opened.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The affected unit was Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing
LP, which provides trading and clearing services for stocks,
options and futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, made
the most revenue from trading equities of any bank in the world
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNBC.com reported earlier today that Goldman Sachs posted a
message on a client website this morning notifying customers
that there would be custody reporting delays. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock-index futures retreated,
indicating the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index may extend its
biggest selloff since February 2009, as investors await a jobs
report amid concern the world&#8217;s largest economy is faltering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. (CVX) both lost more than 2
percent in Germany as crude oil declined for a sixth day. Alcoa
Inc. (AA), the largest U.S. aluminum producer, slumped 2.8 percent as
metal prices retreated. Banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and
Bank of America Corp. (BAC) also dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the SP 500 expiring in September dropped 0.8
percent to 1,189.7 at 6:02 a.m. in New York. Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures lost 88 points, or 0.8 percent, to
11,283. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The move in equities relative to bonds has been really
shocking,&#8221; said Trevor Greetham, director of asset allocation
at Fidelity International in an interview with Bloomberg
Television. &#8220;If we get a positive payrolls number, markets
would rally very strongly. Lead indicators are still very
negative, so I would be tempted to sell into that rally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks plunged yesterday as concern that the global
economy is weakening prompted a global rout that has wiped off
more than $4.4 trillion from equity market values worldwide
since July 26. The benchmark SP 500 has lost 7.1 percent so far
this week, on course for the biggest five-day selloff since at
least November 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Jobs, Unemployment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s non-farm payrolls report may show that U.S.
employers failed to create enough jobs in July to reduce the
jobless rate, economists said. Payrolls climbed by 85,000
workers after an 18,000 increase in June that was the smallest
this year, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Labor Department release, due at 8:30 a.m. in
Washington, may also show that the jobless rate held at 9.2
percent after rising in each of the previous three months. Data
yesterday showed initial claims for unemployment insurance
payments fell last week to a level that shows limited
improvement in the labor market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon lost 2.3 percent to $72.18 in Germany and Chevron
retreated 2.6 percent to $94.28 as crude oil fell to its lowest
price in eight months as investors speculated that fuel demand
will falter as the U.S. economy stalls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa lost 2.8 percent to $12.58 in early New York trading
as base metals tumbled on the London Metal Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan lost 2.4 percent to $37.02 in Germany, while Bank
of America retreated 3.7 percent to $8.50 in early New York
trading. The two biggest U.S. banks respectively tumbled 5
percent and 7.4 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The City Hall may announce a tender to develop the park by

Disneyland&#8221; in this location was first proposed by Soviet

previous mayor, Yury Luzhkov, in the 1990s, RBC Daily said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), sued for
$8.6 billion by bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), said the
defunct firm&#8217;s common-law claims against it must be decided by a
U.S. district court judge rather than a bankruptcy judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a court filing yesterday in Manhattan, the New York-
based bank said the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Anna Nicole
Smith case limited the power of bankruptcy judges to rule on
such claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, has been fighting
Lehman&#8217;s suit in bankruptcy court, fending off demands for the
return of $8.6 billion in collateral, plus &#8220;tens of billions&#8221;
in damages for allegedly accelerating the former investment
bank&#8217;s demise. After the ruling in the Smith case, a district
judge must determine damage claims brought under New York state
law, JPMorgan said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those claims, through which plaintiffs seek to augment
the estate by recovering damages for JPMorgan&#8217;s alleged
misconduct in precipitating LBHI&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, are
legally indistinguishable from the state-law tortuous
interference counterclaim in Stern,&#8221; the bank said, referring
to the Supreme Court case known as Stern v. Marshall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent rulings by higher courts have left bankruptcy cases
in disarray. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff threw out demands by
the liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm for billions of dollars
in damages from London-based HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) The Supreme
Court&#8217;s June decision limited bankruptcy courts&#8217; ability to rule
on state-law claims as well as ending any chance for heirs of
Smith, a former Playboy model, to collect a $449 million
judgment against the estate of J. Howard Marshall, the Texas
billionaire to whom she had been married. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collateral Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to JPMorgan, Lehman&#8217;s demand for return of the
collateral can&#8217;t be decided by a bankruptcy judge either. Those
claims were made to pad out bankrupt Lehman&#8217;s estate, and &#8220;fall
outside the claims-allowance process&#8221; that is the business of a
bankruptcy court, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman disagreed about the impact of Stern v. Marshall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Stern court left untouched the bankruptcy courts&#8217;
authority to enter final judgments on common-law claims&#8221; that
stem from the bankruptcy, it said in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman claimed in the lawsuit filed last year that JPMorgan
demanded loan guarantees that fatally weakened the firm.
JPMorgan, which lent about $70 billion to Lehman&#8217;s brokerage
around the time of the September 2008 bankruptcy, responded by
suing Lehman, alleging it defrauded its lender into making the
loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lehman suit is: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexican traders are postponing bets
for interest-rate increases to August after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Bank of America Corp. lowered the country&#8217;s growth
forecast amid concern the U.S. may relapse into recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on futures for the 28-day interbank due in August,
known as TIIE, sank 15 basis points in the past week to a record
low 5.02 percent. The contracts indicate traders expect Banco de
Mexico to leave its key rate unchanged at 4.5 percent until that
month. They have delayed their estimates for a rate boost 14
times this year. In Brazil, traders are pricing in the
possibility the central bank may lower borrowing costs by
December after betting on an increase three weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s growth prospects are dimming after the economy in
the U.S., the Latin American country&#8217;s biggest trade partner,
grew less than forecast in the second quarter. Mexico is more
likely to cut interest rates than raise them next year, Goldman
Sachs economist Alberto Ramos wrote in a research note. Mexico
is the only major Latin American country to keep its key rate
unchanged in the past year as inflation holds near a five-year
low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the data where they are and inflation so benign,
some are betting there could be an even longer pause,&#8221; Gabriel Casillas, chief Mexico economist at JPMorgan Chase  Co. in
Mexico City, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We expected a long
pause.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on Mexico&#8217;s benchmark peso bonds due in 2024 fell
56 basis points, or 0.56 percentage point, in the past month to
6.5 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In Brazil,
yields on similar-maturity government debt fell 13 basis points,
or 0.13 percentage point, in the past five sessions while those
on Colombian debt fell eight basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Highly Dependent&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs on Aug. 5 reduced its Mexican growth forecast
for this year to 4.1 percent from 4.4 percent and its estimate
for 2012 to 3.9 percent from 4.5 percent, citing weakening
demand from the U.S. A day earlier, Bank of America cut its 2012
growth projection to 4 percent from 4.5 percent, while leaving
its forecast for this year at 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the logistical proximity to the U.S., Mexico will
always be an economy that is highly dependent on the U.S.,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Ramos said in a telephone interview. &#8220;There is
not much they can do. When the U.S. is doing well, they benefit
handsomely. When the U.S. is not doing so well, they are more
exposed than other economies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Remain Cautious&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy, the destination for 80 percent of Mexican
exports, grew at a less-than-forecast 1.3 percent pace in the
second quarter following revised growth of 0.4 percent in the
first three months of the year that was less than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department said July 29. U.S. consumer
spending grew 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since the second
quarter of 2009, the final months of the recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press officials at Mexico&#8217;s central bank didn&#8217;t return
telephone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry maintained its forecast of 4.3 percent
growth this year and 4.2 percent in 2012, Miguel Messmacher,
chief economist, said in an Aug. 5 phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The different indicators of economic activity aren&#8217;t for
the moment sounding any alarms, even though we have to remain
cautious,&#8221; Messmacher said from Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold Mexican government
dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose 19 basis points to
160 at 6:01 p.m. New York time, according to JPMorgan Chase 
Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso weakened 2.7 percent to 12.3253 per U.S. dollar.
It&#8217;s up 0.1 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Default Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
five years rose 24 basis points to 152, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities or the cash equivalent if a government
or company fails to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s economy will weather the slump in the U.S. and
grow 4.8 percent this year, said Sergio Luna, head of economic
research at Citigroup Inc. in Mexico City. Central bank Governor
Agustin Carstens will raise the benchmark rate from 4.5 percent
in January, Luna said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market reaction has been disproportionate to the data
in the U.S.,&#8221; Luna said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
see a deterioration in the data that indicates any more
difficulty for the U.S. markets. The data in Mexico has also
been much better than that in the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rate Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists expect Banxico, as Mexico&#8217;s central bank is
known, to stay on hold until May, according to the median
forecast of 21 economists in a survey distributed Aug. 4 by
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Banamex unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation slowed in Mexico to 3.28 percent in June from
3.69 percent a year earlier. It touched a five-year low of 3.04
percent in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mexican economy is still struggling to rebound from its
2009 recession, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Ramos said. Mexico&#8217;s economy
shrank 6.1 percent that year, the worst since 1995. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The recovery from the brutal 2009 recession has been very
moderate,&#8221; Ramos said. &#8220;Things never accelerated to gain a lot
of momentum.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Edward Klump" date="Aug 08, 2011  6:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-08/exxon-looks-to-sell-stakes-in-indonesian-natural-gas-assets.html"><headline>Exxon Looks to Sell Stakes in Indonesian Natural-Gas Assets</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest publicly traded oil company, said it&#8217;s trying to sell
its interests in some Indonesian natural-gas operations that are
part of an ongoing lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties include the Arun field and satellite fields,
and the North Sumatra Offshore field, David Eglinton, a
spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said in an e-
mailed statement today. The assets had annual average net
production of 215 million cubic feet a day of gas last year, as
well as some liquids, Eglinton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, a U.S. appeals court reinstated a lawsuit thrown
out by a lower court, ruling that Exxon must face allegations
that it aided and abetted murder, torture and sexual assault by
its security forces in Indonesia&#8217;s Aceh province. At the time,
Exxon said it has &#8220;fought these baseless claims for many
years.&#8221; Today, the company asked the full appeals court to
review the three-judge panel&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attempt to sell assets in Indonesia is consistent with
the company&#8217;s &#8220;long-standing practice of continually reviewing
assets for their contribution to Exxon Mobil&#8217;s operating and
financial objectives, as well as their potential value to
others,&#8221; Eglinton said in the statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asset sale &#8220;has nothing to do with the Aceh lawsuit,&#8221;
he said. Eglinton said the sales process doesn&#8217;t involve other
Exxon projects in Indonesia. Exxon and predecessor companies
have operated in Indonesia for more than 100 years and will
retain &#8220;an active presence&#8221; in the country, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nestle SA (NESN), the Swiss company said to
be preparing a bid for Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s baby-food unit, may aim to
regain momentum in China&#8217;s infant formula market by acquiring
the maker of SMA Gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying the business would propel Vevey, Switzerland-based
Nestle to No. 3 from No. 6 in China&#8217;s infant-nutrition market,
Sara Welford, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in London, said by
phone. It would also offer potential cost savings equal to 10
percent of the unit&#8217;s sales, she estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle is the global leader in infant nutrition, the
fastest-growing segment of the packaged-food industry. It&#8217;s lost
market share in China since 2005, when it withdrew two varieties
of Neslac milk powder because authorities found they contained
too much iodine. Pfizer (PFE), the fourth-biggest baby-food company in
the country, said July 7 it may sell or spin off its nutrition
unit, sparking interest from Nestle, Danone SA (BN) and Abbott
Laboratories, according to people with knowledge of the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China is the single most attractive baby-food market and
the company has been losing share there,&#8221; said Ildiko Szalai,
an analyst at Euromonitor International in London, who estimates
that Nestle&#8217;s share of the market shrank by a third to less than
6 percent from 2005 through 2009. &#8220;It&#8217;s a priority for them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global sales of baby-food products are likely to gain 6
percent a year from 2010 to 2015, according to Euromonitor,
which says that growth is being helped by low private-label
penetration and the importance of infant nutrition to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s baby-food market grew about 21 percent last year to
more than 42.1 billion yuan ($6.5 billion) and will probably
expand about 17 percent a year from 2010 to 2015, the researcher
estimates. Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN) had an industry-leading
share of about 13 percent in 2009, it says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s baby-food business, gained through its 2009
purchase of Wyeth, had $1.9 billion in sales last year and
according to people familiar with the matter may fetch $10.5
billion in a sale. The unit makes the SMA Gold line of products
for infants and children and Enercal supplements for adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle stepped up expansion in China with the $1.7 billion
purchase in July of a 60 percent stake of Hsu Fu Chi
International Ltd., the country&#8217;s biggest confectioner by market
value. The maker of Gerber baby food aims to boost the portion
of sales it gets from emerging markets to 45 percent by 2020
from about 40 percent. Unilever, the maker of Magnum ice cream,
gets about 54 percent from developing regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nestle Acquisitions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle has made 19 acquisitions since the end of 2009,
according to Bloomberg data. The company has said it plans to
use its cash of more than 16 billion Swiss francs ($21 billion)
to invest in existing businesses and make &#8220;bolt-on&#8221;
acquisitions. Spokeswoman Melanie Kohli declined to comment on
whether Nestle would be interested in acquiring the Pfizer unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A purchase of the business may boost profit by about 2
percent within three years, according to Citigroup&#8217;s Welford.
So-called organic sales at Nestle&#8217;s nutrition unit probably rose
8.8 percent in the first half of 2011, according to Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle, the world&#8217;s biggest foodmaker, is scheduled to
report first-half earnings tomorrow. Net income probably fell to
4.61 billion Swiss francs, according to the average estimate of
11 analysts compiled by Bloomberg, hurt by higher raw-material
costs and marketing spending. So-called organic sales, which
exclude acquisitions, disposals and currency shifts, rose 6.5
percent, the estimates show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle last year got 10.4 billion francs, or about 10
percent of revenue, from nutrition brands such as Cerelac and
Nestle Nan. The unit makes products ranging from formula milk
for babies to cereals and snacks for toddlers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regulatory Hurdles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paris-based rival Danone, which produces Bebelac formula
milk, generated about 3.36 billion euros ($4.8 billion), or 20
percent of sales, from baby nutrition products in 2010. Revenue
from the business increased about 10 percent in the first half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Nestle and Danone would both be capable of increasing
earnings within three years of buying Wyeth, both would probably
be required to sell parts of the business, Welford said. Nestle
would likely face regulatory hurdles in Latin America, while
Danone may encounter similar constraints in the U.K., Ireland,
Australia and New Zealand, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle may decide that the antitrust issues are too great,
according to Jeff Stent, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in
London, who said it&#8217;s &#8220;questionable&#8221; whether the Swiss company
will make an offer for the unit. Nestle would probably have to
sell parts of the Pfizer business accounting for as much as 45
percent of the unit&#8217;s sales, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attractive Option &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth may be the &#8220;most attractive&#8221; option for Danone,
given a scarcity of large acquisition targets in emerging
markets, Stent said. While the French company would be
&#8220;somewhat stretched&#8221; to finance a deal, it would be able to
acquire the Pfizer business by increasing its debt, he said.
Danone had net debt of 7.3 billion euros at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mead Johnson may have a strategic interest in
acquiring the Pfizer unit, financially it may find such a
purchase difficult, according to Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an
analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich. The Glenview, Illinois-based
company had net debt of $938.1 million at the end of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, has said it doesn&#8217;t
expect to make any further announcements about the alternatives
for the two businesses until 2012. The U.S. company, which is
being advised by Morgan Stanley and Centerview Partners, also
said any transaction may take up to two years to complete. &lt;/p&gt;

Harrington and Christine Harper" date="Aug 08, 2011  5:59 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-08/bank-of-america-goldman-sachs-lead-jump-in-default-swaps-on-u-s-lenders.html"><headline>Bank of America Leads Surge in Credit Swaps on Downgrade Concern</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect against a default
by U.S. banks soared by the most since the month Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. failed after Standard  Poor&#8217;s cut the AAA rating
on the government&#8217;s debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the nation&#8217;s
biggest bank by assets, rose by the most on record and reached
the highest since May 2009, while contracts tied to Morgan
Stanley debt increased the most since September 2008. Swaps on
insurers Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., MetLife Inc.
and Prudential Financial Inc. rose, and a benchmark gauge of
corporate credit risk climbed to the highest since July 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downgrade triggered investor concern that fallout could
impair the health of banks that have been recovering from the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression two years ago.
Investors including BlackRock&#8217;s Peter Fisher speculated SP may
be forced to lower its ratings on banks, while Morgan Stanley (MS)
said in a regulatory filing that market reaction from the
government downgrade could have &#8220;a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and liquidity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This has never happened so I don&#8217;t think anybody really
knows&#8221; the ultimate impact of the sovereign downgrade, said
David Withrow, head of taxable fixed income at Fifth Third Asset
Management. &#8220;It certainly could have an impact on the credit
rating of banks, which could impact counterparty risk. What the
level of impact is nobody really knows right now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Support Assumptions&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP in a late-day statement said the U.S. downgrade doesn&#8217;t
have &#8220;an immediate or direct impact&#8221; on bank ratings. &#8220;None
of the banks we rate in the U.S. has an issuer credit rating
higher than the U.S. sovereign rating,&#8221; SP said in the
statement. &#8220;The sovereign downgrade does not alter the
government support assumptions that we factor into our ratings
on four banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock&#8217;s Fisher said in an interview earlier in the day
that the ratings company may be forced to lower bank grades 
after cutting the sovereign ranking that supports some of the
lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re going to have to follow through and start
knocking down ratings on all sorts of things or look like
they&#8217;re just mucking around in American politics,&#8221; said Fisher,
BlackRock&#8217;s global head of fixed-income. With banks including
Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. (C) already rated
four levels lower than the U.S. government&#8217;s SP rating of AA+,
&#8220;there&#8217;s some fudge room there,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CVX) and
other energy companies fell the most in more than two years on
concern that a cut in the U.S. debt rating signals lower crude
oil prices, investors and analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas, dropped $4.63, or 6.2
percent, to $70.19 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, wiping out its gain this year. Chevron, based
in San Ramon, California, fell $7.36, or 7.5 percent, to $90.25.
The one-day declines were the steepest since Dec. 1, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downgrade of U.S. debt by Standard  Poor&#8217;s Aug. 5
crystallized recession concerns based on rising U.S. and
European debt and a U.S. government report last week that those
out of work 27 weeks or more comprise 50 percent of the
unemployed, said James Glickenhaus, who manages about $2 billion
at Glickenhaus  Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are calling up mutual funds, saying, &#8216;Get me out
of stocks,&#8217;&#8221; Glickenhaus, said today in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widely owned and easily traded stocks like Exxon are part
of the general selloff, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is contagion,&#8221; Donald Coxe, who manages $500
million at Coxe Advisors in Chicago, said in an interview.
&#8220;Gold is going up because of fear the financial system is going
to implode.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Falls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold rose $61.40 to a record $1,713.20 an ounce, up 3.7
percent at today&#8217;s close in New York. Crude oil for September
delivery fell $5.57, or 6.4 percent, to $81.31, on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the lowest price since Nov. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SP downgrade confirmed everybody&#8217;s fear,&#8221; Fadel Gheit, a New York-based energy analyst for Oppenheimer  Co.
said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;Less confidence in the
U.S. economy alone will bring the outlook for consumption lower.
We&#8217;ll use less oil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quicksilver Resources Inc. (KWK), based in Fort Worth, Texas,
fell $2.65, or 23 percent, to $9.10, the lowest price in more
than two years. The oil and natural-gas producer said it will
raise spending 39 percent this year after missing its second-
quarter production target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every company that&#8217;s had the big increase in capital
spending has generally taken it on the chin,&#8221; said David M. Heikkinen, an analyst at Tudor, Pickering, Holt  Co. in Houston
who rates Quicksilver &#8220;accumulate&#8221; and owns none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowering U.S. credit one level to AA+ won&#8217;t hurt Exxon
Mobil&#8217;s AAA rating, the highest available, Standard  Poor&#8217;s
said today in a statement, citing the company&#8217;s global and
diverse business lines and its significant financial strength. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Zeke Faux" date="Aug 08, 2011  4:38 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-08/s-p-says-u-s-downgrade-doesn-t-affect-aaa-rated-j-j-microsoft.html"><headline>S&amp;amp;P Says U.S. Downgrade Doesn&#8217;t Affect AAA Rated J&amp;amp;J, Microsoft</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s said the decision
to strip the U.S. of its AAA rating won&#8217;t affect companies in
the country that carry the top grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and
Automatic Data Processing Inc. (ADP), the four U.S.-based non-
financial companies rated AAA, will retain the highest rating,
SP said in a statement today. The companies are expected to pay
their debts even if the U.S. defaults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, Johnson  Johnson and Microsoft are strong
financially and depend less on the U.S. than other companies do
because they get much of their income from international
markets, SP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ADP earns most of its profits domestically, demand
for its products has held up well and it relies little on the
public sector and is diversified, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emissions offset developer
ClimateCare said it has been taken private in a management
buyout from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) as it seeks to expand
investment in the United Nations carbon offset market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ClimateCare, founded in 1997 to invest in greenhouse gas
emission-reduction projects, has been bought back by the
management and is an independent entity as of today, Edward Hanrahan, an executive director of the company, said by
telephone and e-mail from Oxford, England. He declined to
disclose the price paid. JPMorgan bought the company in 2008, a
year before its purchase of EcoSecurities, an offset buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has sold offsets to companies including German
utility EON AG, electronics maker Panasonic Corp. (6752) and vehicle
manufacturer Land Rover as well as to Britain&#8217;s political
parties and The Elders, a group of global leaders that include
Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ClimateCare specializes in emissions-cutting projects that
also enhance sustainable development, focusing on Sub-Saharan
Africa, Hanrahan said. These include fuel-efficient stoves and
clean-water filters. Such projects create credits that can
either be used by companies wishing to voluntarily reduce their
carbon footprint, or by those wishing to comply with emissions
trading systems such as the European Union&#8217;s market and the
United Nations&#8217; Clean Development Mechanism, or CDM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Moving forward we&#8217;ll be doing much more CDM project
development,&#8221; Hanrahan said. &#8220;We have a large pipeline of
projects which we&#8217;re working on at the moment both in the
voluntary market and CDM. We&#8217;re working with a number of
partners to develop some new projects as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA),
the world&#8217;s largest generic-drug maker, was sued by a joint
venture of GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE) for infringing a
U.S. patent for the HIV drug Epzicom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva has applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
for permission to sell generic Epzicom tablets in violation of a
2002 patent, lawyers for ViiV Healthcare said in an Aug. 5
complaint filed in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva&#8217;s FDA submission &#8220;constitutes infringement&#8221; and
&#8220;ViiV will be irreparably harmed&#8221; by the low-cost version of
Epzicom if it&#8217;s sold before the patent expires in 2016,
according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline, based in Brentford, England, and New York-
based Pfizer announced the ViiV joint venture to combat HIV in
2009. The lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction to block Israel-
based Teva&#8217;s U.S. sales of the drug and damages if the generic
medicine is sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ViiV has facilities in Brentford and at Research Triangle
Park in North Carolina, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva spokeswoman Denise Bradley declined to comment on the

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s biggest
theme-park operator, posted third-quarter sales and profit that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates as pay-TV fees to the ESPN sports
network countered flat cable advertising sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose 11 percent to $1.48 billion, or 77 cents a
share, from $1.33 billion, or 67 cents, a year ago, Burbank,
California-based Disney said today in a statement. Profit
excluding some items was 78 cents, beating the 73-cent average
of 22 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable-network profit rose 10 percent, with ESPN enjoying
gains in fees from pay-TV systems. Theme-park profit advanced
8.8 percent, fueled by higher admission prices at U.S. resorts
and this year&#8217;s later Easter break. The consumer products unit
boosted profit with sales of &#8220;Cars&#8221; and Marvel merchandise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a little better than expected, but there was
really nothing that&#8217;s remarkable in these numbers,&#8221; said
Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities in
Denver who recommends the stock. &#8220;The affiliate fees at ESPN
were a little unexpected, and the parks were able to take
advantage of the Easter holiday.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney may consider new discounts at its domestic theme
parks if the economy weakens, Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said on a conference call with analysts, adding &#8220;We&#8217;re not
thinking of doing that any time soon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendance at Disney&#8217;s domestic theme parks increased by 2
percent, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on the call,
and per-capita spending by 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking Acquisitions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney will continue to make acquisitions, Iger said,
without identifying potential targets. Since becoming CEO in
2005, the company has acquired Pixar and Marvel. Last month,
Disney offered to buy the 49.6 percent of India&#8217;s UTV Software
Communications Ltd., a production company, it doesn&#8217;t own for
$454 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to continue to deploy capital in this
direction,&#8221; Iger said. He estimated that the $13 billion Disney
has spent to acquire companies in the last five years
represented about $23 billion in &#8220;enterprise value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 45 cents to $34.25 in extended trading. The
shares gained $1.67, or 5.1 percent, to $34.70 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading and have declined 7.5
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in the period ended July 2 gained 6.7 percent to
$10.7 billion, exceeding analysts&#8217; projections of $10.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable Revenue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable revenue advanced 7.2 percent to $3.52 billion, with
fees from pay-TV systems countering ad sales at ESPN that were
little changed, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC&#8217;s profit rose 20 percent to $250 million, benefiting
from lower production costs and higher network advertising.
Total revenue from broadcasting decreased 1 percent to $1.43
billion, reflecting lower ad sales at local television stations,
Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit at Disney&#8217;s consumer products division increased 32
percent to $155 million, buoyed by merchandise from the &#8220;Cars&#8221;
animated movies and the Marvel character line. Revenue rose 13
percent to $685 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue at Disney&#8217;s parks division increased 12 percent to
$3.17 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

Harrington and Mary Childs" date="Aug 09, 2011  5:43 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-09/jpmorgan-goldman-sachs-credit-default-swaps-fall-after-surge.html"><headline>JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley Credit Default Swaps Plunge After Surge</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect against a default
by U.S. banks plunged after soaring yesterday by the most in
almost three years, as the Federal Reserve vowed to keep
interest rates near zero through mid-2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan
Stanley (MS), which decline as investor confidence improves, dropped
by the most since at least May 2010, according to data provider
CMA. A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk also fell by the most
since that month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders pushed the cost of protecting corporate and
financial debt lower after the Fed discussed a range of policy
tools to bolster the economy. Investor confidence in bank and
corporate creditworthiness improved after deteriorating
yesterday at the fastest pace in a year following Standard 
Poor&#8217;s cut of the U.S. government&#8217;s credit rating on Aug. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we appreciate the uncertainty regarding the
economy, confidence, mortgage putbacks and Europe contagion, we
firmly believe that yesterday was way overdone in the credit
markets,&#8221; Jonathan Hatcher, a credit strategist at Jefferies
Group Inc. in New York, wrote in a note to clients. U.S.
financial companies today have better balance sheets and
stronger capital and are no longer reliant on overnight
liquidity, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps on New York-based JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, declined 19 basis points to 116 basis points,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, Goldman &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts linked to Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) each decreased 25 to 185. Swaps tied to Morgan Stanley debt
dropped 30 to 250 and those on Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) declined 20 to
115, the data show. Contracts on Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the
largest U.S. bank by assets, fell 17 to 278, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average credit swap price on the six biggest U.S. banks
fell 23 to 188 after jumping 51 yesterday to 211, the largest
gain since September 2008 when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
filed for bankruptcy and caused credit markets to seize up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
fell 7.6 basis points to a mid-price of 107.5 as of 5:30 p.m. in
New York, according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index of default swaps climbed 12.1 basis points
yesterday to reach 115.1 points, the highest level since July 7,
2010, Markit data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Manhattan Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s
chairman illegally transferred more than $2.5 million to his own
accounts while running the Albert Ellis Institute, the nonprofit
said in a lawsuit claiming JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) let it happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Bernstein, the former president of Albert Ellis&#8217;
board of trustees, &#8220;secretly and without authority or the
knowledge of its other trustees&#8221; moved institute funds into
personal bank accounts he owns or controls, the organization
said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein was first elected to the institute&#8217;s board of
trustees in March 2006 and was chosen as president of the board
in July 2006, the institute said in the lawsuit. He was named
acting director of administration in January 2010 and appointed
to the permanent post the following month. Bernstein resigned
from all offices he held at the institute after the fraud was
discovered in February 2011, lawyers for the group said in the
complaint, which was filed today in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been provided with a list of 65 unauthorized
transactions by Bernstein and has refused to restore the funds
to the institute&#8217;s account, lawyers for the institute said in
the lawsuit, which seeks more than $2.3 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Investigation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institute contacted Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance&#8217;s office about the alleged fraud, and the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s
Office in Manhattan is investigating, David Blasband, an
attorney representing the institute, said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Vance&#8217;s office, declined to
comment on whether the district attorney is investigating. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, didn&#8217;t
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. Patrick J. Smith, an
attorney representing Bernstein, didn&#8217;t return a telephone
message left at his office seeking comment on the complaint.
Bernstein isn&#8217;t named as a defendant in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institute, located on East 65th Street in Manhattan, is
a not-for-profit psychotherapy organization founded in 1959 by
its late namesake, Dr. Albert Ellis. It is &#8220;committed to
alleviating emotional disturbances and enhancing emotional well-
being through the study, teaching and application of rational
emotive and cognitive behavioral therapy,&#8221; according to the
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Chart Our Course&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Manhattan Chamber of Commerce has no information about
the matter, President Nancy Ploeger said in an e-mailed
statement. Bernstein has resigned as the chamber&#8217;s chairman
effective immediately, and the organization&#8217;s board will meet as
soon as possible to &#8220;chart our course going forward,&#8221; Ploeger
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein serves as chairman of the New York-based
Archstone Group, a corporate management consulting group, and
was the founder of TruFoods Systems Inc., a company that
operated more than 100 restaurants until 2007 when it was sold
to Trufoods LLC, according to a biography posted on the
Manhattan Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TruFoods began in 1998 when Bernstein acquired Pudgie&#8217;s
Famous Chicken at a bankruptcy court auction, according to the
biography. Digital Creative Development Corp. (DCDC), which operated
the Arthur Treacher&#8217;s Fish  Chips chain, bought Pudgie&#8217;s in
October 2000 and named Bernstein chief executive officer of the
combined company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stalking Horse Bidder &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Creative sold its interest in the combined company
to an affiliate of Bernstein&#8217;s in March 2002. TruFoods also
participated as a stalking horse bidder in bankruptcy
transactions, according to Bernstein&#8217;s biography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein previously served as president and CEO of
Consolidated Services Inc., a management consulting firm that
was retained by debtors, creditor committees and secured lenders
in more than 100 Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases, according to the
biography. Bernstein has also served as chief restructuring
officer and an examiner in several Chapter 11 cases, the
biography says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein told the institute shortly after he was appointed
director of administration that an operating account it had
maintained at JPMorgan had been closed, the institute said in
the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institute discovered in February that the account
hadn&#8217;t been closed and started an investigation that revealed
that the funds in question had been used by Bernstein for his
&#8220;personal benefit,&#8221; the institute claims in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When questioned about the allegedly closed Chase Bank
account, Bernstein refused to provide any information, failed to
explain his actions or account for the monies misappropriated
from the institute,&#8221; lawyers for the institute said in the
lawsuit. &#8220;However, as noted, Bernstein resigned all offices he
held at the institute. Bernstein&#8217;s fraud was immediately
reported to law enforcement authorities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Albert Ellis Institute v. JP Morgan Chase Bank
NA, 11-cv-5504, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, was sued over its sale of mortgage-
linked securities to now-failed credit unions hours after it
disclosed a list of other potential complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Credit Union Administration filed a lawsuit in
California today and said it&#8217;s seeking more than $491 million of
damages from Goldman Sachs. American International Group Inc. (AIG),
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are among firms that have also
threatened to take legal action against the bank over mortgage-
related securities, Goldman Sachs said in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank was already facing active mortgage-linked lawsuits
from companies and investors that the firm estimated had
experienced cumulative losses of $485 million as of June 30. The
new potential claims aren&#8217;t included in that estimate or in the
firm&#8217;s $2 billion estimate of &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; losses
from legal cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of entities, which also includes the Federal
Housing Finance Agency and insurance companies Allstate Corp. (ALL)
and John Hancock, &#8220;threatened to assert claims against the firm
in connection with various mortgage-related offerings,&#8221; New
York-based Goldman Sachs said in the quarterly filing. The
company has reached agreements with some of the entities to toll
the relevant statute of limitations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. The stock rose $5.07, or 4.3 percent, to
$122.73 in New York Stock Exchange Composite trading after
falling as low as $111.60 earlier in the session. Goldman Sachs
is down 27 percent so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuit Targeting JPMorgan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCUA&#8217;s suit against Goldman Sachs, which relates to the
collapse of U.S. Central and Western Corporate federal credit
unions, follows a complaint against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and two
against Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. (RBS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those who caused the problems in the wholesale credit
unions should pay for the losses now being paid by retail credit
unions,&#8221; NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG, the insurer rescued by U.S. bailouts during the 2008
financial crisis, yesterday sued Bank of America Corp. (BAC) In that
case, AIG claimed that Bank of America caused more than $10
billion in losses at AIG, which specialized in investments and
insurance tied to mortgage bonds. Bank of America rejected the
assertions of New York-based AIG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Herr, a spokesman for AIG, declined to comment on the
company&#8217;s potential suit against Goldman Sachs, as did Maryellen Thielen, a spokeswoman for Allstate. Laurie Lupton, a
spokeswoman for Toronto-based Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC), which
owns John Hancock, had no immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for the FHFA and Freddie Mac also declined to
comment, while Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae,
didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reduced its estimate of &#8220;reasonably
possible&#8221; losses from lawsuits to $2 billion as of June 30 from
$2.7 billion on March 31, according to the quarterly filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the SEC told corporate finance chiefs in October that they
should disclose such costs &#8220;when there is at least a reasonable
possibility&#8221; that they may be incurred, even if the risk is too
low to require reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate, the third of its kind made by Goldman Sachs,
is the &#8220;upper end&#8221; of losses in matters where the risk is
&#8220;more than remote but less than likely,&#8221; the New York-based
firm said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) briefly passed Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) today to become the world&#8217;s largest company by market
value, before dropping back down to second place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose as much as 4.7 percent to $369.89 today on
the Nasdaq Stock Market, giving Apple a valuation of $342.9
billion. The stock pared those gains and was trading at $365.93
as of 1:41 p.m. New York time, with a market capitalization of
$339.1 billion. Exxon is down 40 cents to $69.79 on the New York
Stock Exchange, giving it a value of $339.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s valuation has soared in recent years as Chief
Executive Officer Steve Jobs pushed into new markets, such as
mobile phones, tablets and music downloads. The company overtook
Nokia Oyj in smartphone shipments for the first time last
quarter, becoming the leader in that market. Apple&#8217;s iPhone,
released in 2007, is now its best-selling product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said some current and former
employees are the target of a criminal complaint in South Korea
related to sales of collateralized debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. &#8220;filed a criminal complaint
against certain past and present employees of the firm in South
Korea relating to its purchase of a CDO securitization from
Goldman Sachs,&#8221; New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heungkuk Life and Heungkuk Fire  Marine Insurance Co.
filed a complaint to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors&#8217;
office on June 28 against nine Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
executives and employees, accusing them of fraud, Lee Yun No, an
official at Heungkuk Life, said by phone on July 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Korean companies have seen losses from purchasing
collateralized debt obligations in 2007 from Goldman Sachs, Lee
said, without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs confirmed the complaint for the first time
publicly in today&#8217;s quarterly submission to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint &#8220;does not represent any judgment by a
governmental entity, but starts a process whereby the prosecutor
investigates the complaint and determines whether to take
action,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;

generated more than $100 million on four days out of 63 total
days, the filing showed. The second quarter ended June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, last
month reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of
analysts&#8217; estimates as fixed-income trading revenue plunged 63
percent from the first quarter. The company blamed the fixed-
income trading drop, which was more than twice as large as any
other bank&#8217;s, on a reduction in risk-taking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company reported zero days of trading losses during the
first quarter of last year, the first perfect quarter in the
firm&#8217;s history. It reported 10 such days in the second quarter,
two in the third and 13 in the fourth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said its trading losses exceeded the firm&#8217;s
value-at-risk limit, a measure of how much the company could
lose in the securities markets in one day, on one occasion
during the quarter. Average daily value-at-risk was $101 million
in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) manager
fired for allegedly kissing a colleague at a conference, and
then lying about the incident, sued the company in a London
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Negus, a partner and general manager at Microsoft&#8217;s
U.K. unit until he was dismissed in September, filed the lawsuit
on Aug. 3. The complaint followed one made by Microsoft in April
against Negus, now chief operating officer of Upstream Systems,
seeking to reclaim holiday pay and part of his signing on bonus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute relates to an incident at Microsoft&#8217;s annual
conference in Atlanta in July 2009. Negus, a U.K. board member,
may have been seen kissing a female colleague in full view of
other attendees, Microsoft said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negus denied the &#8220;kissing incident&#8221; had taken place and
when further information came out suggesting it had, he was
dismissed for dishonesty, the Redmond, Washington-based company
said in its claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negus didn&#8217;t respond to calls and e-mails for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s disciplinary panel found Negus had &#8220;behaved
dishonestly, and thereby acted in a manner calculated or likely
to destroy trust and confidence between him and Microsoft,&#8221;
according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman at Edelman, a public relations firm employed
by Microsoft, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is seeking the return of 75,000 pounds
($122,600), part of a signing bonus paid to Negus when he joined
from Dell Inc. in 2008 that required him to remain at Microsoft
for three years. The company is also claiming 2,563 pounds of
holiday pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negus joined Upstream, a mobile-marketing technology
company, on July 20. In a press release issued at the time,
Upstream said Negus led Microsoft&#8217;s U.K. Enterprise and Partner
Group, and the U.K. unit had won Microsoft &#8216;Subsidiary of the
Year&#8217; in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are: Simon Negus v. Microsoft Limited,
HQ11X02875, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division; and
Microsoft Limited v. Mr. Simon Negus, HQ11X01216. High Court of
Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Divison &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirteen-time Colombian champion
Millonarios, once owned by a drug cartel billionaire, plans to
become Latin America&#8217;s first soccer team outside Chile to list
shares as new owners and a Harvard University-trained turnaround
specialist lead it out of bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to arrest two decades of on- and off-the-field
decline, the government last year brought in Jose Roberto Arango, known for salvaging failing companies, to revamp the
Bogota-based team. The government has owned about a 27 percent
stake in the club since it seized the assets of Medellin cartel
kingpin Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha after his 1989 shootout death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millonarios is seeking to join companies offering a record
number of shares in the Andean nation this year after President
Juan Manuel Santos signed a law in May making it easier for
soccer clubs to form corporations. The listing could pave the
way for other squads for whom drug profits were a mainstay of
funding in the 1980s and 1990s, said Ivan Novelo, manager of
Dimayor, Colombian soccer&#8217;s governing body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no more easy money in soccer,&#8221; Novelo said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s more transparency today in how
clubs manage money, so much so that they almost all are facing
bankruptcy and talent drains.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past Glory &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arango orchestrated the sale of the team out of bankruptcy
to Azul y Blanco SA, a Bogota-based company created in April to
rescue the club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to its prospectus filed with the securities
regulator in March, Azul y Blanco counts among its investors
Alessandro Corridori, the biggest shareholder in Fabricato SA,
Colombia&#8217;s biggest textile maker, and Juan Carlos Ortiz, a
shareholder of Interbolsa SA, the nation&#8217;s biggest brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which paid 24 billion pesos ($13 million) for
rights to the club name and its players, plans to offer this
year shares worth almost the same amount and representing as
much as a 51 percent stake, said Eduardo Silva, Azul y Blanco&#8217;s
president. The proceeds will fund the purchase of a training
facility. Practices are currently held at a tennis club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A model of broader participation is better for Colombian
soccer, as it will reduce the role of drug money,&#8221; Silva said.
&#8220;Millonarios&#8217;s big idea is to totally democratize ownership.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of Colombian soccer has suffered in recent
years as teams have been slow to adopt business practices
powering Colombia&#8217;s economy, said Novelo. The country hasn&#8217;t
qualified for the World Cup since 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugs to Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millionarios was Colombia&#8217;s greatest team at its peak in
the 1950s, when it defeated clubs including Real Madrid on
frequent tours of Europe. Among its players from 1949 to 1953
was Argentine forward Alfredo Di Stefano, who went on to score
the fourth-most total goals ever in Spain&#8217;s top division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The club&#8217;s decline began when Colombia&#8217;s government seized
Gacha&#8217;s stake in the club after he was killed during a shootout
with soldiers at his ranch. In 1988, Gacha was named along with
fellow Medellin cartel boss Pablo Escobar to Forbes Magazine&#8217;s
annual list of billionaires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Gacha&#8217;s death, Millonarios&#8217;s debt grew until the
company filed for bankruptcy in 2004. The debt stood at 24
billion pesos last year, Silva said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering by Millonarios would make Colombia only the
second country in Latin America with listed soccer teams after
Chile, where the holding companies that own Colo-Colo,
Universidad de Chile and Universidad Catolica all trade on the
Santiago stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard Grad &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombian companies are seeking to raise about 8 trillion
pesos through a record seven share sales this year as the
country&#8217;s stock exchange merges with Peru&#8217;s and Chile&#8217;s in Latin
America&#8217;s first international bourse combination, Juan Pablo Cordoba, head of the Bogota bourse, said Aug. 3. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s largest
theme-park company, fell the most since 2008 on concern that
slowing consumer spending and rising costs at the ESPN sports
network may crimp profit growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the largest media companies, including Time Warner
Inc. (TWX), News Corp. and Viacom Inc., Disney is the most exposed to
consumer spending through its theme parks, as well as broadcast
and cable-TV units, said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg
Industries. Increasing costs to broadcast sports on ESPN and a
declining DVD market may also hurt earnings, according to
Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Certainly there are cost pressures at ESPN and at the
parks, but they were a little worse than I would have thought,&#8221;
said Harrigan, who cut his rating on the shares to &#8220;hold&#8221; from
&#8220;buy&#8221; after the company reported quarterly earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock dropped 9.1 percent to $31.54 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the most since Dec. 1,
2008. With today&#8217;s decline, the shares have fallen 16 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose 11 percent to $1.48 billion in the fiscal
third quarter ended July 2, the Burbank, California-based
company said in a statement yesterday after the markets closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN Affiliate Fee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While earnings of 78 cents beat the 73-cent average of
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg, they included 6 cents
in deferred ESPN affiliate revenue that analysts expected in the
fourth quarter. Without that fee, earnings would have fallen
short, Harrigan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. personal spending fell 0.2 percent in June, the fourth
consecutive monthly decline. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke vowed yesterday to keep borrowing costs at an all-time
low to revive an economic recovery that&#8217;s &#8220;considerably
slower&#8221; than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher costs at ESPN and lower syndication sales at the ABC
broadcasting network will lower this quarter&#8217;s earnings by 7
cents a share, Chief Financial Officer James Rasulo said
yesterday on the conference call. The ESPN expenses are
associated with new contracts to broadcast college sports, Major
League Baseball, and the National Football League, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Earnings upside was less than met the eye,&#8221; Barton Crockett, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets in New York, said
in a note to investors. The fiscal fourth-quarter oulook is
&#8220;muddied,&#8221; said the analyst, who rates the stock &#8220;neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studio Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studio entertainment operating income fell 60 percent to
$49 million in the quarter. While &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean: On
Stranger Tides&#8221; earned more than $1 billion at the box office
worldwide, &#8220;increased revenue was largely offset by higher
marketing and distribution costs,&#8221; said Rasulo, the financial
chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The costs just need to be trimmed,&#8221; said Harrigan, the
Wunderlich analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner last week reported a 14 percent increase in
second-quarter net income as revenue from its cable-TV, movie
and magazine businesses rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA) reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of 35
cents, excluding some items, beating the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg by five cents. The shares rose
2.1 percent in after-hours trading at 4:22 p.m. New York time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read said his company, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, will
fight attempts to cut Medicare payments for medicines after the
industry helped underwrite the U.S. health-care overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug companies contributed $112 billion in discounts and
refunds to last year&#8217;s health-care law, helping Democrats make
up for new spending in the bill. U.S. drugmakers led by Pfizer
and Merck  Co. (MRK) are concerned they will be asked to give more in
the debt-limit deal President Barack Obama signed Aug. 2 that
requires further negotiated cuts in government expenditures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We made a contribution to the Affordable Care Act that
was substantial and fundamental,&#8221; New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s Read
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We are only 10 percent of the
health-care spend in the United States, and we are the most
efficient part of that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squeezing drug savings from Medicare, the U.S. health
program for the elderly and disabled, may cost makers $20
billion and eliminate 260,000 jobs, according to the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America in
Washington. Obama endorses a proposal to discount drugs for
Medicare patients who also qualify for Medicaid, the federal-
state health program for the poor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) sold $2 billion of debt, leading companies taking advantage
of plunging borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), the world&#8217;s largest consumer-products
company, Baker Hughes Inc., WellPoint Inc. and Enterprise
Products Partners LP are also among companies and government
entities planning at least $7 billion of bond sales today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of U.S. investment-grade bonds today may reach the
most since July 20 as the cost of borrowing falls to about
record lows after the Federal Reserve pledged yesterday to keep
interest rates near zero through mid-2013. Corporate treasurers
are returning to the U.S. bond market after volatility stalled
issuance for the past week, according to Timothy Cox, executive
director of debt capital markets at Mizuho Securities USA Inc.
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Treasurers realize this is an opportunity to issue bonds
at some of the lowest rates we&#8217;ve ever seen,&#8221; Cox said in a
telephone interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed decided to keep overnight rates at zero to 0.25
percent and said &#8220;exceptionally low levels&#8221; are likely until
at least mid-2013 because economic growth was &#8220;considerably
slower&#8221; than it had expected. The yield on benchmark 10-year
Treasuries fell as low as 2.09 percent today, after touching an
all-time low of 2.03 percent yesterday following the Fed&#8217;s
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Offering &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire sold $750 million of three-year floating-rate
notes that pay 70 basis points more than the London interbank
offered rate, Bloomberg data show. A $750 million portion of 2.2
percent five-year bonds pay 130 basis points more than similar
maturity U.S. Treasuries and $500 million of 3.75 percent
securities due in 2021 pay a spread of 160 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire is raising cash as its reinsurance units recover
from losses on Japan&#8217;s biggest earthquake and it prepares to
complete the $9 billion takeover of Lubrizol Corp. Buffett, the
Omaha, Nebraska-based company&#8217;s chief executive officer, is
shrugging off the Aug. 8 decision by Standard  Poor&#8217;s to place
a negative outlook on the company&#8217;s credit rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Buffett always takes advantage of extremes in the
markets, whether to buy or to sell,&#8221; said Jeff Matthews, a
Berkshire shareholder and author of &#8220;Secrets in Plain Sight:
Business and Investing Secrets of Warren Buffett.&#8221; &#8220;Rates are
low. They don&#8217;t get an awful lot lower than this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico sold $1 billion of 100-year debt denominated in U.S.
dollars and the University of Southern California issued $300
million of notes due in a century, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG&#8217;s bond sale is split between $1 billion of five-year
notes that may pay a 67 basis-point spread and $1 billion of
three-year notes that may pay a 52 basis-point spread, a person
familiar with that offering said, who declined to be identified
because terms aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s
largest theme-park company, is seeking acquisitions, a year and
a half after completing its $4.2 billion takeover of Marvel
Entertainment&#8217;s cast of film and comic-book characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t have what I&#8217;d call a strategic hole,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger said yesterday on a conference
call after the company&#8217;s third-quarter earnings release. &#8220;But
we&#8217;ve looked expansively at opportunities across the world to
buy either new characters or businesses that are capable of
creating great characters and great stories.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger didn&#8217;t specify any targets. He cited international as
an area of interest, and India as &#8220;another example of a high-
growth market. We think investing in it, at least in today&#8217;s
world, is a smart move,&#8221; Iger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is in the middle of a regulatory review of its
proposal to buy the 49.6 percent of UTV Software Communications
Ltd. (UTV), a Mumbai-based film and TV production company, that it
doesn&#8217;t own for as much as 20.1 billion rupees ($445 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From fiscal 2006 to 2010, Burbank, California-based Disney
has spent $13 billion on acquisitions, Iger said. The company
now puts a $23 billion enterprise value on those purchases, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s been smart about buying assets that contribute to
the core of the company,&#8221; said Bill Smead, chief investment
officer of Seattle-based Smead Capital Investment, which owns
57,813 shares of Disney. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t overpaid, and he has
created value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pixar Purchase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney acquired Pixar Animation for $8.06 billion in stock
in 2006, a deal announced three months after Iger assumed the
CEO&#8217;s job. The company completed the Marvel acquisition in
January 2010 and acquired the Internet casual game company
Playdom in August 2010 for $563 million in cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger spoke after Disney posted third-quarter sales and
profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates as pay-TV fees to the ESPN
sports network countered flat cable advertising sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose 11 percent to $1.48 billion, or 77 cents a
share, from $1.33 billion, or 67 cents, a year ago, Disney said
yesterday in a statement. Profit excluding some items was 78
cents, beating the 73-cent average of 22 analysts&#8217; estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable-network earnings rose 10 percent, with ESPN enjoying
gains in fees from pay-TV systems. Theme-park profit advanced
8.8 percent, fueled by higher admission prices at U.S. resorts
and this year&#8217;s later Easter break. The consumer products unit
boosted profit with sales of &#8220;Cars&#8221; and Marvel merchandise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in the period ended July 2 gained 6.7 percent to
$10.7 billion, exceeding analysts&#8217; projections of $10.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 5 cents to $34.65 at 7:34 a.m. before the open
of the New York Stock Exchange, after gaining 5.1 percent to
$34.70 yesterday. The shares had declined 7.5 percent this year
before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Credit Union
Administration has sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), accusing the
Wall Street firm of violating federal and state laws in the sale
of securities to now-failed corporate credit unions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCUA is seeking damages in excess of $491 million from
Goldman Sachs in the lawsuit filed yesterday in California. The
suit is the fourth in a series aimed at recovering almost $2
billion from &#8220;sellers and underwriters of questionable
securities,&#8221; NCUA said in a statement yesterday announcing the
suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the NCUA lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCUA claims that Goldman Sachs misrepresented securities in
offering documents, causing the credit unions to believe the
risk of loss was minimal when in fact it was substantial,
according to its statement. The regulator previously filed a
complaint against JPMorgan Chase  Co. and two against Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint against Goldman Sachs relates to the
collapses of the U.S. Central and Western Corporate federal
credit unions, two of the five liquidated under NCUA
conservatorship, the regulator said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Point Blank Chief to Plead to Tax Charges, Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Brooks, a founder and former chief executive officer
of military contractor Point Blank Solutions Inc. (PBSOQ), will plead
guilty to tax charges today, his lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal jury found Brooks guilty last year of committing
a $185 million fraud and looting the company, formerly called
DHB Industries Inc., to pay for personal expenses. Three tax
counts were separated from the other charges he was convicted
of, including insider-trading, fraud and obstruction of justice.
He has asked for a new trial on those charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are channeling our efforts into the other counts,&#8221;
Brooks&#8217;s lawyer Gerald L. Shargel said in a phone interview
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooks, 56, and former Chief Operating Officer Sandra
Hatfield were convicted last September in Central Islip, New
York. Point Blank, which makes body armor for the military and
police, filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2010. Brooks
and Hatfield lied about the inventory of &#8220;Interceptor&#8221; combat
vests that were shipped to the U.S. armed forces and falsely
inflated the company&#8217;s value and their own stock, the government
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch
in Brooklyn, New York, declined to comment on the plea hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Brooks, 06-CR-550, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Central Islip). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR Block Unit Settles Mortgage Lawsuit with Massachusetts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HR Block Inc. (HRB) mortgage lender formerly known as Option
One Mortgage and Massachusetts reached a $125 million settlement
of a state lawsuit over allegedly risky and discriminatory
lending, the state said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit, Sand Canyon Corp., agreed to pay $9.8 million to
Massachusetts and will direct American Home Mortgage Servicing
Inc., which services Option One loans in the state, to establish
a loan-modification program for struggling borrowers, state
Attorney General Martha Coakley said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option One was sued by Massachusetts in 2008 and accused of
making risky loans that were doomed to fail and discriminating
against black and Latino borrowers by charging more for their
loans, Coakley said. The company&#8217;s practices were deceptive and
illegal, she said at a press conference yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement will provide an estimated $115 million in
loan modifications to homeowners, Coakley&#8217;s spokeswoman Melissa
Karpinsky said. The modifications will give Massachusetts
homeowners writedowns of principal balances and interest rate
reductions depending on features of their loans, according to
Coakley&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased with the final outcome and believe this is
good for all parties involved,&#8221; Dale Sugimoto, president of
Sand Canyon, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement comes as state attorneys general and federal
officials are negotiating a settlement with the five largest
mortgage servicers in the U.S., including Bank of America Corp. (BAC)
and JPMorgan Chase  Co., over their foreclosure and mortgage-
servicing practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some attorney generals, including Coakley, have raised
concerns about liability releases in any agreement that would
protect the banks from state and federal claims. Coakley has
said that any agreement shouldn&#8217;t provide banks with releases
tied to the packaging of mortgages into securities and conduct
related to a mortgage database known as MERS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Resolves Claims That Assistant Defrauded Clients &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) will pay $500,000 to resolve Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority claims that it failed to stop
fraud by an employee who abused accounts belonging to elderly
and ill clients as well as her own father. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamara Moon misappropriated almost $750,000 from 22
customers over eight years while working as a sales assistant at
a branch office in Palo Alto, California, Finra said yesterday
in a statement. Moon, who was barred from the securities
industry for the misconduct in 2009, was indicted by a federal
grand jury on related criminal charges in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup failed to investigate red flags including
suspicious trades as Moon targeted customers she believed would
be unable to monitor their accounts, Finra said. The Palo Alto
branch didn&#8217;t have adequate systems to prevent Moon from
falsifying records, the Washington-based regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one instance, Moon created an account in the name of a
dead customer even after Citigroup had been notified that the
person had died, Finra said. She then created a fraudulent
account in the name of the customer&#8217;s widow, using it to funnel
$7,500 to her own personal account, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Citigroup discovered Moon&#8217;s suspicious activity in
2008, the firm &#8220;immediately notified the authorities,
terminated her employment and reimbursed impacted clients,&#8221; the
company said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We will provide any
assistance necessary to ensure that the former employee is
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phone call to Geoffrey Hansen, a federal public defender
representing Moon in the criminal matter, wasn&#8217;t immediately
returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moon was employed by Citigroup&#8217;s Smith Barney unit,
Elizabeth Fogarty, a bank spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Says EU Accuses Firm in Cable Price-Fixing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the European Commission told
the firm it may have to pay fines in a case relating to price
fixing by power-cable companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission issued a &#8220;statement of
objections&#8221; that proposed making the firm liable for some or
all of any fine levied against an Italian cable company in which
Goldman Sachs funds held stakes, the New York-based bank said in
a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s private-equity funds bought the power-cable
unit and a telecommunications cable business from Milan-based
Pirelli  C. SpA in 2005 and renamed the business Prysmian
Cables  Systems, which became Prysmian SpA (PRY) in an initial public
offering in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prysmian stock dropped in February 2009 after the company
disclosed that it was cooperating with antitrust regulators&#8217;
investigation of the cable market. Goldman Sachs funds sold
shares in Prysmian later that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month the European Commission sent complaints to 12
companies &#8220;that may have colluded to allocate markets and
customers for underground and submarine power cable projects and
fix prices,&#8221; the Commission said in a statement on July 6.
Prysmian said on July 5 that it had received an antitrust
complaint and that it would defend itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission has proposed holding Goldman Sachs liable
&#8220;under the concept of parental liability under EU competition
law,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in yesterday&#8217;s filing, referring to
the European Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muni Issuers Should Face Disclosure Penalties, MSRB Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. states and cities should face sanctions for failing to
provide updated financial information after they sell bonds, the
municipal market&#8217;s regulator said, challenging the lax
disclosure that has unnerved investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which writes
regulations for the tax-exempt debt industry, made the comments
in a letter to Securities and Exchange Commissioner Elisse
Walter, who is leading an agency review into how to improve the
municipal bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public borrowers aren&#8217;t penalized if they don&#8217;t provide
annual financial reports and other disclosures on time after
issuing debt. The failure by some borrowers to make timely
disclosures has long rankled municipal-bond investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There seem to be no significant regulatory repercussions
for non-compliance,&#8221; the board wrote in the Aug. 8 letter,
which was released yesterday. The board said the SEC should take
steps &#8220;necessary to impose consequences for non-compliance with
continuing disclosure undertakings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC doesn&#8217;t directly regulate disclosures made by
municipalities after bonds are sold, as it does with
corporations that sell securities to the public. Instead, the
agency requires underwriters that sell the securities to be
assured by the municipalities that they will provide to
investors annual financial statements and other information that
could affect the value of the bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has stepped up its enforcement of standards for
municipal securities by establishing a unit to police fraud and
last year settled a case against New Jersey for masking the
state of its pension plans as it raised money from investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter has been holding hearings on the $2.9 trillion
municipal bond market with the intention of recommending
improvements. The SEC also is updating its 1994 guidance
covering the disclosure obligations for the municipal industry,
a review the MSRB was seeking to influence with its
recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks Should Make Living Wills to Plan for Failure, FSA Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks should prepare so-called living wills setting out how
they may be broken up with the least possible disruption to the
economy if they collapse, the U.K. Financial Services Authority
said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders should be able to be shut down without roiling
markets or requiring public support, according to the FSA.
Failed lenders&#8217; bondholders should also bear part of the costs
of closure, the regulator said, as part of plans to shield
taxpayers published on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are warning that rules considered by global
regulators to limit the need for bailouts may harm the economic
recovery. Michel Barnier, the European Union&#8217;s financial
services chief, published draft proposals in January to impose
losses on failing lenders&#8217; bondholders -- a step that firms
including Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have said
may make it more expensive for banks to raise funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living wills &#8220;are largely untested,&#8221; because the U.K.
hasn&#8217;t had a major bank collapse since they have come under
consideration by regulators, Darren Fox, a financial services
lawyer at Simmons  Simmons LLP, said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;They require quite a bit of work and possibly restructuring to
design and implement and consequently can be intensive in terms
of the level of financial and human resources that they
absorb.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NYSE to Raise Hurdle for Reverse Merger Listings Amid Scrutiny &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE Euronext (NYX), the U.S.&#8217;s biggest operator of exchanges,
said it will tighten the listing requirements for reverse merger
companies following allegations of accounting fraud, according
to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operator of NYSE Amex and the New York Stock Exchange
will implement a &#8220;seasoning&#8221; period for companies that seek
listing after completing a reverse merger, according to the
proposal, which is subject to approval by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. In a reverse-merger process, a closely held
firm buys a publicly traded shell company, gaining a stock
listing without the scrutiny of an initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Significant regulatory concerns, including accounting
fraud allegations, have arisen with respect to a number of
reverse merger companies in recent times,&#8221; said the filing
dated July 22. Because of these concerns, &#8220;the exchange
believes it is appropriate to codify in its rules specific
requirements with respect to the initial listing qualification
of reverse merger companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies trading in the U.S. through reverse
mergers such as China MediaExpress Holdings Inc. (CCME) have faced
investor scrutiny this year after disclosing financial
irregularities or auditor resignations, raising concern there
may be widespread fraud. Carson Block, a short seller at Muddy
Waters LLC, helped fuel that speculation with bearish reports on
corporations including Rino International Corp. (RINO) and Sino-Forest
Corp. (TRE), which trades in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE is proposing a waiting period of at least one year of
trading on the U.S. over-the-counter market or other national
market, or a foreign exchange, before companies can list on the
bourse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ), the second-biggest operator of U.S.
stock exchanges, has also proposed to evaluate reverse-merger
companies more closely, according to filings to the SEC from
April and May. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Primary Global Manager Loses Bid to Throw Out Wiretaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former sales manager at expert networking firm Primary
Global Research LLC lost his bid to bar government wiretaps at
his insider trading trial later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Fleishman had argued that the wiretaps of more than
100 callers to two Primary Global conference lines were illegal.
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected Fleishman&#8217;s request in a
two-page order made public in Manhattan federal court yesterday
and also declined to hold an evidentiary hearing on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary Global, based in Mountain View, California, is at
the center of a nationwide probe of insider trading at hedge
funds, technology companies, banks and consulting firms.
Winifred Jiau, a former Primary Global consultant, was convicted
of securities fraud and conspiracy on June 20 after a trial
before Rakoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 14 people charged in the investigation by Manhattan
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara&#8217;s office, 12 have pleaded guilty and
one, Jiau, was convicted at trial. Fleishman has pleaded not
guilty and is scheduled to go on trial before Rakoff on two
counts of conspiracy Aug. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethan Balogh, a lawyer for Fleishman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Fleishman, 11-CR-32, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam Sentence of More Than 24 Years Sought by U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, labeled by
prosecutors as the &#8220;face of illegal insider trading,&#8221; should
spend as long as 24 years and five months in prison, the U.S.
told the judge who will sentence him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Rajaratnam, in a separate court filing
yesterday, asked U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell in
Manhattan for a prison term &#8220;substantially below&#8221; what federal
guidelines recommend. Rajaratnam&#8217;s attorneys, citing their
client&#8217;s poor health, urged Holwell not to force him to die in
prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 54, was convicted in May of all 14 criminal
counts of conspiracy and securities fraud he was charged with.
He&#8217;s scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 27. Prosecutors said he
should serve at least 19 years, seven months in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rajaratnam repeatedly leveraged the power of money and
his position as the head of a $7 billion hedge fund to induce
friends, employees and associates to participate in his criminal
activities,&#8221; Justice Department lawyers said in their
sentencing memorandum yesterday. &#8220;He is the modern face of
illegal insider trading.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors called Rajaratnam the most &#8220;egregious
violator&#8221; of insider-trading laws ever to be caught. He engaged
in a seven-year conspiracy to trade on inside information from
corporate executives, bankers, consultants, traders and
directors of public companies including Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., they said. He gained $63.8 million as a result of the
scheme, according to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors and defense lawyers are awaiting a pre-
sentencing report from the federal probation office to help
determine a range under U.S. sentencing guidelines, according to
yesterday&#8217;s filing by John Dowd, the lead lawyer for Rajaratnam.
Holwell is free to disregard the guidelines, which are advisory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Rajaratnam is not a healthy man,&#8221; his lawyers wrote,
citing &#8220;significant and challenging medical issues&#8221; that are
known to the court&#8217;s probation department. &#8220;His death will be
hastened by a term of imprisonment,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers submitted letters on his behalf from
his family members, former business associates, ex-employees and
even his apartment doorman. Some of the letters detail what the
defense said is more than $45 million in charitable donations by
Rajaratnam in the U.S. and abroad, including millions of dollars
to help victims of a tsunami that devastated his native Sri
Lanka. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, is being probed about its
compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the firm
said in a filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank and some of its units are subject to a number of
probes and reviews, some of which also involve other firms,
according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Goldman Sachs officials in London couldn&#8217;t immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are probing Goldman Sachs&#8217;s dealings with the
Libyan Investment Authority, the Wall Street Journal reported
today, citing people familiar with the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC opened an investigation in January into whether
banks, hedge funds and private-equity firms paid placement
agents to win access to the government-run funds, people
familiar with the matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An agent working with a sovereign wealth fund may be
considered a government official, making interactions with that
person subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which
forbids U.S. companies from paying bribes to officials of
overseas governments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks are priced at &#8220;very low
levels&#8221; because investors are nervous about earnings,
inflation, market volatility and the outlook for global growth,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Abby Joseph Cohen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Much of the ugly news that might take place in the
economy seems to be already priced in,&#8221; Cohen, a New York-based
senior investment strategist, said today in a radio interview on
&#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Ken Prewitt and Tom Keene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost $3 trillion has been erased from U.S. equity values
in the last three weeks as the Federal Reserve pledged to keep
interest rates near zero through at least mid-2013 to bolster
U.S. growth and European Central Bank said it would buy bonds to
cap borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman is concerned about the dragging growth in Europe,
the health of the European financial system and the sovereign
debt crisis, Cohen said. The U.S. also had more sluggish-than-
expected growth in the first half. Still, companies on the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index have strong balance sheets, which
they can use for share buybacks, dividend increases and
investments that lead to job creation, Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do believe that many U.S. companies are sufficiently
flush with cash that they will continue to restore cash to the
shareholders,&#8221; Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 76 percent of companies in the SP 500 Index (SPX) that
have released quarterly results since July 11 beat projections,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings per share have
gained 17 percent, while sales advanced 13 percent. The SP 500
rose 4.6 percent to 1,172.64 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients on
Aug. 5 that Goldman cut its growth forecast for 2012 to 2.1
percent from 3 percent. Goldman also said it saw a one-in-three
chance of a renewed recession in the U.S. within the next nine
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top-ranked strategist in Institutional Investor&#8217;s
surveys in 1998 and 1999, Cohen stayed bullish on computer-
related stocks for too long as the SP 500 suffered a bear
market from March 2000 to October 2002. She said in October 2000
that technology stocks would be a good investment in 2001. The
SP 500 Information Technology Index then tumbled 26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Nikolaj Gammeltoft" date="Aug 11, 2011 12:17 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-11/exxon-single-100-share-trade-triggers-price-circuit-breaker.html"><headline>Exxon Single 100-Share Trade Triggers Price Circuit Breaker</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A single trade for 100 shares of
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) more than 6 percent below yesterday&#8217;s closing
price led to the triggering of a circuit breaker, pausing
trading in the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade, later canceled, was executed at 10:33 a.m. New
York time at $63.47 on an exchange operated by Bats Global
Markets, according to data sent to Bloomberg. The stock closed
at $68.03 yesterday and the highest price in the 5 minutes
before the halt was $69.91, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading was paused under rules adopted after the May 6,
2010, stock market crash in which more than $860 billion was
erased from the value of U.S. equities in 20 minutes. Shares are
suspended if they rise or fall 10 percent within five minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It appears to be a &#8216;fat finger&#8217; situation,&#8221; Mike Shea, a
managing partner and trader at Direct Access Partners LLC in New
York, wrote in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, which was surpassed by Apple Inc. yesterday as
the world&#8217;s most valuable company, rose 3 percent to $70.05 at
11:32 a.m. in New York. The shares&#8217; primary listing is on the
New York Stock Exchange, owned by NYSE Euronext. (NYX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A quote was hit, triggering a pause. We have since busted
the trade,&#8221; Randy Williams, a spokesman for Bats, said in an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FM Global, the policyholder-owned
insurer that counts JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
among its top equity holdings, said stock market declines have
created opportunities to invest in the largest U.S. companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been a net buyer of equities in the last 60 days,&#8221;
said Shivan Subramaniam, FM Global&#8217;s chief executive officer, in
a phone interview yesterday. &#8220;Across the board, the large-cap
North American stocks are all very attractive buys, especially
if they have a dividend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FM Global is adding to stock holdings as U.S. companies
build record cash piles and raise dividends. The plunge in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index from July 22 through yesterday
erased 17 percent from the benchmark gauge for American equities
as Congress and President Barack Obama clashed over borrowing
limits and SP stripped the U.S. of its top credit rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We still have cash liquidity of a little more than $1
billion,&#8221; said Subramaniam. &#8220;If we wanted to move into the
market in a big way we could. Or, most importantly, we could
take care of all of our clients&#8217; obligations and not have it
affect the portfolio at all.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FM Global, which writes property coverage for corporations,
held $4.84 billion in equities at the end of last year,
according to a report on its website. The Johnston, Rhode
Island-based insurer boosted its stake in JPMorgan to 3.4
million shares on June 30 from 3.27 million shares three months
earlier, according to regulatory filings. It held 2.65 million
shares of Exxon at the end of the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan boosted its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share
from 5 cents in March. The New York-based bank has an indicated
yield of 2.91 percent. Exxon pays a quarterly dividend of 47
cents a share, yielding 2.77 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEOs have more money than ever after boosting cash for 10
straight quarters to $963.3 billion, 58 percent more than in
December 2007 near the start of the credit crisis, SP data
show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Heebner, one of the top-
performing diversified U.S. stock mutual-fund managers over a
10-year period, added financial and consumer discretionary
shares in the second quarter and sold all shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heebner&#8217;s Capital Growth Management LP purchased about 1.38
million shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in the three-month period
ended June 30, as well as stakes in automaker Ford Motor Co. (F),
casino-owner Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN), and Tiffany  Co. (TIF), the New York-
based jewelry-store operator, according to a filing today with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Boston-based
firm sold its $111 million stake of Cupertino, California-based
Apple, the maker of iPhones and iPads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heebner, 70, ran the best-performing diversified U.S. stock
fund over a 10-year period for 11 straight quarters before he
was unseated in the first quarter of 2011 by Thomas Soviero,
manager of the $4.2 billion Fidelity Advisor Leveraged Company
Stock Fund. He had boosted shares of Apple in the first quarter
and is known for making concentrated bets in industries from
homebuilding to commodities and for his willingness to shift
gears quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial companies were the biggest allocation of Capital
Growth&#8217;s portfolio in the second quarter, making up 36.7 percent
of the firm&#8217;s holdings. Consumer discretionary stocks had the
second-biggest weight with 25.8 percent. Moody&#8217;s Corp., Discover
Financial Services (DFS) and Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) are other financial
and real estate companies Heebner added during the second
quarter. He exited Morgan Stanley (MS) and General Growth Properties
Inc. (GGP) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital Growth had sold all 109,900 shares of New York-
based Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in the first quarter. Heebner
also exited Ford and General Motors Co. (GM) during that period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, he built his stake in Dearborn,
Michigan-based Ford back up to $230.1 million. Ford lost 35
percent this year through yesterday to $10.94, compared with a
6.8 percent decline in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

Braun" date="Aug 12, 2011 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-12/jpmorgan-proves-bond-deal-death-in-jefferson-county-no-bar-to-new-business.html"><headline>JPMorgan Proves Bond Deal Death in Jefferson County No Bar to New Business</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Charles LeCroy said the key to landing bond deals in Jefferson County,
Alabama, was finding out whom to pay off. In one example, that
meant a $2.6 million payment to Bill Blount, a local banker and
longtime friend of County Commissioner Larry Langford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of money, but in the end it&#8217;s worth it on a
billion-dollar deal,&#8221; LeCroy told a colleague in 2003, according
to a complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s because in the $2.9-trillion market for state and
local government debt, where 80 percent of all financings are
negotiated in private, conflicts of interest prevail. While
Langford and Blount are in jail, LeCroy is fighting an SEC
action. JPMorgan, which provided most of the toxic debt that
devastated Jefferson County, has suffered no loss of business as
the nation&#8217;s third-largest underwriter of municipal bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just 21 months ago, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million SEC
settlement to end a case over secret payments to friends of
Jefferson County commissioners. The financings arranged by
JPMorgan, a package of floating-rate debt and derivatives,
exposed taxpayers to the 2008 credit crisis and dealt a blow
that may lead the county to approve the biggest U.S. municipal
bankruptcy as soon as today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As an outsider looking in, it just certainly appears to me
that JPMorgan ravaged this county,&#8221; said Robert Brooks, a
finance professor at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and
the author of a textbook on derivatives. &#8220;They convinced
Jefferson County to pursue a strategy they never would have
followed to generate a lot of fees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deals Backfired &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County&#8217;s financing shows how Wall Street peddled
complex bond-and-derivative deals that backfired on taxpayers,
from small Pennsylvania school districts to California&#8217;s state
government. Banks may have charged $20 billion in hidden fees on
the derivatives alone, Andrew Kalotay, a New York-based
financial consultant who specializes in such agreements, told an
SEC hearing in Jefferson County last month. The agreements
allowed lenders to earn fees that were rarely, if ever,
disclosed, while exposing municipalities to unexpected increases
in borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet while JPMorgan&#8217;s deals denuded Jefferson County, the
company has emerged with its municipal-debt underwriting
business unscathed. During the past two years, public officials
from California to Massachusetts hired the New York-based bank
to arrange $64.7 billion of bond offerings, making it the third-
largest underwriter in the market for state and local
securities, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Very Aggressive&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The issuers need the bankers,&#8221; said Christopher Whalen,
managing director of Torrance, California-based Institutional
Risk Analytics, which assesses banks. &#8220;Morgan&#8217;s a big house and
they&#8217;re very aggressive and they&#8217;re out there looking for
business everywhere. So people tend to forget.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, without admitting or denying wrongdoing,
JPMorgan agreed to pay $211 million in a separate settlement
with state and federal regulators over charges that its
municipal-derivatives unit participated in an industry-wide
scheme to fix prices and overcharge local governments on
investment contracts. The bank blamed former employees and said
it has increased oversight of its public finance business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a motion to dismiss a lawsuit by Jefferson County,
JPMorgan said the county was inappropriately attempting to lay
blame for the debt crisis at the bank&#8217;s feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The simple fact is that the county took on too much debt
and vastly underestimated the cost of building out its sewer
system,&#8221; lawyers for JPMorgan argued. &#8220;These problems were
only exacerbated by the county&#8217;s poor management of its sewer
system and the current credit crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank Law &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Justin Perras declined to comment for
this story and said Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who
joined JPMorgan after the Jefferson County deals were done,
wasn&#8217;t available for an interview. William B. Harrison Jr., the
bank&#8217;s CEO at the time it sold the contracts, didn&#8217;t return
phone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county&#8217;s collapse has loomed over the municipal bond
market for more than three years and inspired provisions in the
Dodd-Frank law seeking to protect localities from complex
financial trades involving derivatives. Officials are asking
JPMorgan and other creditors to forgive about $1 billion of the
bonds or may decide as soon as today to file for bankruptcy
protection to escape the debts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money-Saving Plan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jefferson County, JPMorgan pitched a money-saving plan
that converted almost all the county&#8217;s $3 billion of sewer-
system debt into floating-rate securities coupled with
derivatives. The deals comprised the largest transactions in
municipal swaps and auction-rate bonds, a form of floating-rate
borrowing, in the bank&#8217;s history, according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like homeowners who turned to exotic mortgages, officials
refinanced 93 percent of the sewer bonds into securities with
adjustable interest rates. They bought interest-rate swaps, in
which two parties make periodic payments based on an underlying
measure of borrowing costs. The contracts were supposed to
offset the floating rates the county paid and give it a fixed
rate that was lower than on traditional bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county paid JPMorgan, Bear Stearns Cos, Bank of America
Corp. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. $120 million in fees for
swap trades. Those fees were as much as six times the prevailing
rate, according to a report by former county financial adviser
Porter White  Co. of Birmingham, Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money-saving strategy backfired. JPMorgan&#8217;s financings
unraveled in early 2008 as the subprime mortgage-market meltdown
sent ripples through Wall Street, undermining the credit ratings
of the companies that insured Jefferson County&#8217;s bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest Costs Soared &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county&#8217;s interest costs soared as investors dumped the
bonds. After banks demanded early payoffs, the county defaulted.
The swaps exposed the county to hundreds of millions in fees to
refinance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Dimon has moved to put the municipal crisis
behind him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the bank said it got out of the business of
selling interest-rate swaps to state and local governments. In
November 2009, it settled with the SEC over allegations that
LeCroy and former JPMorgan colleague Douglas MacFaddin funneled
$8 million of secret payments to bankers, including Blount, who
had ties to Jefferson County politicians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It looks like they&#8217;ve done the right things to limit the
reputational damage,&#8221; said Matt Fabian, who tracks the state
and local government securities industry for Municipal Market
Advisors Inc. in Concord, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Jefferson County case, much of the blame for the
collapse has been cast on corrupt politicians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hasn&#8217;t Hurt&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t hurt them a bit because the whole thing has
been sold that they were dealing with corrupt officials,&#8221; said
Christopher Taylor, the executive director of the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board from 1978 until 2007. &#8220;But the
truth of the matter is they were in bed with the issuer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Langford, the former commissioner in charge of
finance, was found guilty on U.S. criminal charges of accepting
bribes from Blount, who pleaded guilty in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeCroy and MacFaddin, the former head of municipal
derivatives for the bank, are fighting SEC civil claims that
they failed to disclose payments to Blount and others. JPMorgan
fired LeCroy in 2004 and terminated MacFaddin in 2008. No one
from JPMorgan is accused of criminal wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacFaddin and LeCroy have argued that the SEC lacks
authority to pursue them under federal anti-fraud statutes
because the interest-rate swaps aren&#8217;t securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Lawler, MacFaddin&#8217;s attorney, declined to comment.
LeCroy&#8217;s lawyer, Lisa Mathewson, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 People &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jefferson County, 21 people, including four county
commissioners, were convicted or pleaded guilty to charges
related to the sewer construction or financing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former County commissioner Langford, 63, a longtime friend
of Blount&#8217;s who was responsible for finance, was convicted of
taking $242,000 in bribes in exchange for steering business to
Blount. Langford lost an appeal of his convictions, according to
a notice posted Aug. 5 by the federal appeals court in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the SEC, LeCroy also paid fees to two other
local firms to win the support of another former commissioner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeCroy joked about the tactics with a fellow JPMorgan
banker in 2003. &#8220;We have to pick the partners who are going to
get free money from us this time,&#8221; he said, according to the
SEC complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deals Raised Questions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond insurer Syncora Guarantee Inc., which backed about $1
billion of the bonds, said in a lawsuit that JPMorgan knew that
the county wouldn&#8217;t have enough revenue to pay its debts in a
few years but kept a report documenting that secret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A least one banker at JPMorgan, Charles Giffin, raised
internal questions about the risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Do these guys know the risks they are taking (in large
doses)?&#8221; Giffin wrote in a May 12, 2003, e-mail to a colleague,
when asked to prepare materials explaining why the county should
buy more derivatives, according to SEC records. &#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t we
be pitching diversification arguments?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Richard Vines" date="Aug 14, 2011  7:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-14/microsoft-guru-myhrvold-serves-wine-from-a-blender-wacky-30-course-dinner.html"><headline>Microsoft Guru Myhrvold Serves Wine in Blender, 30-Course Feast</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Nathan Myhrvold -- the former chief
strategist and chief technology officer at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) --
opens a bottle of wine and pours it into a kitchen blender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Decanting is about doing two things,&#8221; Myhrvold, 52, says
before flipping on the power switch. &#8220;It&#8217;s about mixing oxygen
in with the wine and about taking dissolved gasses out of the
wine. So, if a little bit of decanting works, why not a lot?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#8217;re in an industrial unit in suburban Seattle, the home
of Myhrvold&#8217;s company, Intellectual Ventures. He&#8217;s giving a
PowerPoint presentation before a 30-course dinner made up of
dishes from &#8220;Modernist Cuisine, The Art and Science of
Cooking,&#8221; the six-volume, 2,438-page book he&#8217;s produced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Myhrvold is also a columnist for Bloomberg View.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say the dishes are unusual would be an understatement.
The first consists of watermelon chips with spicy pickles. Thin
slices of fruit and pickle are mixed with modified starch
slurry, compressed in vacuum bags and then deep fried. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I figured that if I could make chips out of watermelon, I
could do it for anything,&#8221; Myhrvold explains as we sip hyper-
decanted wine. (I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed it was from a blender.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up? Corn and green-pea butter spread on brioche and
walnut-bread toasts. Run through a centrifuge, the corn and peas
yield three distinct layers: juice, starch and a small quantity
of a substance that has 20 times the flavor intensity of the raw
ingredient and the texture of soft butter, Myhrvold says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterChef Contestant &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen people from around the world are attending the
dinner. My table includes a journalist from Germany, an academic
from New York, a food technologist who works for Mars Inc. and
Alvin Schultz, a Houston-based contestant from chef Gordon Ramsay&#8217;s Fox TV show, MasterChef. Myhrvold divides his time
between providing a commentary and helping prepare the food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#8217;re sitting in the laboratory with chefs working along
one side. Heading the kitchen is Maxime Bilet, co-author of
&#8220;Modernist Cuisine.&#8221; He graduated with highest honors from the
Institute of Culinary Education in New York and also worked at
the Fat Duck, outside London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courses keep coming: Puffed Chicken Skin, Peking
Flavors involves the skin being cooked sous vide -- in an
airtight bag in a water bath -- then puffed in oil with hoisin
sauce, scallion oil emulsion, cucumber and shaved scallions.
Liquid Caprese is a cold, emulsified soup of olive oil and
tomato water. The equipment required? A rotor-stator
homogenizer, a pressure cooker and a centrifuge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baked Potato Soup consists of wafer-thin potato ravioli
filled with shallots melted in bacon fat, and dressed with an
intense broth of potato juice infused with roasted potato skins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kansas Ribs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipe for the Hot-Smoked Spare Ribs, Barbecue Sauces
from Kansas City, South Carolina, requires an Enviro-Pak cold
smoker, an ultrasonic bath, centrifuge, liquid nitrogen, vacuum
sealer and a water bath. The ribs are cooked sous vide for 48
hours, then dry rubbed, smoked and vacuum sealed. The chefs then
warm them in a bath and &#8220;cryofry&#8221; by dipping them in liquid
nitrogen and then deep-frying them. This process creates an
intense crust without overcooking the meat below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be asking by this stage: How does the food taste?
The answer is great. The flavors are intense, the textures
distinct, the aromas enticing. Many courses evoke memories of
childhood, when a simple strawberry may be a mouthful of heaven
and chocolate more fun than playing in the park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet somewhere in multicourse modernist meals -- and 48
dishes at El Bulli was my limit -- I tend to tire of perfection.
I want a piece of meat that hasn&#8217;t been cooked for days, I don&#8217;t
need my vegetables uniform and I might even accept the
occasional lump in my gravy. It&#8217;s hardly a fly in the soup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemongrass Egg &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myhrvold is such an entertaining host, sharing funny
stories and being completely un-precious about his food, that an
evening at his laboratory is a delight. Even the food has wit.
The waitresses said that one dish, Raw Quail Egg, came from
birds kept on the roof of the building. The yolk turned out to
be passion fruit, the white a gel of lemongrass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myhrvold was a postdoctoral fellow in the department of
applied mathematics and theoretical physics at Cambridge
University in the U.K. and worked with Professor Stephen Hawking
on research in cosmology, quantum field theory in curved space
time and quantum theories of gravitation. He doesn&#8217;t keep all
his eggs in one basket. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Pfizer Inc. (PFE) patent for the
impotence pill Viagra is valid, a U.S. judge ruled, blocking
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) from marketing a generic
version until 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision, protecting Pfizer&#8217;s $1 billion a year in U.S.
Viagra sales for most of the next decade, was handed down Aug.
12 after a two-week non-jury trial that began June 15, according
to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The pharmaceutical industry will take note&#8221; of the
ruling, Navid Malik, a London-based analyst with Matrix
Corporate Capital LLP, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The
generic companies are still going to be aggressive, but the
pharmaceutical companies aren&#8217;t going to be easy touches,
they&#8217;re fighting back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith in Norfolk,
Virginia, ruled against Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, which
claimed the patent wasn&#8217;t valid and couldn&#8217;t be enforced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Teva has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that
the patent is invalid,&#8221; Smith said in a 110-page opinion.
&#8220;There is utterly no evidence&#8221; to support Teva&#8217;s claim that
that Pfizer intentionally withheld documents from the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, Smith wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise Bradley, a Teva spokeswoman, declined to comment on
the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viagra sales increased 1 percent in the second quarter from
a year earlier to $495 million, Pfizer said this month. New
York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, posted net
income of $8.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, last year on sales of
$67.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Innovative Core&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Protecting the intellectual property rights of our
innovative core is critical,&#8221; Amy Schulman, Pfizer&#8217;s general
counsel, said in a statement. &#8220;Friday&#8217;s court decision
acknowledges Teva&#8217;s clear violation of our patent rights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva fell 3 percent to 138.30 shekels in Tel Aviv. The
company&#8217;s American depositary receipts, each representing one
ordinary share, rose 79 cents, or 2 percent, to $40.49 at 2:55
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer gained 41 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $18.27 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling is worth about 3 cents to Pfizer&#8217;s 2012 per-
share earnings and 6 cents to the company&#8217;s annual per-share
earnings through 2019, Christopher Schott, a New York-based
analyst for JPMorgan Chase  Co., said in a note to clients
today. Teva will probably appeal, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling was &#8220;a surprise,&#8221; Bloomberg Industries analyst
Asthika Goonewardene said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The patent was a method-of-use patent, and usually these
don&#8217;t hold up that well in court for small molecular drugs,&#8221;
Goonewardene said. &#8220;The court&#8217;s decision to uphold this patent
means other filers wanting to enter in 2012 are not likely to do
so then.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer v. Teva, 10-cv-128, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Virginia (Norfolk). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), the world&#8217;s biggest maker
of mobile phones by volume, climbed the most in 1 1/2 years in
Helsinki trading after Google Inc. (GOOG) agreed to acquire Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc. for about $12.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, whose Android software powers handsets made by
Motorola Mobility and manufacturers including Samsung
Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. (066570), will win wireless
patents it needs to compete against Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone. The
linkup may shift some Android phone manufacturers away from
Google to consider platforms such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Windows
Phone, which was adopted by Nokia this year, said Lee Simpson,
an analyst at Jefferies International in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It might start to put Microsoft into focus as an
alternative platform now, which could indirectly benefit
Nokia,&#8221; Simpson, who has an &#8220;underperform&#8221; rating on Nokia
shares, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Espoo, Finland-based Nokia surged 34 cents, or 9.1 percent,
to 4.09 euros at the close of trading in Helsinki for its
steepest increase since January 2010. The surge pared the
stock&#8217;s decline this year to 47 percent, valuing the company at
15.3 billion euros ($22 billion). Microsoft added 0.9 percent to
$25.32 at 12:37 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alec Baldwin made his art-buying
intentions clear Friday night at the Summer Gala Benefit Auction
for Guild Hall, the East Hampton art and entertainment complex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Just get the hell out of my way when Clifford Ross comes
up,&#8221; he said under a tent on the grounds of a Long Island
estate near Guild Hall. &#8220;I really want it and I&#8217;m going to get
it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ross&#8217;s 2008 &#8220;Hurricane LI,&#8221; a scene of crashing
waves, came up for auction, Baldwin playfully glared and
glowered at competing bidder Donald Mullen, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.&#8217;s global head of credit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the &#8220;30 Rock&#8221; star, who says he is thinking
about a New York City mayoral run, made the winning $70,000 bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have a room in my apartment that I&#8217;m decorating all in
black-and-white photography,&#8221; Baldwin said, moments after Simon de Pury, chairman of Phillips de Pury  Co., gaveled the sale.
&#8220;I have another by Sally Mann of the Virginia countryside --
southern roads and mansions -- which I bought at a Guild Hall
auction a few years ago. This will be a great bookend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baldwin said reactions to his possible mayoral run have
varied: &#8220;Either people are supportive or they think I&#8217;m
crazy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As guests dined on hangar steak and shaved beets, De Pury
auctioned six items, including a 2011 Eric Fischl watercolor
nude that went for $100,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mullen, who wore his sunglasses most of the night, paid
$100,000 for a Barbara Kruger print of a man wearing a blindfold
over which appears the sentence, in red lettering, &#8220;He entered
shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke no word, and looked at
all objects with a wild and vacant stare.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Prince, the artist, paid $30,000 for Bryan Hunt&#8217;s
2002 bronze sculpture &#8220;Maenad II.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Covering Pollock&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event began with guests, including Glenn Fuhrman, co-
managing partner of MSD Capital, art dealer Larry Gagosian and
Martha Stewart, the event&#8217;s honoree, visiting Guild Hall to view
a Richard Prince exhibition titled &#8220;Covering Pollock,&#8221; which
opened Saturday and is on view through Oct. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The works are composed of photographs of or related to
Jackson Pollock, which Prince has collaged with other images and
paint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pollock was the first artist who interested me,&#8221; Prince
told Lisa Phillips, the director of the New Museum, in an
interview distributed at the show. &#8220;I was very attracted to the
idea of someone who was by himself, fairly antisocial, kind of a
loner, someone who was noncollaborative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince was hardly antisocial at the benefit. He joined the

&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne Partners Ltd., the biggest
hedge fund in Europe that bets on stocks, bought shares of Bank
of America Corp. (BAC) in the second quarter, while reducing its
stakes in Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne purchased 5.1 million shares of Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America between April and June, according
to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
today. Lansdowne sold 3.7 million shares of Wells Fargo to cut
its stake to 28.3 million shares. The hedge fund reduced its
JPMorgan holding by 6.8 million shares to 7.1 million shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the biggest lender in the U.S., has
slumped 46 percent this year as investors question whether
rising costs from failing mortgages will force the company to
raise capital. Competitors Wells Fargo and JPMorgan have
performed better. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo has fallen 22
percent while New York-based JPMorgan is down 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Lansdowne spokesman in London declined to comment. The
hedge fund held no shares in Bank of America at the end of the
first quarter, according to a May 16 filing with the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odey Asset Management LLP, the $7 billion London-based
hedge fund started by Crispin Odey, sold 1.38 million shares of
UBS AG (UBSN) in the second quarter, reducing its stake to 502,243
shares, according to a filing today with the SEC. Odey sold its
entire stake of 938,912 shares of JPMorgan in the period. Chief
Executive Officer David Stewart wasn&#8217;t available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruddock, Heinz &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne, started by Paul Ruddock and Steven Heinz,
manages about $14 billion. The U.K. Equity fund, Lansdowne&#8217;s
biggest, had declined 16 percent this year through Aug. 5,
according to a person familiar with the matter. The smaller
Global Financials fund, managed by William De Winton, was down
about 12 percent through the first week of August, the person
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne&#8217;s Bank of America stake is held in the Global
Financials fund, according to the SEC filing. The stake is
valued at about $38.1 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The biggest holding in the fund by market value is a
$188.4 million stake in Citigroup Inc. (C), the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm has been hurt this year by its bets on banks,
among them Lloyds Banking Group Plc. (LLOY) London-based Lloyds, which
is 41 percent owned by the U.K. government, has plunged 50
percent this year. Britain&#8217;s biggest mortgage lender posted a
first-half net loss of 2.31 billion pounds on Aug. 4 after
increasing provisions for bad loans and setting aside funds to
compensate customers improperly sold personal-loan insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is among financial companies
Lansdowne has sold this year. The hedge fund sold its entire
stake of 4.9 million shares in the New York-based firm in the
first quarter. Lansdowne has purchased 4.4 million shares of
Morgan Stanley (MS) in 2011, according to SEC filings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and two other mortgage lenders and loan servicers
received approval from a New Jersey judge to resume uncontested
foreclosures in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) also won permission in
an order yesterday by Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson in
Trenton, New Jersey. Each had to show they have processes and
procedures in place to ensure that information in uncontested
foreclosures is based on a personal review of records. The judge
ordered the four lenders to undergo monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lenders were among six whose practices came under
scrutiny Dec. 20, when Chief Justice Stuart Rabner of the New
Jersey Supreme Court said they were implicated in &#8220;robo-
signing,&#8221; in which foreclosure documents were automatically
signed without personal verification of the contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobson set a hearing at the time on whether to suspend
uncontested foreclosures in the state. The move &#8220;is necessary
to protect the integrity of the judicial foreclosure process in
New Jersey and to assure the public that the process going
forward will be reliable,&#8221; Jacobson said in a court order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks agreed to undergo a review by a special master.
That official, retired judge Richard Williams, found the banks&#8217;
practices would ensure that documents are submitted by those
authorized to act for the plaintiff in the foreclosure action
and that paperwork is based on personal review of records,
according to reports filed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreclosure Recommendation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams recommended that the banks be allowed to resume
foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge&#8217;s decision &#8220;reflects the court&#8217;s recognition of
the significant work we undertook beginning last fall to enhance
processes designed to ensure foreclosures are being processed
correctly,&#8221; Dan Frahm, a spokesman for Bank of America, said in
an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We appreciate having had the opportunity to present
details about our procedures, and we are pleased with the result
announced yesterday,&#8221; a Citigroup spokesman, Mark Rodgers, said
in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theresa Schrettenbrunner, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said
that when the bank can&#8217;t help homeowners stay in their homes,
foreclosures prevent problems with vacant and unkempt dwellings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;We Will Resume&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now that the New Jersey court has validated Wells Fargo&#8217;s
foreclosure processes, we will resume these practices for the
benefit of New Jersey&#8217;s communities,&#8221; she said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Kelly, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys general from all 50 states in October started
probing mortgage servicers after revelations that they may have
acted illegally in having employees sign affidavits that they
didn&#8217;t review. State and federal officials are negotiating a
settlement with the five largest mortgage servicers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In announcing the review last year, Rabner said New Jersey
was the first U.S. state to take such an action. The state&#8217;s
courts received 21,752 new foreclosures in 2006 and 65,222 in
2010 through late December. Only 6 percent of cases were
contested last year, meaning 94 percent lacked &#8220;any meaningful
adversarial proceeding,&#8221; a court order said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks Not Included &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orders didn&#8217;t affect two banks subject to the review,
Ally Financial Inc. and OneWest Bank. Williams hasn&#8217;t provided
his reports on the two companies to Jacobson, according to
Winnie Comfort, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Residential Mortgage
Foreclosure Pleading and Document Irregularities, Superior Court
of New Jersey, Chancery Division-General Equity Part, F-59553-
10, Mercer County (Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Ambereen Choudhury" date="Aug 16, 2011  1:42 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-16/goldman-sachs-says-glenn-earle-to-retire-after-25-years-at-firm.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Says Earle to Step Down After 25 Years</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;(Corrects date of memo in second paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said Glenn Earle, chief operating officer of its European, Middle East and
African unit, will retire after almost 25 years with the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earle, 53, will be replaced by Robin Vince, global head of
operations, the bank said in a memorandum to employees last
month. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London confirmed the
contents of the document today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earle&#8217;s &#8220;judgment regarding reputational and suitability
matters was invaluable in meeting the needs of our clients and
protecting the firm&#8217;s global franchise,&#8221; New York-based Goldman
Sachs said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank was last year accused by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and a Senate subcommittee of misleading
customers in a 2007 mortgage-linked investment. Goldman Sachs
paid $550 million in July 2010 to settle the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit,
without admitting or denying guilt, and said it made a mistake
in the marketing materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earle, who received a master&#8217;s in business administration
from Harvard Business School, joined the firm in 1987 and became
a partner in 1996. Between 1996 and 1999 he helped the firm
develop its operations in central and eastern Europe, the Middle
East and Africa. He was co-head of the European advisory group
within the investment banking unit from 1999 to 2004 before
being named chief operating officer for the region in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2011, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s operations in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, known as EMEA, contributed
$4.63 billion of revenue, 24 percent of the total, down from 28
percent in the same period a year earlier, according to the
firm&#8217;s quarterly 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The region contributed $1.57 billion toward pretax
profit in the first half, 27 percent of the total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vince, who will remain global operations head, will be
based in London. He became a managing director in 2002 and a
partner in 2006. Financial News reported Earle&#8217;s retirement
earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), the biggest maker of
smartphone software, agreed to buy Motorola Mobility Holdings
Inc. for $12.5 billion in its largest acquisition, gaining
mobile patents and expanding in the hardware business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, under pressure from activist investor
Carl Icahn to shift strategy, gives Google more than 17,000
patents it can leverage in negotiations with competitors such as
Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Page, the Google co-founder who took over as chief
executive officer in April, is pushing the Web company into
smartphones to take on Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and gain more clout
for its Android software in the wireless business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola shareholders will get $40 a share in cash, the
companies said in a statement yesterday. That&#8217;s 63 percent more
than Motorola Mobility&#8217;s closing price on the New York Stock
Exchange on Aug. 12. Both boards have approved the takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile USA Inc. introduced the first phone powered by
Google&#8217;s Android software, made by HTC, in October 2008.
Android, which Google offers for free, will remain available to
other manufacturers, the company said. Winston Yung, chief
financial officer of HTC, gave his support to the deal, saying
it will strengthen &#8220;the whole Android ecosystem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said Samsung and Android-phone manufacturers Sony
Ericsson Mobile Communications AB and LG Electronics Inc. (066570) also
support the transaction. In a blog posting Aug. 3, Google
accused Apple, Microsoft and Oracle Corp. of using patents to
wage a &#8220;hostile, organized campaign&#8221; against Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is an intellectual property arms race between
Apple, Google and Microsoft,&#8221; said Kevin Smithen, a
telecommunications analyst at Macquarie Securities Group in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google had a total of 754 patents assigned to it as of last
week, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
database, not including patents Google bought last month from
International Business Machines Corp. Apple received 563 new
patents just last year, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal marks the end of independence for a company that
helped pioneer mobile phones and introduced its first consumer
handset in the early 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola announced a plan to spin off its mobile-phone
business in March 2008 amid market share losses and pressure
from billionaire Icahn. The company completed the split in
January, after the global recession delayed the deal. Motorola
Inc. became Motorola Solutions Inc., which makes radio equipment
for emergency workers and scanning devices for retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google acquisition is likely to attract the attention
of regulators, said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Citigroup Global
Markets, who rates Google a &#8220;hold.&#8221; The company, which owns
the world&#8217;s most popular search engine, is already under review
by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over its business
practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Regulatory scrutiny will likely be material,&#8221; Mahaney
said in a report yesterday. It&#8217;s &#8220;very hard to see this deal
closing by year-end,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the scrutiny may be tempered by the fact that Google
doesn&#8217;t currently make handsets, and that Apple and Microsoft
have already gained approval for the purchase of Nortel&#8217;s
patents, said Macquarie&#8217;s Smithen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re quite confident that this will be approved,&#8221; said
David Drummond, Google&#8217;s chief legal officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Wins Viagra Patent-Infringement Case Against Teva &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) won a patent-infringement case that prevents
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) from marketing a generic
version of the impotence drug Viagra until 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith in Norfolk,
Virginia, ruled Aug. 12 against Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva,
which claimed patent 6,469,012 wasn&#8217;t valid and couldn&#8217;t be
enforced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Teva has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that
the patent is invalid,&#8221; Smith said in a 110-page opinion. In
addition, &#8220;there is utterly no evidence&#8221; to support Teva&#8217;s
claim that that Pfizer intentionally withheld documents from the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Smith wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viagra sales increased 5.5 percent in the first quarter to
$479 million, Pfizer said in May. New York-based Pfizer, the
world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, posted net income of $8.26 billion
last year on sales of $67.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Protecting the intellectual property rights of our
innovative core is critical,&#8221; Amy Schulman, Pfizer&#8217;s general
counsel, said in a statement. &#8220;Friday&#8217;s court decision
acknowledges Teva&#8217;s clear violation of our patent rights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling was &#8220;a surprise,&#8221; Bloomberg Industries analyst
Asthika Goonewardene said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The patent was a method-of-use patent, and usually these
don&#8217;t hold up that well in court for small molecular drugs,&#8221;
Goonewardene said. &#8220;The court&#8217;s decision to uphold this patent
means other filers wanting to enter in 2012 are not likely to do
so then.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise Bradley, a Teva spokeswoman, declined to comment on
the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer v. Teva, 10-cv-128, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Virginia (Norfolk). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renesas Patent Complaint Seeks to Bar U.S. Imports of Vizio TVs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723), the world&#8217;s biggest maker of
microcontrollers used in cars and appliances, filed patent-
infringement complaints seeking to block Vizio Inc. televisions
from the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renesas accused Vizio of violating rights on two patents in
an Aug. 12 filing with the U.S. International Trade Commission
in Washington. The Japanese company also sued closely held Vizio
in a federal court in Marshall, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent 7,199,432 covers an arrangement of connections on
the surface of the circuit. Patent 6,531,400 is for a
manufacturing process that reduces corrosion, according to the
ITC complaint. Kawasaki, Japan-based Renesas contends that
circuits in Vizio&#8217;s digital televisions are made using these
patented inventions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vizio, based in Irvine, California, has its own patent-
infringement case pending against Renesas at the ITC that was
instituted last month. A trial in that case, which also involves
digital TVs, is scheduled for next June, according to
information on the agency&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renesas, formed in 2003 from the semiconductor divisions of
Hitachi Ltd. (6501) and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503), is owned by those
two companies and NEC Corp., according to the ITC complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil case is Renesas Electronics Corp. v. Vizio Inc.,
2:11-cv-00356, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Texas (Marshall). The ITC case is In the Matter of Digital
Televisions Containing Integrated Circuit Devices, Complaint No.
2840, U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vizio case against Renesas is In the Matter of Digital
Televisions and Components Thereof, 337-789, U.S. International
Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zynga Has Company in Quest for &#8216;With Friends&#8217; Trademarks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zynga Inc., the online game developer that is planning an
initial public offering, applied to register &#8220;With Friends&#8221; in
March 2011, according to the database of the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based company said it planned to use the
term for computer games, according to the pending application.
It also applied in January 2011 to register &#8220;words with
friends&#8221; for computer games. Zynga is best known for its
Farmville and Mafia Wars games played through Facebook Inc.&#8217;s
social media site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the other &#8220;with friends&#8221; possibilities may be
forestalled by a group of 12 applications filed earlier this
month by Roxy Friday LLC of Newport Beach, California. According
to the applications, marks such as &#8220;canasta with friends,&#8221;
&#8220;cribbage with friends,&#8221; &#8220;dominos with friends,&#8221; and
&#8220;farkle with friends&#8221; are all to be used for computer games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two applications have been filed this month for the use of
&#8220;crosswords with friends&#8221; for computer games. One application
is from Roxy Friday and the other is from Montie Jacobson of
Irvine, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the fusible.com website, one of the officers
of Roxy Friday is Brian Fargo, the chief executive officer of
inXile Entertainment of Newport Beach California. Closely held
InXile is also a game company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City Officials Shut Down 22 Fake Apple Stores in Kumming, China &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 22 fake versions of Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s stores have been shut
down in Kumming, China, Tech World reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city itself took action closing the stores upon receipt
of a complaint Apple sent Aug. 2, according to Tech World. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is one of the most popular brands in China, with huge
lines forming outside its authorized stores in China every time
the Cupertino, California-based company releases a new product
in that country, Tech World reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, best known for its iPhone and iPad, has only
four official stores in China, two in Shanghai and two in
Beijing, according to Tech World. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sturgis Trademark Enforcement Causes Decline in Event Vendors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of vendors at the annual gathering of motorcycle
fans Aug. 8-14 in Sturgis, South Dakota, declined this year in
the wake of the rally&#8217;s sponsor&#8217;s attempt to enforce its
trademark, the Rapid City Journal reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-profit Sturgis Motorcycle Rally Inc. registered
trademarks earlier this year and sent letters to potential
vendors demanding they not sell merchandise bearing the marks
without permission, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property owners in downtown Sturgis who ordinarily rented
space to rally vendors lost money &#8220;because their main guys
didn&#8217;t come back&#8221; over the trademark dispute, David Wilson of
Sturgis Real Estate Promotions told the Rapid City Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dean Kenney, chairman of Sturgis Motorcycle Rally Inc. said
after his group sent out cease-and-desist letters, some vendors
did sign licensing deals and he saw little evidence of boycotts
of the licensed products by rally attendees, the newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen King&#8217;s &#8216;Duma Key&#8217; Doesn&#8217;t Infringe Copyright, Court Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in Atlanta has dismissed a copyright
infringement suit against best-selling author Stephen King and
his publishing house CBS Corp. (CBS)&#8217;s Simon  Schuster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rod Marquardt, a South Carolina resident, sued King in
December 2010, claiming that King&#8217;s &#8220;Duma Key&#8221; infringed the
copyright to his novel &#8220;Keller&#8217;s Den.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina writer claimed King&#8217;s book too closely
resembled his in terms of &#8220;plot, plot devices, structure,
sequence of events, setting, characters, characterizations,
character function and relationships.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King&#8217;s publisher responded in February, saying in a court
filing that the only common elements in the two works are
&#8220;abstract ideas, stock elements and random similarities
isolated from the expressive context in which they appear, none
of which are protected by copyright.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marquardt, who by the end of the case was no longer
represented by counsel, filed a motion July 7 opposing the
publisher&#8217;s request that the case be dismissed. In that filing
he said that the defendants&#8217; &#8220;downplaying similarities is a
tactic that is expected but should not be construed as
accurate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a July 9 order, U.S. District Judge Julie E. Carnes said
that Marquardt&#8217;s book failed to meet copyright law&#8217;s standards
for infringement due to &#8220;substantial similarity,&#8221; and
dismissed the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Marquardt V. King, 1:10-cv-03946-JEC, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DoubleLine&#8217;s Gundlach Says He Offered to Buy TCW in 2009 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DoubleLine Capital LP&#8217;s Jeffrey Gundlach testified that in
September 2009 he offered to buy TCW Group Inc., the asset-
management company that fired him three months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach, who started DoubleLine weeks after TCW fired him
in December 2009, told a Los Angeles jury yesterday that he
offered about $350 million for 51 percent of the firm. TCW
claims that Gundlach and three other former TCW employees stole
its trade secrets to open a rival business. Gundlach says TCW
fired him to avoid paying hundreds of millions of dollars in
fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW, the Los Angeles-based unit of Societe Generale (GLE) SA,
sued Gundlach, 51, in January 2010, a month after more than half
of TCW&#8217;s fixed-income professionals had joined his new firm. TCW
seeks $375 million in damages, claiming Gundlach stole its trade
secrets, including client portfolio data, to start DoubleLine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach, who had worked at TCW for 25 years and who was
named Morningstar&#8217;s Fixed Income Manager of the Year in 2006,
countersued, saying that TCW fired him to avoid having to pay
management and performance fees for the distressed-asset funds
his group managed and that went &#8220;through the roof.&#8221; Gundlach
seeks about $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW argues that Gundlach wouldn&#8217;t have been able to get
DoubleLine started so quickly if he hadn&#8217;t had access to the
trade secrets and confidential information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW claims Gundlach instructed subordinates to download
confidential and proprietary information, including client data,
around the time of the September meeting to be used at his own
firm. Gundlach today disputed testimony by Cris Santa Ana, a co-
defendant and counter-claimant, detailing the kind of TCW
information he wanted collected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach also said he spoke with Western Asset Management
Co. earlier in 2009 about moving the funds he managed at TCW to
the rival company. The talks were prompted by Paris-based
Societe General&#8217;s announced intention to get out of the asset-
management business and the arrangement he contemplated would
have been beneficial to TCW as well, Gundlach said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proposed June 12, 2009, compensation arrangement by
Western Asset Management, based on an estimated $150 million in
revenue from his business, was a non-starter and he didn&#8217;t read
a follow-up proposal, Gundlach said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Gundlach, BC429385,
California Superior Court, Los Angeles County. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks may not have
reached their lows because inflation has yet to slow in the so-
called BRIC nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are probably very close to the lows of the year; the
reason I don&#8217;t emphatically say this is the buying moment is we
still have an inflation problem in the big emerging markets,&#8221;
Adrian Mowat, the chief Asia and emerging-market strategist at
JPMorgan, said in a Bloomberg Television interview in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 0.5 percent to 1,018.5
at 5:16 p.m. in Hong Kong. The gauge has slumped 12 percent this
year, compared with a 6.4 percent drop in the MSCI World Index
of developed nations, as countries from India to Brazil raised
borrowing costs to curb rising consumer prices. The MSCI BRIC (MXBRIC)
Index has fallen 14 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s wholesale price index rose 9.22 percent in July,
the commerce ministry said today, the eighth month of inflation
above 9 percent. The central bank has increased interest rates
11 times since the start of last year. China&#8217;s July
inflation rate of 6.5 percent was the highest in three years and
compares with an official target of 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s central bank has raised its target rate five times
this year. Consumer-price increases have stayed above the bank&#8217;s
target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent since April as rising
wages and credit growth stoked consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Equity markets are going to hit their lows when growth
has slowed down, inflation is coming off and analysts are very
aggressively downgrading earnings,&#8221; Mowat said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s inflation was 9 percent in July. Bank Rossii left
interest rates unchanged for a third month in August, citing a
balance between risks from inflation and a slowing economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dell Inc. (DELL) Chief Executive Officer
Michael Dell reaffirmed his backing for tablet software made by
Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp., issuing remarks viewed by
analysts as a swipe at rivals such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s Android mobile operating system will get a boost
from the company&#8217;s $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc., Dell said during a conference call
yesterday. He also said he&#8217;s been encouraged by the company&#8217;s
early work on a tablet running Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 8 software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think beyond those two that there are viable
alternatives that make sense,&#8221; Dell said. &#8220;So there&#8217;s a lot of
other noise out there in the market that I don&#8217;t think will
amount to much of anything.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remarks were a veiled criticism of Hewlett-Packard,
owner of the competing WebOS mobile software, and Research In
Motion Ltd., maker of the operating system used in BlackBerry
phones and PlayBook tablets, said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne,
Agee  Leach Inc. in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s taking an indirect swipe at Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s WebOS
and RIM&#8217;s BlackBerry PlayBook,&#8221; Wu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM, which has been losing market share and is threatened
by Google&#8217;s purchase of Motorola, could be acquired by companies
including Samsung Electronics Co., HTC Corp. or Dell to shore up
their position in the smartphone and tablet markets, said Wu.
Dell&#8217;s remarks didn&#8217;t quell speculation about a possible RIM
buyout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge Bets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell may also be trying to hedge its bets between Android
and Windows as the company tries to compete with the success of
Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad, which has been grabbing share from personal
computer makers, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at Gleacher 
Co. in San Francisco, who has a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on Dell
shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t want to get hurt with Android, but is saying
Windows 8 is looking good as well,&#8221; Marshall said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s acquisition of Motorola Mobility and its trove of
17,000 patents could help Google fend off litigation against
Android by companies including Apple, Microsoft and Oracle
Corp., Dell said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Certainly patents play a big role here, and having
Android with a stronger ability to exhaust patent claims against
it probably sets up an interesting competitive dynamic,&#8221; Dell
said. &#8220;We&#8217;re still quite interested in Android. I&#8217;ll also tell
that you our early work on Windows 8 on the tablet side looks to
be pretty encouraging.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell is planning new tablet computers that use either
Android or Windows 8, due next year. The company&#8217;s current
Streak tablets, which use an older version of Android, didn&#8217;t
have broad consumer appeal, Dell executive Stephen J. Felice
said in a June interview. The company has discontinued a version
of the Streak with a 5-inch screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Frink, a spokesman for Dell, declined to elaborate on
the CEO&#8217;s comments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPC index rose 0.3 percent to 34,049.58. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcasters followed U.S. technology companies lower. Dell

consumer technology crimped its sales forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV Azteca SAB (AZTECACP MM), Mexico&#8217;s second-largest
broadcast television network, dropped 2.6 percent to 7.84 pesos.
Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO) , the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-

&lt;p&gt;Industrias Penoles SAB (PEOLES* MM), Mexico&#8217;s largest

&lt;p&gt;Jive Software Inc., a maker of
social-networking software for businesses, picked Morgan Stanley
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to lead an initial public offering,
said three people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) and Citigroup Inc. (C) will also work on the IPO, which
may occur this year if market conditions permit, said the
people, who declined to be named because the process is private.
Jive may be valued at more than $1 billion, and the company may
sell a 10 to 20 percent stake, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jive is planning to capitalize on a resurgent IPO market,
following the share sales of professional-networking site
LinkedIn Corp., music-streaming service Pandora Media Inc. and
vacation-rental company HomeAway Inc. Gartner Inc. estimates
that Jive&#8217;s revenue more than doubled last year to $70 million.
As of late 2010, Jive had more than 15 million people from over
3,000 companies using its software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jive spokeswoman Ana Andreescu declined to comment. Morgan
Stanley (MS) spokesman Pen Pendleton, Goldman Sachs spokeswoman
Andrea Rachman and Citigroup spokesman Mark Costiglio also 
declined to comment, as did UBS spokeswoman Torie Von Alt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley has won the lead spot on share sales for
many of year&#8217;s hottest Web IPOs. The New York-based firm was
listed as the first underwriter for LinkedIn, Pandora and
HomeAway, as well as Groupon Inc. and Zynga Inc., which have yet
to start trading. Goldman Sachs, also based in New York, is co-
leading the Groupon and Zynga offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPOs Canceled &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until last week, this year was on course to be the biggest
for IPOs since 2007. That was before Standard  Poor&#8217;s cut the
U.S. credit rating on Aug. 5, leading to a surge in market
volatility, with the Nasdaq Composite Index moving more than 4
percent on four consecutive days. At least 13 U.S. IPOs were
postponed or withdrawn last week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded a decade ago by Bill Lynch and Matt Tucker, Jive
has raised $57 million in venture funding from Sequoia Capital
and Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers, the two firms that backed
Google Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tony Zingale joined the
company&#8217;s board in 2008 and became CEO last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Jive added executives from Google, Facebook and
McAfee Inc. to its board, as it prepared for an IPO. Google&#8217;s
Sundar Pichai, Facebook&#8217;s Jonathan Heiliger and McAfee&#8217;s Dave DeWalt brought the total number of directors to nine. DeWalt has
since resigned from McAfee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re here to build the next great enterprise software
company,&#8221; Zingale said in an interview when the board
appointments were announced on March 30. &#8220;The time was right to
expand the board and bring on this kind of expertise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zingale said then that becoming a public company would
improve access to capital for mergers and acquisitions and make
Jive a more visible competitor to Microsoft Corp., International
Business Machines Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jive&#8217;s customers include Nike Inc. (NKE), the world&#8217;s largest
sporting-goods company; Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), the biggest maker of
computer-networking equipment; and VMware Inc., the top seller
of virtualization software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is selling $1.85
billion of bonds, including its first 30-year debt in almost a
decade, as the Federal Reserve pledges record-low interest rates
through mid-2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest theme-park company plans to sell $750
million each of five- and 10-year notes and $350 million of 30-
year bonds, said a person with knowledge of the transaction.
Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, said the
person, who declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is selling bonds for the second time in 2011 even as
Standard  Poor&#8217;s said the company already has &#8220;exceptional
liquidity&#8221; that could cover its uses by more than two times
during the next two to three years. Investors are seeking
longer-term bonds for relatively higher yields after the Fed&#8217;s
pledge last week while companies are taking advantage of about
the lowest borrowing costs on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on corporate debt maturing in 15 years or more fell
to 5.42 percent yesterday, compared with the 1.72 percent on
company debentures due in one to three years, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index data. Overall investment-grade
bond yields tumbled to a record low of 3.45 percent on Aug. 4
before rising to 3.62 percent yesterday, the index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burbank, California-based Disney&#8217;s five-year notes may pay
60 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, the 10-
year notes may pay a 72 basis-point spread, and the 30-year
bonds may pay an 87.5 basis point spread, said the person with
knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2002 Offering &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney last sold 30-year debt in 2002, Bloomberg data show.
The company issued $500 million of 10-year notes in May, which
was its first return to the bond market in more than two years,
the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme park operator sold $500 million of 7 percent, 30-
year debt in 2002 that yielded 170 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, the data show. The notes traded on
Aug. 8 at 133.8 cents on the dollar with a spread of 79.6 basis
points and a yield of 4.47 percent, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is rated A2 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and A by
Standard  Poor&#8217;s, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is joined by Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the
railroad purchased by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., in selling 30-
year bonds today, said the person with knowledge of that
transaction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CIFG Assurance North America Inc.
sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for fraud over $275 million in
residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs made misrepresentations in connection with
the securitization of a portfolio of 6,204 mortgage loans,
according to the lawsuit filed yesterday in New York State
Supreme Court in Manhattan. CIFG insured about $275 million of
securities from the portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank duped investors and insurers into
assuming its market risk, even as Goldman Sachs profited from
underwriting fees, trading opportunities and bets on a decline
in the subprime market, New York-based CIFG said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs aggressively sought to liquidate its
position in residential mortgage-backed securities, &#8220;it also
sought to exploit the crisis,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CIFG Assurance North America Inc. v. Goldman,
Sachs  Co., 652286/2011, New York Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Solar Inc. (FSLR), the world&#8217;s
biggest maker of thin-film solar modules, sank as much as 7.8
percent after a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst reduced the
price target to $150 from $175. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Solar dropped $6.12, or 5.9 percent, to $98.34 at
10:21 a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares, which
earlier slipped to $96.32, have declined 24 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Wienkes at Goldman Sachs in New York has a
&#8220;buy/neutral&#8221; rating on Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jens Meyerhoff, First Solar&#8217;s president of utility systems
and former chief financial officer, plans to leave on Sept. 30
and will be replaced by James Brown, the company said in a

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks tumbled, sending the Dow
Jones Industrial Average down more than 400 points for the
fourth time this month, on concern the global economy is slowing
and speculation that European banks lack enough capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and FedEx Corp. (FDX) fell at least 4.9 percent,
pacing losses in stocks most-tied to the economy, as a
Philadelphia-area manufacturing index sank to the lowest since
2009, jobless claims and consumer prices rose, and existing home
sales slid. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) fell more
than 6 percent, following a plunge in European lenders. Hewlett-
Packard Co. sank 6 percent after cutting its earnings forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index slumped 4.5 percent to
1,140.65 at 4 p.m. in New York. All 10 groups in the SP 500
dropped at least 1.2 percent, and only 10 stocks in the
benchmark gauge advanced. The Dow fell 419.63 points, or 3.7
percent, to 10,990.58. Treasuries rallied, pushing 10-year
yields to a record low. About 11.6 billion shares changed hands
on U.S. exchanges as of 4:27 p.m., 44 percent more than the
three-month average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s almost like a worldwide buyers strike,&#8221; Michael Mullaney, who helps manage $9.5 billion at Fiduciary Trust in
Boston, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s a general
malaise on global economic activity. People continue to
downgrade their expectations on growth. There&#8217;s concern about
funding problems. That&#8217;s making us very nervous and we want to
take risk out of portfolios at least for the immediate future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP 500&#8217;s Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s stock rout erased more than $600 billion of U.S.
market value. The SP 500 has tumbled 16 percent from its April
29 high, matching the retreat between April 23 and July 2, 2010,
previously the biggest contraction of the bull market that began
in March 2009. The decline from April 29 through Aug. 8 left the
SP 500 within 29 points of entering a bear market. European
shares and the Russell 2000 Index entered a bear market last
week, falling at least 20 percent from their previous highs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The massive exodus from risk markets reflects heightened
concerns with a possible recession and the accelerated loss of
trust in policymakers,&#8221; Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive
officer and co-chief investment officer at Pacific Investment
Management Co., the world&#8217;s biggest manager of bond funds, wrote
in an e-mail. &#8220;Importantly, such worries will now be compounded
by concerns about technical damage to key markets. The risk is
of a rapidly deteriorating negative feedback loop of weakening
fundamentals, inadequate policies and bad technicals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Dangerously Close&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global stocks tumbled today after Morgan Stanley cut its
forecast for global growth this year, citing an &#8220;insufficient&#8221;
policy response to Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis, weakened
confidence and the prospect of fiscal tightening. The bank
estimates expansion of 3.9 percent, down from a previous
forecast of 4.2 percent, according to a report dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Europe are &#8220;dangerously close to recession,&#8221;
Morgan Stanley analysts including Chetan Ahya said in the note.
&#8220;Recent policy errors, especially Europe&#8217;s slow and
insufficient response to the sovereign crisis and the drama
around lifting the U.S. debt ceiling, have weighed down on
financial markets and eroded business and consumer confidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. equities slumped after a report showed that the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia&#8217;s general economic index
plunged to minus 30.7 this month, the lowest since March 2009,
from 3.2 in July. The August gauge exceeded the most pessimistic
projection in a Bloomberg News survey in which the median
estimate was 2. Readings less than zero signal contraction in
the area covering eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and
Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobless Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government data also showed that more Americans than
forecast filed applications for unemployment benefits last week,
while the cost of living climbed in July by the most in four
months. Separately, the National Association of Realtors said
that sales of U.S. previously owned homes unexpectedly dropped
in July, reflecting an increase in contract cancellations due to
strict lending rules and low appraisals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
economic growth slumped 6.8 percent as all of its 30 stocks
retreated. The Dow Jones Transportation Average of 20 stocks,
also considered a proxy for the economy, tumbled 6.1 percent. A
gauge of homebuilders in SP indexes declined 6.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caterpillar, the world&#8217;s largest construction and mining-
equipment maker, slumped 4.9 percent to $83.33. FedEx, operator
of the world&#8217;s biggest cargo airline, sank 5.9 percent to
$74.46. PulteGroup Inc., the largest U.S. homebuilder by
revenue, decreased 11 percent to $4.16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks Tumble &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American banks tumbled, following losses in European
financial shares, as Sweden&#8217;s financial regulator said his
country&#8217;s lenders must do more to prepare for a worsening in
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. The KBW Bank Index (BKX) of 24 stocks retreated
5.6 percent. Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender by assets,
sank 6 percent to $7.01. Citigroup dropped 6.3 percent to
$27.98. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks also slumped after the Wall Street Journal reported
that American regulators are intensifying scrutiny of the U.S.
arms of Europe&#8217;s largest banks amid concern about the region&#8217;s
debt crisis, citing people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard dropped 6 percent to $29.51 after jumping
as much as 8.3 percent earlier. The world&#8217;s largest computer
maker forecast fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year earnings that
missed analysts&#8217; estimates as lackluster consumer spending
failed to offset corporate purchases of printers, computers and
servers. Hewlett-Packard confirmed it&#8217;s considering a spinoff
for its PC business and that it has agreed to buy software maker
Autonomy Corp. for $10.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity Producers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gauges of energy and raw-material producers slid at least
5.6 percent. Oil, wheat and copper led declines in commodity
markets on concern that slower economic growth will weaken
demand for raw materials. Gold surged to a record as investors
fled stocks for the perceived safety of the metal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa Inc. (AA), the largest U.S. aluminum producer, decreased
6.1 percent to $11.51. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) fell 4.3 percent to
$70.94. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasuries surged, pushing yields to record lows, as
investors seek a refuge in the world&#8217;s safest securities on
concern global growth is slowing and speculation inflation will
remain subdued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bond market is indicating certainty of a recession,&#8221;
Chad Morganlander, a Florham Park, New Jersey-based money
manager at Stifel Nicolaus  Co., which oversees more than $115
billion in client assets, said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;Uncertainty regarding recession risk puts SP 500&#8217;s earnings
estimates in peril of drastic cuts, repricing stock market
valuations and expectations lower.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP 500 Earnings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the third quarter of last year, companies in the SP
500 have earned $774.3 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, pushing per-share profit to $91.44 as of yesterday
from $74.97 on July 2, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts have underestimated U.S. earnings for eight
straight quarters, with SP 500 companies beating forecasts by
an average of 5.1 percent in the three months ended in June. At
the start of the last recession, their projections for overall
profit proved 8.2 percentage points too high in the third
quarter of 2007, and 33.5 points too high in the fourth. That
was the biggest miss ever, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. stocks declined yesterday, wiping out an earlier
advance, amid speculation that the Fed may not consider another
economic stimulus program to avert a recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Inappropriate Policy&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernanke&#8217;s pledge last week to keep interest rates near
zero percent until mid-2013 was &#8220;inappropriate policy at an
inappropriate time,&#8221; Charles Plosser, president of the Fed Bank
of Philadelphia, said yesterday in a radio interview on
&#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt.
Dallas President Richard Fisher said the central bank shouldn&#8217;t
enact policy to protect stock investors. Both officials
dissented from the Fed&#8217;s Aug. 9 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s ugly out there,&#8221; Paul Zemsky, the New York-based
head of asset allocation for ING Investment Management, said in
a telephone interview. His firm oversees $550 billion. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
combination of concern of a potential recession and the lack of
policy tools to fight it. Until people see a bottom, they are
not going to buy stocks. There will be pressure on the equity
market until we see a solid policy response.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting the Stage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks may slip to new lows in the next few weeks,
setting the stage for a rally of more than 20 percent in the SP
500, Tom DeMark, the creator of indicators meant to identify
turning points in markets, said in an Aug. 16 interview. The SP
500, which closed at 1,193.89 yesterday, will probably drop
below the 11-month low of 1,119.46 set on Aug. 8 before surging
above 1,363.61, its peak on April 29, according to DeMark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and European options gauges surged. The VIX, as the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index is known, jumped
35 percent to 42.67. The VStoxx Index (V2X), which measures the cost
of protecting against declines in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index,
snapped a five-day losing streak. It climbed 35 percent, the
most since May 2010, to 47.17. Volatility gauges in Hong Kong,
South Korea, Japan and India also rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selloff in U.S. stocks may be close to ending with
valuations so low they could withstand a 15 percent decline in
profits, said Barton Biggs, the hedge fund manager who said this
month he was selling shares. The tumble in stocks shows that
investors expect a slowing economy to spur analysts to lower
earnings estimates, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings at SP 500 companies are forecast to climb 17
percent to $99.08 a share in 2011 and 14 percent to $112.90 in
2012, estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The index is trading
at 12.4 times profits in the last 12 months, 24 percent below
its five-decade average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very possible, in the grand scheme of things, that
what we&#8217;re seeing is the classic retest of the lows of 10 days
ago,&#8221; Biggs said on Bloomberg Television today. &#8220;We may be in
the process of making an important bottom.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. sued the U.S.
Interior Department, asking a judge to set aside the agency&#8217;s
decision to cancel offshore leases that may yield &#8220;billions of
barrels of oil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department overstepped its authority in a ruling on
Gulf of Mexico leases for the so-called Julia Unit, Exxon Mobil
said in a complaint filed Aug. 12 in federal court in Lake
Charles, Louisiana. Statoil ASA (STL), a partner of Exxon Mobil&#8217;s in
the Julia fields, filed a similar lawsuit in the same court on
Aug. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Interior decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse
of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law,&#8221; and &#8220;deprives
Exxon Mobil of property without due process of law,&#8221; the
Irving, Texas-based company said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded oil
company, said federal regulations allow oil producers to suspend
production in their fields, partly &#8220;to facilitate proper
development of a lease.&#8221; Because of drilling complexity, Exxon
Mobil said, it asked for a suspension for Julia in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Interior Department denied the request in 2009, stating
that the company &#8220;had not demonstrated a commitment to
production,&#8221; according to court papers. Unsuccessful appeals
followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Interior Department is reviewing the Exxon Mobil
complaint, Melissa Schwartz, spokeswoman for the department&#8217;s
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement,
said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Safe Development&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our priority remains the safe development of the nation&#8217;s
offshore energy resources, which is why we continue to approve
extensions that meet regulatory standards,&#8221; Schwartz said. The
government must respond to the Exxon suit within 60 days of
receiving the Aug. 15 summons, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits were reported earlier by the Wall Street
Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts Fadel Gheit at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York and
Brian Youngberg at Edward Jones in St. Louis said they
ultimately expect Exxon Mobil to reach an agreement with the
government to keep the leases. Both said they hadn&#8217;t heard of
the Julia discovery before the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon&#8217;s not just going to walk away from it,&#8221; said
Gheit, who rates the shares &#8220;outperform&#8221; and owns an
undisclosed number of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil fell $3.24, or 4.4 percent, to $70.92 at 2:49
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading as crude oil
slumped the most in a week after Morgan Stanley and Deutsche
Bank AG cut their forecasts for global economic expansion.
Statoil&#8217;s American depositary receipts, each representing one
ordinary share, declined $1.68, or 7 percent, to $22.40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyn Hornbuckle, a U.S. Justice Department spokesman,
declined to comment on the dispute. Jonathan A. Hunter, lead
attorney on the suit for Exxon, couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached
for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama stopped deep-water oil and natural-
gas drilling early last year after a BP Plc (BP/) well blew out off
the Louisiana coast, claiming 11 lives and causing the largest
U.S. oil spill. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the ban in
October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon alleges that the Interior Department terminated the
Julia leases to gain new leases and make more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cancellation of the original Julia leases would give
Interior the opportunity to collect millions of dollars in
bonuses and royalties that it otherwise would not be entitled to
collect,&#8221; Exxon said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the agency&#8217;s decision stands, Exxon Mobil and Statoil
will &#8220;lose the enormous value of those leases and their
hundreds of millions of dollars in investments,&#8221; Statoil said
in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ola Morten Aanestad, a spokesman for Stavanger, Norway-
based Statoil, had no immediate comment on the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) v. Kenneth Salazar, 11CV1474,
U.S. District Court, Western District of Louisiana (Lake
Charles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. may face
billions of dollars more in liability for faulty mortgages if a
judge agrees with insurer MBIA Inc. (MBI) that the lender must buy
back loans even if the errors didn&#8217;t cause a borrower&#8217;s default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If New York Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten and
judges in similar cases across the country rule that the issue
of &#8220;causation&#8221; doesn&#8217;t apply -- meaning it&#8217;s enough to show
that the loan was improperly made -- it &#8220;could significantly
impact&#8221; Bank of America&#8217;s potential costs, the bank said in a
regulatory filing this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such court defeats may add as much as $9 billion to what
Bank of America owes bond insurers, according to hedge fund
Branch Hill Capital, which is betting against its stock and has
invested in MBIA. A victory for Armonk, New York-based MBIA may
also strengthen claims by mortgage-securities investors that
want the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank to pay more than
the $8.5 billion it&#8217;s offered them as a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to wait until you&#8217;re in a severe accident
before you return the car with bad brakes,&#8221; said David Grais, a
partner in New York at Grais  Ellsworth LLP who represents
investors objecting to the bank&#8217;s proposed settlement with
Countrywide Financial Corp. mortgage-bond holders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any ruling on the issue, which was to be the subject of a
hearing today in state court in Manhattan, may come later than
anticipated because the proceeding was postponed until October.
The decision may intensify settlement talks between bond
insurers like MBIA and other banks that issued securities based
on faulty mortgages, according to the head of insurer Assured
Guaranty Ltd. (AGO), which is demanding money from lenders including
UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG. (CSGN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they lose that case, then our certainty of getting
reimbursed becomes a lot higher,&#8221; Dominic Frederico, Assured&#8217;s
chief executive officer, said in an interview. Bank of America
agreed in April to a deal it valued at $1.6 billion with
Hamilton, Bermuda-based Assured Guaranty to settle its mortgage
claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It could change the playing field,&#8221; MBIA Chief Executive
Officer Jay Brown said on an Aug. 10 conference call with
analysts and investors when asked about the causation issue. It
could &#8220;have a very significant effect on the ability to rescind
or obtain recessionary damages,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So, it can affect
the view of both parties as to the likely outcome of the
trial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, said in
an e-mail that Branch Hill Capital &#8220;consistently has overstated
Bank of America&#8217;s representation and warranty repurchase
exposure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their motives are not nuanced,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Less than a
year ago, they had estimated repurchase losses for Bank of
America of approximately $74 billion. They were wrong then, and
we believe that they are wrong now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is MBIA Insurance v. Countrywide Home Loans,
602825-08, New York State Supreme Court (New York County). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIFG Sues Goldman Sachs Over $275 Million in Securities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIFG Assurance North America Inc. sued Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) for fraud over $275 million in residential mortgage-backed
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs made misrepresentations in connection with
the securitization of a portfolio of 6,204 mortgage loans,
according to the lawsuit filed Aug. 16 in New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan. CIFG insured about $275 million of
securities from the portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank duped investors and insurers into
assuming its market risk, even as Goldman Sachs profited from
underwriting fees, trading opportunities and bets on a decline
in the subprime market, New York-based CIFG said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs aggressively sought to liquidate its
position in residential mortgage-backed securities, &#8220;it also
sought to exploit the crisis,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CIFG Assurance North America Inc. v. Goldman,
Sachs  Co., 652286/2011, New York Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Sued by South Korean IPhone Users Over Location Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of South Korean users of Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone sued
the company in a local court, claiming it invaded their privacy
by allowing the smartphone to collect location data without
their consent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 27,000 people joined a class-action lawsuit against
Apple&#8217;s South Korean unit and headquarters, seeking 1 million
won per person ($930) in damages, according to a notice posted
online by Mirae Law, which represents the plaintiffs. The suit
was filed in Changwon, south of Seoul, where the law firm is
located. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple was fined by South Korea&#8217;s telecommunications
regulator on Aug. 3 and ordered to encrypt location data of
people using iPhones to address privacy concerns. The company
also came under scrutiny from regulators around the world after
an April report by publisher O&#8217;Reilly Radar said iPhones record
information about users&#8217; whereabouts, adding to legal disputes
the company is involved in over patent infringements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple was fined 3 million won for collecting such data even
when some users turned off location-recognition features on
their iPhones, the Korea Communications Commission said Aug. 3.
Google Inc., which didn&#8217;t gather data in the same way, wasn&#8217;t
fined and was only ordered to make the information unreadable,
it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Apple was sued in the U.S. by two iPhone
and iPad users who claimed the devices secretly collected
information on their movements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Park, a Seoul-based spokesman for Apple, declined to
comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madoff Trustee Amends UBS Case, Says Bank Misled Regulators &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm amended his
lawsuit seeking $2 billion from UBS AG (UBSN), claiming the Swiss bank
misled regulators in the U.S. and Luxembourg to help hide
Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS misled the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier in
Luxembourg about Madoff, the trustee, Irving Picard, said
yesterday in a filing in Manhattan federal court, according to a
copy of the complaint posted on his website. The filing couldn&#8217;t
immediately be confirmed in court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, based in Zurich, hid Madoff&#8217;s role as the true
custodian of two so-called feeder funds that attracted investors
to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities before his arrest in
December 2008, according to the complaint. Madoff pleaded guilty
to running a Ponzi scheme and is serving 150 years in federal
prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Madoff&#8217;s scheme could not have been accomplished unless
the UBS defendants had agreed to look the other way and to
pretend that they were truly ensuring the existence of assets
and trades when in fact they were not and never did,&#8221; according
to the amended complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter McKillop, a spokesman for UBS, said the bank denies
the trustee&#8217;s allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;UBS was not aware of any wrongdoing by Mr. Madoff and
will take all appropriate steps to demonstrate that the
allegations are false and unfounded,&#8221; he said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. UBS AG, 11-cv-04212, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Says Ceglia E-Mailed &#8216;Authentic Contract&#8217; to Lawyer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Ceglia, the western New York man claiming part-
ownership of Facebook Inc., e-mailed the &#8220;authentic contract&#8221;
disproving his claim to a law firm in 2004, a lawyer for the
company told a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orin Snyder told U.S. Magistrate Judge Leslie Foschio at a
hearing in Buffalo, New York, yesterday that Ceglia sent the
contract, which made no mention of Facebook, to a lawyer at the
firm Sidley Austin LLP the year after Ceglia claims he signed a
contract with Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg giving him an
equal share in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract Facebook says is genuine was found both on
Ceglia&#8217;s computer and Sidley Austin&#8217;s e-mail server, Snyder told
Foschio. Snyder said the evidence proves Ceglia fabricated the
contract on which he bases his claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The noose is tightening around the neck of the plaintiff
in this case and he knows it,&#8221; Snyder told Foschio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foschio said Ceglia must allow Facebook&#8217;s experts to
examine his Web-based e-mail accounts, which he said he used to
communicate with Zuckerberg in 2003 and 2004, before Zuckerberg
will be required to turn over 175 e-mails from his Harvard
University account. Ceglia claimed he copied e-mails with
Zuckerberg from his Web-based accounts into word-processing
documents he saved on floppy disks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook said the Harvard e-mails involve Zuckerberg and
Ceglia and others at StreetFax.com, Ceglia&#8217;s former company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceglia&#8217;s lawyer, Jeffrey Lake, said the contract attached
to Ceglia&#8217;s complaint is the genuine one. Ceglia&#8217;s version of
the contract includes terms giving him a share of &#8220;The Face
Book&#8221; in exchange for a $1,000 investment, in addition to terms
referring to Zuckerberg&#8217;s StreetFax work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After yesterday&#8217;s hearing, Lake said he plans to demand
computers, e-mails and instant messages from Zuckerberg, in
addition to early source code for the site. Ceglia claims
Zuckerberg used code from StreetFax in building Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ceglia v. Zuckerberg, 1:10-cv-00569, U.S.
District Court, Western District of New York (Buffalo). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon Opposes N.Y. Move to Intervene in BofA Accord &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) asked a judge to reject a bid
by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to intervene in a
proposed $8.5 billion mortgage-bond settlement involving Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman this month asked the New York state-court
judge overseeing the case to reject the deal, calling it unfair
to investors. Bank of New York, the trustee for the mortgage-
securitization trusts covered by the settlement, violated New
York law, Schneiderman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement calls for Bank of America to pay $8.5
billion to resolve claims from investors in Countrywide
Financial Corp. mortgage bonds. Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America acquired Countrywide in 2008. Bank of New York,
along with 22 institutional investors, claim Schneiderman has no
standing to intervene in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The current settlement process allows for all investors -
-supporters and objectors -- to make their case before the
court, including those with even the smallest economic
interests,&#8221; Kevin Heine, a Bank of New York spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attorney general&#8217;s claims about whether Bank of New
York acted in good faith &#8220;would hijack what should be an
expedited proceeding,&#8221; the bank said. Those claims could take
years to resolve, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No intervenor has demonstrated that the trustee was
presented with -- or could have achieved -- a better outcome
than the settlement the trustee obtained,&#8221; the investors said.
&#8220;That is precisely why all 22 of institutional investors chose
to support it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, and the institutional investors, said the
proposed settlement proceeding isn&#8217;t the appropriate forum to
address the attorney general&#8217;s claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given that those who stand to be significantly affected
include New York State investors and pensioners, as well as
distressed homeowners residing throughout the state and country,
the state of New York has a broad and crucial interest in these
proceedings,&#8221; Danny Kanner, a Schneiderman spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement responding to the opposition to his motion
to intervene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the matter of Bank of New York Mellon,
651786/2011, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Hacking to Become News Corp. (NWSA) &#8216;Scandal,&#8217; Watson Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelations that U.K. tabloid journalists may have
graduated to hacking computers in addition to mobile phones may
form the next scandal facing Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News Corp., a U.K.
lawmaker investigating privacy violations by the now-defunct
News of the World said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police and parliament have mostly focused their probes on
how journalists illegally accessed the voice mails of
celebrities, politicians, and crime victims, and who at the
company knew about it. More revelations of computer hacking and
other forms of spying could emerge, Tom Watson, a Labour Party
lawmaker, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My own concerns are that this will lead to other forms of
covert surveillance and I think the next scandal will be
computer hacking and we&#8217;re going to be living with this for
weeks and months to come,&#8221; said Watson, a member of the
Culture, Media and Sport Committee that is investigating phone
hacking. Watson made the comments after the committee published
additional statements from News Corp. deputy chief operating
officer James Murdoch and others beyond what they offered in
their initial testimony July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London&#8217;s Metropolitan Police opened a third investigation
into reporting tactics at the end of July which focuses on
computer hacking, while not specifically targeting News Corp.
The probe, dubbed Operation Tuleta, is considering &#8220;a number of
allegations regarding breach of privacy&#8221; and computer hacking
that they have received since January, police said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allegations are outside the scope of the two other
police probes opened earlier this year into phone hacking and
police bribery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuleta began following allegations by Ian Hurst, a former
British Army intelligence officer. Hurst on Aug. 1 sued News
Group, the unit of the New York-based company that publishes the
Sun and formerly the News of the World, claiming it hired a
computer expert to hack into his e-mail, according to his
lawyer, Mark Lewis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News International declined to comment via e-mail when
asked about computer hacking. Regarding the statements to
parliament, the company said, &#8220;We recognize the seriousness of
materials disclosed to the police and parliament and are
committed to working in a constructive and open way with all the
relevant authorities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., Manhattan federal prosecutors have joined the
inquiry into allegations that News Corp.&#8217;s American marketing
arm hacked a password-protected website at Floorgraphics Inc.,
an attorney for Floorgraphics has said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BofA Said to Weigh Foreclosure Accord Allowing New York Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. may settle a state and federal probe
of foreclosure practices in a deal that lets New York proceed
with an inquiry into securitizations, according to two people
with direct knowledge of the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm may pursue an accord with most of the 50 state
attorneys general, even if it omits New York&#8217;s Eric Schneiderman
and at least two other states that are opposed because a deal
would impede related inquiries, said one of the people.
Negotiations on a broad settlement stalled after Schneiderman
indicated he wouldn&#8217;t let it block his probe into the bundling
and sale of mortgages, said the people, who declined to be
identified because talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan, seeking to
reverse a 44 percent stock slide this year, has booked about $30
billion in settlements and writedowns to clean up mortgage
liabilities at the biggest U.S. bank since the start of 2010.
One of the largest legal matters still pending is the multi-
state probe into whether firms servicing mortgages used bogus
documents to justify foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They need to resolve this because it&#8217;s looming out there
as an unknown liability,&#8221; said Brian Chappelle, a partner at
mortgage-finance consultancy Potomac Partners LLC in Washington
and former executive at the Mortgage Bankers Association. &#8220;It&#8217;s
harming the housing recovery because the large institutions are
reluctant to originate new loans because of the uncertainty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America executives, concerned that a delay in
resolving the case is hurting the firm&#8217;s stock, are open to a
deal that would resolve most of it, even if some mortgage
investigations continue, said one of the people. The bank has
been pushing for liability releases for loan activities besides
servicing, such as securitization and lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys general from Delaware, Massachusetts and Nevada
have also voiced concern that a proposed settlement would
protect banks from mortgage investigations that aren&#8217;t yet
finished. Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, whose
office sued Bank of America and is conducting civil and criminal
foreclosure probes, said in an interview this week that she will
be &#8220;very cautious&#8221; about agreeing to a settlement that hinders
those inquiries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danny Kanner, a spokesman for Schneiderman, and Melissa
Karpinsky, a spokeswoman for Massachusetts Attorney General
Martha Coakley, declined to comment on Bank of America&#8217;s
settlement talks. Edie Cartwright, a spokeswoman for Masto,
didn&#8217;t comment. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Delaware Attorney
General Beau Biden, didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judge to Review Madoff Trustee&#8217;s Anti-Class Action Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said he will decide if the
liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm may stop a class-action
lawsuit against directors and advisers of so-called feeder fund
Thema International Fund Plc, according to a court filing Aug.
16 in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustee Irving Picard sued the class-action plaintiffs in
April, claiming they were undermining the U.S. bankruptcy
court&#8217;s jurisdiction over Madoff&#8217;s estate. They said Picard was
trying to &#8220;commandeer&#8221; their claims by suing some of the same
defendants and wouldn&#8217;t share any recoveries with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Repex, 11-cv-03477, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining Executive Kuhn Declared Fugitive by EPA over Dumping &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former mining-company executive Peter Kuhn was declared a
fugitive by the Environmental Protection Agency after he failed
to turn himself in for his role in a conspiracy to illegally
dispose of arsenic and lead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuhn, former president of Reno, Nevada-based French Gulch
Nevada Mining Corp. and Bullion River Gold Corp. (BLRVQ), engaged in a
conspiracy to dump mining wastes on a hillside, county road and
stream near a company mine, the EPA said yesterday in a
statement. If convicted, Kuhn faces a possible prison term of 20
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 1, 2010, a U.S. District Court grand jury in the
Eastern District of California returned an indictment charging
Kuhn with one count of conspiracy and other crimes. Kuhn, 56,
becomes the 18th fugitive listed by the agency, according to the
EPA&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A telephone message left with French Gulch Nevada Mining
wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. A telephone number on file for Kuhn
was disconnected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach Denies DoubleLine Fund Is &#8216;Turbo-Charged&#8217; With Risk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DoubleLine Capital LP&#8217;s Jeffrey Gundlach denied that his
total-return fund is &#8220;turbo-charged&#8221; with risky securities,
saying his management strategy is similar to what he used at TCW
Group Inc. before he was fired in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under questioning by TCW&#8217;s lawyer in his fourth day of
testimony at a jury trial in Los Angeles, the money manager said
yesterday the way the different kinds of securities are put
together in the bond fund determines what risk there is rather
than the type of security by itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With respect sir, you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking
about,&#8221; Gundlach told lawyer John Quinn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles-based TCW fired Gundlach, 51, in December 2009
and sued him the following month after more than half of its
fixed-income professionals joined his new firm. TCW, a unit of
Paris-based Societe Generale SA, seeks $375 million in damages,
claiming Gundlach stole its trade secrets, including client
portfolio data, to start DoubleLine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach, who had worked at TCW for 25 years and who was
named Morningstar&#8217;s Fixed Income Manager of the Year in 2006,
countersued, saying TCW fired him to avoid having to pay
management and performance fees for the distressed-asset funds
his group managed and that went &#8220;through the roof.&#8221; Gundlach
seeks about $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Gundlach, BC429385,
California Superior Court, Los Angeles County. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Reaches Accord With Connecticut Over Home Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) will consider about 1,535 Connecticut
mortgages for modification as part of an agreement with the
state on adjustable-rate loans, the state&#8217;s attorney general
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord resolves claims that Wachovia Corp. and Golden
West Financial Corp. violated state consumer protection laws,
Attorney General George Jepsen said yesterday in a statement.
The banks failed to adequately inform borrowers that minimum
payments on &#8220;pick-a-payment&#8220;-type mortgages wouldn&#8217;t cover
interest due, causing the balance to grow, Jepsen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I want to stress that Wells Fargo inherited this problem
when it acquired Wachovia and Golden West,&#8221; Jepsen said. San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo bought Wachovia and its Golden West
unit in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve the investigation, the bank also agreed to pay
Connecticut $741,465 to support the state&#8217;s foreclosure-
prevention efforts, Jepsen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Connecticut accord is the 11th such agreement by the
lender, which has also settled with California, Texas, Florida,
Illinois, New Jersey and five other states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiau Loses Bid to Reverse Conviction in Insider-Trading Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winifred Jiau, a former consultant with expert networking
firm Primary Global Research LLC, lost a post-trial bid to
overturn her convictions on charges related to insider-trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff denied Jiau&#8217;s motion for an
acquittal or a new trial in federal court in Manhattan, where
she was convicted June 20 of conspiracy and securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury found her guilty of passing information regarding
earnings and other matters on Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Marvell
Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) to hedge fund managers Noah Freeman, a
former SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio manager, and Samir
Barai, founder of New York-based Barai Capital Management LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiau, of Fremont, California, faces as long as 25 years in
prison when she is sentenced by Rakoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Jiau, 11-cr-00161, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, will start offering banking
services to South Africa&#8217;s largest companies as it seeks to tap
faster growth outside the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank will offer corporate clients lending as well as
treasury and foreign exchange services, Eric von Glehn, managing
director of JPMorgan in Johannesburg, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. The lender, which has been in South Africa
since 1998, already offers clients services such as advice on
mergers and acquisitions and on debt and stock offerings. It
doesn&#8217;t plan to compete with South African banks, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re broadening our products and services,&#8221; von Glehn
said. &#8220;We have lots of big multinationals doing business all
over Africa and in South Africa and we&#8217;re in Africa so it makes
enormous sense to be their partners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has made expanding
overseas a priority as growth in the U.S. and Europe stalls.
South Africa&#8217;s economy is forecast to grow 3.7 percent this
year, according to the central bank. JPMorgan, the top-ranked
adviser on mergers globally, is also trying to add clients as
its share of South Africa&#8217;s market for stock offerings shrinks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, the top-ranked adviser on stock offerings in
South Africa between 2001 and 2004, fell every year to ninth
position last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This year it doesn&#8217;t feature at all in the equity rankings. In
mergers, JPMorgan worked with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) on its
acquisition of a 16.5 billion-rand ($2.32 billion) stake in
South African retailer Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM), a deal which
started last year and was approved in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaining Market Share &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitors such as BNP Paribas (BNP) SA and Citigroup Inc. (C) are
gaining market share and are the two top-ranked stock
underwriters in Africa&#8217;s largest economy this year.
Johannesburg-based Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) has worked with parent
Barclays Plc (BARC) to net 37 debt underwriting assignments in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transactions may come from working more closely with South
African companies, Von Glehn said. Banks, retailers and mining
companies are all expanding across the continent with South
Africa home to some of the world&#8217;s biggest metals producers
including Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Gold Fields Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The mining sector is certainly an area we&#8217;re going to be
focusing on,&#8221; he said. We&#8217;ll be looking at the blue chips, the
top 40.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies have held nine share sales for a combined total
of $1.4 billion in South Africa this year, according to
Bloomberg data. That compares with 21 offerings valued at $4.5
billion in total last year. In the year to date South African
companies have also proposed 156 takeovers valued at 81.8
billion rand, compared with 195 mergers in the first three
quarters of 2010 which were valued at almost 130 billion rand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of deals are taking longer to close than we had
hoped but it probably means next year will be exciting,&#8221; Von
Glehn said. &#8220;The difficulty closing is a function of markets
being wobbly, concerns about economic growth and a lack of
confidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Alan Purkiss" date="Aug 18, 2011  1:29 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-18/globalization-has-whipsawed-u-s-europe-sachs-writes-in-ft.html"><headline>Globalization Has &#8216;Whipsawed&#8217; U.S., Europe, Sachs Writes in FT</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Both the U.S. and European economies
are being &#8220;whipsawed&#8221; by globalization, and the failure of
governments to cope with that lies behind the collapse of market
confidence in the euro area and America, said Jeffrey Sachs, who
heads the Earth Institute at Columbia University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing in the Financial Times, Sachs said employment in
the U.S. and Europe in the early years of the century was held
up only by housing construction, fueled by low interest rates
and reckless deregulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs for low-skilled workers in manufacturing, and
investment in industry, have been lost to Asian competition,
while proving a bonanza for the super-rich, who have been able
to invest in highly profitable projects in emerging economies,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor are hurt twice, first by global market forces,
then by the ability of the rich to park money at low taxes in
hideaways round the world, Sachs wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An improved fiscal policy would expand investment in human
and infrastructure capital; cut wasteful spending on misguided
military adventures such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen; and
balance budgets in the medium-term, partly through tax increases
on high personal incomes and international corporate profits
that are shielded by loopholes and overseas tax havens, Sachs
concluded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) has developed a computer chip inspired by the human brain
that may predict tsunamis and highlight risks in financial markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology, called cognitive computing, is programmed
to recognize patterns, make predictions and learn from mistakes,
human-like capabilities not possible using today&#8217;s best
computers. It&#8217;s a sharp departure from traditional chip design
concepts, IBM said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems built with the new chip can synthesize events
currently occurring and make decisions in real time, the Armonk,
New York-based company said. Sponsored by the U.S. Department of
Defense, IBM has received $21 million more in funding after
today&#8217;s developments to bring the technology to applications.
The advancement marks the end of a conceptual phase and
initiates the first step to find out how to bring the chips to
scale for production, said Kelly Sims, an IBM spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re inventing a new system, changing the game,&#8221;
Dharmendra Modha, the project&#8217;s leader, said in an interview.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a new generation of computers, bypassing the hurdles
faced by today&#8217;s computers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While current computers handle commands individually on a
linear if/then basis, Modha said machines equipped with the new
chips will &#8220;rewire themselves on the fly.&#8221; Without any set
programming, the devices reach decisions through integrated
memory, computation and communication cores that resemble
synapses, neurons and axons, respectively, in the brain&#8217;s
nervous system. The sensor network is three times larger than
any ever created, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reacting to Surroundings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive computers may react to taste, touch, smells and
sound, Modha said, while consuming less power and volume than
today&#8217;s technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the device has 3.8 million transistors in a 4.2
millimeters square of silicon, a tiny scale for what the chip
accomplishes, said Richard Doherty, research director at
Seaford, New York-based Envisioneering Group, a technology
assessment firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Research like this has been going on for decades, but
this marks the beginning of commerce, industry and profits for
cognitive computing,&#8221; Doherty said in an interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re
going to be more like humans and primates than ever before.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current chips using 2 billion transistors couldn&#8217;t perform
similar tasks, he said, and they&#8217;d have to be 10 times as large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re giving birth to a new type of architecture-enabling
applications to ask computers to help us with today,&#8221; Modha
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential Uses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of that help may come, for example, in the form of
predicting tsunamis or creating financial opportunities, he
said. By constantly recording and reporting temperature,
pressure, wave height and ocean tides, such a system could issue
a warning for giant waves based on its decision making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a financial sense, it would be looking not for micro
opportunities, but a macro pattern that spots anomalies, risks,
and creates new possibilities,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology also might be used in a doctor&#8217;s glove,
providing real-time patient data during surgery based on the
body&#8217;s texture, smell and temperature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The impact of this is inevitable, but the timing is
unpredictable,&#8221; Modha said. &#8220;As a civilization we&#8217;re computing
with half a brain, and now we&#8217;re bringing forth that other half
to complement it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gasoline in the Gulf Coast
strengthened after Exxon Mobil Corp. said a fluid catalytic
cracker was offline at its Baytown, Texas, refinery, the largest
in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gasoline-making unit and a catalytic light-ends unit at
the 584,000-barrel-a-day plant were down, Neely Nelson, a
spokeswoman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said in an e-
mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 2.5 cents to 4.5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:50 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
increased 7.91 cents to $2.7923 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for the same fuel in the Midwest, or Group 3,
increased 2.25 cents to 9 cents a gallon, the widest
differential since May 13, after refinery outages threatened to
crimp supply. Higher prices in the Midwest may increase the
demand for pipeline deliveries into the region from refineries
on the Gulf Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marathon Petroleum Corp. shut a fluid catalytic cracker at
its Catlettsburg, Kentucky, refinery after a leak caused a fire
Aug. 17, according to a filing with state regulators. A crude
unit at Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)&#8217;s Memphis, Tennessee, plant is down
for repairs after a fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips (COP) is conducting planned maintenance at the
Ponca City refinery in Oklahoma, Janet Grothe, a company
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital, the investment
banking division of Barclays Plc (BARC), hired Pedro Grimaldi from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and two other equity analysts as it
seeks to expand its research of Latin American companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grimaldi started covering Latin American pulp and paper
firms based in Sao Paulo this week, Mark Lane, a New York-based
spokesman for Barclays Capital, said in an e-mail statement
yesterday. Barclays also hired Gabriel Lima from Banco Santander
SA to cover Latin American food and beverages and Vera Rossi
from Morgan Stanley for telecommunications, he said, adding that
both analysts started their positions earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Equity research is an important element of the continued
expansion of our franchise in Brazil and the rest of Latin
America, Roberto Attuch, Barclays Capital&#8217;s head of equity
research for Latin America, said in an e-mail statement today.
&#8220;These new appointments demonstrate the commitment we have to
providing our clients with quality research and insights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays is initiating the coverage of the pulp and paper
and food and beverage industries in Latin America with these
additions, Lane said. Earlier this year, the bank started to
cover the aviation industry in the region after hiring Benjamin
Theurer from DWS Investments GmbH, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) cut their U.S. growth forecasts as the global economy slows
and officials struggle to stem Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product will grow 1 percent in the fourth
quarter rather than the 2.5 percent previously forecast and 0.5
percent in the first quarter of 2012 instead of 1.5 percent,
JPMorgan said in a note e-mailed to clients today. Citigroup cut
its 2011 growth forecast to 1.6 percent from 1.7 percent and
lowered its projection for next year to 2.1 percent from 2.7
percent, according to a note to clients dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global stocks dropped today, European shares suffered their
biggest two-day slump since 2008 and oil sank below $80 a barrel
on concern the recovery in the world&#8217;s largest economy is
faltering and Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will worsen. Morgan Stanley
this week cut its forecast for global growth in 2011 and said
the U.S. and Europe are &#8220;dangerously close to recession.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The next four quarters we don&#8217;t see growth that is much
faster than the growth that took place in the first half of this
year,&#8221; said Michael Feroli, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief U.S. economist in
New York. &#8220;Global growth has disappointed and foreign growth
forecasts have been taken lower. Risks of a recession are
clearly elevated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than $6 trillion has been erased from the value of
global equities this month on signs of a slowing U.S. economy
and speculation that European banks lack sufficient capital.
Regulators from the U.S., South Korea and Sweden said the market
turmoil posed further risks to growth, after reports yesterday
showed American jobless claims rose and Philadelphia-area
manufacturing shrank in August by the most since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Political Paralysis&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup economists Steven Wieting and Shawn Snyder wrote
that they were lowering their forecasts because of potential
&#8220;political paralysis&#8221; in the U.S. and fiscal tightening steps.
They also trimmed their estimates for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index&#8217;s earnings-per-share this year to $97 from $98 and to $101
from $105 next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positioning of the economy and pace of recovery so far
&#8220;do not suggest a new cyclical recession, rather an inability
to mount a full recovery,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;We see corporate
profits growing at a quite low single-digit pace in coming years
even with the assumption of continued economic expansion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reduced its growth forecasts for the next two
quarters because consumer sentiment has &#8220;tumbled&#8221; and &#8220;the
housing market shows little sign of lifting,&#8221; Feroli said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, &#8220;declining energy prices should help to cushion
some of the weakness in the economy, and the still-low levels of
cyclically sensitive spending could reduce the chances of
getting a negative GDP quarter,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The liquidator of Bernard L.
Madoff&#8217;s firm sued Lion Global Investors Ltd. and at least six
other companies to recover at least $172.8 million they
allegedly received from investments made with the con man by
Fairfield Sentry Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving Picard, the trustee overseeing the liquidation of
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, claims Fairfield, a
so-called feeder fund to the Madoff company, transferred
&#8220;customer property&#8221; to Lion Global, a Singapore-based asset
management company; Quilvest Finance Ltd., a unit of Luxembourg-
based investor Quilvest SA; and five other entities, according
to filings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven complaints filed yesterday seek at least $172.8
million for investors in Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. Picard demanded
$11.5 million from First Gulf Bank PJSC, the United Arab
Emirates lender owned by Abu Dhabi&#8217;s ruling family. Picard said
he has the authority to take back the transfers as he works to
recover money for Madoff customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee last month lost the right to claim almost $9
billion in damages from HSBC Holdings Plc and feeder funds after
a ruling by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who said Picard was
free to pursue bankruptcy claims. Madoff is serving a 150-year
sentence in a prison in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard is seeking at least $50.6 million from Lion Global,
according to the filing. Lion Global&#8217;s lawyers are looking into
the lawsuit, Mae Wong, a spokeswoman for the Singapore firm,
said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lion Global, through its joint venture with Fairfield
Greenwich Group, had sold about $45 million of the feeder fund
to investors, according to a December 2008 Singapore regulatory
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to Quilvest USA in New York seeking comment on the
lawsuit after regular business hours wasn&#8217;t returned. A call to
First Gulf Bank wasn&#8217;t answered after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Lion Global, 11-2540, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former News of the World Reporter Said to Be Arrested &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Desborough, a former Hollywood reporter for the now-
shuttered News of the World newspaper, was arrested by London
police investigating phone-hacking, according to a person
familiar with the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desborough, 38, is the 13th person detained since police
renewed a probe this year to determine if the practice extended
beyond a former royal reporter and a private investigator who
were jailed in 2007 for intercepting voice mails. Desborough
started at the tabloid in 2005 and began a role as an editor in
the U.S. in April 2009, according to the person, who didn&#8217;t want
to be identified because they weren&#8217;t authorized to discuss the
matter publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London&#8217;s Metropolitan Police said in an e-mailed statement
that they arrested a 38-year-old man, who they declined to
identify, by appointment yesterday &#8220;on suspicion of conspiring
to unlawfully intercept voice mails.&#8221; A separate statement said
the man was later released on bail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public outcry over the hacking scandal, including claims
journalists accessed the voice mail of a murdered schoolgirl for
stories, led News Corp. (NWSA) to close the News of the World and end
its 7.8 billion-pound ($12.9 billion) bid to buy the 61 percent
of British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc it doesn&#8217;t already own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are fully cooperating with the police investigation
and we are unable to comment further on matters due to ongoing
police investigations,&#8221; News International, the New York-based
company&#8217;s U.K. newspapers unit, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to find contact details for Desborough or a lawyer
representing him were unsuccessful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mulcaire, Investigator Jailed for Hacking, Sues News Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator jailed in 2007 for
intercepting voice-mail messages left for model Elle Macpherson
and members of the British royal family while working for News
Corp.&#8217;s News of the World tabloid, sued the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit against News Group Newspapers Ltd., which
publishes the Sun newspaper and formerly the News of the World,
was filed at a London court Aug. 17. Mulcaire is a key figure in
the phone-hacking scandal that prompted the closure of the 168-
year-old tabloid last month after revelations that journalists
had hacked the phone of a murdered schoolgirl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of Mulcaire&#8217;s case aren&#8217;t publicly available
under British law until News Group files a response to the court
acknowledging the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch and his
son James told U.K. lawmakers last month they didn&#8217;t know if the
company was still paying legal fees for Mulcaire. The company
said the next day they would immediately terminate &#8220;any
arrangement&#8221; to pay Mulcaire&#8217;s bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mulcaire&#8217;s lawyer, Sarah Webb, didn&#8217;t immediately respond
to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for News Corp.&#8217;s U.K.
unit said the lawsuit had been received. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mulcaire and News Group are defendants in dozens of civil
lawsuits filed by individuals who claim their voice mails were
accessed. London&#8217;s Metropolitan Police are examining Mulcaire&#8217;s
notebooks and contacting possible victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Glenn Michael Mulcaire v. News Group Newspapers
Ltd., 11-2867, High Court of Justice, Chancery Division
(London). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Sues Interior Department Over Canceled Gulf Leases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) sued the U.S. Interior Department, asking
a judge to set aside the agency&#8217;s decision to cancel offshore
leases that may yield &#8220;billions of barrels of oil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department overstepped its authority in a ruling on
Gulf of Mexico leases for the so-called Julia Unit, Exxon Mobil
said in a complaint filed Aug. 12 in federal court in Lake
Charles, Louisiana. Statoil ASA (STL), a partner of Exxon Mobil&#8217;s in
the Julia fields, filed a similar lawsuit in the same court on
Aug. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Interior decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse
of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law,&#8221; and &#8220;deprives
Exxon Mobil of property without due process of law,&#8221; the
Irving, Texas-based company said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded oil
company, said federal regulations allow oil producers to suspend
production in their fields, partly &#8220;to facilitate proper
development of a lease.&#8221; Because of drilling complexity, Exxon
Mobil said, it asked for a suspension for Julia in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Interior Department denied the request in 2009, stating
that the company &#8220;had not demonstrated a commitment to
production,&#8221; according to court papers. Unsuccessful appeals
followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Interior Department is reviewing the Exxon Mobil
complaint, Melissa Schwartz, spokeswoman for the department&#8217;s
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement,
said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our priority remains the safe development of the nation&#8217;s
offshore energy resources, which is why we continue to approve
extensions that meet regulatory standards,&#8221; Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama stopped deep-water oil and natural-
gas drilling early last year after a BP Plc (BP/) well blew out off
the Louisiana coast, claiming 11 lives and causing the largest
U.S. oil spill. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the ban in
October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon alleges that the Interior Department canceled the
Julia leases to gain new leases and make more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the agency&#8217;s decision stands, Exxon Mobil and Statoil
will &#8220;lose the enormous value of those leases and their
hundreds of millions of dollars in investments,&#8221; Statoil said
in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Salazar, 11CV1474, U.S.
District Court, Western District of Louisiana (Lake Charles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitro Units Sued by Bond Trustee Over $1.35 Billion in Notes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Units of Vitro SAB, the Mexican glassmaker that defaulted
in 2009, were sued by a bondholder trustee seeking to recover
$1.35 billion owed under notes issued by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitro and its subsidiaries are engaged in a &#8220;a multi-year
scheme&#8221; to avoid paying bondholders, Wilmington Trust NA, the
trustee under two series of notes issued by Vitro and guaranteed
by the units, said in a complaint filed Aug. 17 in New York
state court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitro in 2009 defaulted on $1.5 billion in debt, including
$1.2 billion of bonds, after the recession cut demand for
construction and auto glass. Bondholders have been fighting the
company&#8217;s debt-restructuring efforts in the U.S. and Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberto Riva Palacio, a Vitro spokesman, declined to
comment about the lawsuit because the company hadn&#8217;t been
notified. Company officials &#8220;will continue to maintain our
openness to dialogue&#8221; with creditors, he said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wilmington Trust NA v. Vitro Automotriz,
652303-2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Moscow Ex-CEO Claims $4.8 Million for Contract Breach &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Moscow&#8217;s former Chief Executive Officer Andrei
Borodin is suing the lender for breach of his labor contract,
seeking more than 140 million rubles ($4.8 million), his lawyer
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borodin, who headed the bank before a takeover by VTB
Group, Russia&#8217;s second-largest lender, is claiming unpaid salary
plus interest, Mikhail Dolomanov said yesterday by phone. A
hearing at Moscow&#8217;s Meshchansky Court is scheduled for Sept. 5,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Moscow was granted a record bailout of 395 billion
rubles ($14 billion) as bad debt uncovered after its acquisition
by VTB threatened to topple Russia&#8217;s fifth-biggest lender.
Russia has issued an international arrest warrant for Borodin on
suspicion of abusing his authority in connection with a 12.8
billion-ruble corporate loan granted in 2009. He denies any
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Moscow has conducted an investigation to determine
whether Borodin&#8217;s contract complied with Russian law, and the
findings have been sent to the Interior Ministry&#8217;s investigative
committee, the lender said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds from the loan ended up in the personal account of
Yelena Baturina, wife of ousted Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, the
Interior Ministry said Feb. 17 after police raided Baturina&#8217;s
company, ZAO Inteco. The Moscow government held a controlling
stake in Bank of Moscow that was acquired by state-run VTB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gennady Terebkov, a spokesman for Inteco, said April 6 that
he doesn&#8217;t expect a criminal case to be opened against Baturina
because she hasn&#8217;t done anything wrong. The loan to Baturina is
being repaid on schedule, Dolomanov said last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Lehman Brothers Managing Director Gets Pretrial Diversion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) managing director
Bradley H. Jack, who was arrested in June for prescription
forgery, got court approval to enter a pretrial diversion
program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superior Court Judge Earl B. Richards III in Bridgeport,
Connecticut, approved Jack&#8217;s request to enter so-called
accelerated rehabilitation, a program that is available to
people charged with less-serious crimes that might result in
prison time. People charged with more serious felonies, those
with prior convictions and those who previously have used
diversion programs aren&#8217;t eligible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack, 52, of Westport, Connecticut, was arrested on June 24
after he allegedly tried to pass forged prescriptions for 12
pills of the painkiller Oxycontin and nine of Ritalin, a drug
used to treat attention deficit disorder, according to
Fairfield, Connecticut, police. Jack has received treatment for
cancer, has had a valid prescription in the past, and has no
prior criminal record, his attorney, Robert G. Golger, said in
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s regrettable, but he&#8217;s a man of good character,&#8221;
Golger told the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack is charged with second-degree forgery and attempting
to obtain a controlled substance through forgery or alteration
of a prescription or a written order. The forgery charge, the
more serious, is punishable by as many as five years in prison
and a $5,000 fine. Jack hasn&#8217;t entered a plea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Connecticut v. Jack, F02B-CR11-0258280-S,
Connecticut Superior Court, Fairfield County (Bridgeport). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW Chief Says Gundlach Fired Because Firm Was &#8216;Threatened&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer Marc Stern said he
fired Jeffrey Gundlach in December 2009 because Gundlach was
plotting to take TCW&#8217;s clients and portfolios to his own firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern testified yesterday in the trial that pits Gundlach
and three other former TCW executives against the asset-
management firm. Stern said he made the decision to fire
Gundlach, TCW&#8217;s chief investment officer and head of its fixed-
income group, because the company was being &#8220;threatened&#8221; and
&#8220;in the process of being destroyed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was the most important portfolio manager at the firm,
managing 60 percent of the assets,&#8221; Stern told the jury in
California state court in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW, based in Los Angeles, fired Gundlach, 51, in December
2009 and sued him the following month after more than half of
its fixed-income professionals joined his new firm. TCW, a unit
of Paris-based Societe Generale SA, seeks $375 million in
damages, claiming Gundlach stole its trade secrets, including
client portfolio data, to start DoubleLine Capital LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach, who had worked at TCW for 25 years and who was
named Morningstar&#8217;s Fixed Income Manager of the Year in 2006,
countersued, saying TCW fired him to avoid having to pay
management and performance fees for the distressed-asset funds
his group managed and that went &#8220;through the roof.&#8221; Gundlach
seeks about $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern told the jurors that he had no intention of getting
rid of Gundlach in the summer of 2009, after Stern had been
asked to return to day-to-day management of TCW. Gundlach and
other group managers at TCW had opposed the return of Stern, who
had retired as president in 2005, and had wanted instead a
management committee to be put in charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be like cutting off your right arm,&#8221; Stern said
under questioning by TCW lawyer John Quinn. &#8220;He was the most
important person at the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach&#8217;s fixed-income group managed more than half of
TCW&#8217;s $110 billion assets under management. He has denied that
he wanted to leave TCW and testified that he only started to
make plans to set up his own company, including registering a
shell company in Delaware and looking for office space, in late
2009 because he was afraid he was getting fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern testified that his &#8220;single most important concern&#8221;
when he returned to TCW in June 2009 was whether Gundlach was
committed to staying at the company. Gundlach was an at-will
employee without a signed contract in 2009 and had been in talks
with a rival asset manager earlier that year, Stern said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern is expected to continue his testimony when the trial
resumes Aug. 24. He hasn&#8217;t yet been cross-examined by
DoubleLine&#8217;s lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Gundlach, BC429385,
California Superior Court, Los Angeles County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Faces Second Trial Over Hepatitis Cases Linked to Drug &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), the world&#8217;s biggest
generic-drug maker, sold the anesthetic propofol in a way that
led some patients to develop hepatitis C, a lawyer said at the
start of a second trial over the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Eglet, a lawyer for three Las Vegas residents who
claim they were diagnosed with hepatitis after receiving
propofol from tainted vials during colonoscopies, told jurors in
opening statements yesterday that officials of Teva, along with
drug distributors Baxter International Inc. (BAX) and McKesson Corp. (MCK),
knew sales of large vials of the drug could help spread blood-
borne diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies &#8220;made billions of dollars in profits at the
expense of patient safety,&#8221; Eglet said in Nevada state court in
Las Vegas. The trial of the first case against Teva and Baxter
last year resulted in a verdict of more than $500 million
against the drugmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva faces almost 300 lawsuits stemming from a hepatitis C
outbreak three years ago in southern Nevada, the Petach Tikva,
Israel-based company said in a regulatory filing last month.
Nevada health officials blamed the reuse of propofol vials for
infecting patients with the incurable liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva manufactures the drug and San Francisco-based McKesson
is its current U.S. distributor. Baxter, based in Deerfield,
Illinois, sold the drug for Teva until 2009, according to court
filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case that began yesterday, Anne Arnold, Richard
Sacks and Anthony Devito contend Teva&#8217;s 50-milliliter propofol
containers aren&#8217;t designed as single-use vials and the drugmaker
didn&#8217;t properly warn doctors about the dangers of &#8220;double
dipping&#8221; into the anesthetic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are confident that if the jury gets to hear all of the
evidence, they will correctly determine that the drug-product
defendants were in no way responsible for the tragic hepatitis
outbreak that occurred in Las Vegas,&#8221; Denise Bradley, a U.S.
spokeswoman for Teva, said Aug. 12 in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deborah Spak, a spokeswoman for Baxter, said Aug. 11 the
company declined to comment on the suit because Teva accepted
liability for all of the cases stemming from the 2008 hepatitis
outbreak involving propofol. Megan Hawkins, a spokeswoman for
McKesson, said Aug. 12 that the company doesn&#8217;t comment on
pending litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sacks v. Endoscopy Center of Southern Nevada
LLC, 08A572315, District Court for Clark County, Nevada (Las
Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank Faces Breuer Trial in Kirch Litigation Legacy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leo Kirch&#8217;s death a month ago hasn&#8217;t laid to rest his legal
fight with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and its former chief, Rolf Breuer.
The man Kirch blamed for the downfall of his media group faces
claims he lied to judges in a trial that began yesterday and was
adjourned only shortly after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Munich trial, whose start was delayed an hour because a
stand-in lay judge arrived late, was paused after Breuer&#8217;s
defense asked for more time to review the bench&#8217;s composition. A
resumption of the trial isn&#8217;t expected before the end of
October, the court said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It turned out that we wouldn&#8217;t be able to hold hearings
for another seven weeks,&#8221; said Presiding Judge Anton Winkler.
&#8220;We decided to restart the trial with newly chosen lay judges
in due course.&#8221; In some criminal cases in Germany, lay judges
hear cases together with professional judges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial is part of a nine-year fight over comments Breuer
made to Bloomberg TV in 2002 about how creditworthy Kirch&#8217;s
media group was. Kirch, once one of Germany&#8217;s biggest media
tycoons, claimed Breuer&#8217;s remarks precipitated the company&#8217;s
bankruptcy and filed claims totaling at least 3.3 billion euros
($4.8 billion). These suits continue in spite of Kirch&#8217;s death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, while not a party in the criminal case,
could see its image affected by the trial in which its former
chief executive officer faces charges of attempted fraud, said
Stephan Holzinger, a litigation media adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank and Breuer, who both rejected a 775 million-euro
settlement over the civil litigation proposed by a judge in
March, deny any wrongdoing. Sven Thomas, Breuer&#8217;s lawyer, told
reporters before the trial started that he is expecting an
acquittal. Prosecutors claim Breuer lied to judges in 2003 to
avoid losing a civil damages lawsuit Kirch brought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal trial is the result of Kirch&#8217;s attempt to draw
attention away from his own responsibility for the failure of
his enterprise, Christian Streckert, a Deutsche Bank spokesman,
said Aug. 17. Breuer has said his televised remarks were based
on media reports, not internal bank analysis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China Minmetals, Sinosteel Price-Fixing Lawsuit Revived &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Minmetals Corp., China&#8217;s biggest state-owned metals
trader, and Sinosteel Corp. must face claims they conspired to
fix the price of magnesite sold in the U.S., a federal appeals
court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia reversed Aug. 17
a lower-court decision dismissing the lawsuit. The lower court
erred in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to decide the
dispute based on a federal statute, the appeals panel said,
remanding the case for further proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal Science Products Inc. and Resco Products Inc., U.S.
buyers of magnesite, sued 17 Chinese companies in 2005 claiming
they conspired since at least April 2000 to fix the price of the
metal exported and sold in the U.S. Magnesite is mined from
magnesium deposits and used to melt steel, clean wastewater and
make cement, the appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals case involves only the China Minmetals and
Sinosteel defendants, who had argued that the dispute should be
arbitrated in China, according to court papers. Sinosteel is
China&#8217;s biggest iron-ore trader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan S. Caplan, an attorney for Sinosteel, didn&#8217;t
return a phone call and e-mail seeking comment on the appeals
court ruling. Shepard Goldfein, an attorney for China Minmetals,

&lt;p&gt;Californians Can&#8217;t Claim Billed Costs in Injury Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Californians suing over personal injuries can only seek
damages for actual, rather than billed, medical expenses, the
state&#8217;s high court said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing plaintiffs to recover billed medical costs rather
than the lower fees from negotiated rates between health
providers and insurers could have cost insurance companies
billions of dollars and driven up insurance rates for consumers,
Allstate Insurance Co. said in court filing in the case. The
company wasn&#8217;t a party in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is one of the biggest issues to hit California
consumers in years, and few people were aware&#8221; of the case,
said Robert Tyson, an attorney for Hamilton Meats  Provisions
Inc., the defendant in the lawsuit decided yesterday. &#8220;Rates
for insurance were going to go up if the court had ruled the
other way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Howell sued Hamilton Meats after she was seriously
injured in a car accident with a company driver. A trial court
reduced her damages to the amount actually paid by her medical
care providers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state appeals court in San Diego reversed the ruling,
saying it violated a legal rule that disallows reducing damages
for compensation a plaintiff has received from sources other
than the defendant. Hamilton Meats appealed and insurance groups
and companies including Allstate sought reversal of the appeals
court ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ruling drastically rewrites a century of California
law that says plaintiffs can recover the reasonable value of
their damages,&#8221; Gary Sims, an attorney for Howell, said in a
phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was sent back to the appeals court for further
proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Howell v. Hamilton Meats, S179115, California
Supreme Court (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davis Polk Hires Former Federal Trade Commission Economist &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP said Howard A. Shelanski, a
former deputy director at the Federal Trade Commission, joined
the law firm&#8217;s Washington office to strengthen its antitrust and
regulatory business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelanski, 47, was a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley from 1997 to 2009, where he co-directed
the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology from 2000 to 2008,
Davis Polk said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also served as chief economist at the Federal
Communications Commission from 1999 to 2000, and from 1998 to
1999 was a senior economist to the President&#8217;s Council of
Economic Advisers, Davis Polk said. He was deputy director of
the FTC&#8217;s Bureau of Economics from 2009 until this year, where
he was responsible for the antitrust portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelanski has also practiced law in Washington and served
as a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia,
Davis Polk said. He earned his law degree and his doctorate in
economics at Berkeley and his bachelor&#8217;s degree at Haverford
College outside Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelanski will continue to teach at Georgetown University&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy may expand less
than previously thought in the next two quarters as consumer
sentiment drops and the housing market fails to gain momentum,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product will grow 1 percent in the fourth
quarter rather than the 2.5 percent previously forecast and 0.5
percent in the first quarter of 2012 instead of 1.5 percent,
Michael Feroli, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief U.S. economist in New York,
said in an e-mailed note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global stocks dropped today, European shares suffered their
biggest two-day slump since 2008 and oil sank below $80 a barrel
on concern the U.S. recovery is faltering and Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis will worsen. Morgan Stanley earlier this week cut its
forecast for global growth in 2011, and Citigroup Inc. lowered
estimates for the world&#8217;s largest economy in a note dated
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Growth in the current quarter looks only moderately
softer than our previous projection,&#8221; Feroli said in today&#8217;s
note. &#8220;Global growth has disappointed and foreign growth
forecasts have been taken lower. Risks of a recession are
clearly elevated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roche Holding AG (ROG) may get the first
signs at a cardiology conference this month that the Swiss
drugmaker can garner $6.8 billion in sales with a pill to combat
heart disease by raising so-called good cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug, dalcetrapib, may reap that much in annual revenue
by 2020 if it works in patients who have had heart attacks,
estimates Gbola Amusa, a UBS AG analyst in London. He gives the
pill a one-in-four chance of succeeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s by no means a sure thing. Basel, Switzerland-based
Roche, known for cancer medicines such as Avastin and Herceptin,
is venturing into a new area. The basic concept was dealt a
setback in May when a study found an Abbott Laboratories (ABT) drug to
raise good cholesterol didn&#8217;t prevent heart attacks. Pfizer Inc. (PFE)
had to scrap its version in 2006 after patients died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s excitement,&#8221; said Chris Cannon, a cardiologist
at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital in Boston, in a telephone
interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been thinking about this for decades. On the
other hand, there&#8217;s renewed caution and realization that it&#8217;s
hard to make things work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roche will present results at the European Society of
Cardiology conference in Paris from a pair of trials that look
at the drug&#8217;s effect on blood vessel function and see whether it
can shrink artery-clogging plaque. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called dal-Vessel and dal-Plaque, respectively, the two
trials won&#8217;t answer the more pressing question of whether
Roche&#8217;s drug helps keep patients alive and blocks heart attacks
and strokes, Cannon said. That&#8217;s being addressed in a bigger
study known as dal-Outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results in 2012 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim results from the 15,800-patient trial are expected
early next year, with a first set of final results by December
2012, Pascal Soriot, Roche&#8217;s pharmaceutical unit head, said in a
conference call with analysts on July 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Cannon said, &#8220;if plaque shrinks, that is a huge win
and very exciting, and everyone is going to be jumping up and
down saying, &#8216;Hurray, this class works.&#8217;&#8221; An abstract of data
for the dal-Plaque study is scheduled to be posted on the
conference website tomorrow. Dal-Vessel is due to be presented
in an oral session on Aug. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY), based in Indianapolis, and Merck  Co. of
New York have similar drugs in development aimed at increasing
good cholesterol, or HDL, in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HDL flushes fat deposits from arteries to the liver to be
eliminated from the body. By contrast, statins such as
simvastatin and Pfizer&#8217;s Lipitor, the best-selling drug in the
world, decrease levels of bad cholesterol, or LDL, which blocks
arteries and leads to heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple Blockbusters &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If both smaller Roche dalcetrapib trials are successful,
they could increase the probability of success in the larger
study, UBS&#8217;s Amusa said in a telephone interview. If the best
case occurs, and HDL-raising drugs prove as successful as
statins in larger studies, the market could rival the size of
that for cholesterol-lowering medicines and produce multiple
drugs with sales of more than $1 billion a year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult for this drug to be anything but
either an outright failure or a mega-blockbuster,&#8221; he said. He
has a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on Roche&#8217;s shares. Peak sales may be
higher than his forecast if the medicine sees use in the bigger
pool of high-risk patients who haven&#8217;t had a heart attack yet,
Amusa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest is higher in this month&#8217;s results from the smaller
trials because of the Pfizer history, Roche Chief Executive
Officer Severin Schwan said in an interview at the company&#8217;s
headquarters in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Rewriting the Textbooks&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a high-risk project, because what we want to know is
that HDL has a positive effect,&#8221; Schwan said. &#8220;Nobody has
proven this yet. I always say dalcetrapib is the biggest proof-
of-concept study we ever did.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a conference call with analysts in 2010, Schwan said the
drug had the potential of &#8220;rewriting the textbooks in
cardiovascular medicine&#8221; and named the pill among a group of
medicines with potential for more than 5 billion francs ($6.3
billion) in sales, according to the call transcript. He declined
in July to elaborate on the sales potential for the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roche may have good reason to be cautious. Pfizer abandoned
its pill to raise HDL, torcetrapib, five years ago after it
unexpectedly raised increased death rates even as it raised
levels of good cholesterol. The New York drugmaker had invested
$1 billion in the drug to stem the loss of revenue when Lipitor
loses patent protection this year. Since then Pfizer has cut
jobs, closed research labs and bought Wyeth for $68 billion in
2009 to help plug the gap to be left by Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Real Concern&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roche decided to continue with dalcetrapib after Pfizer&#8217;s
failure because of experiments showing the two drugs don&#8217;t work
the same way and don&#8217;t share the same toxicity, Alexander Klauser, a spokesman for Roche, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Step one with your drug is to make sure it doesn&#8217;t kill
anyone, and with this class, given the experience with
torcetrapib, safety&#8217;s been a real concern,&#8221; said Jack Scannell,
a London-based analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in May the National Institutes of Health stopped
a study of another HDL-raising drug, Abbott&#8217;s Niaspan, after it
was linked to strokes and failed to reduce heart attacks.
Niaspan works to raise good cholesterol in a different way than
the Roche and Merck drugs, and it has different side effects,
said Graeme Green, a London-based analyst for Decision
Resources, in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roche helped alleviate some concerns by saying in July that
the Outcomes trial had continued after an initial interim safety
analysis had been completed, Bernstein&#8217;s Scannell said. He rates
Roche shares &#8220;market perform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck&#8217;s Drug &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon, the Brigham and Women&#8217;s cardiologist, agreed. The
dalcetrapib trial set some safety concerns to rest by
progressing further than Illuminate, the torcetrapib trial
Pfizer had to abandon in 2006, he said. Cannon is involved in
studies of Merck&#8217;s good-cholesterol pill anacetrapib. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study presented in November at the American Heart
Association meeting in Chicago showed the Merck drug raised HDL,
lowered LDL and left patients with fewer heart complications.
The study numbers were small though, with just 1,623 patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors have &#8220;great hope, but we simply have to wait and
see what the trials show,&#8221; Cannon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many drugs have looked good in earlier trials and then
failed in the final studies needed to get approval, said Steven Nissen, the Cleveland Clinic head of cardiology who helped test
Pfizer&#8217;s unsuccessful good-cholesterol pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The graveyard of drugs is littered with examples,&#8221; said
Nissen, who&#8217;s now working on Lilly&#8217;s HDL drug. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Vice President Joe Biden met
with about 20 U.S. and Chinese business leaders in Beijing today,
including Coca-Cola Co. (KO) Chief Executive Muhtar Kent, to discuss
how to improve economic relations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies in China say their profits are growing and
that the issue captivating political debate in Washington over
the value of the Chinese currency isn&#8217;t as important as market
access and a level playing field. Almost one in five respondents
in an American Chamber of Commerce survey published in March
said the biggest risk they faced was a stronger yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our members do not think currency is the top issue in our
relationship,&#8221; said Erin Ennis, vice president of the U.S.-
China Business Council. Bigger concerns are &#8220;level-playing
field issues,&#8221; like opening up the Chinese market to U.S.
exports and protecting intellectual property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden told Vice President Xi Jinping in a private meeting
yesterday that China must address its undervalued exchange rate
and remove import barriers so that the U.S. can continue an open
trade and investment relationship, according to administration
officials who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our exports to china have been increasing even as we&#8217;ve
been growing our business inside China,&#8221; Caterpillar Inc.
President Richard Lavin, who was at today''s meeting, said in an 
interview last week. Still, Lavin said he&#8217;s concerned that Chinese
competitors are given access to U.S. markets while U.S. 
corporations face challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lavin said the company is growing &#8220;aggressively&#8221; in China.
The Peoria, Illinois-based company, the world&#8217;s largest
construction- and mining-equipment maker, posted increased
profits and sales in the second quarter, largely due to growth
overseas, the company said July 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caterpillar&#8217;s revenue from China almost doubled last year
to $3.3 billion from $1.9 billion in 2009. The company and its
dealers have almost 20,000 Chinese employees in China working at
16 manufacturing facilities and the company is either breaking
ground or has already started construction on almost half a
dozen more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With elections looming next year, President Barack Obama is
under pressure at home to keep pushing the Chinese to raise the
value of their currency to damp imports and make U.S. exports to
China more competitive. China&#8217;s trade surplus surged to $31.5
billion in July as exports rose to a record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trade deficit with China continues to leap so it&#8217;s
definitely not a problem that is fixing itself,&#8221; said Thea Lee,
deputy chief of staff at the AFL-CIO, the largest U.S. labor
union. &#8220;With the economy in dire need of jobs&#8221; getting China
to revalue the yuan could &#8220;create potentially millions of jobs
in a very short period of time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuan Revalued &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a June study by the Washington-based Economic
Policy Institute, which looks at issues affecting low- and
middle-income workers, if the yuan and satellite currencies were
revalued to their equilibrium levels, U.S. gross domestic
product would grow as much as 1.9 percent and as many as 2.25
million U.S. jobs would be created. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protection of intellectual property will be another issue
facing U.S. business that will be raised in the meeting, said
Tony Su, corporate vice president and president of DuPont
Greater China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a rising concern about IP protection,&#8221; Su said,
adding that it is an especially important consideration for his
company, the biggest U.S. chemicals maker by market value and
second-biggest seed producer in the world. &#8220;The government can
be an example to industry that stealing technology will be
punished by law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales and profit for most European and U.S. businesses
operating in China rose last year, according to surveys
published earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlanta-based Coca-Cola yesterday announced plans to invest
$4 billion in the world&#8217;s fastest growing economy over three
years from 2012. First-half sales in China were running at
double the rate of 2010, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy-eight percent of EU companies said they had a
&#8220;significant rise&#8221; in sales last year, compared with 50
percent in 2009, according to a survey of 598 EU companies doing
business in China published in May. Seventy-one percent said
they reported higher profit in China last year, up from 43
percent a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance and perception of EU companies dovetails
with that of U.S. businesses in China. In a report released in
March, more U.S. businesses said they were profitable last year
even as they became increasingly pessimistic about the Chinese
government&#8217;s commitment to improving market access, the American
Chamber of Commerce in China said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very Profitable &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy-eight percent of member companies surveyed by
AmCham said their China operations in 2010 were very profitable
or profitable, the highest proportion in survey results dating
back to 2002, the Beijing-based chamber said in its annual
business climate survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For U.S. companies doing business in China and exporting
their products, yuan appreciation can hurt their sales. The
AmCham China survey of its members found that 17 percent said
yuan appreciation was the greatest risk facing its organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the U.S. and EU chambers said the biggest challenge to
doing business in China was concern that the regulatory
environment was increasingly arrayed against them in favor of
state-owned Chinese companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU companies believe that China&#8217;s government is
increasingly discriminating against foreign-invested companies,
according to the survey. Forty-six percent expect China&#8217;s
government to have policies that discriminate against foreign
companies in the next two years, up from 36 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licensing Process &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the AmCham survey, seventy-one percent of the
respondents said China&#8217;s business licensing process
discriminates against foreign companies, according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a list released by the White House the
following representatives from U.S. companies are attending
today&#8217;s meeting in Beijing: President and CEO General Electric
Co. Greater China Mark Hutchinson; JP Morgan Chase  Co.
Chairman and CEO for China Zili Shao; President for Dupont China
Tony Su; General Motors China Inc. President and Managing
Director Kevin Wale; Group President Caterpillar Inc. Richard
Lavin; CEO Corning Inc. China Eric Musser; Founder/Executive
Chairman of Acorn International Inc. Robert Roche; CEO Chindex
International Inc. and Chairman of the Board of United Family
Hospitals Roberta Lipson and Chairman of Board of Governors of
AmCham China Ted Dean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Biden had private meetings and a dinner in his
honor hosted Xi. Later today, he&#8217;ll meet with Premier Wen Jiabao
and President Hu Jintao. The administration says the primary
purpose of the visit is for Biden to get to know Xi, who is
expected to become the next president of China in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A one-atom-thick layer of carbon may
one day help International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and the U.S.
military build more precise radar and computers that operate at
near the speed of light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicists Konstantin Novoselov, 36, and Andre Geim, 52, at
the University of Manchester in the U.K., have found a way to
manipulate how graphene, the thinnest and toughest material ever
produced, conducts electricity, a breakthrough that opens the
door to its use in digital electronics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because graphene conducts electricity 30 times faster than
silicon -- approaching the speed of light, according to the
researchers -- the finding may be used by companies such as IBM
to speed up computers. The material was first isolated by the
two Russian-born scientists in 2004, and they were awarded a
Nobel Prize last year. The latest research was published last
week in the journal Science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve observed a phenomenon that was unattainable
previously,&#8221; said Yu-Ming Lin, an IBM researcher who developed
the first integrated circuit from wafer-size graphene in June.
The Armonk, New York-based company, which funded the study along
with Samsung Electronics Co. and the U.S. Air Force and Navy,
will now consider how to use graphene in semiconductors and
computers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, use of graphene was limited to development
of more-efficient batteries and foldable touch screens, items
that didn&#8217;t require scientists to be able to stop and start the
movement of electrons in the material. Novoselov and Geim were
able to control the current by suspending two layers of graphene
in a vacuum, reordering the electronic structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;New-Type Transistors&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding may lead to &#8220;completely new types of
transistors,&#8221; Novoselov said in a telephone interview. &#8220;You
can probably start using it for computer chips, but we believe
we have something different, bigger here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding is &#8220;bringing people&#8217;s attention back to
graphene,&#8221; and spurring a new look at whether the material &#8220;is
usable in digital widgets,&#8221; IBM&#8217;s Lin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international market for graphene-based products may
reach $675 million by 2020, Wellesley, Massachusetts-based BCC
Research LLC estimated in February, when the material&#8217;s use as a
semiconductor was considered impossible. If the new research
leads to semiconductor devices, graphene would be entering what
the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association said was
a $298.3 billion industry worldwide in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Within the next couple years you will hear a lot about
transistors based on bilayer graphene,&#8221; Geim said in an e-mail.
&#8220;It will be a very long road to graphene integrated circuits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile Phones, Radar &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense&#8217;s Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, is researching the material&#8217;s
ability to create more-efficient mobile phones, clearer wireless
signals, and better radar, Lin said. The material&#8217;s magnetic
traits may also enable IBM to utilize high frequency waves for
medical devices that would spot diseases early on, Lin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novoselov and Geim are part of a $1.4 billion effort put
together by nine European organizations, including the
University of Cambridge and Finland-based Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), to research
graphene. Geim and Novoselov discovered graphene by extracting
the material from a piece of graphite such as is found in
ordinary pencils, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said
last year when announcing the scientists won the Nobel in
Physics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia Research &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia, the world&#8217;s largest maker of mobile phones by
volume, is investigating the material&#8217;s potential use in cell
phones, touch screens, and printed electronics. Graphene as a
cheap replacement for current touch screen technology is right
around the corner, said Jani Kivioja, a research leader at Nokia
whose team develops graphene&#8217;s electronic sensing ability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and other employees hired
attorneys this year when the U.S. began a probe of matters
raised by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Eric H. Holder said on May 3 that the
Justice Department was reviewing an April report on the
financial crisis by the Permanent Subcommittee, led by Carl M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat, and Thomas A. Coburn, Republican of
Oklahoma. The report accused Goldman Sachs of misleading clients
about complex mortgage-related investments in 2007, and Levin
alleged that Blankfein misled Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other
individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection
with the Justice Department&#8217;s inquiry into certain matters
raised in the PSI report hired counsel at the outset,&#8221; the
company said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell 4.7 percent in New York trading on
concern that Blankfein&#8217;s hiring of a criminal defense attorney
could mean the firm will face more legal woes. He has been
represented by Reid H. Weingarten, a partner at Steptoe 
Johnson LLP in Washington, since the Justice Department inquiry
began, according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weingarten is a friend of Holder&#8217;s, with whom he helped
found the nonprofit See Forever Foundation, according to
Weingarten&#8217;s biography on Steptoe  Johnson&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street&#8217;s Role &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 56, hasn&#8217;t been charged with wrongdoing amid
federal probes of Wall Street&#8217;s role in the housing boom and
credit crisis. Goldman Sachs is paying Blankfein&#8217;s legal costs,
according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has said the testimony its employees gave to
the Permanent Subcommittee &#8220;was truthful and accurate and this
is confirmed by the subcommittee&#8217;s own report.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported yesterday that Blankfein had hired
Weingarten, citing an unidentified government source. The report
contributed to the decline in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock, which
closed at $106.51 on the New York Stock Exchange and has dropped
37 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that the attorney was hired months ago rather
than recently moderates the impact and implications of the
story,&#8221; William Tanona, an analyst at UBS AG who has a &#8220;buy&#8221;
rating on the stock, wrote in a note yesterday. Still &#8220;these
continued distractions increase the probability of a management
reshuffle over the next few years, which will undoubtedly cause
some investor angst.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built a Reputation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weingarten won the acquittal in May of Lauren Stevens, a
former GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) attorney accused of impeding a U.S.
Food and Drug Administration investigation. He also represented
Elizabeth Monrad, the former chief financial officer at General
Reinsurance Corp. who was convicted in an accounting fraud
scandal. She won a retrial earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weingarten previously represented former WorldCom CEO
Bernard Ebbers, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison after he
was convicted of an $11 billion fraud. He defended former Enron
Chief Accounting Officer Richard Causey, who was sentenced to 5
1/2 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alisa Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment. Weingarten didn&#8217;t respond to e-mail and phone
messages requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
subpoenaed earlier this year by the Manhattan District
Attorney&#8217;s office for information related to the Permanent
Subcommittee&#8217;s report, a person familiar with the matter said in
early June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investor confidence in U.S.
corporate credit deteriorated to the worst level since June 2010
and the cost to protect Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) debt jumped
following a report that Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
hired a defense attorney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 4 basis points to a
mid-price of 126.8 basis points as of 5:35 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. Credit-
default swaps on Goldman Sachs jumped 40 basis points to 255.4
basis points, the highest level since April 2009, according to
data provider CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders earlier pushed down the benchmark gauge of
investment-grade debt risk, which typically falls when investor
confidence improves and rises when it deteriorates, before the
Federal Reserve holds its annual symposium in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming this weekend. The index reversed as credit risk at
finance companies including Bank of America Corp. (BAC) gained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Monday saw a tug-o-war of themes that pitted financial
sector concerns against bullish sentiment tied to speculation
Bernanke&#8217;s speech on Friday will deliver a message of further
stimulus,&#8221; Adrian Miller, fixed-income strategist at Miller
Tabak Roberts Securities LLC in New York, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index has soared from 96.3 at the end of July as
investor concern mounted that the global economic recovery is
slowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said Blankfein and other people hired
attorneys in relation to a U.S. probe of matters raised by the
Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Department &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other
individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection
with the Justice Department&#8217;s inquiry into certain matters
raised in the PSI report hired counsel at the outset,&#8221; the New
York-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts linked to the debt of Bank of America, based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, added 38.6 basis points to 380.6, the
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor confidence in high-yield, high-risk debt plunged
for a third day to the lowest level in almost two years. The
Markit CDX North America High Yield Index, which falls as
investor confidence deteriorates, dropped 0.6 percentage point
to 91.8 percent of face value, the lowest level since Sept. 10,
2009. High-yield, high-risk bonds and loans are rated below Baa3
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and lower than BBB- by SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, fell 4.7 percent after Reuters
reported that Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein hired
defense lawyer Reid Weingarten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares fell $5.25 to $106.51 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Reuters, citing an
unidentified government official, didn&#8217;t specify when or why
Blankfein hired Weingarten, a Steptoe  Johnson LLP partner

&lt;p&gt;Blankfein hasn&#8217;t been charged with wrongdoing amid federal

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, began arguing its U.S. trade case that Android-
based smartphones made by Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. use
technology derived from Microsoft inventions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a trial that began today before the International Trade
Commission in Washington, Microsoft accused Motorola Mobility of
infringing seven of its patents and requested a halt to imports
of certain Motorola phones. The ITC has the power to stop
imports of products that violate U.S. patent rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is the first smartphone dispute to be heard by the
agency since Google Inc. (GOOG) said Aug. 15 it would buy Motorola
Mobility for $12.5 billion to obtain patents that could be used
as a bulwark against a surge of lawsuits targeting handsets and
tablet computers that use Google&#8217;s Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a responsibility to our employees, customers,
partners and shareholders to safeguard our intellectual
property,&#8221; David Howard, Microsoft&#8217;s corporate vice president
and deputy general counsel for litigation, said in an e-mail.
&#8220;Motorola is infringing our patents and we are confident that
the ITC will rule in our favor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility is &#8220;vigorously defending&#8221; itself
&#8220;against Microsoft&#8217;s patent attack business strategy,&#8221;
Jennifer Erickson, a Motorola Mobility spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail. &#8220;We have also brought legal actions of our own in the
U.S. and in Europe to address Microsoft&#8217;s large scale of
infringement of Motorola Mobility&#8217;s patents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s claim against Libertyville, Illinois-based
Motorola Mobility is one of more than a dozen smartphone cases
before the ITC, as companies seek to use patents to gain a
bigger share of a market projected by researcher IHS Inc. to
reach $206.6 billion this year. Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft makes its own mobile operating system, Windows Phone
7, which competes with Android and Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Android platform accounted for 43.3 percent of the
smartphone market last quarter, according to Stamford,
Connecticut-based research firm Gartner Inc. (IT) Microsoft, with
less than 2 percent of the market, is counting on an agreement
with Espoo, Finland-based Nokia Oyj (NOK) to put Windows Mobile on its
phones to increase market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases brought by Microsoft and Cupertino, California-based
Apple are targeting devices that run on Android. Microsoft,
which contends all Android devices use its technology, also has
a case against Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS), targeting the Nook reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testimony in today&#8217;s Motorola Mobility trial focused on
details about functions that Microsoft calls &#8220;essential to the
smartphone user experience,&#8221; including ways to synchronize e-
mail, calendars and contacts; schedule meetings; and notify
applications of changes in signal strength and battery power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block Imports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has asked the agency to block imports of Motorola
phones including the Droid 2, Droid X, Cliq XT, Devour, Backflip
and Charm. Administrative Law Judge Theodore Essex is scheduled
to release his findings in the case Nov. 4, and the commission
has a target to complete its investigation by March 5, according
to information on the agency&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain View, California-based Google, which wasn&#8217;t named
in the complaint, accused Microsoft of disclosing Google&#8217;s
source code to a Microsoft expert without first letting Google
know. Essex on Aug. 15 denied Google&#8217;s request that sanctions be
imposed on Microsoft, saying Google had failed to provide any
information that it has made a &#8220;reasonable, good-faith effort
to resolve the matter with Microsoft.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Mobile Devices,
Associated Software and Components Thereof, 337-744, U.S.
International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Nigerian unit is
awaiting an arbitration ruling to end its dispute with the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. over &#8220;entitlements to lift
crude oil&#8221; from the Erha offshore field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can confirm that the arbitration hearing ended in
Abuja on March 2,&#8221; Nigel Cookey-Gam, an Exxon spokesman in
Nigeria, said today in an e-mailed statement. The &#8220;parties are
currently awaiting an award by the tribunal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s biggest company, sought arbitration in
2009 after talks with the Nigerian government and the state oil
company, known as NNPC, had &#8220;been unsuccessful,&#8221; the statement
said. There&#8217;s no specific date yet for the ruling, said Cookey-
Gam. Levi Ajuonuma, a NNPC spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Erha field, located about 97 kilometers (60 miles)
offshore Nigeria, started production in 2006 and has the
capacity to pump about 190,000 barrels of crude a day. Exxon
Mobil, operator of the field, holds a 56.25 percent interest and
Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Co., a local unit of
Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), holds 43.75 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s top oil producer, is the fifth-biggest
source of U.S. imports of the fuel. Shell, Exxon, Chevron Corp.,
Total SA and Eni SpA run joint ventures with state-owned NNPC,
which pumps about 90 percent of the country&#8217;s crude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest oil company by market value, estimated the cost to clean
up a July 1 oil spill into the Yellowstone River in Montana will
be $42.6 million, according to a filing with federal regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s emergency response to the spill from the
Silvertip pipeline will cost $40 million and property claims
will be $2.5 million, the company said in a July 29 filing with
the Transportation Department&#8217;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration. Exxon also lost about $100,000 of oil and
other commodities in the spill, according to the document,
obtained by Bloomberg News through a Freedom of Information Act
request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s 69-mile (111-kilometer) Silvertip line spilled an
estimated 1,000 barrels of crude into a flood-swollen
Yellowstone River near Laurel, Montana. The pipeline runs from
Elk Basin, Wyoming to Exxon&#8217;s refinery in Billings, Montana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 people were working to clean up the site as
of Aug. 12, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, which is leading the response effort. Sampling results
for air, water, soil and sediment around the river show &#8220;no
levels of concern&#8221; for water supplies or air quality, the
agency said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lowered its
forecast for U.S. economic growth in 2011 on signs the recovery
in the world&#8217;s largest economy lost momentum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. will expand 1.5 percent this year, down from a
previous forecast of 1.7 percent, Goldman economists in New York
including Jan Hatzius said in a note published on Aug. 19.
Credit Suisse was also among banks lowering growth forecasts this 
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve surveys showed manufacturing in
Philadelphia and New York contracted in August, while a Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment
plunged to a three-decade low. Goldman&#8217;s change comes amid a
monthlong drop in global equities and as Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke prepares to speak at the bank&#8217;s annual symposium in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data &#8220;are pointing to even weaker growth ahead,&#8221; the
economists said. While Bernanke &#8220;is likely to be downbeat about
recent developments, we expect that he will still argue that the
conditions for an acceleration later this year and in 2012
remain in place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman forecasts third-quarter growth of 1 percent and a
fourth-quarter expansion of 1.5 percent, down from an earlier
projection for 2 percent growth in each quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse lowered its forecast for U.S. third-quarter
growth to 1.5 percent from from 3.3 percent, and for the fourth
quarter to 2.2 percent from 3.1 percent, according to a research
note dated Aug. 18. The bank cut its projection for global
growth to 3.9 percent in 2011 from 4.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) predicts 1 percent growth in U.S.
gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, down from an
earlier projection of 2.5 percent, the bank said last week.
Citigroup Inc. (C) lowered its 2011 growth forecast to 1.6 percent
from 1.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SpectraWatt Inc., a closely held
solar cell manufacturer backed by units of Intel Corp. (INTC) and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, the second solar company to do so this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hopewell Junction, New York-based company owes
creditors $38.7 million and plans to auction almost all of its
assets, which it valued at $33.9 million in a filing with the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Poughkeepsie, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpectraWatt was forced to seek protection from creditors
because of competition from Chinese rivals and deteriorating
prices in the solar cell industry, according to the Aug. 19
filing. Evergreen Solar Inc. cited similar reasons for its Aug.
15 bankruptcy filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;United States-based manufacturers are under a great deal
of stress because of the emergence of manufacturers in China,
who receive considerable government and financial support,&#8221;
SpectraWatt&#8217;s Chief Restructuring Officer and Chief Executive
Officer Brad Walker said in the filing. &#8220;This support, coupled
with China&#8217;s inexpensive production costs, have created a
competitive advantage for Chinese manufacturers and allowed them
to become price leaders within the industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Noncompetitive Production&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpectraWatt had a &#8220;noncompetitive production line based in
the U.S., without means to reduce that cost,&#8221;  Edwin Mok, an
analyst for Needham  Co., said today in an e-mail. As solar
prices fell, the company was &#8220;stuck in a situation where there
was nothing else they could do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both SpectraWatt and Evergreen have technology that&#8217;s &#8220;not
competitive, and there was no method to reduce cost to make it
competitive with Asian manufacturers,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices of solar cells dropped by more than a third this
year to 81 cents a watt in July, according to Bloomberg New
Energy Finance&#8217;s monthly spot survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpectraWatt shut down its Hopewell Junction manufacturing
plant in April, dismissing all 117 workers. It relocated its
headquarters there in 2009 from Hillsboro, Oregon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar cell maker also said it had received defective
manufacturing equipment and silicon wafers from vendors, forcing
it to sell finished products at reduced prices that led to
losses, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Failures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has received interest from foreign buyers
though hasn&#8217;t secured a lead bidder for the planned auction
because the potential buyers aren&#8217;t familiar with U.S.
bankruptcy policies, it said. SpectraWatt wants to hold the
auction Sept. 28, before the market is inundated with equipment
from other failing solar companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Within the next three to six months, there is a high
likelihood that a significant amount of used solar cell
manufacturing equipment and related assets will flood the market
and drive down the value of the debtor&#8217;s assets,&#8221; Walker said
in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpectraWatt was spun off from Intel, the world&#8217;s biggest
chipmaker, in June 2008 and raised $50 million by selling
preferred stock to its former parent and other investors
including Goldman&#8217;s Cogentrix Energy LLC, PCG Clean Energy 
Technology Fund LLC and Berlin-based solar panel maker Solon SE (SOO1),
according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evergreen Solar, a rival U.S. solar panel maker, sought
bankruptcy protection last week, owing creditors about $485.6
million. Evergreen&#8217;s convertible noteholders have agreed to buy
the company at auction offering to forgive debt owed to them
instead of cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re SpectraWatt Inc, 11-37366, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Poughkeepsie). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect bonds of U.S.
companies fell from the highest level in 14 months as investor
speculation the Federal Reserve will act to spur the economy
overshadowed concern that banks will be forced to raise capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 1.3 basis points to a
mid-price of 125.5 basis points as of 5:27 p.m. in New York,
Markit Group Ltd. data show. The index earlier jumped as much as
4.9 basis points. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) credit swaps declined
after earlier soaring to a record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate and financial company debt is being whipsawed
before central bankers meet this week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
The credit risk benchmark, which rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, dropped even after a
magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck Virginia and shook buildings in
Washington and New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor confidence in corporate credit decreased earlier
on &#8220;concerns about the sovereign situation, concerns about our
own domestic macro situation,&#8221; John Guarnera, a financial
analyst at Societe Generale SA in New York, said in a telephone
interview. The rise signaled investors were &#8220;ignoring the fact
that the financials are fundamentally better-positioned than
where we were coming out of the credit crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps tied to Bank of America fell 2 basis
points to 378.5 as of 5 p.m. in New York, according to data
provider CMA. That pared an earlier surge to at least 445 basis
points, which exceeded the peak during the financial crisis in
March 2009, JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Irrational&#8217; Valuations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuations are becoming &#8220;irrational,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts
Kabir Caprihan and Matthew Hughart based in New York wrote in
the report. They changed their view on the debt to &#8220;neutral&#8221;
from &#8220;underweight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America credit swaps have more than doubled from
178 basis points at the end of July as concern mounts that the
lender may face larger losses tied to mortgages and will need to
raise additional capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Blodget, the former Internet stock analyst turned
blogger, wrote on Business Insider that charges and loan costs
may force the bank to raise as much as $200 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has &#8220;no reason&#8221; to raise capital, Rochdale
Securities analyst Richard Bove said in an interview today on
Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;InBusiness With Margaret Brennan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bank of America has so much cash on its balance sheet
that it could pay back all of its short-term debt and a big
chunk of its long-term debt,&#8221; Bove said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, fell 10 basis points to 245, according to
data provider CMA. The swaps earlier rose to 283, the highest
level since April 2009. The contracts rose 40 basis points
yesterday, after Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and
others hired attorneys in relation to a U.S. probe of matters
raised by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. bank bonds are &#8220;very attractive&#8221; investments after
declining this month, according to Pacific Investment Management
Co.&#8217;s Mark Kiesel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a sector that makes money, has improved
capital,&#8221; Kiesel, Pimco&#8217;s global head of corporate bond
portfolios, said today in a Bloomberg Television interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco, the Newport Beach, California-based manager of the
world&#8217;s largest bond fund, has been wagering on U.S. bank debt
since at least April 2008, when Kiesel said that big banks would
&#8220;slim down&#8221; by raising capital and cutting leverage. Lenders
have improved their balance sheets, making them a safe bet,
Kiesel told Scarlet Fu on the network&#8217;s &#8220;In the Loop&#8221; program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors won a victory in
their crackdown on offshore tax evasion when a federal appeals
court said a former UBS AG client must turn over his bank
records to a U.S. grand jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client, identified only as M.H., must produce records
sought by a federal grand jury in San Diego, according to the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel rejected
M.H.&#8217;s constitutional argument that the Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination should cover records on foreign bank
accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge win for the government,&#8221; said tax attorney
Ed Robbins of Hochman, Salkin, Rettig, Toscher  Perez in
Beverly Hills, California, who is not involved in the case.
&#8220;This ruling says that the government has the right to go to
any taxpayer anywhere and say, &#8216;Give me your foreign bank
records&#8217; and they&#8217;d have no Fifth Amendment protection.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors seek information that M.H. must keep under the
Bank Secrecy Act, asking for the name and number of each
account, the name and address of each bank, and the maximum
values of accounts, according to the Aug. 19 opinion. Such
record-keeping requirements mean M.H. must comply, the appellate
panel ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because the records sought through the subpoena fall
under the Required Records Doctrine, the Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination is inapplicable, and M.H.
may not invoke it to resist compliance with the subpoena&#8217;s
command,&#8221; according to the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grand jury issued a subpoena in June 2010 to M.H., who
is the target of an investigation into whether he used secret
Swiss bank accounts to evade taxes, according to the ruling. He
transferred securities from his UBS account in 2002 to a
different Swiss bank, UEB Geneva, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.H. attorney Pamela Naughton of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter
 Hampton LLP in San Diego didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Grand Jury Investigation M.H. v. United
States of America, 11-55712, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
(San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Unit Pays $5 Million in San Francisco Accord &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s credit card unit agreed to pay $5
million and suspend arbitrations of consumer debt collections in
California for two years to settle San Francisco&#8217;s lawsuit over
its collection practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement, filed yesterday in state court in San
Francisco, resolved a 2008 lawsuit alleging that Bank of
America&#8217;s FIA Card Services unit used an arbitration service
that was biased in favor of the bank and against consumers. The
National Arbitration Forum Inc., based in Minneapolis, employed
unfair business practices while administering arbitrations for
consumer who owed credit-card debt to the unit, according to the
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIA agreed not to use the mediation service in arbitrations
for five years or enforce unconfirmed arbitration awards
obtained through the company, said San Francisco City Attorney
Dennis Herrera in an e-mailed statement. FIA is prohibited from
barring consumers from suing the company as a group, according
to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both sides agreed to the settlement to avoid the costs
and uncertainty of further legal action,&#8221; Shirley Norton, a
Bank of America spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America denies any wrongdoing, Norton said. The
Charlotte, North Carolina-based company discontinued mandatory
arbitration for consumer credit card disputes in August 2009 and
hasn&#8217;t used National Arbitration Forum since then, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, the largest U.S. lender, also eliminated
mandatory arbitration and requirements barring group lawsuits
from consumer and small business credit card agreements, Norton
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Fellows, a spokesman for National Arbitration Forum,
didn&#8217;t immediately return a voice-mail message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is People of State of California v. National
Arbitration Forum, 473569, California Superior Court, County of
San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Duane Reade Chief Cuti Gets Three-Year Prison Sentence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Duane Reade Inc. Chief Executive Officer Anthony
Cuti was sentenced to three years in prison for falsely
inflating income and misleading investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuti, 65, of Saddle River, New Jersey, was convicted in
June 2010 of conspiracy and securities fraud after a federal
jury trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. U.S. District
Judge Deborah Batts yesterday also ordered Cuti to pay a $5
million fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuti was &#8220;a gifted, arrogant, driven, entitled
individual,&#8221; Batts said, adding that he had &#8220;bullied people
into committing fraudulent acts to make the company look better
than it actually was&#8221; to increase his executive compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batts said Cuti was also guilty of &#8220;the height of hubris&#8221;
for re-writing his employee compensation plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuti didn&#8217;t admit any wrongdoing when he spoke in court
before the sentence was imposed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always led my life with
integrity,&#8221; Cuti said as his wife, adult daughter and brother
sat in the courtroom. &#8220;The conviction is so at odds with what
I&#8217;ve tried to be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuti&#8217;s lawyer, Reid Weingarten, yesterday asked Batts to
impose no jail time and allow his client to remain free to
perform public service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was not a guy motivated by greed and driven to line
his pockets,&#8221; said Weingarten. Investors weren&#8217;t harmed, he
argued, and said they had profited from Cuti&#8217;s transformation of
Duane Reade from &#8220;a sleepy nearly bankrupt drug store on a
Manhattan street corner to being a force to be reckoned with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Duane Reade Chief Financial Officer William Tennant,
who was tried with Cuti and convicted of one count of securities
fraud, is scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 29. The U.S. said both
men engaged in a scheme to falsely increase revenue and lower
expenses from 2000 to 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batts yesterday directed Cuti to surrender to U.S. Bureau
of Prisons officials on Jan. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Cuti, 08-cr-00972, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil Mexico Dominance Rulings to Get Speedy Review &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil SAB will get a speedy review by Mexico&#8217;s
Federal Competition Commission in an appeal of its findings that
the company is dominant in five aspects of the phone business,
the nation&#8217;s antitrust chief said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antitrust agency will honor a Supreme Court decision
last week requiring it to review its 2009 and 2010 rulings that
America Movil&#8217;s Mexican units were dominant in fixed-line and
mobile telecommunications, Eduardo Perez Motta said yesterday.
While the agency has 60 business days to review an appeal, it
will seek to complete the process more quickly, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court decision stalls Mexican regulators&#8217; plans to chip
away at the market share of America Movil, controlled by
billionaire Carlos Slim. The Federal Telecommunications
Commission, which had expected to issue new rules this year
based on the antitrust agency&#8217;s findings, will have to await the
results of the review, Perez Motta said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we&#8217;re going to do is issue our findings as soon as
possible,&#8221; Perez Motta said in a phone interview. &#8220;I welcome
this decision by the Supreme Court because it clears up where we
go from here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil, based in Mexico City, has about 70 percent
of Mexico&#8217;s wireless subscribers. Its Telefonos de Mexico SAB
unit, also known as Telmex, has about 78 percent of the fixed-
line market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antitrust agency must wait for instructions from lower
courts before beginning the review process, Perez Motta said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telmex dominates the markets for originating phone calls,
carrying local calls, completing calls and leasing lines to
rivals, the antitrust agency found in 2009. The agency found
America Movil&#8217;s wireless unit dominant in the mobile-phone
market the following year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil asked the antitrust commission to review
those rulings. Perez Motta&#8217;s agency didn&#8217;t find a legal basis
for granting a review and denied America Movil&#8217;s request,
setting up a court fight that led to the Supreme Court ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dominance findings are separate from antitrust
commission decisions this year to assess fines of $1 billion
against America Movil and of $7.4 million against Telmex for
anticompetitive practices. The antitrust agency has accepted
America Movil&#8217;s requests to review those cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein Hires Lawyer Weingarten for Justice Investigation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C.
Blankfein and other employees hired attorneys this year when the
U.S. began a probe of matters raised by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Eric H. Holder said on May 3 that the
Justice Department was reviewing an April report on the
financial crisis by the Permanent Subcommittee, led by Carl M.
Levin, a Michigan Democrat, and Thomas A. Coburn, Republican of
Oklahoma. The report accused Goldman Sachs of misleading clients
about complex mortgage-related investments in 2007, and Levin
alleged that Blankfein misled Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other
individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection
with the Justice Department&#8217;s inquiry into certain matters
raised in the PSI report hired counsel at the outset,&#8221; the
company said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell 4.7 percent in New York trading on
concern that Blankfein&#8217;s hiring of a criminal defense attorney
could mean the firm will face more legal woes. He has been
represented by Reid H. Weingarten, a partner at Steptoe 
Johnson LLP in Washington, since the Justice Department inquiry
began, according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 56, hasn&#8217;t been charged with wrongdoing amid
federal probes of Wall Street&#8217;s role in the housing boom and
credit crisis. Goldman Sachs is paying Blankfein&#8217;s legal costs,
according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has said the testimony its employees gave to
the Permanent Subcommittee &#8220;was truthful and accurate and this
is confirmed by the subcommittee&#8217;s own report.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that the attorney was hired months ago rather
than recently moderates the impact and implications of the
story,&#8221; William Tanona, an analyst at UBS AG (UBSN) who has a &#8220;buy&#8221;
rating on the stock, wrote in a note yesterday. Still &#8220;these
continued distractions increase the probability of a management
reshuffle over the next few years, which will undoubtedly cause
some investor angst.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alisa Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment. Weingarten didn&#8217;t respond to e-mail and phone
messages requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
subpoenaed earlier this year by the Manhattan District
Attorney&#8217;s office for information related to the Permanent
Subcommittee&#8217;s report, a person familiar with the matter said in
early June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss President Says U.S. Approach in Tax Probe &#8216;Unacceptable&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss President Micheline Calmy-Rey said the way U.S. tax
authorities are seeking information from Switzerland on alleged
tax evasion by Americans  is &#8220;legally unacceptable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These means are too drawn out, legally unacceptable or
politically unjustifiable,&#8221; Calmy-Rey said in the text of a
speech given yesterday in Lucerne, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland said in June that it was in talks with the U.S.
to resolve the issue of untaxed assets held by American citizens
in Swiss bank accounts. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service and
the Justice Department have stepped up enforcement to combat
offshore tax evasion after UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank,
handed over data on 4,450 accounts to resolve a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s an agreement on the table,&#8221; Donald
Beyer, U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, said in an interview in
Geneva yesterday. &#8220;The Americans and Justice, the IRS, and
certainly the Swiss leaders, would like to find a solution that
works for everybody.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS avoided prosecution by paying $780 million, admitting
it fostered tax evasion, and giving the IRS data on more than
250 accounts. U.S. prosecutors told Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) last
month that it&#8217;s a target of a probe into its former cross-border
banking services to American customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC Sues Ex-Silverton Directors, Officers for $71 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. sued former directors
and officers of Atlanta-based Silverton Bank N.A. seeking $71
million to help recoup costs stemming from the biggest bank
collapse in Georgia history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank consistently disregarded its own policies when
making loans, according to the suit. At the same time, it built
a &#8220;large and lavish&#8221; office building and spent millions on new
corporate aircraft, the suit states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Silverton&#8217;s aggressive expansion plan was accompanied by
significant weaknesses in loan underwriting, credit
administration and a complete disregard of a declining
economy,&#8221; the FDIC said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The damages sought by the FDIC represent less than a fifth
of the $386 million it spent on Silverton, which was declared
insolvent in May 2009, the lawsuit alleges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begun in 1986 to serve small community banks, Silverton
gained a national charter and expanded into real estate
development and acquisition loans, according to the suit. Its
assets grew to $3 billion in 2008 from $1.7 billion in 2005, the
FDIC said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit names former chief executive officer and board
member Tom A. Bryan, former Chief Lending Officer Brian D.
Bueche, and former Chief Credit Officer and Senior Vice
President Brock Fredette. A message seeking comment on the case
left at a home number for Bryan, the lead defendant, wasn&#8217;t
returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency sued 14 other former directors as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation v. Bryan,
1:11-CV--2790, Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ShengdaTech Board Sues CEO in Chinese Reverse Merger Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Board members of ShengdaTech Inc. (SDTH), a Chinese company that
gained access to U.S. investors through a reverse merger, sued
the chief executive officer of the bankrupt chemical maker,
claiming he&#8217;s obstructing an internal fraud investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special committee of ShengdaTech sued Chen Xiangzhi to
prevent him from regaining control of the company, ending a
probe of its finances and ousting a newly appointed chief
restructuring officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reorganizing ShengdaTech requires &#8220;the continued existence
of the special committee and the CRO, and the preservation of
their independent powers,&#8221; the board members said in court
papers filed Aug. 20 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Reno, Nevada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen could not be immediately reached for comment at
ShengdaTech offices, where no one answered the phone before
business hours in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ShengdaTech makes nano precipitated calcium carbonate, or
NPCC, a chemical additive used in automotive and polyvinyl
chloride products. The company was organized by a so-called
reverse merger in 2006 and traded on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange
until April, when it failed to file an annual financial report
and its auditor resigned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, more than 150 Chinese companies with a market
value of $12.8 billion entered U.S. markets through reverse
mergers, according to the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board, which oversees auditors of public companies. During that
same period, about 50 Chinese companies filed initial public
offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a reverse merger, a company not listed in the U.S. buys
an American public shell corporation, allowing the new entity to
avoid the scrutiny of an initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. exchanges have frozen or delisted shares of more than
a dozen China-based firms since March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re ShengdaTech Inc., 11-52649, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Nevada (Reno). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Marsh  McLennan Executives Sues Spitzer, Slate Magazine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two former Marsh  McLennan Cos. executives, who had
insurance-fraud charges against them dropped, sued ex-New York
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer claiming they were defamed in a
Slate magazine article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the suit, William Gilman claimed Spitzer, in a Slate.com
opinion piece written in response to a Wall Street Journal
editorial critical of his investigation, indicated that Gilman,
who wasn&#8217;t named in the article, had committed crimes. Gilman&#8217;s
suit was filed in federal district court in Manhattan on Aug.
19. Edward McNenney, another former Marsh  McLennan executive,
filed suit in New York State Supreme Court on Friday as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilman worked for Marsh  McLennan from 1976 to 2004,
according to his complaint. In 2004 Spitzer announced an
investigation into practices at the company, including fees paid
by insurers to brokers who place business with them. Gilman was
indicted in 2005 on 37 counts. He was convicted of one charge,
restraint of trade and competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The convictions of Gilman and McNenney were thrown out by
the trial judge, James Yates of state Supreme Court, who said
newly discovered contradictory evidence &#8220;undermines the court&#8217;s
confidence in the verdict.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen the lawsuit and so will not comment on
it,&#8221; Spitzer said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The illegalities
rampant at Marsh  McLennan leading to their fine of $850
million and the multiple judicial findings of illegality are
clear from the public record.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Slate Group LLC was also sued by Gilman and McNenney.
E-mails to the magazine&#8217;s press office seeking comment didn&#8217;t
receive a reply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilman is seeking at least $60 million in damages in the
federal suit. McNenney seeks $30 million in the state case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal case is Gilman v. Spitzer, 11-c-5843, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
state case is McNenney v. Spitzer, 109628/2011, Supreme Court of
the State of New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), leader of a
group of lenders owed $381.7 million on a bankrupt homebuilding
project in Henderson, Nevada, sued Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH) to
recover the builder&#8217;s share of a guarantee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and other lenders agreed in 2004 to advance as
much as $535 million to builders including Meritage and Beazer
Homes USA Inc. (BZH), taking repayment guarantees from each builder,
according to a complaint filed yesterday in Las Vegas. The share
of Meritage for the loans advanced to date is $13.3 million,
JPMorgan said in the filing as it asked a judge to compel
payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan has made due demand under the repayment
guaranty, and the defendants have failed and refused to pay
their liabilities,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Edge LLC, which is owned by the builders, is in
bankruptcy court in Nevada. The bankruptcy triggered the
repayment guarantee, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meritage sued the bank Aug. 19 in state court in Ohio,
where the JPMorgan unit that is the trustee for the lenders is
based. Meritage asked a judge to rule the homebuilder doesn&#8217;t
have any obligations to the lenders and seeks $8 million in
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meritage claims that it tried to pay the lenders in April
2008 but JPMorgan refused to accept the payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meritage&#8217;s claim for damages is based on losses related to
the drop in value of the property and legal fees, company Chief
Financial Officer Larry W. Seay said today in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is JPMorgan v. Meritage Homes, 11-cv-01364, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;Troika Dialog, Russia&#8217;s oldest
investment bank, hired JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Anton Malkov as a
director for equity capital markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malkov, previously an executive director at JPMorgan, will
work on equity fundraising and structuring deals, the Moscow-
based brokerage said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troika Dialog, which is being acquired by Russia&#8217;s largest
lender, OAO Sberbank, added three other bankers this month.
Chris Weafer was hired as chief strategist after just a month in
a similar role at ING Groep NV. Olga Klimov came from UBS AG in
New York as global head of equity sales based in Moscow and
James Corrigan joined from VTB Capital for an investment-banking
role. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, dismissed speculation it&#8217;s considering a
merger with smaller rival JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) as &#8220;baseless&#8221;
in a memo to employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some blogs are speculating about rumors of merger talks
with J.P. Morgan Chase, which are baseless and don&#8217;t even make
practical sense,&#8221; the bank&#8217;s communications department said in
a memo to employees yesterday that was obtained by Bloomberg.
Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman at Bank of America, confirmed the
contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo also rebutted a blog&#8217;s suggestion that Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America needs to raise as much as
$200 billion as &#8220;just wrong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a clear path to meet the new regulatory
requirements under Basel III and we intend to meet these
standards without having to issue additional common stock,&#8221;
according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, is the second-biggest U.S. 
bank by assets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renren Inc., the Chinese social
networking site operator that completed an $855 million initial
public offering in May, agreed with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s MSN to
cooperate on instant messaging services and social networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The services will allow users to create universal logins to
both sites and share photos and status updates, the companies
said in a joint statement e-mailed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement is at least the second web partnership
announced by Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft in China in the
past two months as it seeks to broaden its access to the world&#8217;s
largest Internet market by users. Microsoft and Baidu Inc. last
month agreed to allow Baidu&#8217;s users to see English search
results generated by the U.S. company&#8217;s Bing technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renren, based in Beijing, had 124.2 million users at the
end of June. China had 485 million Internet users in the same
period, according to data from the government-sponsored China
Internet Network Information Center. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department
announced an $88.3 million settlement with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
for apparent violations of international sanctions programs,
including Cuban assets control and anti-terrorism regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury said that JPMorgan through its correspondent
banks maintained prohibited financial transactions with
sanctioned entities in countries including Cuba and Iran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan payment agreed upon by the Office of Foreign
Assets Control, known as OFAC, involves &#8220;egregious&#8221; violations
for five years, according to a Treasury Department statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The civil settlement resolves a number of OFAC
allegations dating back to 2005, none of which involved any
intent to violate OFAC regulations,&#8221; Jennifer R. Zuccarelli, a
JPMorgan spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;These
rare incidents were unrelated and isolated from each other. The
firm screens hundreds of millions of transactions and customer
records per day and annual error rates are a tiny fraction of a
percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OFAC enforcement action covers actions from December
2005 to March 2011 involving multiple violations of sanctions
programs, the Treasury said. The violations include processing
1,711 wire transfers totaling $178.5 million from December 2005
to March 2006 involving Cuban persons and a trade loan of $2.9
million with a blocked affiliate to the Islamic Republic of Iran
Shipping Lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OFAC said the $88.3 million payment from JPMorgan is based
on the bank&#8217;s cooperation, transaction review and the absence of
an OFAC notice or finding of violation during the five years of
the transactions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two dozen young men and women toting
backpacks and brochures mill around cardiologist P.L. Tiwari&#8217;s
office in Bombay Hospital, waiting as long as 90 minutes for an
opportunity to see him. They aren&#8217;t there for checkups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They instead want to persuade the Mumbai doctor to
prescribe their brands of prescription drugs. Tiwari, who sees
about 50 patients a day, said he is so inundated by sales
representatives he tries to limit their visits to Friday nights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical sales in India have increased an average of
14 percent annually since 2005, stoked by rising incomes and
surging rates of heart disease, diabetes and cancer. India bans
prescription-drug advertising, so GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), Pfizer
Inc. (PFE) and other companies are trying to tap the $12 billion
market through a sales force of 100,000 that is predicted to at
least triple by 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They often come pleading to me, asking me to prescribe
their company&#8217;s drugs,&#8221; said Tiwari, 66. &#8220;I only give them 20
seconds or a minute. You can&#8217;t stop your consultation to
entertain them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s 10 biggest pharmaceutical companies -- including
Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY), Cipla Ltd., Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories
Ltd. and local units of Pfizer and Glaxo -- bolstered their
combined sales forces by more than 6,000 in the fiscal year
ended March 31, executives said on conference calls this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brand Abundance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has 92,000 brand names of registered pharmaceuticals,
according to a compendium of medicines sold in the country. The
World Health Organization, in contrast, recommends 340 essential
drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The number of medicine brands sold in India is at least
30 times that in the U.S. and Europe,&#8221; said C.M. Gulhati,
editor of the Indian edition of the drug encyclopedia MIMS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 90 percent of prescriptions are generics, which their
manufacturers seek to differentiate with unique names -- making
them branded generics. Merck  Co.&#8217;s cholesterol-lowering Zocor
is sold by Ranbaxy as Simvatin, by Cipla as Simcard and by Lupin
Ltd. (LPC) as Starstat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices of the brands can differ by as much as 75 percent
for 10 tablets, according to MIMS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When prescribing medication, Indian doctors typically refer
to brands rather than chemical names. Pharmacists are prohibited
from substituting one generic for another, even if it&#8217;s cheaper,
so drugmakers try to persuade doctors to think of their brands
first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-Minute Meetings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are at least 43 brands of blood-pressure pill
olmesartan, which is sold by Merck as Olmighty and by Glaxo as
Benitec. Pfizer sells a similar drug called Targit. All compete
in a market for heart drugs that the All India Organization of
Chemists and Druggists estimates is worth 66 billion rupees
($1.4 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s an extremely competitive industry, and I have to
visit some doctors once every week,&#8221; said Avinash Singh, who
markets medicines for Bafna Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (BFNA), one of India&#8217;s
5,000 drugmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh&#8217;s job is to persuade Mumbai gynecologists to order
Raricap, one of about 200 versions of a calcium-and-iron
supplement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Each meeting will take one minute or so, but if we come
regularly then they will hopefully prescribe more,&#8221; said Singh,
who tries to meet at least 11 doctors a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Crowded Out&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also visits neighboring pharmacies to gauge his success.
Singh earns about 9,200 rupees a month plus quarterly bonuses
for meeting sales targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be at least three medical reps for every 10
doctors by 2020, triple the ratio from 2005, McKinsey  Co. said
in an October report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sales representatives are getting crowded out of the
doctors&#8217; chambers,&#8221; especially in India&#8217;s largest cities,
McKinsey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition and government-enforced price controls help
keep prices low and make India one of the cheapest countries for
pharmaceuticals. The price of 10 tablets of the antibiotic
ciprofloxacin, sold by Bayer AG (BAYN) as Cipro for more than 20 years,
fell 14 percent from 1996 to 2005, according to a March report
from the Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor costs, which equal 10 percent to 14 percent of sales
for at least five major drugmakers, have increased by at least
27 percent on average, according to Batlivala  Karani
Securities in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better Raises &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales personnel receive better raises than other workers
because of competition that prompts one in four recruits to
change companies within a year. Ranbaxy, India&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, agreed to boost pay for its medical reps by 20
percent to 40 percent this year, said K.B. Kadam, general
secretary of the Federation of Medical Representative
Associations of India, a union group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth in salaries has outstripped productivity increases,
with sales representatives at Ranbaxy, Cipla, Dr. Reddy&#8217;s and
Lupin generating less revenue on average than they were two
years ago, Edelweiss Securities Ltd. said in a report last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Peer pressure has forced some companies to add more
people than they are comfortable with,&#8221; said Nitin Agarwal, a
pharmaceutical analyst at IDFC Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. &#8220;At
some stage, you&#8217;re going to get no more gain from adding people.
I think we should be close to that point now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Getting Ruthless&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy added almost 1,500 sales representatives last year.
The company, based on the outskirts of New Delhi, expected the
recruits to expand domestic sales by 15 percent to 20 percent
each quarter, former Managing Director Atul Sobti said in May
2010. Instead, domestic sales growth slowed to less than 6
percent in the past two quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s influence in driving sales is
facing resistance from the Medical Council of India in New Delhi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council -- the top government body responsible for
setting ethical standards, granting doctors&#8217; licenses and
accrediting the nation&#8217;s 315 medical colleges -- is restricting
corporate sponsorship of medical events, including paying for
doctors&#8217; flights and accommodations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even the pharmaceutical industry, the big players, they
also agree with us in principle,&#8221; Council Secretary Sangeeta Sharma said. &#8220;They&#8217;re also sick of this kind of practice. It is
getting ruthless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor Training &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council is seeking a system requiring India&#8217;s 800,000
doctors to continue updating their knowledge and skills. For
some doctors, sales pitches from pharmaceutical companies are
their only source of new medical information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors in 23 of India&#8217;s 28 states aren&#8217;t required to
undertake post-graduate training to maintain their accreditation.
The council recommended in May that the health ministry require
doctors to attend lectures and conferences, and read medical
journals to continue practicing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Biased information from the industry is influencing
doctor&#8217;s decisions,&#8221; said Pankaj Chaturvedi, a cancer surgeon
at Mumbai&#8217;s Tata Memorial Hospital. &#8220;A medical representative
is a sales person just like someone selling mobile-phone
plans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the office of Mumbai heart doctor Tiwari, medical reps
flick through flipcharts and brochures while making their
pitches for medicines including Pfizer&#8217;s anti-smoking drug
Champix and Ipca Laboratories Ltd. (IPCA)&#8217;s Larinate, an injectable
anti-malarial treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiwari hears all 30 within eight minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re waiting for hours and hours, and just to satisfy
them, we listen,&#8221; Tiwari said. &#8220;What benefit is a doctor going
to get from their short speech?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells Fargo
 Co. (WFC) are among banks that made final bids to buy portions of
Anglo Irish Bank Corp.&#8217;s $9.65 billion of U.S. property loans,
according to three people with knowledge of the sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lenders are looking to acquire pieces of the $4.52
billion of performing loans the Dublin-based bank is shedding,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
talks are private. Investor groups led by private-equity firms
Blackstone Group LP (BX), working with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), and Lone
Star Funds also submitted offers for parts of the portfolio,
which include $5.13 billion of subperforming and non-performing
debt, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banks like Wells and JPMorgan can afford to pay more than
a nonbank for the performing loans,&#8221; said Ben Thypin, director
of market analysis for Real Capital Analytics Inc., a property-
research firm in New York. &#8220;Private-equity firms like
Blackstone and Lone Star can bid aggressively on the
nonperforming pieces because they have a large workout
infrastructure in place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo Irish is seeking to unload loans after being seized
by the Irish government in January 2009 amid a surge in souring
debt. The offering includes loans backed buildings from
Manhattan to Beverly Hills, California. The competition
underscores the appetite for real estate loans by private-equity
firms and banks looking to grow their assets even amid signs
that the global economic recovery is stalling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martha Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Anglo Irish, declined to
comment on the bids, as did spokesmen for New York-based
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Board to Discuss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final bids were submitted this week and a winner is
expected to be chosen by early next week, according to the
people. Anglo Irish&#8217;s board of directors is likely to discuss
the final bids at a meeting today in advance of tomorrow&#8217;s
release of first-half results, according to a person familiar
with the matter, who asked not be identified because the
information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Wells Fargo may hold the loans for their own
books or package them for sale as bonds if investor demand for
commercial-mortgage backed securities, or CMBS, is sufficient,
said one of the people. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo bought a
$1.4 billion portfolio of 25 loans from Bank of Ireland Plc on
properties in Boston, New York and Washington, according to Alan Elias, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based bank. The lender
also bought part of Allied Irish Banks LLC&#8217;s $1 billion loan
portfolio, Elias said. Blackstone purchased the other piece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financing Possible &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Wells Fargo may finance the purchase of the
some pools, the people said. A syndicate of lenders including
Bank of America Corp., RBC Capital Markets, Citigroup Inc. and
Macquarie Bank Ltd. are also vying for the assignment, the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastdil Secured LLC and FTI Consulting Inc. (FCN) are advising
Anglo Irish on the sale, the people said. The portfolio has been
divided into eight pools, according to an offering document from
Eastdil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of Blackstone, Lone Star, Deutsche Bank,
Citigroup, Bank of America, RBC Capital and Macquarie declined
to comment on the deal. Calls to Eastdil weren&#8217;t returned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co., facing
allegations that it stole tablet computer patents from Apple
Inc. (AAPL), says the design for such devices can be traced back to
Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s 1968 film &#8220;2001: A Space Odyssey.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design claimed in a 2005 patent Apple holds covering
parts of the appearance of the iPad is depicted in the film, in
which two astronauts are using tablet computers, Samsung
attorney Sara Jenkins said in a court filing Aug. 23 in federal
court in San Jose that included a clip from the film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple sued Samsung this year saying the South Korean
company&#8217;s Galaxy line of mobile devices, including its Galaxy
Tab, infringes Apple&#8217;s D&#8217;889 and other patents. The iPad maker
is seeking a court order blocking Samsung from selling products
that violate its patents. A hearing is scheduled for October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The D&#8217;889 patent covers parts of the iPad&#8217;s &#8220;unique and
novel ornamental appearance&#8221; such as the black face, the matrix
of icons and a rim surrounding a flat screen, Cupertino,
California-based Apple said in court filings. Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy
Tab infringes the patent, the company alleges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 11-1846,

&lt;p&gt;SEC Wins Civil Judgment Against Fugitive Analyst Deep Shah &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission won a judgment
against Deep Shah, who has been declared a fugitive in the
insider trading case of Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, that includes a civil penalty of $24.6 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shah, an ex-analyst at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service Inc., was
charged in November 2009 by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and sued by the SEC for allegedly passing along inside
information about acquisitions involving Hilton Hotels Corp. and
Kronos Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission sought a default judgment in June against
Shah claiming that he had not responded to its suit. U.S.
District Judge Jed Rakoff signed the order Aug. 22 and it was
filed Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment says Shah must pay back $8.2 million in
profits gained or losses avoided as a result of the conduct
alleged in the complaint, along with prejudgment interest of
$1.76 million and the civil penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is &#8220;pleased with the decision,&#8221; spokesman John Nester said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the SEC said in court documents filed in March
that the commission had located Shah in Mumbai, where a bailiff
found Shah&#8217;s residence in the Juhu neighborhood of the city and
left an amended complaint on March 22, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shah is accused of tipping Roomy Khan, a former Intel Corp.
product-marketing engineer, in 2007 to material nonpublic
information about pending takeover bids for Hilton Hotels Corp.
and Kronos Inc. Khan then passed on the tips to Rajaratnam,
prosecutors said; she pleaded guilty in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Galleon
Management LP, 09-cr-8811, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago Hedge Fund Principal Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip J. Baker, principal of the collapsed Chicago hedge
fund Lake Shore Asset Management Ltd., yesterday pleaded guilty
to one count of wire fraud for his role in an alleged $292
million global scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicted in absentia in February 2009 for his role in the
scheme that ensnared about 900 investors, Baker had faced 27
criminal counts including 17 for wire fraud and two for
commodities fraud, as well one count of embezzlement of
commodity pool funds. He pleaded not guilty last year after
being extradited from Hamburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker is also liable for $154 million in restitution, U.S.
District Judge John W. Darrah in Chicago said. Sentencing is set
for Nov. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government will recommend the maximum term of 20
years in prison when Baker is sentenced,&#8221; Chicago U.S. Attorney
Patrick Fitzgerald said in an e-mailed statement after the plea
was entered. A trial had been scheduled for Sept. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker&#8217;s lawyer, Kurt Stitcher of Baker  Daniels LLP,
declined to comment after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Baker, 1:09-cr-00175, and the

&lt;p&gt;CIFG Opposes BofA&#8217;s Mortgage-Bond Accord With Investors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s proposed $8.5 billion mortgage-bond
settlement, which has drawn criticism from a group of investors
and two states, is opposed by bond insurance company CIFG
Assurance North America Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord requires approval from a New York state judge,
and CIFG filed a &#8220;notice of intention to appear and object&#8221; to
the agreement yesterday in New York State Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed settlement calls for Bank of America to pay
$8.5 billion to resolve claims from investors in Countrywide
Financial Corp. mortgage bonds. Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America acquired Countrywide in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence Grayson, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the matter of Bank of New York Mellon,
651786/2011, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirius XM Wins Subscriber Class-Action Accord Court Approval &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI) won court approval for the settlement
with subscribers who sued the satellite-radio broadcaster over
claims it broke the law by raising prices after acquiring its
only rival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Harold Baer in Manhattan endorsed the
accord in a filing yesterday over the objections of some
subscribers who had argued at an Aug. 8 hearing that the deal
paid them too little and the lawyers too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have reviewed the settlement&#8217;s substantive terms and

&lt;p&gt;Subscriber Carl Blessing of Florida sued Sirius XM in 2009,
claiming the company violated federal antitrust law and state
consumer-protection law when it raised some prices and levied a
music royalty fee after Sirius Satellite Radio acquired XM
Satellite Radio in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirius XM said the increases were imposed to cover higher
costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, valued at $180 million, provides that prices for
basic service and Internet access, as well as the music royalty
fee, will remain at current levels through the end of the year.
Subscribers who canceled can reconnect without paying a fee.
Those whose plans expire after Dec. 31 can renew before that
time at current rates. Subscribers will get no cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirius XM declined to comment on Baer&#8217;s decision,
spokeswoman Kelly Sullivan said in an e-mail. Objectors called
the settlement of &#8220;dubious value&#8221; because Sirius XM hadn&#8217;t
said it planned to raise prices this year. They also objected to
the $13 million in fees to be paid to the lawyers representing
the class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Blessing v. Sirius XM Radio, 09-10035, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Sues Homebuilder Over Share of $381.7 Million Loan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., leader of a group of lenders that is
owed $381.7 million on a bankrupt homebuilding project in
Henderson, Nevada, sued Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH) to recover the
builder&#8217;s share of a guarantee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and other lenders agreed in 2004 to advance as
much as $535 million to a group of builders including Meritage
and Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH), taking repayment guarantees from each
builder, according to a court filing on Tuesday. The share of
Meritage for the loans advanced to date is $13.3 million,
JPMorgan said in the filing as it asked a judge to compel
payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan has made due demand under the repayment guaranty
and the defendants have failed and refused to pay their
liabilities,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Edge LLC, which is owned by the builders, is in
bankruptcy court in Nevada. The bankruptcy triggered the
repayment guarantee, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A voice mail left for Steven Hilton, Meritage&#8217;s chairman,
wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is JPMorgan v. Meritage Homes, 11-cv-01364, U.S.
District Court, District of Nevada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC Sues Ex-First National Bank of Arizona CEO Over Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-First National Bank of Arizona Chief Executive Officer
Gary A. Dorris and former director Philip A. Lamb &#8220;sacrificed
safety&#8221; and promoted risky nontraditional mortgage loans that
ultimately caused the bank&#8217;s failure, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. said in a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorris and Lamb were negligent in exercising their duties,
given the obvious risks of the bank&#8217;s business model, the agency
said yesterday in a complaint in federal court in Phoenix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank operated a wholesale mortgage division to purchase
and market nontraditional &#8220;Alt-A&#8221; loans that lacked proper
underwriting, required no verification of borrowers&#8217; income or
assets, and had terms that guaranteed high default rates, the
FDIC alleged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although these risky loans returned record profits in the
near term, they produced losses once the real estate market
softened, and ultimately caused the bank&#8217;s failure,&#8221; the agency
said in the complaint, which seeks to recover more than $193
million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Aug. 4, the FDIC has authorized lawsuits against 266
officers and directors in an effort to recoup more than $6.8
billion in losses stemming from the credit crisis, the agency
said on its Web site. An additional 172 residential malpractice
and mortgage fraud lawsuits are pending, consisting of lawsuits
filed and inherited, the agency said. More than 350 lenders have
failed since the start of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman who answered the phone at Dorris&#8217;s home in
Scottsdale, Arizona, said he was unavailable. Lamb has no public
phone listing and couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Dorris,
2:11-cv-01652, U.S. District Court, District of Arizona
(Phoenix). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comscore Accused in Lawsuit of Installing Data-Mining Software &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comscore Inc. (SCOR), a company that measures website traffic, was
accused in a lawsuit by two Internet users of surreptitiously
installing data-mining software on their computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s secret installation of the programs, which
come bundled with free screen-saver software and other
applications, violates Illinois and U.S. laws including the
federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, according to a
federal lawsuit filed Aug. 23 in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The scope and breadth of data that Comscore collects from
unsuspecting customers is terrifying,&#8221; Californian Jeff Dunstan
and Illinois resident Mike Harris said in their complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comscore, based in Reston, Virginia, compiles Internet
traffic data from about 2 million consumers in 170 countries and
then markets the information to financial analysts, advertising
agencies and other businesses, according to its own website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris and Dunstan said the company&#8217;s software collects
user names and passwords, credit card numbers, and prices paid
for consumer goods purchased on line, in addition to logging the
sites consumers visited and ads they&#8217;ve clicked on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have reviewed the lawsuit and find it to be without
merit and full of factual inaccuracies,&#8221; Andrew Lipsman, a
Comscore vice president, said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Comscore intends to aggressively defend itself against these
claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs seek a class action status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Harris v. Comscore Inc., 11cv5807, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Sues U.K. Debt Recovery Company Over &#8216;Misleading&#8217; Name &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) sued a U.K. debt recovery company in a
trademark dispute over the use of the name of the U.K.&#8217;s second-
largest bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Recovery Services has no connection to the London-
based bank, Barclays said in a statement. The lawsuit was filed
in London on Aug. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under U.K. intellectual property law, company names can be
protected as registered trademarks, according to the
Intellectual Property Office&#8217;s website. Infringement may occur
when a logo or name can be confused with a registered trademark,
or where it takes advantage of another company&#8217;s reputation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The legal proceedings seek to stop Barclays Recovery
Services Ltd. from infringing the bank&#8217;s trademarks and engaging
in conduct that is misleading,&#8221; Barclays said. &#8220;Barclays
values its reputation with its customers and the general public
and will always act to protect its name.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Recovery Services, which is registered at an
address on Regent Street in London, doesn&#8217;t have a listed phone
number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Barclays Bank Plc v. Barclays Recovery Services
Ltd., High Court of Justice Chancery Division, HC11C02895. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuit News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alabama Immigrant Status Checks May Spark Suits, Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alabama&#8217;s new immigration law requiring that police
officers check immigrants&#8217; legal status might lead to lawsuits
for unlawful detention, a judge said in a hearing on challenges
to the statute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a lot of problems with this statute,&#8221; U.S.
District Judge Sharon Blackburn in Birmingham, Alabama, said
yesterday in a hearing on three cases filed by the federal
government, groups including the American Civil Liberties Union
and Christian clergy. &#8220;My job is to decide if this is
constitutional.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure, to go into effect Sept. 1, requires police
officers to verify the immigration status of anyone they stop
and suspect may be in the U.S. illegally. Businesses must use a
federal database called E-Verify to determine whether job
applicants are eligible to work. And it&#8217;s a crime to rent
housing to illegal immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department and the ACLU argue that federal
law governs the handling of undocumented immigrants. Roman
Catholic, Episcopal and Methodist clergy say the statute makes
it illegal for them to fulfill their mission to feed, clothe and
give communion to undocumented aliens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alabama is the fifth U.S. state to enact such legislation.
The three lawsuits are consolidated before Blackburn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Robert Bentley signed the bill into law in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama v.
Bentley, 5:11-cv-2484, Parsley v. Bentley, 5:11-cv-2736, and
U.S. v. Bentley, 5:11-cv-2746, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Alabama (Birmingham). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeowner Associations in Need of Cash Sue to Force Foreclosures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the Vintage East Condominium Association in
Miami Beach got tired of waiting for JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to
foreclose on unit 9, so they sued the bank in February to take
control of the property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, more than four years after the owner stopped
making payments, a judge ruled that JPMorgan lost its claim to
the $144,000 mortgage. The apartment is now on the market for
$87,500, and the association may stave off insolvency with
proceeds from the sale and a new owner who pays monthly dues,
said Jane Losson, a board member at the complex in a telephone
interview. Four of the 11 other owners at the property are also
behind on dues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially troubled condo associations are taking banks to
court as foreclosure delays enable delinquent homeowners to stay
in their buildings for years, often without paying dues that
keep boards running. The groups start by pressuring lenders to
speed up home seizures and take over payment of the monthly
fees. In extreme situations, like the Vintage East case,
associations may force banks to give up rights to the property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lenders are stalling foreclosures,&#8221; Ben Solomon, the
Miami Beach attorney for the Vintage East association, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;Our complaints say the banks abandoned
their interest and either need to accept responsibility for the
title or walk away.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon, whose Association Law Group represented homeowner
boards in 16 Florida counties with 15,000 delinquent owners,
also won what he calls &#8220;mortgage terminator&#8221; lawsuits in
claims against Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. (C), Deutsche
Bank AG (DB) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank defendant is usually a trustee for the loan that
was sold into a mortgage-backed security, a legal structure that
can leave the party responsible for a mortgage unclear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup and Deutsche Bank declined to challenge lawsuits
brought by Solomon because both banks were trustees, not the
servicers of the delinquent loans, bank representatives said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2010, Citigroup lost a lawsuit over a Miami Beach
condo with a $136,000 mortgage, according to court filings.
Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
bank, declined to comment, saying Citigroup wasn&#8217;t the servicer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank in September forfeited its right to a unit
with a $149,300 mortgage to the Palm Aire Gardens Condominium
Association Inc. in Pompano Beach, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Litton Loan Servicing, the loan servicer for the loan,
and not Deutsche Bank as trustee, was responsible for all
foreclosure activity relating to the loan,&#8221; John Gallagher, a
Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan in Chicago, declined
to comment on cases in which the bank lost properties to
homeowner associations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viktor Bout Statements to U.S. Agents Coerced, Judge Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viktor Bout, a Russian accused of conspiring to sell
weapons to a Colombian terrorist group, won a bid to bar from
his trial statements he made after U.S. authorities threatened
to abandon him in a Thai prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin in Manhattan
yesterday granted Bout&#8217;s request to exclude his comments to Drug
Enforcement Administration agents after his arrest in Bangkok,
saying the agents ignored Bout&#8217;s request for more time to decide
whether to talk. Bout, 44, said he was told that if he didn&#8217;t
speak immediately, he&#8217;d be left in a Thai jail to face &#8220;heat,
hunger, disease and rape,&#8221; Scheindlin wrote in her ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When coupled with the agents&#8217; deceptive suggestion that
if Bout &#8216;cooperated&#8217; he could come back to the United States
with them (rather than be &#8216;abandoned&#8217; in a Thai jail), I find
that this credible threat of violence also materially induced
Bout to make statements,&#8221; Scheindlin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert Dayan, one of Bout&#8217;s attorneys, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a telephone message left at his office seeking comment on
the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We respectfully disagree with the judge&#8217;s opinion and
plan to request that it be reconsidered,&#8221; Ellen Davis, a
spokeswoman for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office, said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Bout, 08-cr-0365, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) agreed to pay $500
million to settle U.S. allegations that advertising for online
Canadian pharmacies on its website allowed illegal imports of
prescription drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google was aware as early as 2003 that the shipment of
prescriptions to the U.S. from outside the country is illegal,
the Department of Justice said in a statement yesterday. The
payment represents revenue that Google generated from the ads
and that Canadian pharmacies reaped from online drug sales to
American consumers, the DOJ said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This settlement ensures that Google will reform its
improper advertising practices with regard to these pharmacies
while paying one of the largest financial forfeiture penalties
in history,&#8221; Deputy Attorney General James Cole said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, owner of the world&#8217;s most popular search engine, is
grappling with increasing scrutiny from governments around the
world, including an investigation of its business practices by
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. As part of the settlement,
there will be &#8220;a number of compliance and reporting measures,&#8221;
the DOJ said, without providing further details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google had $29.3 billion in revenue last year, almost
entirely from advertising. The Mountain View, California-based
company said in May that it had set aside $500 million to
resolve an investigation of its ad business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We banned the advertising of prescription drugs in the
U.S. by Canadian pharmacies some time ago,&#8221; Google said in an
e-mailed statement yesterday. &#8220;However, it&#8217;s obvious with
hindsight that we shouldn&#8217;t have allowed these ads on Google in
the first place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2010, Google joined Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Yahoo!
Inc. and other companies in helping establish a nonprofit
organization to fight illegal Internet pharmacies. Counterfeit
drug sales account for about $75 billion in global sales, the
National Association of Boards of Pharmacy said at the time.
About 1 percent to 2 percent of prescription medicines in North
America are counterfeit, according to the pharmacy group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switzerland, U.K. Agree to Settlement in Tax-Evasion Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland and the U.K. completed an agreement to end a
dispute over tax evasion by wealthy Britons holding offshore
accounts with Swiss private banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss banks will pay 500 million Swiss francs ($629
million) to the U.K. government to cover the failure by their
clients to disclose undeclared money in the past, Switzerland&#8217;s
Finance Ministry said yesterday. The banks will later be
reimbursed from taxes paid by their customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord &#8220;respects the protection of bank clients&#8217;
privacy, but also ensures the implementation of legitimate tax
claims,&#8221; the ministry said in an e-mailed statement from the
Swiss capital, Bern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treaty comes after Switzerland agreed in March 2009 to
meet international standards to avoid being blacklisted as a tax
haven by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. The settlement may trigger outflows by Britons who
question the value of cross-border accounts as Swiss banking
secrecy crumbles and follows a similar accord with Germany
earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The days when it was easy to stash the profits of tax
evasion in Switzerland are over,&#8221; U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer George Osborne said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We
will be as tough on the richest who evade tax as on those who
cheat on benefits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss banks will levy a withholding tax of 48 percent on
investment income and 27 percent on capital gains earned by
Britons with offshore accounts, according to yesterday&#8217;s
statement. Revenue generated will go to the British Treasury,
while client identities remain secret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initialed tax agreement should be signed by both
governments in the next few months and is expected to come into
force in 2013, the Treasury said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland is the world&#8217;s biggest center for offshore
wealth with about 1.96 trillion francs of assets last year,
according to Boston Consulting Group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC Wins Civil Judgment Against Fugitive Analyst Deep Shah &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission won a judgment
against Deep Shah, who has been declared a fugitive in the
insider trading case of Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj
Rajaratnam, that includes a civil penalty of $24.6 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shah, an ex-analyst at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service Inc., was
charged in November 2009 by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara and sued by the SEC for allegedly passing along inside
information about acquisitions involving Hilton Hotels Corp. and
Kronos Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission sought a default judgment in June against
Shah claiming that he had not responded to its suit. U.S.
District Judge Jed Rakoff signed the order Aug. 22 and it was
filed Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment says Shah must pay back $8.2 million in
profits gained or losses avoided as a result of the conduct
alleged in the complaint, along with prejudgment interest of
$1.76 million and the civil penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is &#8220;pleased with the decision,&#8221; spokesman John
Nester said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the SEC said in court documents filed in March
that the commission had located Shah in Mumbai, where a bailiff
found Shah&#8217;s residence in the Juhu neighborhood of the city and
left an amended complaint on March 22, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shah is accused of tipping Roomy Khan, a former Intel Corp.
product-marketing engineer, in 2007 to material nonpublic
information about pending takeover bids for Hilton Hotels Corp.
and Kronos Inc. Khan then passed on the tips to Rajaratnam,
prosecutors said; she pleaded guilty in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

Management LP, 09-cr-8811, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago Hedge Fund Principal Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip J. Baker, principal of the collapsed Chicago hedge
fund Lake Shore Asset Management Ltd., yesterday pleaded guilty
to one count of wire fraud for his role in an alleged $292
million global scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicted in absentia in February 2009 for his role in the
scheme that ensnared about 900 investors, Baker had faced 27
criminal counts including 17 for wire fraud and two for
commodities fraud, as well one count of embezzlement of
commodity pool funds. He pleaded not guilty last year after
being extradited from Hamburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker is also liable for $154 million in restitution, U.S.
District Judge John W. Darrah in Chicago said. Sentencing is set
for Nov. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government will recommend the maximum term of 20
years in prison when Baker is sentenced,&#8221; Chicago U.S. Attorney
Patrick Fitzgerald said in an e-mailed statement after the plea
was entered. A trial had been scheduled for Sept. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker&#8217;s lawyer, Kurt Stitcher of Baker  Daniels LLP,
declined to comment after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Baker, 1:09-cr-00175, and the
civil case is U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Lake
Shore Asset Management Ltd., 1:07-cv-03598, U.S. District Court,

settlement, which has drawn criticism from a group of investors
and two states, is opposed by bond insurance company CIFG
Assurance North America Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord requires approval from a New York state judge,
and CIFG filed a &#8220;notice of intention to appear and object&#8221; to
the agreement yesterday in New York State Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed settlement calls for Bank of America to pay
$8.5 billion to resolve claims from investors in Countrywide
Financial Corp. mortgage bonds. Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America acquired Countrywide in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

$381.7 million on a bankrupt homebuilding project in Henderson,
Nevada, sued Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH) to recover the builder&#8217;s share
of a guarantee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and other lenders agreed in 2004 to advance as
much as $535 million to builders including Meritage and Beazer
Homes USA Inc. (BZH), taking repayment guarantees from each builder,
according to a complaint filed Aug. 22 in Las Vegas. The share
of Meritage for the loans advanced to date is $13.3 million,
JPMorgan said in the filing as it asked a judge to compel
payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan has made due demand under the repayment
guaranty, and the defendants have failed and refused to pay
their liabilities,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Edge LLC, which is owned by the builders, is in
bankruptcy court in Nevada. The bankruptcy triggered the
repayment guarantee, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meritage sued the bank Aug. 19 in state court in Ohio,
where the JPMorgan unit that is the trustee for the lenders is
based. Meritage asked a judge to rule the homebuilder doesn&#8217;t
have any obligations to the lenders and seeks $8 million in
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meritage claims that it tried to pay the lenders in April
2008 but JPMorgan refused to accept the payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meritage&#8217;s claim for damages is based on losses related to
the drop in value of the property and legal fees, company Chief
Financial Officer Larry W. Seay said yesterday in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is JPMorgan v. Meritage Homes, 11-cv-01364, U.S.
District Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC Sues Ex-First National Bank of Arizona CEO Over Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-First National Bank of Arizona Chief Executive Officer
Gary A. Dorris and former director Philip A. Lamb &#8220;sacrificed
safety&#8221; and promoted risky nontraditional mortgage loans that
ultimately caused the bank&#8217;s failure, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. said in a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorris and Lamb were negligent in exercising their duties,
given the obvious risks of the bank&#8217;s business model, the agency
said yesterday in a complaint in federal court in Phoenix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although these risky loans returned record profits in the
near term, they produced losses once the real estate market
softened, and ultimately caused the bank&#8217;s failure,&#8221; the agency
said in the complaint, which seeks to recover more than $193
million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Aug. 4, the FDIC has authorized lawsuits against 266
officers and directors in an effort to recoup more than $6.8
billion in losses stemming from the credit crisis, the agency
said on its Web site. An additional 172 residential malpractice
and mortgage fraud lawsuits are pending, consisting of lawsuits
filed and inherited, the agency said. More than 350 lenders have
failed since the start of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman who answered the phone at Dorris&#8217;s home in
Scottsdale, Arizona, said he was unavailable. Lamb has no public
phone listing and couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Dorris,
2:11-cv-01652, U.S. District Court, District of Arizona
(Phoenix). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) and Lone Star Funds won the bidding for Anglo Irish Bank
Corp.&#8217;s $9.65 billion portfolio of U.S. real estate loans,
according to three people briefed on the auction&#8217;s results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Wells Fargo each won pools of mainly
performing loans, said one of the people, who asked not to be
named because the results haven&#8217;t been made public. Lone Star,
the Dallas-based investor in distressed mortgages, will buy
subperforming and nonperforming loans that account for about
half of the portfolio, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction, which included loans backed by buildings from
Manhattan to Beverly Hills, California, underscores the appetite
for property in higher-quality locations by private-equity firms
and banks seeking to expand their assets. The winning bids for
the loans averaged about 80 cents on the dollar, said two of the
people who were told of the results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re looking at quality assets in good, strong
markets, I&#8217;d say 80 cents on the dollar sounds pretty
reasonable,&#8221; said Tom Craig, founder of TSC Realty Partners, a
commercial-property broker in Seattle who wasn&#8217;t involved in the
sale. &#8220;One of the barriers to entry on a big deal like this is
how many people can put the capital together to buy this and
close quickly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York, and
Alan Elias, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo,
declined to comment, as did Andy Brimmer, a spokesman for Lone
Star. Martha Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Anglo Irish in Dublin,
also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A message for Martha Wallau, a spokeswoman for Eastdil
Secured LLC, the Wells Fargo unit that conducted the auction,
wasn&#8217;t returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX) was a final bidder for at least a
portion of the loans, according to people with knowledge of the
situation. Peter Rose, a spokesman for the New York-based
private-equity firm, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo Irish is seeking to unload loans after being seized
by the Irish government in January 2009 amid a surge in souring
debt. The U.S. loans are backed by properties including the
Apthorp apartments in Manhattan, Chicago&#8217;s Palmer House Hilton
hotel and the Two Rodeo Drive shopping center in Beverly Hills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo Irish expects to complete the U.S. portfolio sale by
year&#8217;s end, Tom Hunersen, the bank&#8217;s head of corporate
development, said at a press briefing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We had a large group of interested parties,&#8221; Hunersen
said, declining to disclose details of the auction. The bank
achieved &#8220;the best possible value,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

economist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forecast is a change from the previous expectation of a

&lt;p&gt;Boeing Co. (BA) : The Chicago-based company is replacing
its commercial-jet sales chief, Marlin Dailey, a month after
Airbus SAS made inroads into one of the U.S. planemaker&#8217;s top
customers. Ray Conner, who had been head of sales before Dailey
was appointed in December 2008, will take an expanded role as
vice president of sales and customer support. Dailey previously
led European sales and will become president of Boeing Germany,
Northern Europe/EU and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) : The Federal Reserve
said it will hold public hearings on the McLean, Virginia-based
lender&#8217;s acquisition of ING Direct USA. The Fed said the
scrutiny is to examine whether the acquisition creates benefits
to the public and risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or
financial system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey and Ukraine are more
vulnerable to a repeat of the 2008 credit crisis than other
nations in central and eastern Europe, the Middle East and
Africa on concern their balance of payments will hurt financial
stability, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey has &#8220;accumulated substantial external imbalances&#8221;
and an International Monetary Fund program has been sidelined in
Ukraine, economists including Clemens Grafe and Ahmet Akarli
said in an e-mailed report today. Russia would also be exposed,
though &#8220;a more resilient banking system and increased ruble
flexibility&#8221; should limit the impact, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our analysis suggests there are marked financing risks in
a number of CEEMEA economies should we see a repeat of &#8216;crisis-
like&#8217; stress conditions,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;The &#8216;stress-case&#8217;
scenario implies that Turkey and Ukraine may be relatively more
vulnerable to potential balance of payments incidents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s current account deficit, which widened to a record
$72.5 billion in the 12 months through June, or about 9 percent
of economic output, has brought losses for the lira of 13
percent this year, the biggest decline among more than 20
emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, in Ukraine,
the IMF has delayed a visit planned for next week until October,
pending a revamp of its pension system and steps to narrow the
budget deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;More Abrupt&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event of external financial stress, the adjustment
to Turkey&#8217;s current-account deficit &#8220;would have to be much more
abrupt, leading to significant output losses, further lira
weakness and possibly a fall in foreign exchange reserve
levels,&#8221; Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lira was little at 1.7558 per dollar at 5:43 p.m. The
main ISE National 100 share index in Istanbul rose 1.4 percent,
trimming this year&#8217;s declined to 19 percent. The Ukrainian
Equities Index (UX) fell 2.6 percent, extending this year&#8217;s retreat
to 34 percent, making it the worst performer globally this year
after the Cyprus General Market Index and Egypt&#8217;s EGX 30.
Russia&#8217;s Micex rose 0.9 percent, paring its 2011 drop to 14
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hungary, five-year credit default swaps, which measure
the cost of insuring a country&#8217;s debt against default, have
surged to the highest since April 2009, partly on concern that
disagreements with the IMF leave the country more exposed to a
financial shock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The breakdown in negotiations with the IMF means that the
government will need to convince the markets of the credibility
of its reforms and fiscal commitments; an unconvincing
performance would increase the likelihood that the country would
have to undergo another painful adjustment,&#8221; Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The external balances of Israel and Kazakhstan look more
resilient, the report said. In South Africa, &#8220;the required
current account adjustment is to a large extent generated by the
existing moderate current account deficit,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;In
addition, we would expect to see a relative outperformance of
gold under a &#8216;back to 2008&#8217; scenario.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of countries are in a stronger starting
position when compared with mid-2008, with the excesses of a
pre-2008 credit boom now tempered, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most of the countries are running either a current
account surplus or a moderate deficit,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;The
exceptions are Turkey and Poland, a by-product of the strong
domestic demand-led recoveries of the past two years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department
announced an $88.3 million settlement with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
for apparent violations of international sanctions programs,
including Cuban assets control and anti-terrorism regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury said that JPMorgan through its correspondent
banks maintained prohibited financial transactions with
sanctioned entities in countries including Cuba and Iran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan payment agreed upon by the Office of Foreign
Assets Control, known as OFAC, involves &#8220;egregious&#8221; violations
for five years, according to a Treasury Department statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The civil settlement resolves a number of OFAC
allegations dating back to 2005, none of which involved any
intent to violate OFAC regulations,&#8221; Jennifer R. Zuccarelli, a
JPMorgan spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;These
rare incidents were unrelated and isolated from each other. The
firm screens hundreds of millions of transactions and customer
records per day and annual error rates are a tiny fraction of a
percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OFAC enforcement action covers actions from December
2005 to March 2011 involving multiple violations of sanctions
programs, the Treasury said. The violations include processing
1,711 wire transfers totaling $178.5 million from December 2005
to March 2006 involving Cuban persons and a trade loan of $2.9
million with a blocked affiliate to the Islamic Republic of Iran
Shipping Lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OFAC said the $88.3 million payment from JPMorgan is based
on the bank&#8217;s cooperation, transaction review and the absence of
an OFAC notice or finding of violation during the five years of
the transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EPA Delays Mandate to Report Products Leading to Carbon Releases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency said it would put off
reporting requirements for manufacturers and power plants on the
products they use that lead to greenhouse-gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Federal Register notice yesterday, the EPA said that
companies would have until at least 2013 to submit information
about the raw materials. Representatives of chemical makers, oil
refiners and other manufacturers have tried to scuttle the EPA&#8217;s
proposal, saying it would force them to disclose confidential
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules were set to take effect this year. The EPA
proposed in December that they be deferred and yesterday&#8217;s
notice makes that decision final. The rules will be delayed
until March 31, 2013, for some substances and two years later
for others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more a year of
greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, are required to submit
annual reports to the EPA on those releases. On Aug. 22, the EPA
started a new program that lets 7,000 power plants, refiners and
other manufacturers file their emissions data electronically.
The information must be submitted by the end of September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers Must Tell Workers of Right to Unionize, NLRB Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. employers must post notices informing workers about
their legal rights to form a union and bargain on contracts, the
National Labor Relations Board said in a rule that may help
efforts to organize employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that use posters to tell employees about
personnel rules or policies must add a notice about their
collective bargaining rights, according to a statement yesterday
from the NLRB. The posting must be completed Nov. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The notice does make it easier for labor to make
inroads,&#8221; Doreen Davis, a partner in the labor and employment
practice at Morgan, Lewis  Bockius LLP in New York and
Philadelphia, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board proposed the rule to spell out for employees
their rights under federal laws that let workers choose to form
and join a labor union. Business groups protested the proposal
and said the rule shows that the agency favors unions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s arbitrary, it&#8217;s capricious,&#8221; Peter Schaumber, a
former NLRB chairman appointed by Republican President George W.
Bush, said in an interview. &#8220;It shows just how activist they&#8217;re
prepared to be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The NLRB rule simply brings the National Labor Relations
Act in line with other workplace laws that require employers to
post a notice in the workplace of their employees&#8217; rights,&#8221;
Peter Colavito, director of government relations at the 2.2
million-member Service Employees International Union, said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Banks Said to Seek Relief From Regulators as Deposits Swell &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators have asked some banks to take more deposits
from large investors even if it&#8217;s unprofitable, and lenders in
return are seeking relief on insurance premiums and leverage
ratios, according to six people with knowledge of the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deposits are flooding into the biggest U.S. banks as
customers seek shelter from Europe&#8217;s debt crisis and falling
stock prices. That forces lenders to raise capital for a growing
balance sheet and saddles them with the higher deposit insurance
payments. With short-term interest rates so low, it&#8217;s hard for
financial firms to reinvest the new money profitably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators have asked banks to take the deposits anyway,
three people said, with one lender accepting $100 billion. The
regulators want lenders to take the deposits because it improves
the stability of the financial system, according to one of the
people, who said U.S. banks are viewed as places of strength. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the largest ones have talked with regulators about
softening rules for ratios that measure capital and assets,
according to the people, who declined to be identified because
talks are private. At least one asked for a waiver on paying
higher premiums to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which is
less likely to be granted, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the helicopter comes raining money on your bank and
it&#8217;s only temporarily there, it could be excessively costly and
disruptive,&#8221; said Robert Litan, a vice president of research
and policy at the Kansas City, Missouri-based Kauffman
Foundation, which promotes entrepreneurial business practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra deposits are problematic because they&#8217;re subject
to withdrawal, so banks have to park the money in low-yielding
short-term investments, Litan said. With few other choices
available, banks have stashed their excess deposits at the Fed,
which means the cash gets counted as assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This expands their balance sheets and thus pushes down
their leverage ratio, which measures Tier 1 capital divided by
adjusted average total assets; the lower the ratio, the weaker
the bank, at least in theory. In reality, regulators regard U.S.
lenders as relatively strong with sufficient capital cushions,
the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders have held discussions with officials at the Fed,
FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Treasury
Department, according to four of the people. Spokesmen for the
four agencies declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon Bell, a Citigroup spokeswoman, Howard Opinsky at
JPMorgan, Ancel Martinez at Wells Fargo and Bank of America&#8217;s
Jerry Dubrowski declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relaxing the rules or enforcement could be a slippery
slope, said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP LLC,
a Jersey City, New Jersey-based unit of London-based ICAP Plc,
the world&#8217;s largest inter-dealer broker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Asking for a free pass on the leverage ratio for bank
deposits by itself isn&#8217;t something that regulators would
consider,&#8221; Crandall said. &#8220;The question is whether banks
should be able to exclude reserve balances since they are a
risk-free asset.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Faces Confusion From Multiple Privacy Agencies, EU Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. and other Internet companies face legal
confusion from local and national European regulators with
different approaches to data protection, the European Commission
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These differences &#8220;show the risk that the same company and
services will be treated in an inconsistent manner by different
authorities,&#8221; said Matthew Newman, a spokesman for the European
Commission, in an e-mail. The Brussels-based regulator will
propose draft rules later this year for all data protection
agencies across the 27-nation bloc to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook&#8217;s like button and facial-recognition features were
criticized by two German regional regulators this month, with
officials in Schleswig-Holstein saying the like button may
violate European Union and German data protection law while
Hamburg&#8217;s data protection agency said the company may break
privacy rules by recording biometric data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is among U.S. companies that have faced scrutiny
in the EU for possible privacy breaches. Google Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) and Yahoo! Inc. have been pushed by European data-
protection officials to limit the amount of time they store
online users&#8217; search records. The group of regulators, known as
the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, has also
criticized Facebook for policy changes that could harm users&#8217;
privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Century&#8217;s Poulsen Conviction, 30-Year Term Upheld &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court upheld the 30-year prison term of
Lance Poulsen, founder of National Century Financial Enterprises
Inc., as well as his convictions at separate trials on
obstruction of justice and fraud charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poulsen was found guilty by jurors in federal court in
Columbus, Ohio, in October 2008 of fraud, conspiracy and money
laundering for defrauding investors of $2.9 billion. Seven
months earlier, a separate jury convicted him of trying to bribe
the main witness against him. U.S. District Judge Algenon
Marbley sentenced him to 30 years in the fraud case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati
yesterday rejected Poulsen&#8217;s claims that Marbley made several
improper rulings at each trial and that his prison term was too
long. Poulsen had said he shouldn&#8217;t get a longer sentence than
the chief executive officers of WorldCom Inc. and Enron Corp.,
who got 25 and 24 years, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Poulsen cites a number of sentences given to those whom
he refers to as &#8216;the most notorious financial fraudsters in
corporate America,&#8217;&#8221; according to the opinion by a three-judge
panel of the appeals court. &#8220;Poulsen presents no coherent
argument as to why his sentence is substantively unreasonable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poulsen, 68, is incarcerated at the Williamsburg Federal
Correctional Institution in South Carolina, according to the
U.S. Bureau of Prisons website. His release date is listed on
the site as Dec. 4, 2033. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals panel ruled that Marbley properly determined
the loss to investors as $2.89 billion, even though prosecutors
had said once to jurors that the loss was only &#8220;over $2
billion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poulsen&#8217;s attorneys William Terpening and Peter Anderson
didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poulsen&#8217;s 30-year term for the fraud case is concurrent
with his earlier 10-year term for the obstruction case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals are U.S. v. Poulsen, 08-4218 and 09-3658, 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Cincinnati). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drimal Should Get 70- to 80-Month Prison Term, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Drimal, the former Galleon Group LLC trader who
pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges, should get a prison
term of 70 to 80 months, which is within federal sentencing
guidelines, the U.S. said in a memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drimal pleaded guilty last month in federal court in New
York charges of conspiracy and securities fraud. Drimal admitted
that he and others at Galleon traded on inside information
obtained from lawyers working on transactions involving 3Com
Corp. and Axcan Pharma Inc. in 2007. Drimal said the information
was obtained from Arthur Cutillo and Brien Santarlas, lawyers at
Boston-based Ropes  Gray LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drimal has suggested that the court impose community
service or home confinement in lieu of a &#8220;substantial&#8221; prison
term, prosecutors said. The request should be denied in order to
send a &#8220;strong message of deterrence to others in the hedge
fund community&#8221; and because the &#8220;nature and extent of his
criminal conduct doesn&#8217;t warrant community service,&#8221;
prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drimal is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge
Richard Sullivan on Aug. 31. Drimal&#8217;s attorney, Jane Anne
Murray, said she filed a memorandum last week asking the judge
to impose a sentence below the federal guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not surprised by their position; it&#8217;s been
consistent,&#8221; Murray said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We
disagree with the government on a number of issues including the
applicable guidelines. And we&#8217;re seeking a sentence that is
substantially lower than the one the government is seeking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors also asked the court to obtain a judgment
against Drimal to recover the amount of the proceeds of his
crimes, which they said are at least $7 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuld, Lehman Executives to Settle Lawsuit for $90 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) executives including former
Chairman Richard Fuld will settle an investor lawsuit using a
$90 million payment from the defunct firm&#8217;s insurers, according
to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors blamed Lehman officers and directors for
losses on Lehman stock and options from June 12, 2007, to Sept.
15, 2008, according to the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. Fuld, 65, was chief executive officer of New York-
based Lehman, once the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank,
before its 2008 bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bankruptcy examiner said Lehman foundered because of too
much debt, which it tried to hide from investors, and risky real
estate investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patricia Hynes, a lawyer for Fuld, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman said in November that Fuld would get $10 million
from insurers as part of an officers-and-directors program
paying for the costs of lawsuits. It also said insurers would be
asked to pay as much as $90 million in costs for unidentified
defendants in civil, criminal and regulatory proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman has asked the judge to modify bankruptcy law on nine
previous occasions to tap its directors-and-officers insurance,
according to the Aug. 24 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Depressed Libor Rates, Schwab Says in Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW), the largest independent brokerage by
client assets, sued Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. (C) and
other banks claiming they manipulated the London interbank
offered rate, or Libor, starting in 2007 in violation of U.S.
antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit filed Aug. 23 in federal court in San
Francisco, where Schwab is based, claims the banks conspired to
depress Libor rates by understating their borrowing costs,
thereby lowering their interest expenses on products tied to the
rates. The banks &#8220;reaped hundreds of millions, if not billions,
of dollars in ill-gotten gains,&#8221; Schwab wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In separate suits in April, three European asset-management
firms and the Carpenters Pension Fund of West Virginia sued the
banks claiming they manipulated Libor. U.S. and U.K. officials
are cooperating in a probe of possible Libor manipulation, a
person close to the investigation said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Schwab suit seeks unspecified damages, which may be
tripled under antitrust law. It also includes claims for
racketeering and securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, and Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a
spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, didn&#8217;t immediately
return calls for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Schwab Money Market Fund v. Bank of America
Corp. (BAC), 11-cv-4186, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guaranty Financial Trustee Suit Accuses KBW of Short Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidation trustee for Guaranty Financial Group Inc. (GFGFQ)
sued KBW Inc. (KBW), claiming that the investment bank used inside
information about the Texas lender to short its stock before KBW
collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Tepper, the trustee, is seeking to recover $20
million in fees KBW obtained as Guaranty Financial&#8217;s investment
banker, profit it received from betting against the company&#8217;s
shares and other damages, according to a suit filed Aug. 24 in
New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;KBW&#8217;s disregard of its contractual obligations and
illegal and improper use of GFG&#8217;s and the bank&#8217;s material, non-
public, confidential, inside information undermined GFG&#8217;s
efforts to raise capital, one of the very purposes for which KBW
had been engaged,&#8221; Tepper alleged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guaranty Financial, based in Austin, Texas, filed for
bankruptcy protection in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krista Eccleston, a spokeswoman for New York-based KBW,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee on Aug. 22 sued cardboard-box maker Temple-
Inland Inc., which spun off Guaranty Financial in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Tepper v. Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Inc.,
652349-2011, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, is waiving some late fees for
customers affected by Hurricane Irene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan won&#8217;t charge people in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut for late payments of credit cards, business and
consumer loans, or overdraft-related fees from today through
Sept. 4, according to an e-mail sent to customers by the New
York-based bank. The message was sent to millions of people this
morning, said spokesman Thomas Kelly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also will waive early withdrawal fees on
certificates of deposit &#8220;to help customers with their cash
flow&#8221; if needed, according to the e-mail. It won&#8217;t charge
consumers for using another bank&#8217;s automated teller machine and
will extend hours at branches in affected areas this week, the
e-mail said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the largest U.S. bank, will help
customers facing financial hardship on a case-by-case basis,
Kelli Raulerson, a spokeswoman for the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based company, said in an e-mail. &#8220;Mobile ATM units
are being deployed to support customers where most significant
needs exist due to storm impacts,&#8221; Raulerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) offers different financial recovery
assistance options and the bank will work with customers
depending on individual circumstances, said Sean Kevelighan, a
spokesman for the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATM Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) will waive fees for customers in New
York, New Jersey and Connecticut today through Sept. 2 when they
use another bank&#8217;s ATM, according to an e-mail from Kevin
Friedlander, a spokesman. Customers of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan
may incur fees from the other banks operating the ATMs. Wells
Fargo, based in San Francisco, also won&#8217;t charge early
withdrawal fees on CDs, Friedlander said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average ATM fee charged by a bank for going outside its
network is $1.41, according to Greg McBride, senior financial
analyst at Bankrate.com, a unit of Bankrate Inc. The average
surcharge assessed by the bank operating the ATM on non-
accountholders is $2.33, McBride said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) is encouraging its customers
affected by the hurricane to reach out in person at a branch,
via phone or online, if they&#8217;re having issues with their credit
card or banking needs, Stephen Schooff, a spokesman for the
McLean, Virginia-based lender, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have policies in place to assist those customers on a

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG are among 13 financial institutions
that submitted bids to advise Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial
Bank for Industry  Trade on its planned $500 million overseas
bond sale, according to Deputy General Director Le Duc Tho. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others that sent in bids include HSBC Holdings Plc,
Standard Chartered Plc, Australia  New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. and BNP Paribas SA, Tho said in a telephone interview
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale would be the first international offering of
Vietnamese notes this year and will test investor confidence in
the country, which has struggled to damp Asia&#8217;s fastest
inflation as its currency slid to the worst-performing in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They need a good, recognizable name to help them with the
bond sale,&#8221; said Francois Chavasseau, Ho Chi Minh City-based
head of fixed income research at Sacombank Securities Joint
Stock Co. &#8220;Vietnam is still viewed as quite a risky place at
the moment by foreign investors. Whether a big name will be
enough to win more confidence, I&#8217;m not sure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s second-largest listed lender by market value,
commonly known as VietinBank, has sought approval from the
country&#8217;s central bank to sell $500 million of bonds overseas
later this year, Tho said earlier this month. The sale would be
the first of dollar-denominated notes for the bank, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-Performing Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnam&#8217;s banking system is weak and non-performing loans
are &#8220;heavily understated&#8221; in official data, Fitch Ratings said
in an Aug. 8 note. The extra yield investors demand to own
dollar debt sold by Vietnam instead of similar-maturity
Treasuries has risen 110 basis points this quarter to 445 basis
points, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Asia Credit Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VietinBank is rated at B by Fitch, the fifth-highest non-
investment grade rating, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Tho said in May the lender planned to sell between
$500 million and $1 billion of bonds late in the third quarter
or early in the fourth quarter of the year. It opted for a lower
amount after reassessing its financial needs and due to global
market conditions, Tho said Aug. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender&#8217;s shares gained 2 percent to 25,900 dong at
close on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange today. The dong,
has slid 6.4 percent this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was devalued by about 7 percent in February, the
most since at least 1993. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnam&#8217;s inflation accelerated to 23 percent this month,
the highest rate among 17 Asian economies tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VietinBank has the equivalent of $374 million of bonds and
loans outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) has replaced BP
Plc in a partnership with Russia&#8217;s OAO Rosneft to drill in the
Arctic, one of the last untapped oil frontiers in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exchange for access to potentially billions of barrels
of crude in the Arctic Ocean, Exxon will grant Rosneft stakes in
Texas shale fields and deep-water projects in the Gulf of
Mexico, the companies said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Rosneft plan to spend an initial $3.2 billion
exploring Russia&#8217;s Arctic offshore and the Black Sea. In turn,
Rosneft may become the first major Russian oil producer to
develop U.S. deposits, gaining experience in deep-water and
shale oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia is seeking access to more international technology
to help it exploit complex crude deposits in increasingly harsh
environments as traditional resources, such as western Siberian
fields, are declining. The Exxon agreement will help Rosneft
meet Putin&#8217;s challenge that Russian producers maintain the
country&#8217;s world-leading output of 10 million barrels a day for
at least a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s government will support the Exxon-Rosneft alliance
&#8220;in every way,&#8221; said Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who
presided over the deal today in Sochi on Russia&#8217;s Black Sea
coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Life Blood&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon beat out its biggest international oil rivals to win
a piece of the Russian Arctic. Exxon replaces BP Plc (BP/) as
Rosneft&#8217;s partner in the Arctic Kara Sea after the U.K.
explorer&#8217;s billionaire partners in the TNK-BP Holding (TNBP) venture
blocked the agreement this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Access to new resources is the life blood of oil
companies,&#8221; said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co.
in New York. &#8220;Russia is one of the largest resources that&#8217;s
still available. It&#8217;s like Exxon is now dating the girlfriend BP
had a few months ago.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp. also have said they
wanted to explore partnerships with Rosneft in the Arctic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest oil companies are competing for new
reserves as crude-rich countries shut out foreign operators and
the easiest-to-reach hydrocarbons are exhausted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Salt, spokesman for London-based BP, declined to
comment on the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;100 Billion Barrels &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three blocks in the Kara Sea fields that are part of
this agreement are about the size of the U.K. North Sea and may
hold as much as 100 billion barrels of oil equivalent, according
to BP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson attended the
signing with Neil Duffin, the company&#8217;s president for
development, and Rosneft CEO Eduard Khudainatov. Duffin oversaw
Exxon&#8217;s deepwater Angolan projects, such as Kizomba, which have
been big some of the company&#8217;s biggest producers in the past
decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I take it as a strong statement of Russian intentions to
create competitive conditions to attract investments,&#8221;
Tillerson told reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement allows Rosneft a chance to participate in
Exxon&#8217;s unconventional fields in the U.S., where oil and gas are
extracted by cracking open rocks with sand, water and chemicals.
The two companies said they&#8217;ll study the potential for similar
fields in western Siberia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Pockets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the largest oil companies in the world, Exxon
brings experience and deep pockets to the alliance, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis who has a
&#8220;hold&#8221; on Exxon shares and owns none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To partner up with a AAA-rated energy company makes sense
for Rosneft as they seek to diversify outside of Russia,&#8221;
Youngberg said. Credit agencies rate Exxon AAA, their highest
grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putin said the investment needed to develop all the fields
involved and associated infrastructure may reach as much as $500
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s scary to utter such huge figures,&#8221; he said. Exxon,
based in Irving, Texas, will be a &#8220;reliable, strategic and good
partner,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Rosneft on Jan. 27 signed a preliminary accord
for a $1 billion exploration project in the Black Sea&#8217;s
deepwater Tuapse Trough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell, Chevron &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell, Europe&#8217;s largest oil company, was described by Putin
in May as a potential &#8220;comfortable partner&#8221; to replace BP in
the Kara Sea. Shell, which works with state-controlled OAO
Gazprom in Siberia and Sakhalin Island, agreed to further expand
cooperation with the gas producer in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron pulled out as Rosneft&#8217;s partner in the Val
Shatskogo exploration project in Russia&#8217;s Black Sea this year.
Chevron is &#8220;looking to partner with Rosneft on other
opportunities in the Arctic or elsewhere in Russia,&#8221; said Kurt
Glaubitz, a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, will spend as much as $76.3 million to explore and
develop shale oil and natural gas in Argentina with Americas
Petrogas Inc. (BOE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon will gain a 45 percent stake in Americas Petrogas&#8217;s
Los Toldos blocks, which cover 163,500 acres in the Neuquen
Basin, Calgary-based Americas Petrogas said in a statement
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americas Petrogas plans to drill a well in the fourth
quarter at its blocks, targeting the unconventional Vaca Muerta
formation, which may hold as much as 240 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the next major shale development outside of
North America will be in the Neuquen Basin,&#8221; Guimar Vaca Coca,
managing director for Americas Petrogas in Argentina, said in
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaca Muerta has characteristics similar to reservoirs such
as the Eagle Ford and Haynesville formations in North America,
the company said. YPF SA, Argentina&#8217;s largest crude producer,
announced in May it discovered the nation&#8217;s biggest oil find in
two decades at Vaca Muerta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From a geological resource point of view, I think
Argentina&#8217;s future is positive,&#8221; Jorge Pinon, a research fellow
at Florida International University in Miami, said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulatory uncertainty and a lack of continuity in fiscal
terms and conditions are larger concerns for foreign oil
companies working in Argentina, said Pinon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking For Niches &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think some of the major oil companies are looking for
niche areas in which they can position themselves to take
advantage of future opportunities,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon will have more than 310,000 net acres in the Neuquen
Basin following its deal with Americas Petrogas, Patrick McGinn,
a spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americas Petrogas climbed 40 cents, or 24 percent, to
C$2.10 on the TSX Venture Exchange, Canada&#8217;s junior stock
exchange, at 3:59 p.m. Exxon fell 21 cents to $73.91 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:15 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dick Cook, former chairman of Walt
Disney Studios, is seeking to raise $625 million in equity
financing to make and distribute family oriented films,
according to a banker briefed on the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cook and his advisers are soliciting investors, including
private-equity firms, hedge funds and wealthy individuals, said
the banker, who wouldn&#8217;t discuss the matter publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cook is seeking to return to film-making after resigning
from Burbank-based Walt Disney Co. (DIS) in 2009. Chief Executive
Officer Robert Iger engineered Disney&#8217;s purchase of Marvel
Entertainment for $4 billion that year and agreed to distribute
movies for Steven Spielberg&#8217;s DreamWorks Studios SKG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former baseball player at the University of Southern
California, Cook is also executive producer of a film based on
the life of Jackie Robinson, the first black player in Major
League Baseball, Legendary Pictures, which is producing the
film, said in a June 1 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other terms of the offering, including the percentage of
the company that will be sold, weren&#8217;t available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cook&#8217;s lawyer Peter Dekom, reached at the Cook Co. offices,
declined to comment. In the past year, some investors have
become more receptive to film finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legendary, the co-producer of films including &#8220;Inception&#8221;
and the &#8220;Hangover&#8221; movies, will raise $220.5 million for a
Hong Kong venture through Paul Y. Engineering Group Ltd.,
according to an announcement this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Film Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summit Entertainment LLC, producer of the &#8220;Twilight&#8221;
vampire films, raised $750 million in debt in February. New
owners of Miramax, producer of Oscar-winning pictures including
&#8220;Shakespeare in Love,&#8221; borrowed $325 million in December to
complete the acquisition from Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his 38 years at Disney, Cook oversaw creation of films
including the &#8216;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8217;&#8217; franchise, a series
that has generated $3.72 billion in worldwide ticket sales,

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said it would
withdraw part of its patent-infringement case against Datel
Design  Development Ltd. over controllers for the Xbox 360
video-game system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datel redesigned its controllers and stopped importing
versions known as TurboFire2 Xbox 360 Wireless that were at the
heart of a complaint before the U.S. International Trade
Commission in Washington, Microsoft said in a filing yesterday
that sought to withdraw the case. The software maker said it
still will pursue cash compensation for past infringement
through a civil lawsuit lodged against Datel last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Datel&#8217;s voluntary exclusion of the accused products from
the U.S. market has obviated the need to devote valuable public
and private resources&#8221; of the ITC, Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controllers made by Staffordshire, England-based Datel
can turn single-shot electronic pistols used in games like
&#8220;Call of Duty&#8221; into fully automatic weapons. Closely held
Datel filed an antitrust lawsuit in November against Microsoft,
claiming the company seeks to monopolize the markets for
multiplayer online gaming systems and for accessories not sold
directly with the Xbox. Those claims also are proceeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In The Matter of Certain Game Controllers,
337-715, U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). The
antitrust case is Datel Holdings Ltd. v. Microsoft Corp.,
09cv5535, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) formed an alliance
with OAO Rosneft, Russia&#8217;s largest oil producer, to drill from
the Texas plains and Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Rosneft plan to spend an initial $3.2 billion
exploring Russia&#8217;s Arctic offshore and the Black Sea, the
companies said today in a statement. In turn, Rosneft may become
the first major Russian oil producer to develop U.S. deposits,
gaining experience in deep-water and shale oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon replaces BP Plc (BP/) as Rosneft&#8217;s partner at three blocks
in the arctic Kara Sea after the U.K. explorer&#8217;s billionaire
partners in the TNK-BP venture blocked that agreement this year.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who presided over the Exxon deal
today in Sochi on Russia&#8217;s Black Sea coast, said it may generate
as much as $500 billion of investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Access to new resources is the life blood of oil
companies,&#8221; said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co.
in New York. &#8220;Russia is one of the largest resources that&#8217;s
still available. It&#8217;s like Exxon is now dating the girlfriend BP
had a few months ago.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest oil companies are competing for new oil
and gas reserves as countries such as Saudi Arabia shut out
foreign operators and the easiest-to-reach hydrocarbons are
exhausted. The Kara Sea fields are about the size of the U.K.
North Sea and may hold as much as 100 billion barrels of oil
equivalent, according to BP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based BP spokesman Mark Salt declined to comment on
the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliable Partner &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s government will support the Exxon-Rosneft alliance
&#8220;in every way,&#8221; Putin said. The Texas-based company will be
a &#8220;reliable, strategic and good partner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement allows Rosneft a chance to participate in
Exxon&#8217;s unconventional fields in the U.S., where oil and gas are
extracted by grinding rocks with sand, water and chemicals. The
two companies said they&#8217;ll study similar fields in western
Siberia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson attended the
signing between Neil Duffin, the company&#8217;s president for
development, and Rosneft CEO Eduard Khudainatov. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I take it as a strong statement of Russian intentions to
create competitive conditions to attract investments,&#8221;
Tillerson told reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Scary&#8217; $500 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putin said the investment need to develop all the fields
involved may reach as much as $500 billion once all the
associated infrastructure is built. &#8220;It&#8217;s scary to utter such
huge figures,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Rosneft on Jan. 27 signed a preliminary accord
for a $1 billion exploration project in the Black Sea&#8217;s
deepwater Tuapse Trough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe&#8217;s largest oil company, may
have let the opportunity slide, after Putin said in May that it
would be a &#8220;comfortable partner&#8221; to replace BP in the Kara
Sea. Shell, which works with state-controlled OAO Gazprom in
Siberia and Sakhalin Island, agreed to further expand
cooperation with the gas producer in June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Rosneft agreed on a $3.2 billion exploration
project in Russia&#8217;s Arctic waters and Black Sea, the companies
said today in a statement. The Moscow-based explorer may also
gain projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Texas, Putin said today
in Sochi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon will explore the Arctic Kara Sea blocks that Rosneft
had planned to develop with BP Plc (BP/) before that agreement fell
apart earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) stands to lose
its top spot among takeover advisers this year if ATT Inc. (T)
isn&#8217;t able to complete its $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA
Inc., the biggest deal of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collapse would move Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) into the No.
1 ranking with $346.8 billion in deals this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan has $341.5 billion,
excluding the ATT transaction, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT said today it will &#8220;vigorously contest&#8221; the U.S.
government&#8217;s lawsuit to block the proposed acquisition of T-
Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom AG. If those efforts fail,
ATT&#8217;s advisers, JPMorgan, Greenhill  Co. and Evercore Partners
Inc. (EVR), aren&#8217;t likely to get any significant fees for their work,
according to estimates by New York-based research firm Freeman 
Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s advisers, Morgan Stanley (MS), Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Citigroup Inc., may have to share
as little as $7 million to $9 million, or about one-tenth of an
original $70 million to $90 million in estimated fees, said Lam Nguyen, a Freeman vice president. It&#8217;s also possible, though
unlikely, that the Deutsche Telekom advisers could collect as
much as $60 million, or 1 percent of the estimated value of a $6
billion reverse breakup fee, Nguyen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Greenhill and Evercore would get $60 million to
$80 million in fees only if ATT is able to proceed with the
purchase, according to Nguyen. JPMorgan and other lenders are
still getting $20 million from committing to provide ATT a $20
billion loan to finance the purchase, Nguyen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for the banks advising Dallas-based ATT and
Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenhill Falls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenhill, which draws most of its revenue from providing
advice, fell 3.5 percent to $35.53 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, the day&#8217;s worst performance in
the 75-company Standard and Poor&#8217;s Midcap Financials Index.
Evercore gained 1.6 percent to $26.23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had been an adviser to Sprint Nextel Corp.,
which had been in talks to buy T-Mobile USA before ATT agreed
to a takeover, people familiar with the matter said in March.
The New York-based bank held the top spot in global MA advisory
every year from 2001 to 2008, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding transfers of government assets, the ATT deal is
the largest takeover proposed anywhere in the world since BHP
Billiton Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest mining company, offered $40
billion for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan last August. BHP&#8217;s bid
was blocked by the Canadian government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said it won a $96 million judgment against
Ecuador in an international arbitration case stemming from a
1990s oil-export dispute with the Latin American nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The
Hague resolved seven commercial claims over crude sales by the
Ecuadorian government from 1991 to 1993 from wells operated by
Texaco Inc., Kent Robertson, a spokesman for the San Ramon,
California-based company, said today in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuador overstated domestic crude demand to boost its share
of production from the Texaco-operated wells, and then sold the
oil on the international market, depriving Texaco of profits,
Robertson said. Texaco was acquired by Chevron in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ecuador rejects the final sentence given by the
arbitration court and considers that it has no legal validity
and represents a grave injustice,&#8221; Diego Garcia, Ecuador&#8217;s
attorney general, said today to reporters in Quito. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garcia said the panel didn&#8217;t have jurisdiction to decide
the case because a bilateral investment treaty between the U.S.
and Ecuador wasn&#8217;t in effect when Texaco quit the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuador plans to ask a district court in the Netherlands
within 90 days to invalidate the arbitration ruling, Garcia said.
Ecuador is prepared to appeal the case all the way to the
Netherlands&#8217;s highest court, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate case, Chevron is awaiting a ruling from the
Permanent Court of Arbitration on whether it&#8217;s liable for
environmental damage in Ecuador&#8217;s Amazon River basin. The
company was ordered in February by an Ecuadorian court to pay
$18 billion in damages and penalties for chemical-laden
wastewater dumped in the river when Texaco operated there from
1964 to 1992. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest oil company, sold offshore crude wells and other assets
from its XTO Energy unit for $182.5 million to Dynamic Offshore
Resources LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XTO assets, located in the Gulf of Mexico, will add the
equivalent of 13.5 million barrels of crude to Dynamic&#8217;s
reserves, the equivalent of a 31 percent increase, Houston-based
Dynamic said in an e-mailed statement today. Dynamic, a closely
held oil explorer backed by Riverstone Holdings LLC, filed a
prospectus last week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for an initial share sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties produce the equivalent of 7,000 barrels of
oil a day, Dynamic said. The reserves are comprised of 40
percent oil and the rest is natural gas, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, has said it&#8217;s selling lower
profit assets acquired in last year&#8217;s $34.9 billion acquisition
of XTO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, capping the best
eight-day gain since 2009 for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index,
as speculation the economy will keep expanding overshadowed a
tumble in ATT Inc. (T) following a government antitrust lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford Motor Co. (F) and Alcoa Inc. gained at least 2.3 percent
as companies most-tied to economic growth rallied. Joy Global
Inc. (JOYG) added 1.3 percent after the maker of mining equipment
forecast earnings that beat analysts&#8217; estimates. ATT tumbled
3.9 percent, limiting the market&#8217;s gain, as the U.S. government
sued to prevent its planned purchase of T-Mobile USA Inc.,
saying the deal would curb competition in the wireless market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 0.5 percent to 1,218.89 at 4 p.m. in New
York, after climbing 1.5 percent earlier. The benchmark gauge
surged 8.5 percent since Aug. 19 while still completing a fourth
straight monthly loss, the longest slump since March 2008. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average added 53.58 points, or 0.5 percent,
to 11,613.53 today, erasing its year-to-date decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People want to nibble because if we avert a recession
stocks would appear to be cheap,&#8221; Mark Luschini, chief
investment strategist at Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC, which manages $54 billion, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;At the same time, given the overall levels of
volatility, you know you can wake up and the market is easy up
or down 300 points. Part of that uncertainty is that investors
are dealing with the heavy hand of government intervention
infusing itself in the capital markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks advanced after reports showed U.S. business activity
and factory orders expanded at a faster pace than economists
forecast. The SP 500 pared its August decline to 5.7 percent,
still the biggest monthly retreat since May 2010. U.S. equities
rose yesterday after the Federal Reserve said some policy makers
wanted to take more action to stimulate the economy during their
meeting this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The economy is not falling off a cliff, and at the same
time, policy makers are aware that growth is slow and they are
prepared to do something to accelerate it,&#8221; Peter Jankovskis,
who helps manage about $2.6 billion at Oakbrook Investments in
Lisle, Illinois, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Much of the
selling that we&#8217;ve experienced was overdone and left the market
poised for a rally when sentiment began to change.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 slid 16 percent between July 22 and Aug. 19
after the U.S. government lost its AAA rating at SP and
investors speculated the European debt crisis was intensifying.
The index has rallied 8.9 percent since Aug. 8 after the SP 500
traded at 12.2 times earnings, the lowest level since 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Based on My Numbers&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, benchmark gauges pared gains after Nouriel Roubini, co-founder and chairman of Roubini Global Economics
LLC, said &#8220;we&#8217;re going into a recession based on my numbers&#8221;
while the Federal Reserve and other authorities no longer have
the ability to provide emergency support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have reached stall speed in the economy,&#8221; Roubini
said in an interview today on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
&#8220;InBusiness with Margaret Brennan.&#8221; &#8220;Unfortunately we are
running out of policy tools&#8221; in the U.S. and European
governments no longer have the resources to bail out their
troubled banks, said Roubini, also a professor at New York
University&#8217;s Stern School of Business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, numbers on the economy will &#8220;come out worse and
worse and worse&#8221; and the &#8220;markets are going to fizzle out,&#8221;
Roubini said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies whose
earnings are most-dependent on economic growth rallied 0.7
percent. Ford gained 2.3 percent to $11.12. Alcoa rose the most
in the Dow, gaining 3.6 percent to $12.80. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joy Global Rallies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joy Global advanced 1.3 percent to $83.45. The maker of PH
and Joy mining equipment lifted its earnings forecast in 2011 to
as much as $6 a share, exceeding the average analyst estimate of
$5.72, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT slumped 3.9 percent to $28.48. The U.S. government
said its purchase of T-Mobile would &#8220;substantially lessen
competition&#8221; in the wireless industry. The purchase would
combine the second- and fourth-largest mobile-phone carriers in
the country, surpassing No. 1 Verizon Wireless. Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ), which co-owns the biggest operator with
Vodafone Group Plc, fell 0.4 percent to $36.17. Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S) advanced 5.9 percent to $3.76. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson&#8217;s proposed
purchase of Bellevue, Washington-based T-Mobile, announced in
March, would combine the second- and fourth-largest carriers to
create a new market leader ahead of No. 1 Verizon Wireless. The
new company would dwarf current No. 3 carrier Sprint Nextel,
which argued against the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending Battle &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF) sank 7.5 percent to $6.96.
Billionaire Carl Icahn agreed to sell his Lions Gate shares for
$7 each, roughly his cost, to end a battle for control over the
independent film and television studio. The parties also agreed
to end all litigation, according to a statement issued yesterday
by Icahn and Lions Gate, the studio behind the &#8220;Saw&#8221; movies
and &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; TV show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pessimism about U.S. stocks among newsletter writers
increased to a one-year high, a bullish signal to analysts who
track investor sentiment as a contrarian indicator of equity
performance. The share of bearish publications among those
tracked by Investors Intelligence rose to 36.6 percent
yesterday, the highest since August 2010, from 33.3 percent a
week earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stock market is poised for a rebound if data begins
to be more encouraging,&#8221; Marshall Front, who helps oversee $600
million as chairman of Front Barnett Associates LLC in Chicago,
said in an interview. &#8220;Stocks have gotten to a point where they
are discounting a degree of slowness in the economy that is not
likely to evolve.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, settled a patent-infringement lawsuit with the Indian
generic-drug maker Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories Ltd. over the
cholesterol treatment Lipitor. The terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, sued Dr. Reddy&#8217;s in December
2009 to block generic copies of Lipitor from coming out before
Pfizer&#8217;s patent for the tablets expires in 2017. The companies
settled on Aug. 19, and U.S. District Judge Leonard P. Stark in
Wilmington, Delaware, dismissed the case Aug. 29, according to
court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have closed our litigation with Pfizer, but the date
of entry into the market is not yet confirmed,&#8221; Kedar Upadhye,
a spokesman for Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, of Hyderabad, India, announced the settlement
today in a statement. The agreement is subject to review by the
U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, the
company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can confirm that we have reached an agreement with Dr.
Reddy&#8217;s regarding a patent case involving Lipitor,&#8221; Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Terms
of the agreement are confidential.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Mylan Inc. also
have reached settlements with Pfizer to sell generic forms of
Lipitor, known chemically as atorvastatin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy Plans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY), the first company to seek
regulatory approval for its version, had planned to enter the
market on Nov. 30 -- with Teva, Mylan and other generic makers
beginning sales six months later as part of its deal with
Pfizer. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration investigation into
quality standards at two Ranbaxy plans and a federal probe of
its testing practices have delayed approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts including Edward J. Kelly of Credit Suisse AG have
said that Ranbaxy may have to sell its rights to be the only
approved generic on the market if it can&#8217;t pass regulatory
muster by November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) has a separate agreement with
Pfizer that would let it sell Lipitor without the brand label as
a so-called authorized generic beginning Nov. 30. The Watson-
sold drug doesn&#8217;t require FDA approval and wouldn&#8217;t be affected
by the Ranbaxy deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer v. Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, 1:09-cv-00943, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

Russia&#8217;s biggest oil producer, will announce joint international
projects by early next year, an official for the Moscow-based
company said today during a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will be entering on friendly terms, on a non-

business development, said on a conference call with investors
today. &#8220;We will complement our reserve base by quite
significant number.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s biggest company by market value, and
state-run Rosneft yesterday agreed on an alliance that would
give the U.S. company access to Russia&#8217;s Arctic resources by
exploring three blocks in the Kara Sea, while allowing Rosneft
to gain experience in deep-water and tight oil deposits in the
U.S. and other areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft and Exxon agreed to get access to &#8220;several select
high-quality exploration and production opportunities&#8221; in the
U.S., Canada and other countries, Svirshchevsky said, declining
to identify any projects. These include areas in the Gulf of
Mexico and onshore Texas, deep-water and tight oil fields, and
some projects are in the development stage, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was one of the aspects why the proposals from Exxon
Mobil was especially attractive to us,&#8221; Svirshchevsky said.
Exxon&#8217;s Hibernia project was listed in a presentation on
Rosneft&#8217;s website today. The Kommersant newspaper reported
earlier today that Rosneft may enter that development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Deal Collapsed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft&#8217;s original plan to develop its Kara Sea blocks in
the Arctic with BP Plc collapsed after the British oil
producer&#8217;s local billionaire partners blocked the deal, which
also involved a $7.8 billion share swap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland described
the deal, which she valued at $3.2 billion, as &#8220;another example
of the expanding relationship&#8221; between the U.S. and Russia.
Nuland said that President Barack Obama and President Dmitri Medvedev have been working on broadening economic and trade
ties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She declined to comment on whether the deal would draw
scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States, the inter-agency government group that reviews
transactions that may affect U.S. national security. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human behavior is increasing the
frequency and severity of natural disasters, according to
Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia University economist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying Hurricane Irene is an example of that, but
I am saying that when you look around the planet, every month
you are seeing more shocks, more frequently, more severe than at
any time in modern history,&#8221; Sachs said in a &#8220;Bloomberg
Surveillance&#8221; radio interview with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt.
&#8220;We are definitely in the midst of human-made natural
disasters.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Irene killed at least 40 people as it moved from
the Caribbean through New England, left an estimated $2.6
billion in damage and cut power to almost 8 million homes and
businesses along the U.S. East Coast. Tropical Storm Katia,
about 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers) from the southernmost Cape
Verde Islands, may be declared a hurricane later today,
according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Can one say that Katrina, or Irene or the massive floods
in Pakistan or drought in the horn of Africa are examples in
that instance of the long-term human induced change?&#8221; Sachs
said. &#8220;That is extremely difficult but on occasion it can be
done because the event is so extreme that one can say with a
very high assurance that that is human induced -- like the
massive heat waves that hit Europe a few years ago.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices of raw materials will not spur investors to finding
alternatives to commodities that cause climate change, said
Sachs, the director of Columbia&#8217;s Earth Institute and the
Quetelet Professor of Sustainable Development at the New York-
based university. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Odd Reality&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have the odd reality that we can dig up enough coal or
shale gas to wreck the planet before price scarcity itself is
going to choke this off,&#8221; Sachs said. &#8220;So we&#8217;re going to have
to make real, conscience choices rather than letting the market
itself decide.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm
of the U.S. Energy Department, estimates global coal reserves at
909 billion tons, a 129 year supply. Benchmark European coal
prices rose 50 cents or 0.4 percent, to $129.50 a metric ton
today in London. The five-year average price is $100.48 per
metric ton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve transitioned globally into a human-led environment
where human&#8217;s effects on carbon flows, energy flows, water flows
are so dominant now that we have changed the probability
distribution of when extreme droughts or hurricanes or heat
waves are hitting the planet,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), federal
regulators and investors are seeking more information about Bank
of America Corp.&#8217;s effort to resolve mortgage liabilities with
an $8.5 billion settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Federal Housing
Finance Agency, Goldman Sachs and pension funds are among those
who have objected to the agreement, saying they don&#8217;t have
sufficient information to evaluate the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs can&#8217;t determine whether &#8220;all investors who
are similarly situated will be treated equally&#8221; under the
settlement, the company said in a court filing late yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. A group of homeowners separately
sued Bank of America in federal court, seeking to block the
accord, claiming terms related to the servicing of mortgage
loans will accelerate home foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objections create more obstacles for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America as it seeks court approval for
the settlement to resolve claims from investors in Countrywide
Financial Corp. mortgage bonds. It acquired Countrywide in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal was negotiated with a group of institutional
investors, including BlackRock Inc. and Pacific Investment
Management Co., and would apply to investors outside that group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trustee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), the trustee for the
mortgage-securitization trusts covered by the agreement, asked a
New York state judge to approve the settlement. A hearing on the
matter was initially scheduled for November. New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman asked the judge to reject the accord
and said in court papers that he has potential claims against
Bank of America. An investor group is seeking to move the case
to federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that the trustee acted reasonably in entering
into the settlement, and that there are compelling reasons why
the agreement should receive judicial approval.&#8221; Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, said in an e-mail. He
declined to comment on the homeowner lawsuit. BNY Mellon
spokesman Kevin Heine declined to comment on the objections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement, which must be approved by a judge, is
important for Bank of America to put its mortgage liabilities
behind it, Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said
in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a possibility it gets thrown out,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know to handicap that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filed Objections &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those filing objections include American International
Group Inc. (AIG), the Federal Home Loan Banks of Boston, Chicago and
San Francisco, the Maine State Retirement System, and the
National Credit Union Administration, a federal agency that is
the liquidating agent for five corporate credit unions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are unable to evaluate the fairness of the
allocation of the settlement proceeds,&#8221; the Maine retirement
system said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC, the receiver for failed banks, said it owns
securities covered by the settlement. Andrew Gray, an FDIC
spokesman, said in an e-mail that the filing is a notice to
preserve its right to make claims as a part of the settlement
and seeks additional information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is not an evaluation or opinion on the settlement
itself,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FHFA, which regulates mortgage finance companies Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, said in a statement that it was also
seeking more information and &#8220;is aware of no basis upon which
it would raise a substantive objection to the proposed
settlement at this time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Nevada asked a federal judge in Reno to
terminate an earlier settlement with Bank of America which
involved home-loan modifications tied to its Countrywide unit,
saying the company hasn&#8217;t complied with terms of the accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America increased consumer interest rates and
monthly payments in violation of a consent decree and required
homeowners to provide extensive documentation to qualify for
modifications even though the settlement calls for a
&#8220;streamlined&#8221; approach, the state said yesterday in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state is seeking to file an amended complaint against
the bank with additional claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After two and a half years of lost implementation -- of
borrowers denied modifications, discouraged by repeated and
futile efforts to obtain help, or already subject to foreclosure
-- the state no longer can get the benefit of its original
settlement with defendants,&#8221; Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-cv-5988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The homeowner lawsuit is Iesu v. Bank of New York
Mellon, 11-6078, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). The Nevada case is State of Nevada v. Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), 11-cv-00135, U.S. District Court, District of
Nevada (Reno). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A possible European Union ban on
Syrian oil exports may boost demand for supertankers and have a
&#8220;significant&#8221; impact on depressed hire rates, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imposition of an embargo would require the EU to seek crude
oil from more distant suppliers, such as those in the Persian
Gulf, lenghtening journeys, Goldman said today in an e-mailed
report. Aframax vessels typically used to transport oil in the
Mediterranean Sea would be replaced with larger ships,
potentially increasing demand for supertankers by 2.5 percent,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diplomats from the 27-nation EU approved the oil embargo at
a meeting in Brussels on Aug. 29, expanding sanctions against
President Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s government for its deadly crackdown
on protesters, according to a person familiar with the matter.
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton announced the planned
embargo earlier this month, citing &#8220;intensifying large-scale
use of indiscriminate military force.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If implemented, this ban is likely to have a significant
impact on currently depressed VLCC rates,&#8221; Goldman analyst
Edouard Baldini wrote in the report, referring to supertankers,
which are also known as very large crude carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syria exports 162,000 barrels of light crude a day, with 88
percent heading for Europe, according to the report, citing data
from Lloyd&#8217;s List Intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is widening sanctions against Syria that include an
asset freeze and a travel ban on 50 people and nine entities
deemed &#8220;responsible for the violent repression against the
civilian population.&#8221; The United Nations puts the death toll at
more than 2,200. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tanks, Helicopters &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with the most serious threat to his family&#8217;s 40-year
rule, Assad has deployed tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and
helicopters to crush the uprising that began in mid-March after
revolts ousted the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt and sparked a
conflict in Libya. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU imports of crude oil from Syria in 2010 totaled 3.16
billion euros ($4.55 billion), according to the European
Commission, the bloc&#8217;s executive arm. The import ban will go
into effect after EU governments take a final decision
on the matter and it is published in the bloc&#8217;s Official Journal
in the coming days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Minus Rates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily rental income for supertankers on the benchmark Saudi
Arabia-to-Japan voyage plunged to minus $207 yesterday,
according to the Baltic Exchange in London. Earnings first
turned negative on Aug. 1, according to the exchange, and have
only been positive for seven days this month as a surplus of the
vessels persists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owners are contending with a supertanker fleet that&#8217;s the
largest in 29 years and growing at the fastest pace in more than
three decades, forcing freight rates to a 14-year low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supertankers carry about 2 million barrels of oil,
suezmaxes about half of that and aframaxes about 690,000
barrels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s coup in securing
access to OAO Rosneft&#8217;s Arctic oil frontier is the culmination
of almost 15 years of effort by Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson to expand its position in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s partnership with Rosneft will allow the company to
tap into a region potentially containing tens of billions of
barrels of oil. Exxon beat rivals, including BP Plc, Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) and Chevron Corp. (CVX), to gain its piece of one of the
globe&#8217;s last undeveloped oil provinces. In return, Exxon is
providing Rosneft with the capital and expertise it needs to
help Russia hold on as the world&#8217;s biggest oil producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson, who oversaw Russia&#8217;s first offshore project in
Arctic conditions in the 1990s, is reversing course in a country
that he criticized for its lack of transparency as recently as
three years ago. The agreement with Rosneft is his biggest deal
since the $35 billion acquisition of U.S. shale gas producer XTO
Energy Inc. in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Between Russia and the XTO deal, Tillerson has put
together a big resource base for the end of the decade,&#8221; said
Jason Gammel, an oil industry analyst at Macquarie Capital Ltd.
in London. &#8220;Whoever succeeds him will be very happy with the
job he&#8217;s done.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Rosneft plan to spend an initial $3.2 billion
exploring Russia&#8217;s Arctic offshore and the Black Sea. Exxon has
agreed to give Rosneft stakes in some of its deep-water Gulf of
Mexico projects and fields in Texas, making it the first major
Russian oil producer to develop U.S. deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Large Scale&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This large-scale partnership represents a significant
strategic step by both companies,&#8221; said Tillerson, who attended
the signing of the agreement in Sochi, Russia, with Rosneft CEO
Eduard Khudainatov, presided over by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. &#8220;This agreement takes our relationship to a new level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has had operations in Russia dating back to the late
1980s. Tillerson took responsibility for the company&#8217;s holdings
in Russia and the Caspian Sea in the 1990s. In 1998, he was
named vice president of Exxon Ventures (CIS) Inc. and president
of Exxon Neftegas Ltd., a role that included oversight of
Exxon&#8217;s Sakhalin I project in Russia&#8217;s far east. At its height,
the project produced about 250,000 barrels of crude a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sakhalin was a big achievement,&#8221; Macquarie&#8217;s Gammel said
in an interview. Rosneft &#8220;is their next big step into Russia.
Insofar as Exxon has a position in Russia it&#8217;s due to
Tillerson&#8217;s efforts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sakhalin Experience &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his Sakhalin experience, Tillerson never lost his
appetite for Russian ventures even as then-President Putin&#8217;s
government rebuffed foreign companies to take tighter control of
its oil and natural-gas resources eight years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain interested, we remain engaged,&#8221; Tillerson said
a few months after stepping into the CEO job at Exxon in 2006.
&#8220;When the time is right, we&#8217;ll find something to do there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lack of faith in Russia&#8217;s investment climate may have
held him back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson criticized Russia&#8217;s legal system, telling the St.
Petersburg International Forum in 2008, that there was &#8220;no
confidence in the rule of law in Russia.&#8221; That echoed comments
made by Lee Raymond, Tillerson&#8217;s predecessor as CEO, who said in
a 2004 interview that an earlier comment he&#8217;d made that Russia
was a safe place to invest, may have been &#8220;premature.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Exxon was negotiating what might have been the
company&#8217;s most significant investment in Russia to that point, a
stake in OAO Yukos Oil Co., led by Russian billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Pressure on Exxon to gain access to Russia&#8217;s
immense reserves had increased after London-based BP Plc (BP/) formed
its TNK-BP joint venture with OAO Tyumen Oil Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yukos Talks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yukos talks, confirmed by Putin, fell apart and
Khodorkovsky was jailed in 2003. Rosneft bought Yukos&#8217;s main
producing asset in 2004, after the state claimed it and
auctioned it for unpaid taxes. Yukos was forced into bankruptcy
in August 2006 as a barrage of tax claims continued. Rosneft
acquired the bulk of the remaining Yukos assets at liquidation
auctions in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, it appeared as if no American-Russian oil and
gas collaboration was going to be able to succeed, said Amy
Myers Jaffe, an energy analyst at Rice University in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russians &#8220;weren&#8217;t interested in negotiating with
anyone, and it got to the point where no one was interested in
investing in their country,&#8221; Jaffe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That thinking began to change as Russia realized it needed
the expertise and technology of international oil companies to
maintain its position as the world&#8217;s biggest oil producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex Deposits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless it was able to develop resources in increasingly
complex deposits in harsh environments, production would
decline, Chris Weafer, chief strategist at Troika Dialog Group
Ltd. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Russia needs to ensure that it remains the world&#8217;s
largest energy producer for both domestic and external political
reasons,&#8221; Weafer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, BP was the first to secure a deal with Rosneft
to develop its Arctic reserves in the Kara Sea. Less than two
weeks later, Rosneft announced a $1 billion accord with Exxon to
explore for oil in the Black Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP&#8217;s $7.8 billion share swap agreement fell apart after the
U.K. explorer&#8217;s billionaire partners in TNK-BP blocked the deal
this year. Shell and Chevron also had expressed interest in
partnering with Rosneft in the Arctic before Exxon won the
alliance yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kara Sea &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three blocks in the Kara Sea fields in the accord are
about the size of the U.K. North Sea and may hold as much as 100
billion barrels of oil equivalent, according to BP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership also allows Rosneft a chance to participate
in Exxon&#8217;s deep-water projects in the Gulf of Mexico and its
unconventional fields in Texas, where oil and gas are extracted
by cracking open rocks with sand, water and chemicals. The two
companies said they&#8217;ll study the potential for similar so-called
tight oil fields in western Siberia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell, Europe&#8217;s largest oil company, was described by Putin
in May as a potential &#8220;comfortable partner&#8221; to replace BP in
the Kara Sea. Shell, which works with state-controlled OAO
Gazprom in Siberia and Sakhalin Island, agreed to further expand
cooperation with the gas producer in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron pulled out as Rosneft&#8217;s partner in the Val
Shatskogo exploration project in Russia&#8217;s Black Sea this year.
Chevron is &#8220;looking to partner with Rosneft on other
opportunities in the Arctic or elsewhere in Russia,&#8221; Kurt Glaubitz, a company spokesman, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF), the investment
bank that&#8217;s been expanding since the financial crisis, hired
Christopher Burns as a managing director in the firm&#8217;s leveraged
finance investment-banking group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burns was previously co-head of industrials leveraged
finance in the investment-banking division of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), New York-based Jefferies said today in a statement.
He worked in mergers and acquisitions investment banking at
Merrill Lynch  Co. and was a senior underwriter in structured
finance at Fleet Boston Financial, according to the statement.
Burns will be based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies has been adding managing directors from some of
the biggest U.S. banks. In June, Jefferies said it hired Brian Chadwick from Goldman Sachs as a managing director for U.S.
rates sales. The firm said this week it added David Luse in the
financial sponsors investment-banking group from Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) Revenue in Jefferies&#8217;s investment-banking unit reached a
quarterly record in the three months ended May 31, increasing 28
percent to $328.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The addition of Chris Burns and his significant
leveraged-finance experience and client relationships in the
industrials sector is part of our ongoing strategy to build on
this momentum and provide best-in-class execution to our
clients,&#8221; Benjamin Lorello, global head of investment banking
and capital markets at Jefferies, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

Cohan" date="Sep 01, 2011  7:46 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-01/rogers-shuns-goldman-glare-to-gain-power-while-outlasting-corzine-paulson.html"><headline>Rogers Shuns Goldman Glare to Gain Power While Outlasting Corzine, Paulson</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;John F. W. Rogers is known on Wall
Street for four initials and an enviable fact of corporate
geography. The F. and W. stand for Francis and William, though
why Rogers uses them both is one of several mysteries he has
either gone out of his way to cultivate or never seen fit to
explain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Why does he have that extra initial that everybody else
doesn&#8217;t have?&#8221; asks Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman and chief
executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Blankfein truly wanted to find out, he could walk three
feet and ask. Rogers&#8217;s office in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s lush,
$2.4&#160;billion downtown Manhattan headquarters is right next to
Blankfein&#8217;s and a few steps away from that of Goldman Sachs
President Gary D. Cohn, Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its
Sept. 5 edition. Prior to Blankfein and Cohn&#8217;s arrival at the
top of the Goldman Sachs food chain, Rogers sat next to Hank Paulson, the previous CEO (1999-2006) whose appointment as U.S.
Treasury Secretary Rogers helped grease. Prior to Paulson,
Rogers sat next to Goldman Sachs CEO Jon Corzine (1994-99). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He is an extraordinarily loyal person,&#8221; says former
Goldman Sachs colleague Jud Sommer, who is now the senior
adviser to government affairs at UnitedHealth Group Inc. &#8220;But
that is a pretty extraordinary segue for any human being in any
setting, anywhere, at a professional level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond Rogers&#8217;s ability to adapt, the inference is that
Goldman Sachs is not made up of ordinary human beings in an
ordinary setting or profession. It&#8217;s made up of incredibly
competitive people in one of the world&#8217;s most cutthroat
businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a Dealmaker &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average partner serves just eight years. Unlike
Blankfein, Cohn, Paulson, Corzine, and dozens more at Goldman
Sachs whom he has served and outlasted, Rogers is not a
dealmaker or trader. He has no revenue-generating
responsibilities and strives to have virtually no public
profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet many of those who follow Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Kremlinology
describe Rogers, 55, as the single most powerful person at the
firm over the past decade. One Goldman Sachs partner, who asked
not to be named because he fears damaging his relationship with
Rogers, describes him as Colossus bestriding the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April&#160;2011, Blankfein promoted Rogers to be one of 11
&#8220;executive officers&#8221; at Goldman Sachs, a title without much
substance other than that it forced Rogers for the first time to
share in the pain of public disclosure. (He has Goldman Sachs
stock worth around $30&#160;million and options worth several
millions more.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Relations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press-shy Rogers&#8217;s work portfolio includes
responsibility for press and public relations and the firm&#8217;s
government affairs office in Washington. He also oversees
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s considerable philanthropic efforts, which the
firm has not been shy about using to try to counter the barrage
of criticism levied against it in the wake of the financial
crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s a major fixing agent" in a "chemical sense,&#8221; explains
Lucas van Praag, a former British naval officer and current 
Goldman Sachs partner who heads press relations and reports to 
Rogers. &#8220;He makes sure that the DNA Goldman knows and loves 
stays in place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he&#8217;s not globe-trotting with Blankfein, Rogers
commutes every week between Washington, where he owns an
$8.4&#160;million home on Embassy Row, and New York, where he stays
in a suite at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel on Central Park South. His
wife, Deborah Lehr, a former senior negotiator on China trade
policy in the Clinton Administration, lives in Washington with
the couple&#8217;s two young children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Smiley &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers is of average height, doughy, and a year or two away
from needing a full comb-over of his flaxen hair. He can be
charming and witty, but seldom conspicuously so. His passing
resemblance to the late Sir Alec Guinness in the actor&#8217;s
portrayal of John le Carre&#8217;s ueber-spy, George Smiley, is widely
remarked upon within Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others find a more modern, less sinister analog: Michael
Clayton, the George Clooney character who called himself a
corporate &#8220;janitor.&#8221; (Full disclosure: Without Rogers&#8217;s
approval in 2010, it is unlikely I would have been permitted
access to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s current and former senior executives
for my book about the firm.) Rogers is unfailingly described by
friends and foes as a master tactician with a long record of
behind-the-scenes accomplishments, yet his indispensability
stems in large part from how little he cares about being
recognized for those accomplishments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reagan&#8217;s Plaque &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard, Rogers appears to have internalized an
aphorism that his hero and former boss, Ronald Reagan, had on a
small plaque in the Oval Office: &#8220;There is no limit to what a
man can do or where he can go if he does not mind who gets the
credit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers serves on the board of the Ronald Reagan Centennial
Commission and is treasurer of the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Foundation and Library. He also helped organize Reagan&#8217;s state
funeral and gave $250,000 to help underwrite the cost of the
Reagan statue that stands in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Goldman Sachs, though, he rarely discusses politics,
his personal life, or what he did before arriving at the firm in
1994. A Goldman Sachs partner, who asked not to be named because
he was not authorized to speak about Rogers&#8217;s motivations, says
invisibility is part of a master plan in which Rogers hopes to
achieve absolute deniability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate CEO, Chairman &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This deniability is not always used for benign purposes.
After Paulson announced his departure from Goldman Sachs in June
2006, Rogers, according to a former senior executive close to
him, led a brief push to prevent Blankfein, Paulson&#8217;s chosen
successor, from filling Paulson&#8217;s roles as both CEO and chairman
of the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bloomberg News report at the time noted that &#8220;some board
members&#8221; considered &#8220;naming a separate chairman&#8221; such as
Stephen Friedman, the former senior partner at Goldman Sachs who
had been an merger-and-acquisitions guy, to complement
Blankfein&#8217;s sales and trading background. The same former
executive says Rogers is so good that Blankfein didn&#8217;t even know
that Rogers was behind it. Blankfein concedes as much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t have occurred to me that John would&#8217;ve
initiated that,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not in a position to deny
it. I just don&#8217;t know.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Praag, the Goldman Sachs spokesman, says Rogers was not
the person who suggested splitting the roles and that &#8220;John
flatly denies having suggested the idea to anyone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given his preference for invisibility, it&#8217;s no surprise
that Rogers declined multiple requests to be interviewed for
this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career Killer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the dozen or so friends and colleagues who did
agree to be interviewed pointed out that Rogers&#8217;s absence from a
profile about himself is typical. Several noted that their
inability to speak on the record for fear of reprisal is a
perfect example of how Rogers doesn&#8217;t need recognition to be
powerful. One former Goldman Sachs colleague, after conceding
that he&#8217;s afraid of Rogers, added that Rogers has an old-school
sense of omerta. If wronged, his vengeance can kill careers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When David Gergen arrived at the White House in 1975 as
director of communications to President Gerald R. Ford, he found
his Old Executive Office Building office empty. A bureaucrat
told him he could speak with the General Services Administration
and wait two months to get a chair or he could call John Rogers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influential Intern &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers was then an 18-year-old student at George Washington
University with an internship in the White House&#8217;s speechwriting
and research office. Gergen called Rogers, and the next day he
had a desk, a couch, a TV and some artwork. Gergen was so
impressed that he asked Rogers to be his research assistant
while Rogers remained in college. &#8220;He became a legend within
the White House,&#8221; says Gergen, who claims credit for
discovering &#8220;the phenomenon of John Rogers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s now almost impossible to imagine Rogers outside of
Wall Street or the Beltway, but he was not born to power. He was
raised in Seneca Falls, New York, near the Finger Lakes, where
his father owned a wholesale frozen foods business and his
mother was a dental hygienist. Throughout high school, Rogers
worked in the family business as a salesman. But his passion was
politics, as it&#8217;s played inside the Beltway. Thanks in part to a
scholarship from his high school, Rogers attended George
Washington. After meeting Gergen, his career path was set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gergen, then exclusively a Republican, returned to the
White House as director of communications and an assistant to
President Reagan in 1980. Rogers followed, and at age 24 he was
handed responsibility for the administrative management of the
White House. In June&#160;1983, at 27, Rogers became the youngest
person ever to be named an assistant to the president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Perq Meister&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York Times profile that year described Rogers as the
White House&#8217;s &#8220;Perq Meister&#8221; and &#8220;an affable man of boundless
self-confidence&#8221; who &#8220;thrives in the shark-infested waters of
White House politics.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Rogers fell the tasks of deciding who got to use the
White House tennis court, who received parking spaces in the lot
on West Executive Drive, and who got television sets in their
offices. An unnamed colleague explained to the Times that Rogers
was &#8220;in love with this place and knows how to make the little
things work. He can talk to the telephone operators, the guy at
the Xerox machine, and the Big Four&#8221; -- the president&#8217;s top
aides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He had the tough job in the White House of dealing with
all of the things that determine status,&#8221; says James A. Baker III, who was then Reagan&#8217;s chief of staff and took Rogers with
him to Treasury in 1984. &#8220;Nothing is fought over more
vigorously in the White House than office location, parking
spaces, titles, and things like that, and John was just an
extraordinarily fine hand for me in all of those various roles,
whether it was at the White House or the Treasury or the State
Department.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opera, Art &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time, Rogers had matured into an opera buff, a
collector of Russian art, a ballroom dancer, a member of the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, a member of the board
of trustees of the National Building Museum, the presidential
representative to the board of trustees of the U.S. Capitol
Historic Society, and the director of the Committee for the 50th
American Presidential Inauguration. He&#8217;s also on the board of
the Smithsonian Institution and almost single-handedly pushed
through restorations of the Old Executive Office Building and
the historic Cash Room at the U.S. Treasury. In 1985 he was
awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal, which he keeps on his
desk at Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief stint in the private sector with Washington
commercial real estate firm Oliver Carr, Rogers served as Under
Secretary of State for Management in the George H. W. Bush
Administration before moving to Houston with Baker in 1992 to
help establish the James A. Baker III Institute for Public
Policy at Rice University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powerful Mentors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His relationship with Baker was characteristic of Rogers&#8217;s
deft touch with powerful mentors. When the Soviet Union
dissolved on Baker&#8217;s watch, it was Rogers who had the idea of
giving him the Soviet flag that had flown for 40 years in the
State Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He has what I&#8217;d call an exquisite attention to detail,&#8221;
says Baker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers was trailed to Houston by allegations that someone
at the State Department had rifled through Bill Clinton&#8217;s
passport file before the election to determine whether he had
ever contemplated renouncing his citizenship. Rogers denied
authorizing any such search and told investigators he reported
the incident to Lawrence Eagleburger, the acting Secretary of
State. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking a Job &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker says Rogers would have been happy to stay at Rice in
a senior administrative job, &#8220;but with the administration in
power at that time at Rice it just didn&#8217;t work out.&#8221; (Rogers
remains on the Baker Institute Advisory Board.) So the Texas
political brain trust went to work to find Rogers a new group of
powerful people to serve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Strauss founded the law firm of Akin Gump Strauss
Hauer  Feld in 1945. Now 92, he&#8217;s been a member of the
Washington elite for so long that his political activity dates
to 1937, when he volunteered for fellow Texan Lyndon B. Johnson&#8217;s first congressional campaign. It was natural for Baker
to call Strauss in 1994 while casting about for new positions
for his favorite aide -- just as it was natural for Strauss to
know exactly how to engineer a soft and remunerative landing for
Rogers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call to Corzine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss had served as a longtime political mentor to Robert Rubin, the former co-senior partner at Goldman Sachs. When Rubin
left the company in January 1993 to become the senior economic
adviser to President Clinton, his co-partner, Steve Friedman,
took over running the firm. But in 1994, Friedman unexpectedly
decided to retire. Concerned that he&#8217;d become a lame duck if he
announced his decision widely, Friedman told only two people:
Rubin, during a private meeting at the White House, and Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s general counsel. Knowing that the firm&#8217;s leadership was
about to change dramatically, Rubin recommended that Strauss
call Corzine, then Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-head of fixed income, to
see about a job for Rogers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, the pairing of Rogers and Corzine seemed
odd. Rogers is a devout Republican, Corzine an avowed Democrat.
Also, Rogers didn&#8217;t have the first clue about debt markets or
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Corzine seemed like a good horse to back, and there
was precedent at Goldman Sachs for top government officials
joining the firm, starting in 1969, when Henry Fowler, Lyndon
Johnson&#8217;s Treasury Secretary, joined Goldman Sachs as a partner.
(Sidney Weinberg, the firm&#8217;s longtime senior partner, had
recommended Fowler to Johnson. While at Goldman Sachs, Fowler
introduced Rubin to Strauss.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28 Interviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers likes to tell people that he endured 28 interviews
before getting hired as Corzine&#8217;s chief of staff. Perhaps, but
he hardly entered Goldman Sachs through the mailroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea, in 1994, of an important partner having his own
chief of staff was unprecedented not only at Goldman Sachs but
anywhere on Wall Street, and Rogers struggled to define the
role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That changed on Labor Day that year, when Friedman finally
made his retirement public. After a week of frantic maneuvering
involving Paulson, Corzine, Friedman, and the other partners on
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 12-person management committee, Corzine emerged
as the new senior partner. Rogers, who had watched from the
sidelines, became his consigliere, with Hank Paulson as
Corzine&#8217;s second-in-command. Corzine declined a request to be
interviewed for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media Troubles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on, Corzine and Paulson determined that Goldman Sachs
needed public-relations help. After Friedman&#8217;s abdication, huge
trading losses prompted some high-profile partner departures --
and a pummeling of the firm in the media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Rogers remained on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s payroll, Corzine
and Paulson arranged for him to be seconded to Gershon Kekst,
the dean of Wall Street public relations who had Goldman Sachs
as a client. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gershon really took him under his wing,&#8221; says Paulson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kekst, now 76, is famous for his Sphinx-like demeanor; what
he delivers most for his clients is sophisticated silence in the
face of press inquiries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon enough, Rogers was proving himself indispensable to
his patrons. One Goldman Sachs executive, who requested
anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about Rogers,
describes him as a great technocrat who&#8217;s particularly adept at
workflows, systems, and efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson&#8217;s Coup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good fortune found Rogers again in 1999 after Paulson
pulled off a coup that removed Corzine from power. Rogers, says
a former colleague who was not authorized to speak on the record
and asked not to be named because the two have a close personal
relationship, thought he was going to get whacked, especially
since, according to Paulson, he had been so closely associated
with Corzine and did not know the power play was coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Paulson put Rogers on the management committee,
made him secretary to the board after the firm&#8217;s initial public
offering in May 1999, and encouraged him to wade into the most
important aspects of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He and I started talking strategically about the client
business,&#8221; Paulson says. &#8220;Why was it important that I spend
time in Japan? Why in China? Why in Germany? He made sure that I
met Angela Merkel well before she became chancellor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers also helped Paulson set up and execute the
Chairman&#8217;s Forum, a long series of meetings that Paulson had
with small groups of the firm&#8217;s managing directors around the
world, as well as Pine Street, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s leadership
training institute modeled after General Electric Co.&#8217;s
Crotonville program. Then, Rogers helped recruit Steven Kerr,
the head of Crotonville, to run Pine Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardian of Culture &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a mere five years at the firm, Rogers emerged as the
foremost guardian of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s partnership culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our bankers travel on the same planes as our
competitors,&#8221; he said as part of a 2006 Harvard Business School
case about Pine Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We stay in the same hotels. In a lot of cases, we have
the same clients as our competition. So when it comes down to
it, it is a combination of execution and culture that makes the
difference between us and other firms,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;That&#8217;s why
our culture is necessary -- it&#8217;s the glue that binds us
together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, Rogers was the driving force behind hiring
documentarian Ric Burns to make a film about Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
history and culture. The film, for internal use only, should be
finished within a year, at a cost the firm wouldn&#8217;t disclose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 11 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers is more than merely skilled at catering to people in
power. He&#8217;s an artist. After Sept. 11, he arranged for Paulson,
who was in China when the jets hit the World Trade Center
towers, to be one of the last people to land back home, with
U.S. Air Force escorts. Rogers encouraged Paulson to be the
first CEO to visit China in the wake of the SARS crisis, a
decision that led to a secret dinner with two Chinese leaders in
June 2003 that gave Goldman Sachs early entree to China&#8217;s wave
of investment banking business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#8217;s less clear is whether he&#8217;s any good at the rest of
his job. Under Rogers&#8217;s watch as head of press and government
relations, Goldman Sachs has become known as both &#8220;Government
Sachs&#8221; and &#8220;a giant vampire squid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &#8220;The Promise,&#8221; by Bloomberg contributor
Jonathan Alter, the &#8220;angriest&#8221; President Barack Obama got
during his first year in office was when he heard Blankfein
justify the firm&#8217;s $16.2&#160;billion of 2009 bonuses by claiming
&#8220;Goldman was never in danger of collapse&#8221; during the financial
crisis that began in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rock Stars &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama told a friend that Blankfein&#8217;s statement was &#8220;flatly
untrue&#8221; and added, for good measure, &#8220;These guys want to be
paid like rock stars when all they&#8217;re doing is lip-syncing
capitalism.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says van Praag: &#8220;I&#8217;m not in a position to comment on Mr.
Alter&#8217;s book, but on multiple occasions we have expressed our
gratitude to the U.S. government and taxpayers for their action
during the crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs insiders marvel at how Rogers has retained
his Teflon coating -- and Blankfein&#8217;s confidence -- in the wake
of the firm&#8217;s vilification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers faced the greatest threat of his Goldman Sachs
tenure in April&#160;2010, when the firm was hit with twin crises:
the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s civil lawsuit over
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s infamous Abacus deal, which accused the firm of
misleading investors for failing to fully disclose the role of
hedge-fund investor John Paulson, and the subsequent 11-hour
public flogging at the hands of the Senate&#8217;s permanent
subcommittee on investigations. It was a conflation of poor
government affairs and horrible public relations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Target &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the least, Rogers could claim credit for having
predicted it. According to van Praag, Rogers warned colleagues
that the firm&#8217;s 2007 success -- it made $17.2&#160;billion in pretax
income while the rest of Wall Street was imploding -- followed
by its 2009 performance -- nearly $20&#160;billion, pretax -- made it
literally too rich a target for Congress and the public to
resist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He said there would be some investigations and we would
likely be the primary focus,&#8221; says van Praag. &#8220;He was right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A consensus quickly developed among Goldman Sachs&#8217;s top
executives, including Rogers, that the Abacus suit had to be
settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To be sued by our regulator was devastating,&#8221; explains
van Praag. &#8220;What mattered was resolving it. We couldn&#8217;t be at
war with our regulator.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Admission &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs settled with the SEC in July&#160;2010, paying a
$550&#160;million fine, the largest in Wall Street history. Goldman
Sachs neither admitted nor denied the SEC&#8217;s allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was far less consensus about how the firm should
handle the Senate investigation. According to several Goldman
Sachs executives, van Praag and others thought the firm should
engage in a massive, public mea culpa and explain to the
senators that of course the company had regrets about its
behavior and that in retrospect it would have done things
differently. Moving forward, Goldman Sachs could make amends by
firing the responsible people and donating $1&#160;billion or so to
charity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the other camp were executives, including Rogers, who
preferred defiance. Rogers was convinced that Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat and subcommittee chairman, would
use the April hearing and his investigation for theatrics -- he
was right about that -- and Goldman Sachs would best be served
by admitting little wrongdoing. Rather, it would hunker down and
explain its role as a market maker by providing sophisticated
investors the risks they wanted at prices they were willing to
pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front Row &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, was the message the world heard repeatedly
during the Levin hearing. Throughout most of the proceedings,
Rogers could be seen in the front row of the public gallery,
just behind the testifying Goldman Sachs executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s now a fair amount of second-guessing about Rogers&#8217;s
hard-line approach. One former Goldman Sachs executive, who
still works with the firm and feared reprisals for speaking
about Rogers on the record, says the company has lost the
reservoir of goodwill it built up among the journalists who
cover it and that the government now has a bias toward
skepticism of its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tension over the firm&#8217;s punching bag status exists
primarily between Rogers and van Praag. According to people
familiar with both men and their relationship, van Praag
advocated a more accommodating approach to Levin and his
investigation -- and absorbed the public blame for the bad
headlines when Rogers&#8217;s strategy won the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Odds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Martin, the CEO of public-relations firm Hill 
Knowlton, has been in meetings with both Rogers and van Praag
and says he&#8217;s seen them &#8220;disagree aggressively, but that at the
end of the day they come together as one.&#8221; A Goldman Sachs
managing director calls it the greatest psychodrama he&#8217;s ever
seen, while several former Goldman executives wonder why a firm
that demands Olympian performance in so many areas has indulged
a fractured message and poor performance in this one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his part, Blankfein says he has confidence in Rogers
and van Praag and that dissent and disagreement is healthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the context of what we just lived through at the firm,
there were a lot of opportunities for very tense situations,&#8221;
Blankfein explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We managed to really avoid them, which, if you think
about it, is pretty amazing,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There haven&#8217;t been a
lot of people trying to push people off ledges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firm Made Mistakes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein says he is not contemplating any personnel
changes, though he concedes that the firm has made its share of
public relations mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political environment in which Goldman Sachs operates
-- along with every major Wall Street firm -- has changed
dramatically in the wake of the financial crisis and the 2008
election. It no longer works to Rogers&#8217;s advantage. Where once
he had a surfeit of relationships across Republican Washington
and easy access to his former boss and patron, Paulson, at
Treasury, and his former partner, Josh Bolten, the White House
chief of staff, things are chillier now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama invited Blankfein and his wife, Laura, to a state
dinner in April. Blankfein and Timothy Geithner chatted for 10
minutes on Jan.&#160;10, according to Geithner&#8217;s calendar. No other
official contact has been reported since March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Jake Siewert, who just completed a two-year
stint as an adviser to Geithner, other than attending the
occasional financial services forum with Blankfein, Rogers is a
nonentity at Treasury. Siewert added that Rogers&#8217;s relationship
with Mark Patterson, Geithner&#8217;s chief of staff, is particularly
strained, and with good reason: Patterson departed abruptly from
Goldman Sachs in April 2008 after four years as its chief
lobbyist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobbying Team &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers&#8217;s job does not call for direct lobbying. To do that,
he has put together a team of ex-government staffers including
Michael Pease, a former aide to Representative Barney Frank, the
Massachusetts Democrat; Russell Horwitz, who used to work for
Gene Sperling, chairman of the National Economic Council; and
Dina Powell, a former personnel director at the White House for
George W. Bush and then an Assistant Secretary of State for
Educational and Cultural Affairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powell is now head of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, and her
various initiatives -- 10,000 Women and 10,000 Small Businesses
-- have won her and Rogers invites to visit with Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton and Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influence Diminished &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is clearly too big for Washington to ignore,
whether it&#8217;s occasional visits with key players or, more
substantively, trips to the SEC and U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission to help flesh out the new regulations still
being written under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act. But there&#8217;s no question that Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s influence and swagger have been diminished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Rogers remains indisputably good at is keeping his
garden well tended. In June 2006, Rogers played a big role in
luring Robert B. Zoellick to Goldman Sachs as a vice-chairman
and the chairman of the firm&#8217;s international board of advisers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers and Zoellick had known each other since 1985, when
they both worked at Treasury. After a stint as deputy to
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Zoellick turned to Rogers,
among others, to explore private-sector opportunities. Once at
Goldman Sachs, Rogers also helped Zoellick figure out how to
make the company work for him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;John is somebody who is sincerely interested in helping
people,&#8221; says Zoellick. &#8220;Not just in my case because I was a
senior person leaving the Administration -- but frankly he&#8217;s
helped a lot of little people as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreams of Writing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 17 years and counting in his Goldman Sachs tenure,
Rogers has already been at the firm longer than he was in
government. Friends say he was never motivated by money and has
more than he could ever need. He&#8217;s mentioned an admiration for
the writer Robert Caro and is said to dream of one day penning a
presidential biography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others think Rogers is a prime candidate for a cabinet post
the next time a Republican administration comes to town.
Zoellick says Rogers is &#8220;sui generis&#8221; and would be that rare
individual who would see opportunity in running an agency like
the Internal Revenue Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoellick left Goldman Sachs in 2007 to become the 11th
president of the World Bank. He and Rogers are currently working
together to help Republican Senator John McCain set up an as-
yet-unannounced public policy center at Arizona State
University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;John, in addition to being a student of organizations, is
a student of power,&#8221; Zoellick explains. &#8220;But he&#8217;s learned one
of the most important lessons that many students of power don&#8217;t
learn, which is that part of being a master of power is using
power with discretion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A federal agency may have violated
U.S. procurement laws when it selected Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s
products over Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s without full competition for a
planned $59.3 million e-mail services contract, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, vying with Microsoft to gain a foothold in the $20
billion government cloud-computing market, sued the U.S.
Interior Department in October over the contract. In a complaint
filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, lawyers
for Google said the agency didn&#8217;t fully consider the company&#8217;s
&#8220;Google Apps for Government&#8221; product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a justifiable basis for me to find&#8221; violations
of procurement laws, Judge Susan Braden said today at a hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braden said she had written a 41-page opinion and will
issue it next week after deciding whether to require the agency
to hire an independent expert. That expert would evaluate
whether Google&#8217;s products meet the agency&#8217;s security needs, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The public interest would be well-served by doing that,&#8221;
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braden ordered the Interior in January to hold off on
making an award while she considered the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government spends $80 billion a year on
information technology and plans to move as much as one quarter
of that to so-called cloud computing, which allows governments
and businesses to have software and data delivered as a service
over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2010, Interior officials signed a decision
establishing the Microsoft product as the agency&#8217;s choice for
cloud e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Private Cloud&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency issued a request on Aug. 30, 2010, for bids
seeking a Microsoft product, Business Productivity Online
Services-Federal, from resellers. Interior officials said the
agency required a &#8220;private cloud&#8221; for security reasons, and
noted Microsoft offered the only such product available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google filed a protest of the contract with the Government
Accountability Office, which decides contract-award disputes.
Google sued after the GAO rejected its protest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said in court filings that the government&#8217;s request
was overly restrictive because its products meet federal
security standards. The Mountain View, California-based company
said Interior Department officials refused to provide details of
its requirements to shut it out of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, isn&#8217;t a party in
the case. Softchoice Corp. (SO) based in Toronto, a reseller of
Microsoft products and other software, is involved in the
litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Kovacs, a Google spokesman, declined to comment
after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Google Inc. v. U.S., 10-743, U.S. Court of
Federal Claims (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

Moore" date="Sep 01, 2011  2:54 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-01/goldman-sachs-ocwen-reach-accord-with-new-york-state-to-end-robo-signing.html"><headline>Goldman Will Pay Penalties, Alter Practices to Win Approval of Litton Sale</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
pay future Federal Reserve penalties and write down $53 million
of mortgage loans in New York to gain approval for its sale of
Litton Loan Servicing LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed ordered Goldman Sachs to conduct an independent
review of Litton&#8217;s foreclosures in 2009 and 2010 to address a
&#8220;pattern of misconduct and negligence,&#8221; the regulator said
today in a statement. Litton&#8217;s sale to Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) was
completed today after reaching accords with the Fed and New York
state regulators, according to a Goldman Sachs statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs leaves mortgage servicing after Litton was
accused of robo-signing, in which foreclosure documents are
signed by company officials who vouch for their accuracy without
personally verifying the contents. The practice raised concern
that some borrowers may have been wrongfully evicted and
triggered calls for more staffing and oversight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our agreement sets a new higher standard for the
residential mortgage-servicing industry, whose troubling
foreclosure and servicing practices we have been investigating
along with other regulators across the country,&#8221; Benjamin Lawsky, superintendant at the New York State Department of
Financial Services, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage servicers send out bills, collect payments and
handle foreclosures. New York-based Goldman Sachs acquired
Houston-based Litton with 1,000 employees in 2007, took a
writedown of about $200 million earlier this year and agreed in
June to sell the unit to Ocwen for $263.7 million. The value of
mortgage servicing companies has been eroded as record U.S.
foreclosures and delinquencies drove up costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review Findings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocwen, based in West Palm Beach, Florida, will also pay
about $337.4 million to retire some of Litton&#8217;s debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed to provide the Fed with findings of
the independent review as well as its plans to reimburse
customers for fees or losses stemming from improper
foreclosures, according to the settlement. The firm also agreed
to improve compliance and borrower communications should it re-
enter the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The review is intended to provide remediation to
borrowers who suffered financial injury as a result of wrongful
foreclosures or other deficiencies identified in a review of the
foreclosure process,&#8221; according to the Fed&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future Penalties &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also agreed to pay any penalty the Fed
imposes on Litton based on today&#8217;s enforcement action. The
regulator said it plans penalties for Litton as well as other
large servicers, including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), which received enforcement actions in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys general from all 50 states last year announced
their investigation into bank foreclosure practices after
reports that faulty or manufactured documents were being used to
seize homes. Since then, a group of attorneys general and
officials from federal agencies, including the Justice
Department, have been negotiating a settlement with the nation&#8217;s
five largest mortgage servicers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York agreement requires the companies to withdraw
pending foreclosures with robo-signed affidavits and compensate
borrowers whose homes were wrongfully foreclosed, according to
the statement. The $53 million represents 25 percent of unpaid
principal for all 60-day delinquent home loans serviced by
Litton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocwen is getting a portfolio of loans with about $41.2
billion in unpaid principal balance as of March 31, most of them
non-prime home mortgages, according to a June filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible Pattern &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s agreement to reduce unpaid principal in the
New York accord is &#8220;the most specific we&#8217;ve seen,&#8221; said Guy
Cecala, publisher of Bethesda, Maryland-based trade publication
Inside Mortgage Finance. While the need for sale approval and
small size of Litton may limit the comparability with other
potential settlements, the deal may give some insight to how
future deals could be structured, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In Goldman&#8217;s case, this is a cost of doing business in
terms of getting this deal done,&#8221; Cecala said. &#8220;This is a
blueprint for what the states are looking for: potentially some
lump sum that they can use to help out borrowers who are in
trouble, regardless of whether or not they&#8217;ve suffered any
foreclosure abuse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saba Capital Management LP, the
hedge fund started by former Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) credit trader Boaz Weinstein, hired Toby Maitland Hudson from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
as the firm&#8217;s assets reach $4.1 billion, according to people
familiar with the hire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maitland Hudson, who started at Saba in New York last
month, ran JPMorgan&#8217;s proprietary trading of derivatives tied to
commercial-mortgage bonds and will focus on relative value
trades, according to the people, who declined to be identified
because it hasn&#8217;t been publicly announced. Maitland Hudson
joined JPMorgan in June 2008 from Bear Stearns Cos. after the
bank was forced to sell itself amid a funding squeeze, according
to records from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saba is bolstering its trading in the market for debt and
derivatives tied to commercial-mortgages as concern that
economic growth is slowing spur price swings on the bonds, which
are linked to properties from skyscrapers to mobile home parks.
Prices on a Markit Group Ltd. CMBX index tied to junior AAA
commercial-mortgage backed securities sold in 2007, which fall
as default risk rises, have plunged more than 25 percent to 55
since the beginning of July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said its Windows
Phone operating system may capture more than 20 percent of the
smartphone market over the next two to three years with the help
of hardware manufacturers and increased marketing efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forecasts by researchers Gartner and IDC, which expects a
market share of about 20 percent in 2015, are conservative, said
Achim Berg, head of Windows Phone marketing, in Berlin today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, is betting
that Windows Phone will retake market share lost to Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s
iPhone and handsets running Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android software. The
company will start offering the enhanced &#8220;Mango&#8221; version of
its operating system, with functions including better social-
media offerings, for the first time in Europe on two HTC Corp.
phones, set to go on sale by Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC and other partners will run advertisement campaigns for
the Titan and Radar phones, and the company has joined Microsoft
in training &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of salesmen worldwide to better
demonstrate the product, Berg said at the IFA consumer
electronics fair. Microsoft plans to build on Windows Phone&#8217;s
initial success with female consumers as well as with young and
first-time users to win market share, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing an extremely positive response&#8221; to the
Windows Mobile system, HTC&#8217;s President for Europe, the Middle
East and Africa, Florian Seiche, said in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re
now thinking that this year is a great time to get that momentum
accelerated, to reach out to a broader group of customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Titan, which has an 8-megapixel camera with dual-led
flash and a wide-angle lens, will sell for 599 euros ($855),
while the Radar costs 399 euros. HTC is in talks with retailer
and operators, Seiche said, adding that the phones will be
broadly available in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Functions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, announced Windows
Phone in February 2010, jettisoning an earlier system called
Windows Mobile. The newest version, announced in May, adds more
functions such as face detection in photos, extended voice
recognition for writing, and support for 15 additional European
and Asian languages. Mango also lets users synchronize Microsoft
Office documents with cloud versions in Microsoft&#8217;s Office 365
and SkyDrive, and improves integration with corporate
directories and e-mail systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj, the world&#8217;s biggest mobile-phone maker by
volume, adopted Windows Phone 7 as its primary smartphone
platform in February, saying that it will give the Finnish phone
company and its developers more opportunities to produce
distinctive products than Google&#8217;s Android, which was also
considered. Microsoft on May 24 announced handset agreements
with Acer Inc., Fujitsu Ltd. and ZTE Corp., as well as 500
features to be added in the fall release of Windows Phone 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;It Takes Times&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a completely new platform, it takes time,&#8221; said
Berg. &#8220;It took time with Android, it took time with Apple. We
have to show that we&#8217;re very capable and that we have the
fastest and easiest phone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, Gartner forecast that the Android operating
system will have the largest smartphone market share during the
next four years, rising from 23 percent in 2010 to 49 percent in
2015. Apple&#8217;s iOS is predicted to grow from 16 percent to 17
percent, while Microsoft&#8217;s share will go from 4.2 percent in
2010 to 19.5 percent in 2015. IDC in June predicted that
Microsoft may hold a 20.3 percent market share in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone&#8217;s base of application developers will also
increase following Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)&#8217;s decision to stop
selling devices with its WebOS software, Berg said. Hewlett-
Packard said last month that it&#8217;s considering licensing or
selling off WebOS, which it acquired in its purchase of Palm
Inc. last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-party applications helped make Apple&#8217;s iPhone the
most profitable smartphone as users flocked to a handset with a
slick touch screen and an online store that has grown to more
than 425,000 games and other programs. Google&#8217;s Android system,
supported by dozens of manufacturers, also lured developers and
became the best-selling smartphone system this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
completed the sale of its Litton Loan Servicing subsidiary
today, agreed to pay future penalties and review foreclosures so
that victims of wrongful seizures can be compensated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm signed a consent order to &#8220;address a pattern of
misconduct and negligence relating to deficient practices in
residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processing&#8221;
involving Litton, the Federal Reserve Board said in a statement
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The review is intended to provide remediation to
borrowers who suffered financial injury as a result of wrongful
foreclosures or other deficiencies identified in a review of the
foreclosure process,&#8221; according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed to retain an independent consultant to
review foreclosures initiated by Litton that were pending in
2009 or 2010. The New York-based firm will also be responsible
for paying any related penalties imposed on Litton by the Fed,
which said in April sanctions are appropriate and may be levied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed in June to sell Litton to Ocwen
Financial Corp. for about $264 million in a deal that was
completed today. The announcement came two months after Goldman
Sachs wrote down the value of the mortgage-servicing business by
about $200 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) was sued by a mobile
phone user claiming the company illegally tracks location
information from mobile devices in violation of state and
federal privacy laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has designed its mobile operating software
Windows Phone 7 to track users&#8217; location deceptively even after
users choose to disable the feature, according to a complaint
filed in federal court in Seattle today. The software is in
mobile devices made by Samsung Electronics Co., HTC Corp. (2498) and LG
Electronics Inc. (066570), and transfers the location data to company
server computers, the complaint shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michigan resident Rebecca Cousineau filed the lawsuit on
behalf of tens of thousands of consumers who use phones with the
Microsoft software and had their location data tracked after
they disabled the feature. The complaint seeks a court order
barring the company from tracking users&#8217; phone locations, $1,000
for each violation, and unspecified punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately

&lt;p&gt;Economists at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said the slow pace of hiring recently in the U.S. led them
to cut their August payroll forecast to a 25,000 gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new estimate is down from a prior projection of a
50,000 increase, the economists said. Their forecast for the
unemployment rate was unchanged at 9.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The main reason is the accumulation of evidence of weak
hiring in late July and August,&#8221; the economists, led by Jan Hatzius, wrote in a note to clients today. &#8220;The recent pickup
in layoff announcements is a concern.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the reports citing weak employment figures are the
Conference Board&#8217;s consumer confidence survey and its separate
gauge of online help-wanted advertising for August, yesterday&#8217;s
ADP Employer Services report that measures private payroll data
and today&#8217;s employment component in the Institute for Supply
Management&#8217;s factory index, the New York-based economists wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cut in the payrolls forecast contrasts with Moody&#8217;s
Analytics Inc. economists, who raised their estimate today to an
increase of 50,000 from a previous projection of a 30,000 gain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HSH Nordbank AG sued JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) to recover damages it incurred after buying $159 million
in mortgage-backed securities from the New York bank that
allegedly were less safe an investment than advertised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage loans underlying the securities posed a greater
credit risk and were more prone to default than represented,
Hamburg-based HSH Nordbank said in a summons filed yesterday in
New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan. Offering materials
contained &#8220;misrepresentations and omissions&#8221; regarding
underwriting standards for the loans, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The securities have performed worse than expected due to
the poorer-quality collateral, and defendants&#8217; wrongdoing has
led directly to the plaintiffs&#8217; damages,&#8221; said the German
lender, which was bailed out during the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSH Nordbank said it&#8217;s seeking damages of at least
$42 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM said its analytics offerings are backed by more than
$14 billion spent on acquisitions in the past five years,

2015 as companies sift their data for insights. Chief Executive
Officer Sam Palmisano last year said he would spend $20 billion
on acquisitions within five years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department sued to
block ATT Inc. (T)&#8217;s proposed $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA
Inc., saying the deal would &#8220;substantially lessen competition&#8221;
in the wireless market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is seeking a declaration that ATT&#8217;s
takeover of T-Mobile, a unit of Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE), would
violate U.S. antitrust law, according to a complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Washington. The U.S. also asked
for a court order blocking implementation of the deal, the
largest announced acquisition of the year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson&#8217;s proposed
purchase of Bellevue, Washington-based T-Mobile, announced in
March, would combine the second- and fourth-largest carriers to
create a new market leader ahead of No. 1 Verizon Wireless. The
new company would dwarf current No. 3 carrier Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S), which argued against the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ATT&#8217;s elimination of T-Mobile as an independent, low-
priced rival would remove a significant competitive force from
the market,&#8221; the government said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT said it was surprised by the government suit and that
it will ask for an expedited hearing in the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have met repeatedly with the Department of Justice and
there was no indication from the DOJ that this action was being
contemplated,&#8221; Wayne Watts, ATT&#8217;s general counsel, said in a
statement. He said the company intends to fight the litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom said in an e-mailed statement
that it too would contest the U.S. government suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;DOJ failed to acknowledge the robust competition in the
U.S. wireless telecommunications industry and the tremendous
efficiencies associated with the proposed transaction,&#8221; the
German company said, adding it appreciates the Justice
Department&#8217;s &#8220;willingness to discuss possible remedies&#8221; to
address the competitive concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The important point is that the Justice Department has
gone ahead and challenged a big merger of competitors, which it
just hasn&#8217;t done,&#8221; said Eleanor Fox, a law professor at New
York University. &#8220;People were getting used to seeing press
releases saying the Justice Department has agreed to merger XYZ
with a spinoff.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC said that it was continuing its review. In an e-
mailed statement FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said the record
before the agency &#8220;raises serious concerns about the impact of
the proposed transaction on competition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cerberus, Chatham Face October Trial in Innkeepers Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerberus Capital Management LP and Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT)
will face an Oct. 10 trial over their backing out of a deal to
buy hotels from Innkeepers USA Trust, a bankrupt operator of
Residence Inns, Marriott hotels and Hampton Inns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley C. Chapman in Manhattan set
the expedited trial schedule yesterday. Innkeepers sued Cerberus
and Chatham Aug. 29 seeking to force them to honor the deal to
buy 64 hotels or pay damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approved Chapter 11 plan by the operator of 71 hotels
rested on the sale. Cerberus and Chatham said Aug. 22 they&#8217;d
ended the $1.1 billion agreement, citing a possible adverse
change that could affect Innkeepers&#8217; long-term business. They
didn&#8217;t say what the change was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a fairly well circumscribed issue&#8221; over whether
there was a legitimate material adverse change, Chapman said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innkeepers, whose parent is managed by an affiliate of Leon Black&#8217;s private-equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC, filed
for bankruptcy in July 2010 with a pre-arranged reorganization
plan proposed by Apollo and Lehman Ali, a unit of bankrupt
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which was rejected by creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Innkeepers USA Trust, 10-13800, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Primary Global Executive&#8217;s Conspiracy Trial Begins &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insider-trading conspiracy trial of former Primary
Global Research LLC executive James Fleishman will include
testimony from ex-technology executives implicated in the
alleged plot, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleishman, of Santa Clara, California, went on trial
yesterday before U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan on
two counts of conspiracy for his role in what prosecutors say
was a two-yearlong insider-trading scheme. Fleishman, who has
pleaded not guilty, faces as long as 25 years in prison if
convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendant worked with &#8220;a corrupt network of insiders&#8221;
at technology companies who &#8220;sold out their employers by
stealing and then peddling their valuable inside information,&#8221;
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said at the time the
charges were announced in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury was selected yesterday to hear the case, which
Rakoff said would last about three weeks. Two men who have
entered guilty pleas in the insider probe, Mark Anthony Longoria, a former Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) manager, and
Daniel DeVore, a former supply manager for Dell Inc. (DELL), have
agreed to testify against Fleishman, assistant U.S. attorneys
Antonia Apps and David Leibowitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen people have been convicted in the crackdown,
including 12 who pleaded guilty. Winifred Jiau, a former Primary
Global consultant was convicted at trial in June of securities
fraud and conspiracy for passing inside tips about Nvdia Corp.
and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) to hedge fund managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary Global, based in Mountain View, California, links
investors with industry experts at public companies. In his
position as a sales manager, Fleishman was responsible for
attracting new clients and arranging for fund managers to speak
to consultants, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Nguyen, 11-cr-00032, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Galleon Trader Drimal Sentenced to 5 1/2 Years in Prison &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Galleon Group LLC hedge fund trader Craig Drimal,
who took part in an insider trading scheme that stretched from
technology firms to pharmaceutical companies, was sentenced to 5
&#189; years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drimal, 55, pleaded guilty in April in to conspiracy and
securities fraud, admitting that he and others at Galleon traded
on inside information obtained from lawyers working on
transactions involving 3Com Corp. and Axcan Pharma Inc. Drimal
said the information was obtained from Arthur Cutillo and Brien Santarlas, lawyers at Boston-based Ropes  Gray LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan,
who handed down the 66 month-term yesterday in Manhattan, to
sentence Drimal within the federal guidelines range of 70 to 87
months. Drimal had sought community service or home confinement
in lieu of a prison term, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government said in court papers that a &#8220;strong message
of deterrence to others in the hedge fund community&#8221; must be
sent, and that the &#8220;nature and extent of his criminal conduct
doesn&#8217;t warrant community service.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TCW Rests Case in Gundlach Trial Over Trade Secrets, Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW Group Inc. rested its case in the trial that pits the
asset-management firm against its former chief investment
officer, Jeffrey Gundlach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former TCW president Bill Sonneborn, now chief executive
officer of KKR Financial Holdings LLC, was the last witness TCW
called to support its claims that Gundlach and three other
former employees stole TCW&#8217;s trade secrets to start DoubleLine
Capital LP, the rival asset-management business Gundlach set up
10 days after TCW fired him in December 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I encouraged him to terminate Jeffrey,&#8221; Sonneborn told
the jurors, recalling an August 2009 conversation he had with
TCW CEO Marc Stern. Sonneborn, who had left TCW in 2008, said he
told Stern that Gundlach was becoming a disease or a cancer for
the company. Sonneborn said Stern was unwilling to fire Gundlach
at that time because he was too important for TCW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW, the Los Angeles-based unit of Societe Generale (GLE) SA,
sued Gundlach, 51, in January 2010, after more than half of its
fixed-income professionals joined DoubleLine. TCW&#8217;s damages
expert told jurors in California state court in Los Angeles that
the company suffered $344 million in damages from Gundlach&#8217;s
alleged interference with contracts and $222 million from a
claimed breach of fiduciary duty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach, who had worked at TCW for 25 years and was named
Morningstar&#8217;s Fixed Income Manager of the Year in 2006,
countersued, saying TCW fired him to avoid having to pay
management and performance fees for the distressed-asset funds
his group managed and that went &#8220;through the roof.&#8221; Gundlach
seeks about $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach, who testified for four days, has denied that
DoubleLine used any of TCW&#8217;s trade secrets or proprietary
information and said that DoubleLine employees were told to turn
over any TCW files they might have had. Gundlach told the jury
that the success of his funds was due to &#8220;experience and
thinking&#8221; rather than to analytical systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Gundlach, BC429385,
California Superior Court Los Angeles County (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Settles Lipitor Suit With Generic Maker Dr. Reddy&#8217;s &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, settled a
patent-infringement lawsuit with the Indian generic-drug maker
Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories Ltd. over the cholesterol treatment
Lipitor. The terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, sued Dr. Reddy&#8217;s in December
2009 to block generic copies of Lipitor from coming out before
Pfizer&#8217;s patent for the tablets expires in 2017. The companies
settled on Aug. 19, and U.S. District Judge Leonard P. Stark in
Wilmington, Delaware, dismissed the case Aug. 29, according to
court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have closed our litigation with Pfizer, but the date
of entry into the market is not yet confirmed,&#8221; Kedar Upadhye,
a spokesman for Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, said in a statement yesterday. The
agreement is subject to review by the U.S. Justice Department
and the Federal Trade Commission, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can confirm that we have reached an agreement with Dr.
Reddy&#8217;s regarding a patent case involving Lipitor,&#8221; Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Terms of the agreement are confidential.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) and Mylan Inc. also
have reached settlements with Pfizer to sell generic forms of
Lipitor, known chemically as atorvastatin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer v. Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, 1:09-cv-00943, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J. Crew, Funds Said to Reach $16 Million Settlement Over Buyout &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Crew Group Inc. and the two private-equity firms buying
the retailer agreed to pay $16 million to resolve investor
lawsuits over the deal, reviving a previous settlement that had
collapsed, three people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives of New York-based J. Crew and buyout firms TPG
Capital LP and Leonard Green  Partners LP, who acquired the
clothing-store chain for $3 billion, agreed to add an additional
$6 million to the original $10 million settlement to end
litigation over the buyout, the people said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Crew sued a group of shareholders in Delaware Chancery
Court in Wilmington in May in a bid to enforce the original $10
million settlement, which collapsed four months earlier. The new
accord will resolve the company&#8217;s suit as well as investors&#8217;
challenges to the acquisition, said the people, who didn&#8217;t want
to be identified because the agreement wasn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TPG, based in Fort Worth, Texas, and Los Angeles-based
Leonard Green agreed in November to buy J. Crew for $43.50 a
share. The company operates 250 retail stores under brands
including Madewell and 85 factory outlet locations, as well as a
catalog business. A majority of J. Crew&#8217;s shareholders voted to
approve the buyout in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margot Fooshee, a J. Crew spokeswoman, and TPG spokesman
Owen Blicksilver declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cody Franklin, a spokesman for Leonard Green, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment yesterday. Stuart Grant, a Wilmington, Delaware-based lawyer representing the
pension funds that challenged the buyout, also didn&#8217;t
immediately return calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancery Court Chief Judge Leo Strine still must approve
the new settlement before it becomes final. No date has been set
for that hearing, according to court dockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re J. Crew Shareholders Litigation, 6043,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamondback Capital Trader Settles SEC Insider-Trading Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ex-portfolio manager for Diamondback Capital Management
LLC, Anthony Scolaro, agreed to pay about $203,000 to settle an
insider-trading lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scolaro, 50, trading on Diamondback&#8217;s behalf, was accused
of reaping $1.1 million for the Stamford-Connecticut based hedge
fund by trading on inside information about Axcan Pharma Inc.
late in 2007. He agreed to disgorge $140,400 in principal and
interest and pay a $63,000 penalty, the SEC said in a statement.
Diamondback, also named as a relief defendant, agreed to
disgorge $1.07 million in principal and interest, according to
the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allegations were related to a criminal case in which
Scolaro pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges stemming from
the Galleon Group LLC investigation, the agency said yesterday
in a complaint in U.S. District Court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scolaro&#8217;s November 2010 plea of guilty to insider trading
was unsealed in May. He hasn&#8217;t been sentenced. His attorney,
William Brodsky, didn&#8217;t immediately reply to a telephone message
seeking comment on yesterday&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamondback disclosed the settlement to its investors in a
letter yesterday, Steven Bruce, a spokesman, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The complaint contains no allegations of misconduct by
Diamondback,&#8221; the firm said, adding that it and not its
investors will pay for the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Diamondback Capital Management LLC, 11-
cv-6112, in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Deposed 53 in Bank of America Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman&#8217;s office has
taken testimony from 53 witnesses in its investigation into Bank
of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s 2008 acquisition of Merrill Lynch  Co., a
federal judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan said in an
order yesterday that &#8220;there have been 53 examinations under
oath by the NYAG&#8221; in its investigation. The witnesses weren&#8217;t
identified in the order, which involved evidence gathering in
the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castel, who is overseeing separate shareholder litigation
over the Merrill Lynch deal, said the depositions overlap with
information sought by both sides in the litigation in his court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attorney general&#8217;s office, under Andrew Cuomo, now New
York&#8217;s governor, sued Bank of America, former Chief Executive
Officer Kenneth Lewis and former Chief Financial Officer Joseph Price in February 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuomo accused Bank of America of misleading shareholders
about huge losses at Merrill Lynch to win approval of the deal
and then manipulating the federal government into contributing
bailout funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to complete
it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danny Kanner, a spokesman for Schneiderman, had no
immediate comment on Castel&#8217;s order. Bob Stickler, a Bank of
America spokesman, said in an e-mail that all of the depositions
were taken while Cuomo was attorney general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The vast majority of them were in 2009 and early 2010,&#8221;
Stickler said. &#8220;There is nothing new on the deposition front.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Bank of America Corp. Securities,
Derivative and ERISA Litigation, 09-mdl-2058, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parmalat Judge Reaffirms Dismissal of Grant Thornton Cases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. judge reaffirmed his ruling in two suits by Parmalat
SpA (PLT) against accounting firm Grant Thornton LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan yesterday
ruled that he was correct in taking the two cases, which were
originally filed by Parmalat and its Parmalat Capital Finance
Ltd. unit in Illinois state court in 2004 and 2005. Kaplan
dismissed the suits in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, a federal appeals court in Manhattan revived
the cases, ruling that Kaplan had applied the wrong standard in
determining whether to exercise jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court sent the cases back to Kaplan to
determine whether federal law required him to abstain from
taking them in favor of the Illinois courts. Kaplan, applying
the rule set by the appeals court, said yesterday that he was
entitled to rule in the cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parmalat, a dairy company based in Collecchio, Italy,
collapsed in December 2003 in the country&#8217;s largest bankruptcy,
later disclosing more than 14 billion euros ($20.1 billion) of
debt, about eight times the amount reported by its former
management. Parmalat SpA emerged from bankruptcy and returned to
the stock market in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enrico Bondi, who was appointed to oversee the Parmalat
bankruptcy, sued Grant Thornton, claiming it aided in the fraud
that led to Parmalat&#8217;s collapse. Parmalat Capital also sued the
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Parmalat Securities Litigation, 04-
cv-1653, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venoco Sued by Shareholder Over $770.2 Million Buyout Offer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Venoco Inc. (VQ) investor sued to block a bid by the company&#8217;s
founder to take the oil and gas producer private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Timothy Marquez&#8217;s
$770.2 million offer is unfair to shareholders and undervalues
the company, shareholder James G. Prince said yesterday in a
complaint in Delaware Chancery Court. Prince asked that the case
be a class-action suit including other Venoco shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marquez strategically timed the proposed transaction
during a period of economic turmoil in which the terms of the
proposed transaction could be superficially viewed in a positive
light,&#8221; lawyers for Prince wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marquez, who holds 50.3 percent of the Denver-based oil and
gas company&#8217;s shares, offered this week to buy the rest for
$12.50 each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil McPherson, a Newport Beach, California-based analyst
with Global Hunter Securities LLC, said Aug. 29 that the offer
represents a significant discount to the value of the company&#8217;s
assets and may prompt investor lawsuits and a potentially higher
bid from another oil producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venoco, founded in 1992, is the second-largest landholder
in California&#8217;s Monterey oil-shale formation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Edwards, a spokesman for Venoco, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Prince v. Venoco Inc., CA6823, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CareFusion Sues Hospira Over Drug-Delivery System Patents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CareFusion Corp. (CFN) sued Hospira Inc. (HSP) over patents for drug-
delivery systems and is seeking a jury trial, damages and an
order barring infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospira, based in Lake Forest, Illinois, is using protected
technology in products including the Symbiq, Plum and LifeCare
brand of infusion equipment, CareFusion said in papers filed
Aug. 30 in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The evidence will likely show&#8221; that Hospira has &#8220;acted
with disregard of CareFusion&#8217;s patent rights, without any
reasonable basis for doing so,&#8221; and should pay lost profits and
royalties to San Diego-based CareFusion, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CareFusion itself was sued Aug. 29 in federal court in
Chicago by rival B. Braun Medical Inc. over infusion-pump
patents, according to a B. Braun statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think we&#8217;ve got a strong position in this suit and our
plan is to vigorously defend it,&#8221; said Hospira spokeswoman
Tareta Adams in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CareFusion v. Hospira, 11-762, U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sino-Forest Investors Sue Executives for Backdated Stock Options &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) Chief Executive Officer Allen Chan and
Chief Financial Officer David Horsley received stock options
that were backdated or mispriced in violation of Toronto Stock
Exchange rules, according to a lawsuit from two investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The options include those issued to Chan in 1996 and 2007
and to Horsley in 2005 and 2007, according to a statement of
claim sent yesterday by the investors to an Ontario court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendants profited handsomely from the market&#8217;s
resulting appetite for Sino&#8217;s securities,&#8221; according to the
claim. &#8220;Certain of the individual defendants sold Sino shares
at lofty prices, and thereby reaped millions of dollars of
gains.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class action was filed by trustees of the Labourers&#8217;
Pension Fund of Central and Eastern Canada and the trustees of
the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 793 Pension
Plan for Operating Engineers in Ontario. The plaintiffs are
seeking damages from Sino-Forest, Chan and Horsley and other
defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stan Neve, an external spokesman for Sino-Forest in New
York, declined to comment. Horsley didn&#8217;t immediately respond to
voice-mail messages left at his office and on his mobile phone.
Chan didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment to Sino-
Forest&#8217;s Hong Kong offices after regular working hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sino-Forest&#8217;s shares were suspended from trading in Toronto
on Aug. 26 after the Ontario Securities Commission said officers
and directors of the Hong Kong- and Mississauga, Ontario-based
company may have engaged in acts &#8220;related to its securities&#8221;
that they &#8220;knew or should have known&#8221; perpetuated a fraud.
Chan resigned as CEO two days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Trustees of the Labourers&#8217; Pension Fund of
Central and Eastern Canada v. Sino-Forest, 11-4311530, Superior
Court of Justice (Ontario). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baxter Sues Teva to Enforce Agreement Over Hepatitis Cases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baxter International Inc. (BAX), the maker of blood products and
intravenous drugs, sued Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. to
enforce an indemnity agreement over claims the drugmakers sold
the anesthetic propofol in a way that led some patients to
develop hepatitis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baxter contends in a Delaware Chancery Court lawsuit that
an arbitration panel found Teva was bound by an agreement to
cover all liability stemming from cases blaming tainted vials of
propofol for colonoscopy patients developing hepatitis C. A Las
Vegas jury last year ordered Teva and Baxter to pay more than
$500 million in damages to a Las Vegas school principal on one
such claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Teva is obligated to indemnify Baxter for any and all
claims, damages, liabilities or losses, including&#8221; punitive-
damage awards in propofol cases, Deerfield, Illinois-based
Baxter said in the Delaware suit, filed Aug. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit comes as a Las Vegas jury is hearing testimony in
the trial of three more cases alleging Teva and Baxter officials
sold propofol in oversized vials that encouraged medical
personnel to reuse the containers for multiple patients. Las
Vegas residents contend they got hepatitis C from the tainted
vials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise Bradley, a U.S.-based spokeswoman for Teva, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a call and e-mail seeking comment on
Baxter&#8217;s suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva faces almost 300 lawsuits stemming from a hepatitis C
outbreak three years ago in southern Nevada, the Petach Tikva,
Israel-based company said in a regulatory filing last month.
Nevada health officials blamed the reuse of propofol vials for
infecting patients with the incurable liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva manufactures the drug and San Francisco-based McKesson
Corp. (MCK) is its current U.S. distributor. Baxter sold the drug for
Teva until 2009, according to court filings. Propofol is an
intravenous agent used for sedation or anesthesia, according to
Teva&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva already agreed to settle about one-third of the
hepatitis-related suits alleging patients received propofol from
reused containers, according to a July 28 filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Teva said it set aside an
undisclosed reserve to cover the settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Delaware case is Baxter International Inc. v. Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA Inc., 6819, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington.) The Nevada case is Sacks v. Endoscopy Center of
Southern Nevada LLC, 08A572315, District Court for Clark County,
Nevada (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Jersey&#8217;s Christie Sued by Unions over Pension, Health Cuts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey public employee unions, seeking to block a law
reducing pension and health benefits, sued Governor Chris Christie and other state officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed yesterday by more than 20 unions and
individuals, according to federal court records in Trenton, New
Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law deprives workers of their due process rights by
suspending pension adjustments, increasing employees&#8217;
contributions, underfunding pensions, and delegating to pension
committees an &#8220;unrestrained authority to reduce pension and
change eligibility requirements,&#8221; according to a copy of the
complaint on the New Jersey Education Association&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christie signed the bill into law June 28, raising pension
and health-care expenses for public workers, after urging
lawmakers since September to approve measures cutting health-
care costs and reducing a $53.9 billion deficit in the state
pension system. The plan drew protests from teachers,
firefighters and other public workers and was opposed by a
majority of Democratic lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state and other officials in addition to Christie are
named as defendants in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Drewniak and Kevin Roberts, both spokesmen for
Christie, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment after
regular business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is New Jersey Education Association v. State of
New Jersey, 11-05024, U.S. District Court, District of New
Jersey (Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CareFusion Corp. (CFN) sued Hospira Inc. (HSP)
over patents for drug-delivery systems and is seeking a jury
trial, damages and an order barring infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospira, based in Lake Forest, Illinois, is using protected
technology in products including the Symbiq, Plum and LifeCare
brand of infusion equipment, CareFusion said in papers filed
Aug. 30 in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dispute are patents 7,171,277, issued in January 2007,
and 7,835,927, issued in November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The evidence will likely show&#8221; that Hospira has &#8220;acted
with disregard of CareFusion&#8217;s patent rights, without any
reasonable basis for doing so,&#8221; and should pay lost profits and
royalties to San Diego-based CareFusion, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CareFusion itself was sued Aug. 29 in federal court in
Chicago by rival B. Braun Medical Inc. over infusion-pump
patents, according to a B. Braun statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think we&#8217;ve got a strong position in this suit and our
plan is to vigorously defend it,&#8221; said Hospira spokeswoman
Tareta Adams in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CareFusion had $3.52 billion in sales last fiscal year, and
Hospira had $3.91 billion in 2010 sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CareFusion v. Hospira, 11-762, U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Settles Lipitor Suit With Generic Maker Dr. Reddy&#8217;s &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, settled a
patent-infringement lawsuit with the Indian generic-drug maker
Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories Ltd. over the cholesterol-control drug
Lipitor. The terms were undisclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies settled the litigation Aug. 19, and U.S.
District Judge Leonard P. Stark in Wilmington, Delaware,
dismissed the case Aug. 29, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have closed our litigation with Pfizer, but the date
of entry into the market is not yet confirmed,&#8221; Kedar Upadhye,
a spokesman for Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, of Hyderabad, India, announced the settlement
yesterday in a news release. The confidential agreement is
subject to review by the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal
Trade Commission, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, sued Dr. Reddy&#8217;s in December
2009 over patent 5,969,156, which covers the compound
atorvastatin calcium, the Lipitor drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer v. Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, 1:09-cv-00943, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM Opposes U.S., Canadian &#8216;Webkit&#8217; Trademarks for Apple &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM), the maker of the BlackBerry mobile
communications device, has filed papers with the Canadian
Intellectual Property Office to oppose a trademark filing by
Apple Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CIPO database, Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM
opposed Apple&#8217;s application to register &#8220;webkit&#8221; as a
trademark for computer software, computer search engine software
and Internet browser software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cupertino, California-based Apple filed its application in
May 2010. The company said it&#8217;s used the mark in Canada since at
least November 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, Apple filed a U.S. application to register the mark in
May 2010. Both RIM and Nokia OYJ (NOK1V) have filed papers in opposition
to that application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Canada, RIM has until mid-November to file a statement
of its reasons to oppose Apple&#8217;s registration. In the U.S., the
deadline for filing the opposition is Oct. 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levi Strauss&#8217;s European Trademark Claim Not for U.S. Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levi Strauss  Co.&#8217;s European trademark claim against a
seller of the San Francisco company&#8217;s discontinued jeans was
rejected by a federal court in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White said there were
&#8220;compelling reasons&#8221; not to exercise jurisdiction over the
company&#8217;s European trademark claim. He suggested possibilities
of jury confusion, and a potential to prejudice the rights of
European governments were reasons to bar Levi Strauss from
pursuing those particular claims in a U.S. court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did say that his dismissal of the European claim
wouldn&#8217;t bar Levi Strauss from pursing that claim &#8220;in the
appropriate foreign tribunal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Levi Strauss  Co v. Papikian Enterprises Inc.,
3:10-cv-05051-JSW, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hachette&#8217;s &#8216;Don&#8217;t Mess With Texas&#8217; Publication Can Go Ahead &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hachette Book Group Inc. persuaded a federal judge in
Austin, Texas, to deny a request for an immediate halt to the
publication of a romance novel the Texas Department of
Transportation claimed infringed the &#8220;Don&#8217;t Mess With Texas&#8221;
trademark it used for its anti-litter campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks said that Christine Craig&#8217;s
&#8220;Don&#8217;t Mess with Texas&#8221; can be published and that he doubted
the books &#8220;will fly off the shelves with such speed that sales
could not be enjoined in the future should the Texas DOT prevail
on its claims in this lawsuit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he wasn&#8217;t convinced that the transportation
department&#8217;s suit &#8220;has a substantial likelihood of success on
the merits.&#8221; In his Aug. 22 order, Judge Sparks noted that the
publisher has a First Amendment right to choose appropriate
titles for literary works&#8221; and that none of the DOT&#8217;s trademark
registrations for that phrase cover books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Texas Department of Transportation v. Craig
1:11-cv-00726-SS, U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas
(Austin). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performer Rick Ross Sued by Rapper Askew Over &#8216;Teflon Don&#8217; Mark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rap performer who uses the stage name Rick Ross was
sued for trademark infringement by a second rapper over his use
of the name &#8220;Teflon Don&#8221; on an album. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, on
Aug. 29, also names Universal Music Group, its Def Jam Recording
unit, and DJ Khaled, who heads the Def Jam South unit. Rapper
Donald Ray Askew Jr. claims he was the first to use the name
&#8220;Teflon Don,&#8221; and that both performers compete in the same
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Askew says his brand is infringed, and asked the court for
an award of $20 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second trademark infringement suit against
Ross. The performer, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts
II, was previously sued by Ricky D. Ross of Los Angeles. The
California plaintiff claimed his name and prior criminal image
were exploited by the performer without authorization. Ricky D.
Ross is the subject of a 2001 film &#8220;100 Kilos,&#8221; that focused
on his life as a drug dealer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint in that case, Leonard, who had
served as a corrections officer in Dade County, Florida, falsely
claimed he had a criminal past and tried to deceive the public
as to his affiliation with Ricky D. Ross. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross&#8217;s case against Leonard was dismissed in 2010, and he
is presently appealing that dismissal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That case is Ricky D. Ross v. William Leonard Roberts II,
2:10-cv-04428-PA-RZ, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont  Co. registered &#8220;Teflon&#8221; with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. According to the patent office database, the
Wilmington, Delaware-based chemical company has used the mark
for its polytetrafluoroethylene products since 1944. The company
has filed a number of infringement suits involving the Teflon
mark over the years, including a November 2009 case against a
record company then known as Teflon Blood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Askew is unrepresented by counsel. His hand-written
complaint appears to have been filed on a form used by
prisoners. He says in the complaint that he is not in
confinement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His case against Leonard is Donald Askew Jr. v. William
Leonard Roberts, 2:11-cv-02738-JDT-tmp, U.S. District Court,
Western District of Tennessee (Memphis). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Australia Says Improving Economy Triggering Trademark Filings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark filings have increased in Australia to levels
achieved before the recent economic slowdown, according to data
from IP Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2010-2011 fiscal year, 69,003 applications were
filed, up from 67,738 the previous year. The previous high was
in fiscal year 2007-2008, when 68,659 applications were filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Australia said in a statement that in addition to an
improved economic climate, a growing awareness of the value of
intellectual property may have triggered the rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent poll of small businesses in Australia, the
percentage of respondents rating themselves as &#8220;very aware&#8221; of
IP issues rose from 15 percent the previous year to 23 percent,
IP Australia said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edgartown Library Threatened with Copyright Infringement Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A public library in Martha&#8217;s Vineyard, Massachusetts, has
been threatened with a copyright infringement suit by a private
consultant who claims to hold the rights to the slogan
&#8220;Frankly, We Love Our Library,&#8221; the Vineyard Gazette reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danielle Pendergraft and her Holiday Public Relations have
demanded the Edgartown Library Foundation quit using the phrase,
which she says her company owns, according to the Gazette. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holiday Public Relations of Edgartown has held the mark
since July 2009, Pendergraft told the Gazette, and said she
intends to keep the rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Edgartown Library Foundation changed the name
of its annual Labor Day fundraiser from &#8220;Frankly, We Love our
Library&#8221; to &#8220;We Love Our Library,&#8221; Pendergraft told the
Gazette the change was insufficient and that the library will be
hearing from her legal counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minesage&#8217;s Chinese Newspaper IPad App Infringes, Court Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minesage Co. Ltd. was hit with a 100,000 Chinese yuan
($15,700) fine for its application for Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad that
provides Chinese language news, China Daily reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beijing News claimed Minesage&#8217;s Chinese Newspapers app
infringed copyrights on its content and layouts, according to
the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the Beijing News told the China Daily that
legal action was pursued only after Minesage failed to respond
to cease-and-desist requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuan Fuzhen of the Shanghai Intellectual Property Research
Institute told the Beijing News that in light of this case,
compensation for infringement should be increased because the
present level &#8220;creates an imbalance between the cost of
defending one&#8217;s rights and the illegal income to the
infringer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria Copyright Infringement Issues Focus of &#8216;No Music Day&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcast stations throughout Nigeria were requested to
devote programming today to discussions of the rights of
musicians and other artists instead of playing music, the Music
Industry News Network reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Copyright Society of Nigeria designated today as &#8220;No
Music Day,&#8221; intended to draw national attention to widespread
infringement in the music industry, according to Music Industry
News Network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No Music Day&#8221; was first observed in Nigeria in 2009
following a weeklong hunger-strike campaign waged by Nigerian
performers in protest of copyright infringement, Music Industry
News Network reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual event has focused public attention on
infringement issues, and promoted vigorous copyright enforcement
actions in Nigeria, according to Music Industry News Network. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TCW Rests Case in Gundlach Trial Over Trade Secrets, Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW Group Inc. rested its case in the trial that pits the
asset-management firm against its former chief investment
officer, Jeffrey Gundlach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former TCW president Bill Sonneborn, now chief executive
officer of KKR Financial Holdings LLC, was the last witness TCW
called to support its claims that Gundlach and three other
former employees stole TCW&#8217;s trade secrets to start DoubleLine
Capital LP, the rival asset-management business Gundlach set up
10 days after TCW fired him in December 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I encouraged him to terminate Jeffrey,&#8221; Sonneborn told
the jurors, recalling an August 2009 conversation he had with
TCW CEO Marc Stern. Sonneborn, who had left TCW in 2008, said he
told Stern that Gundlach was becoming a disease or a cancer for
the company. Sonneborn said Stern was unwilling to fire Gundlach
at that time because he was too important for TCW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW, the Los Angeles-based unit of Societe Generale (GLE) SA,
sued Gundlach, 51, in January 2010, after more than half of its
fixed-income professionals joined DoubleLine. TCW&#8217;s damages
expert told jurors in California state court in Los Angeles that
the company suffered $344 million in damages from Gundlach&#8217;s
alleged interference with contracts and $222 million from a
claimed breach of fiduciary duty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach, who had worked at TCW for 25 years and was named
Morningstar&#8217;s Fixed Income Manager of the Year in 2006,
countersued, saying TCW fired him to avoid having to pay
management and performance fees for the distressed-asset funds
his group managed and that went &#8220;through the roof.&#8221; Gundlach
seeks about $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DoubleLine called its first witness yesterday, Paul Deitch
of Oaktree Capital Management LP, who testified that Oaktree
helped set up DoubleLine in December 2009 and got it up and
running in exchange for an equity stake in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DoubleLine&#8217;s people were far from ready to start an
investment company when he first met with them the week after
Gundlach was fired, Deitch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach, who testified for four days, has denied that
DoubleLine used any of TCW&#8217;s trade secrets or proprietary
information and said that the success of his funds was due to
&#8220;experience and thinking&#8221; rather than to analytical systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cris Santa Ana, a former managing director of Gundlach&#8217;s
mortgage-backed securities group at TCW, testified that Gundlach
instructed him in September 2009 to start backing up data that
&#8220;might be useful to have&#8221; in case Gundlach was fired. Santa
Ana is a co-defendant and cross-complainant with Gundlach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach&#8217;s fixed-income group managed more than half of
TCW&#8217;s $110 billion assets under management before he was fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern testified he became suspicious in September 2009 and
started checking Gundlach&#8217;s e-mails. Stern said he discovered
that Gundlach and people from his group were copying TCW files
and looking for office space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW claims it fired Gundlach because he was allegedly
stealing trade secrets and confidential information as he
secretly set up a rival firm. DoubleLine has argued that Stern
started looking into alternatives for Gundlach as early as June
of 2009, after Stern returned to active management and before
Gundlach&#8217;s people copied any TCW files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW acquired Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC on Dec.
4, 2009, the day Gundlach was fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern told the jurors that in January 2010 he was forced to
cut the fees for the distressed-asset funds that Gundlach had
managed and to allow clients to withdraw their investments from
the funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although they normally wouldn&#8217;t be allowed to do this, it
was allowed because of pressure generated by Gundlach&#8217;s comments
to the investors after he was fired. Brian said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Gundlach, BC429385,
California Superior Court Los Angeles County (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) may get a reprieve from
generic competition to its $11 billion Lipitor cholesterol pill
as Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) fights regulatory breaches that 
threaten to derail its push to produce the first U.S. copies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy, India&#8217;s third-largest drugmaker by revenue, plans
to introduce its copy of Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-selling
medicine, on Nov. 30. It must first persuade the Food and Drug
Administration that its copy is equivalent to the original and
that approval shouldn&#8217;t be thwarted by violations cited in 2009
at a plant identified in Ranbaxy&#8217;s drug application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to resolve the issue could prevent the FDA from
clearing Ranbaxy&#8217;s Lipitor version by that date, said Ira Loss,
an analyst with Washington Analysis. A delay also may stall
plans by other generic-drug companies to introduce their
versions of the $11 billion-a-year medicine, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember another case where timely approval of
the first generic on a big drug appears dependent upon cleaning
up a mess in their manufacturing situation,&#8221; said Loss, who has
followed the FDA for more than three decades. &#8220;Ranbaxy has
repeatedly expressed confidence that this will all get resolved
in time, but I&#8217;m not sure I believe them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

and Royal Bank of Canada said they expect the central bank to
announce plans to raise the average maturity of its bond
portfolio by selling shorter-term debt and reinvesting proceeds
from maturing securities into longer-term bonds. The Fed
purchased $2.3 trillion of debt since 2008 in two previous
rounds of what&#8217;s become known as quantitative easing, or QE, to
drive rates lower and help spur growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That will be the focus for the Fed in terms of policy
change come September,&#8221; Bill Gross, manager of Pacific
Investment Management Co.&#8217;s $245 billion Total Return Fund,
said in a radio interview on &#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. &#8220;We would stick in the five- to 10-year
area&#8221; to take advantage of demand from the Fed, Gross said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has cited extending the
average maturity as one of monetary stimulus tools available to
policy makers. Economists with the Fed&#8217;s regional bank in San
Francisco wrote in April that &#8220;Operation Twist,&#8221; a 1961
initiative by the central bank and President John F. Kennedy&#8217;s
administration, spawned a 0.15 percentage point reduction in
long-term Treasury yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curve Flattens &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell 13 basis points, or
0.13 percentage point, to 2 percent at 3:07 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. Yields on two-year
notes rose 2 basis points to 0.20 percent, narrowing the so-
called yield curve to 1.80 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are now assuming that the Fed will&#8221; sell shorter
maturity Treasuries to buy those due later, Michael Cloherty,
the head of U.S. rates strategy for fixed income and currencies
at Royal Bank of Canada in New York, wrote in a research report.
Goldman Sachs said that &#8220;following today&#8217;s worse-than-expected
jobs report,&#8221; the firm expects the Federal Open Market
Committee to announce a lengthening in the average maturity of
its holdings at the Sept. 20-21 meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest reading
since September 2010, after an 85,000 gain in July that was less
than initially estimated, Labor Department data showed today in
Washington. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
called for a rise of 68,000. Hourly earnings and hours worked
both declined. The August data included a 48,000 drop in
information industry jobs, mostly reflecting striking Verizon
Communications Inc. workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulus Risk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More stimulus from the Fed may not be beneficial because it
risks a political backlash that could threaten to undermine the
central bank and weaken the economy by driving up commodity
prices, Mohamed A. El-Erian, Pimco&#8217;s chief executive officer and
co-chief investment officer with Gross, said today on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;In The Loop&#8221; with Betty Liu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The balance between the benefits and cost and risks has
changed in an adverse manner,&#8221; El-Erian said. &#8220;At the end of
the day we will not be solving anything. We&#8217;ll just be
undermining the economy and a critical institution for the well
being for America.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments should be focusing on creating growth rather
than reducing debt, Gross said. &#8220;To do it right now is almost
suicidal,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy expanded at a 1 percent pace in the second
quarter following a 0.4 percent gain in the first three months
of the year, the Commerce Department reported last month.
Consumer spending grew 0.4 percent, the smallest increase since
the last three months of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. government bonds returned 2.8 percent in August, the
most since December 2008, as investors bet on slower growth and
sought a refuge from global financial market turmoil, according
to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stock mutual funds are having their
worst year since 1998 relative to their benchmarks, as higher
volatility makes it harder to pick stocks, according to JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 2,806 funds tracked by the brokerage, 47 percent
underperformed their benchmarks by more than 2.5 percentage
points this year, the most since the 55 percent recorded in
1998. Only 13 percent of the funds beat the market by the same
margin. The underperformance accelerated last month, with the
proportion of trailing funds almost doubling from July,
according to JPMorgan data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock price swings widened at the fastest rate since
the 1987 crash in the month through Aug. 23 as investors weighed
stalling economic growth against the prospect of additional
stimulus from the Federal Reserve. The volatility helped drive
August options volume to a record 550.1 million contracts on
demand for a hedge against equity losses, according to the
Chicago-based Options Industry Council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The turbulence of markets in August caused a rapid
deterioration of active manager performance,&#8221; Thomas J. Lee,
JPMorgan&#8217;s chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in the report
dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index plunged 6.7 percent on Aug.
8, before surging 4.7 percent, dropping 4.4 percent and jumping
4.6 percent in the next three days. The benchmark gauge fell as
much as 2.3 percent today as a government report showing
employment stagnated stoked concern the economy may fall into a
recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-Beta Preference &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trailing funds are likely to increase holdings in
companies that move the most relative to the benchmark, known as
high-beta stocks, to boost performance, Lee said. That
preference may result in a year-end rally, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1995, there had been nine years when more funds
trailed than those that beat from Jan. 1 through Aug. 31. The
market rallied in the last four months of a year in all but
2008, with the SP 500 rising 8.5 percent on average, JPMorgan
data showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When active managers trail, there is a tendency for
markets to rise into&#8221; the end of the year, Lee wrote.
&#8220;Intuitively, when there are more trailing, there will be
logically an attempt to outperform, which should be driven by
risk-taking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Linda Sandler" date="Sep 02, 2011  7:21 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-02/madoff-trustee-defends-19-billion-lawsuit-against-jpmorgan.html"><headline>Madoff Trustee Defends $19 Billion Suit Against JPMorgan</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s
firm defended a $19 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase 
Co., saying he was empowered by law to sue the bank on behalf of
innocent creditors of the Ponzi scheme operator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-biggest U.S. bank asked a judge last month to
dismiss trustee Irving Picard&#8217;s suit, citing U.S. District Judge
Jed Rakoff&#8217;s July ruling that he can&#8217;t sue on behalf of Madoff
customers, using common-law claims against parties who failed to
detect the fraud. Picard, who appealed the ruling, said
bankruptcy law gives him the powers necessary to bring his suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bankruptcy code allows the trustee to stand in the
shoes of a judgment creditor and assert common-law claims
against JPMC,&#8221; he said in a court filing yesterday. JPMorgan,
as Madoff&#8217;s primary banker, was central to the fraud and
&#8220;complicit&#8221; in it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard, in his fight with Rakoff and JPMorgan, is defending
his right to demand most of the $100 billion he is seeking from
banks and Madoff investors. Rakoff tossed almost $9 billion in
damages Picard sought from HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and feeder funds,
leaving $2 billion in bankruptcy claims. If forced to give up
common-law claims against JPMorgan, Picard would lose his right
to seek $19 billion and be left to pursue $1 billion in
bankruptcy and other claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Back Door&#8217; Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which accuses the trustee of mounting a &#8220;back
door&#8221; class-action suit on behalf of Madoff clients, said last
month that Picard&#8217;s suit never shows how JPMorgan was complicit
in Madoff&#8217;s crimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trustee never alleges facts showing that anyone at
JPMorgan had actual knowledge of Madoff&#8217;s crimes,&#8221; it said,
asking Judge Colleen McMahon, who is handling the case, to toss
it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In yesterday&#8217;s filing, Picard said bankruptcy law gives him
power to bring a case similar to a class, or group, action.
Standing in the &#8220;shoes&#8221; of an innocent creditor, he can
&#8220;allege harm to all creditors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The trustee is the
proper person to assert the claim.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), 1:11-cv-00913,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Ellen Rosen" date="Sep 02, 2011  6:56 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-02/sap-oracle-google-at-t-comcast-nbc-goldman-sachs-bofa-in-court-news.html"><headline>SAP-Oracle, AT&amp;amp;T, Comcast-NBC, Goldman Sachs in Court News</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;SAP AG (SAP), the largest maker of
business-management software, won its bid to overturn a jury&#8217;s
$1.3 billion award to Oracle Corp. in a copyright-infringement
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland,
California, yesterday called the award &#8220;grossly excessive&#8221; and
granted SAP&#8217;s motion to throw it out. She ruled that SAP should
get a new trial for damages if Oracle rejects her decision to
reduce the amount to $272 million, which she said should be the
maximum in damages based on the evidence at trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The verdict grossly exceeded the actual harm to Oracle,&#8221;
Hamilton said in the ruling. The jury verdict &#8220;was contrary to
the weight of the evidence, and was grossly excessive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury award in November was the largest ever for
copyright infringement. In the 11-day trial, Oracle accused
SAP&#8217;s TomorrowNow software-maintenance unit of making hundreds
of thousands of illegal downloads and several thousand copies of
Oracle&#8217;s software to avoid paying licensing fees in an effort to
steal customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was voluminous evidence regarding the massive scope
of the theft, clear involvement of SAP management in the
misconduct and the tremendous value of the IP stolen,&#8221; Deborah Hellinger, an Oracle spokeswoman, said yesterday in an e-mail.
&#8220;We believe the jury got it right and we intend to pursue the
full measure of damages that we believe are owed to Oracle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP and Redwood City, California-based Oracle, the second-
biggest maker of business software, are competitors in the
market for programs that businesses use to automate payroll,
human resources, accounting and other tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP, based in Walldorf, Germany, didn&#8217;t contest that it was
liable for the infringement by TomorrowNow, which it closed in
2008. Jurors based their award on the value of a hypothetical
license that SAP would have needed to use Oracle&#8217;s software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a license would never have existed between two fierce
competitors, so the damage award should have been based on
profits that Oracle lost and SAP gained as a result of the
infringement, SAP said in court filings. That amount was $28
million to $407.8 million, SAP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very gratified with the court&#8217;s decision,&#8221; Jim
Dever, an SAP spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mail. &#8220;We
believe the jury&#8217;s verdict was wrong and are pleased at the
significant reduction in damages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Oracle Corp. (ORCL) v. SAP AG (SAP), 07-01658, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (Oakland). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Wins Dismissal of Price-Shopping Site&#8217;s Antitrust Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc., the biggest Internet search company, won the
dismissal of antitrust claims filed against it by a price-
comparison website that accused it of anticompetitive practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MyTriggers.com Inc. had responded to a 2009 Google lawsuit
seeking $335,000 in advertising payments by accusing the
Mountain View, California-based company of raising the minimum
price for keywords that would lead Google users to
MyTriggers.com, effectively eliminating it as a possible
competitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge John P. Bessey in Columbus rejected the countersuit
in a 14-page ruling Aug. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The counterclaim only alleges harm to MyTriggers
itself,&#8221; Bessey wrote, noting the company concedes Google does
business with other price-comparison websites. &#8220;Such an
allegation undercuts MyTriggers&#8217; argument that competition as a
whole within the relevant market is being injured,&#8221; the judge
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MyTriggers&#8217; legal team was aided by Charles F. &#8220;Rick&#8221; Rule, who has represented Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and its claims were
supported by Ohio&#8217;s then-Attorney General Richard Cordray, who
recently became the head of the new U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Rule, who leads the antitrust practice group at New
York-based Cadwalader Wickersham  Taft LLP, nor Cincinnati
attorney Stanley M. Chesley, who also represented MyTriggers,
immediately returned calls seeking comment on the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s media office didn&#8217;t immediately reply to an e-
mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Google Inc. v. MyTriggers.com Inc., 09-
cvh-10-14836, Franklin County, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas
(Columbus). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agency May Have Violated Law With Microsoft Contract, Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal agency may have violated U.S. procurement laws
when it selected Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s products over Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s
without full competition for a planned $59.3 million e-mail
services contract, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, vying with Microsoft to gain a foothold in the $20
billion government cloud-computing market, sued the U.S.
Interior Department in October over the contract. In a complaint
filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, lawyers
for Google said the agency didn&#8217;t fully consider the company&#8217;s
&#8220;Google Apps for Government&#8221; product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a justifiable basis for me to find&#8221; violations
of procurement laws, Judge Susan Braden said yesterday at a
hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braden said she had written a 41-page opinion and will
issue it next week after deciding whether to require the agency
to hire an independent expert. That expert would evaluate
whether Google&#8217;s products meet the agency&#8217;s security needs, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The public interest would be well-served by doing that,&#8221;
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braden ordered the Interior in January to hold off on
making an award while she considered the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Kovacs, a Google spokesman, declined to comment
after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Google Inc. v. U.S., 10-743, U.S. Court of
Federal Claims (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comcast-NBC Universal Merger Wins Approval From U.S. Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s takeover of NBC Universal was approved by a
federal judge with conditions that will maintain the court&#8217;s
oversight of the deal for two more years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Leon ruled yesterday in
Washington that the Justice Department and the combined company
must report to him on arbitration actions initiated by online
video distributors and the outcome of those proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since neither the court nor the parties has a crystal
ball to forecast&#8221; how the final judgment will work out, the
additional steps are needed to protect the public interest, Leon
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast&#8217;s proposed acquisition of NBC Universal won
approval Jan. 18 from U.S. regulators under an agreement with
the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice
Department. Its terms, which needed court approval, imposed
conditions designed to protect the emerging online-video market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast is &#8220;pleased the court approved the consent
decree,&#8221; Sena Fitzmaurice, a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia-
based company, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica Smith, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail that the department also was pleased Leon ruled the
settlement &#8220;to be in the public interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Comcast, 11-cv-00106, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Trader Tourre Says Abacus Deal Done by Jersey Firms &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader Fabrice Tourre, accused of
misleading investors in a collateralized debt obligation, said
in a court filing that IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB)&#8217;s alleged
$150 million investment was actually made by two Jersey-based
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre wants to take testimony of witnesses at Loreley
Financing (Jersey) No. 29 Ltd. and Loreley Financing (Jersey)
No. 30 Ltd., according to the filing Aug. 31 in federal court in
Manhattan. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has said
Duesseldorf, Germany-based IKB made the investment in the CDO,
Abacus 2007-AC1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Discovery in this matter thus far has shown, however,
that IKB&#8217;s alleged $150 million investment was, in fact, made
by&#8221; the Jersey-based companies, Tourre&#8217;s lawyers wrote in the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 10, U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan
declined to dismiss the case against Tourre. The judge said the
SEC had met its burden for pursuing a claim that Tourre violated
a securities law designed to prevent fraudulent sales of
securities and should stand trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Nester, an SEC spokesman; Jorg Chittka, an IKB
spokesman; and David Esseks, a lawyer for Tourre at Allen 
Overy LLP in New York, declined to comment on the filing. Pamela Rogers Chepiga, another lawyer representing Tourre, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call and e-mail after business hours
inquiring about the Jersey-based companies&#8217; investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB advised Loreley on the investment, according to
Tourre&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC initially sued the London-based trader in April
2010, saying he defrauded investors by not disclosing that hedge
fund Paulson  Co. had helped pick the underlying securities for
the CDO and planned to bet against them. After reaching a $550
million settlement with New York-based Goldman Sachs, the SEC
filed a new claim against Tourre, saying he gave the company
&#8220;substantial assistance&#8221; as it misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said IKB wouldn&#8217;t have invested if it had known of
Paulson&#8217;s involvement in the portfolio selection, according to
this week&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IKB&#8217;s role was apparently limited to that of investment
adviser to the Loreley companies, in which capacity IKB could
only recommend to the directors of the Loreley companies that
they enter into securities transactions,&#8221; according to the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the &#8220;factual record&#8221; in the case contains almost no
evidence of the Loreley companies, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing last year&#8217;s U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Morrison v.
National Australia Bank, Jones, in June, threw out some claims
involving IKB, which allegedly lost almost all of its $150
million investment, and ABN Amro Bank NV, which assumed the
credit risk associated with a portion of Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Morrison, the high court ruled that U.S. securities laws
don&#8217;t protect foreign investors who buy stocks on overseas
exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-03229, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BofA Settlement Should Return to State Court, Judge Told &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) asked a federal judge to
return Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s proposed $8.5 billion mortgage-
bond settlement to the New York state court where it had been
submitted for approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of bond investors moved the case to federal court
in Manhattan on Aug. 26, arguing that that court has
jurisdiction under federal class-action laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon, the trustee for 530 securitization trusts that
hold loans underlying the bonds asked U.S. District Judge
William Pauley yesterday to send the case back to state court in
Manhattan. Countrywide Financial, which originated the loans,
was acquired by Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no basis for removal&#8221; to federal court, Matthew
Ingber, a lawyer for BNY Mellon, told Pauley at yesterday&#8217;s
scheduling hearing. The judge said he will hear arguments on the
question on Sept. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Federal Housing
Finance Agency, pension funds and other investors have objected
to the settlement, saying they need more information to
determine whether it&#8217;s fair. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has also protested the settlement, claiming the
state may have claims against Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $8.5 billion settlement, which was negotiated with a
group of institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc. and
Pacific Investment Management Co., would apply to all the
investors if approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-cv-5988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile Antitrust Challenge Gives ATT Little Recourse &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. (T) wouldn&#8217;t have much luck trying to salvage its
proposed $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA Inc. through
negotiation with the U.S. Justice Department, leaving a court
fight as its only recourse, lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of the country&#8217;s second- and fourth-largest
wireless carriers would violate antitrust law and
&#8220;substantially lessen competition,&#8221; the U.S. said in a lawsuit
filed Aug. 31 in federal court in Washington. The Justice
Department asked U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle to
block the deal, the largest announced acquisition of the year
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson in March
announced the proposed purchase of Bellevue, Washington-based T-
Mobile, a unit of Deutsche Telekom AG. (DTE) If the transaction falls
apart, Dallas-based ATT would owe the German carrier a breakup
fee and concessions worth as much as $7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the size of the cancellation fee that was
negotiated into this agreement, ATT has the incentive to
fight,&#8221; said Andrew Gavil, who teaches antitrust law at Howard
University in Washington. &#8220;The fact that the Justice Department
is challenging the deal doesn&#8217;t mean they won&#8217;t negotiate a
resolution at some point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huvelle, the judge assigned to the case, has ruled against
the Justice Department in antitrust matters before. In 2001, the
judge allowed SunGard Data Systems Inc. to acquire Comdisco
Inc.&#8217;s disaster recovery business for $825 million, rejecting
U.S. arguments that the deal would hurt competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HSH Nordbank AG sued JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to recover
damages it incurred after buying $159 million in mortgage-backed
securities from the New York bank that allegedly were less safe
an investment than advertised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage loans underlying the securities posed a greater
credit risk and were more prone to default than represented,
Hamburg-based HSH Nordbank said in a summons filed yesterday in
New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan. Offering materials
contained &#8220;misrepresentations and omissions&#8221; regarding
underwriting standards for the loans, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The securities have performed worse than expected due to
the poorer-quality collateral, and defendants&#8217; wrongdoing has
led directly to the plaintiffs&#8217; damages,&#8221; said the German
lender, which was bailed out during the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSH Nordbank said it&#8217;s seeking damages of at least $42
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasha Pelio, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined comment on
the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is HSH Nordbank AG v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA,
652416-2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Sued by Madoff Trustee Picard for $67.4 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) was sued for $67.4 million by the trustee
liquidating the money management firm of convicted Ponzi scheme
mastermind Bernard Madoff, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustee Irving Picard, who is seeking to recover money
transferred from Madoff&#8217;s company, also sued Sumitomo Mitsui
Trust Holdings Inc. for $54.3 million, Korea Exchange Bank (004940) for
$33.6 million, Cathay Life Insurance Co. for $41.7 million,
Banque Privee Espirito Santo SA for $11.4 million and Banca
Carige SpA (CRG) for $10.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the transfers to the entities sued were derived from
investment made with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC
by Fairfield Sentry, a Madoff feeder fund run by Fairfield
Greenwich Group, Picard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds the trustee seeks to recover from Barclays were
&#8220;transfers of customer property collectively made to the
Barclays defendants,&#8221; Picard wrote in the complaint against the
London-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff is serving a 150-year prison sentence for running
the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Picard v. Barclays Bank (Suisse) SA, 11-
ap-2569, Picard v. Cathay Life Insurance Co., 11-ap-2568, Picard
v. Banca Carige SpA, 11-ap-2570, Picard v. Banque Privee
Espirito Santo SA, 11-ap-2571, Picard v. Korea Exchange Bank,
11-ap-2572, Picard v. Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc., 11-
ap-2573, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Sued by Woman Saying Company Tracks Phone Location &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. was sued by a mobile phone user claiming
the company illegally tracks location information from mobile
devices in violation of state and federal privacy laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has designed its mobile operating software
Windows Phone 7 to track users&#8217; location deceptively even after
users choose to disable the feature, according to a complaint
filed in federal court in Seattle yesterday. The software is in
mobile devices made by Samsung Electronics Co., HTC Corp. (2498) and LG
Electronics Inc. (066570), and transfers the location data to company
server computers, the complaint shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michigan resident Rebecca Cousineau filed the lawsuit on
behalf of tens of thousands of consumers who use phones with the
Microsoft software and had their location data tracked after
they disabled the feature. The complaint seeks a court order
barring the company from tracking users&#8217; phone locations, $1,000
for each violation, and unspecified punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment about the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cousineau v. Microsoft, 11-1438, U.S. District
Court, District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Seeks to Vacate &#8216;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell&#8217; Ruling as Moot &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. asked a federal appeals court to vacate as moot
the ruling by a federal judge last year that the military&#8217;s
&#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell&#8221; ban on openly gay and lesbian service
members is unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals heard the government&#8217;s
arguments yesterday in Pasadena, California. The judges last
month asked President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration to explain
why the appeal shouldn&#8217;t be dismissed after Congress repealed
the 1993 law last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on July 22 signed
the certification attesting that the U.S. Defense Department is
prepared to repeal the ban. That certification ends enforcement
of &#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell&#8221; as of Sept. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Virginia Phillips in Riverside,
California, ruled last year that the law establishing the policy
violated constitutionally protected rights to due process and
free speech. The appeals court delayed enforcement of the
judge&#8217;s order while the administration appealed her decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. said in a July 14 filing with the appeals court
that once repeal takes effect, there are no remaining
controversies in the lawsuit and the case becomes moot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Log Cabin Republicans, who brought the suit challenging
&#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell,&#8221; have said Phillips&#8217;s ruling should
not be lifted because it sets a precedent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is mind-boggling that throughout this case, the Obama
administration has said repeatedly that it favors open military
service, yet it has fought us every step of the way and is now
appealing the court&#8217;s judgment in our client&#8217;s favor,&#8221; Dan Woods, a lawyer for the group, said Aug. 31 in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Log Cabin Republicans v. U.S., 10-56634, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s guerrilla group
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia planned to extort money
from companies operating in the Andean country, including
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Nike Inc. (NKE), President Juan Manuel Santos
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s army captured a member of the group known as
FARC within the past several days. The rebel, known only by the
alias &#8220;Brayan,&#8221; held extortion letters ready to send to 130
companies, including Toyota Motor Corp. (7203), Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO) and
unspecified oil companies, Santos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was an important blow by the army against the
FARC,&#8221; Santos said in a statement on the presidential website.
&#8220;We found 130 letters ready to be distributed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Santos took office in August 2010, he pledged to crack
down on rebel groups as he seeks to draw investment in oil wells
and mining. He said he would expel any companies that deal with
illegal groups. The FARC have stepped up attacks and kidnappings
over the past year as energy investments pour into the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) were among 17 banks sued by the U.S. to recoup $196
billion spent on mortgage-backed securities bought by Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Housing Finance Agency, on behalf of Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, filed 17 lawsuits yesterday in New York state
and federal courts and in federal court in Connecticut. The FHFA
accuses the banks of misleading Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about
the soundness of the mortgages underlying the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The loans had different and more risky characteristics
than the descriptions contained in the marketing and sales
materials provided to the enterprises for those securities,&#8221;
the FHFA said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FHFA is seeking to rescind the transactions plus other
damages, including civil penalties and punitive damages in cases
alleging misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to JPMorgan and Bank of America, the agency
filed complaints in federal court in Manhattan yesterday against
Citigroup Inc. (C), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Merrill Lynch  Co.,
Barclays Plc (BARC), Nomura Holdings Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Societe
Generale SA, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and First
Horizon National Corp. (FHN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FHFA sued Ally Financial Inc., Countrywide Financial
Corp., General Electric Co. (GE) and Morgan Stanley in state court in
Manhattan, according to the agency. It sued Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS) in federal court in Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie and Freddie &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have operated under U.S.
conservatorship since 2008, when they were seized amid subprime
mortgage losses that pushed them toward insolvency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FHFA said in its filings that Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac bought $6 billion in mortgage-backed securities from Bank of
America; $24.8 billion from Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America
took over in 2008, and $26.6 billion from Countrywide, which
Bank of America acquired the same year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FHFA claims Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bought $33
billion in securities from JPMorgan and $30.4 billion from Royal
Bank of Scotland. According to the complaints, Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac also bought $14.2 billion from Deutsche Bank, $14.1
billion from Credit Suisse, $11.1 billion from Goldman Sachs,
$10.6 billion from Morgan Stanley, $6.2 billion from HSBC, $6
billion from Ally, $4.9 billion from Barclays, $3.5 billion from
Citigroup, $2 billion from Nomura, $1.3 billion from Societe
Generale (GLE), $883 million from First Horizon and $549 million from
GE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FHFA sued UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, in July
over $4.5 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities sold
to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, claiming the bank misstated the
risks of the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The claims brought by the FHFA are unfounded,&#8221; said
Frank Kelly, a spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank.
&#8220;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the epitome of a sophisticated
investor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ally, based in Detroit, said in a statement that it
believes FHFA&#8217;s claims are meritless and the company intends to
defend its position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac &#8220;acknowledged that their losses
in the mortgaged-backed securities market were due to the
unprecedented downturn in housing prices and other economic
factors,&#8221; said Larry DiRita, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim Cherry of Memphis, Tennessee-based First Horizon said
the company would defend itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knew the Risks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms claimed to understand the risks, and continued
buying, even after their regulator said they lacked adequate
risk-management capabilities to do so, DiRita said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company representatives who declined to comment on the
suits yesterday included Danielle Romero-Apsilos of New York-
based Citigroup, Kerrie Cohen of London-based Barclays, Kristin Lemkau of JPMorgan in New York and Russell Wilkerson of
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Lake of New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS), Jonathan Hodgkinson of Tokyo-based Nomura, Michael DuVally, of Goldman
Sachs in New York, Steven Vames, of Zurich-based Credit Suisse,
Neil Brazil of London-based HSBC, and Jim Galvin of Paris-based
Societe Generale, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edinburgh-based Royal Bank of Scotland Plc will defend the
claims. &#8220;We believe we have substantial and credible legal and
factual defences to these claims and will defend them
vigorously,&#8221; the bank said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the complaints described mortgages that were
already performing worse than investors were told at the time
securitizations were sold. Disclosures by some firms overstated
home values or misrepresented the number of homes occupied by
borrowers, according to the FHFA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Under Water&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An instrument underwritten by an affiliate of Merrill Lynch
was reported to have no loans larger than the value of the
house, known as the loan-to-value ratio. In reality, about 20.7
percent of the mortgages had an LTV ratio above 100 percent,
meaning they were already under-secured or &#8220;under water&#8221; from
the start, according to the FHFA&#8217;s complaint. Some pools
packaged by GE or its affiliates were said to have no loans with
an LTV over 100 percent, when about 13 percent did, according to
another suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint against Goldman Sachs, the FHFA claimed
the bank securitized many mortgages that failed to meet
underwriting standards even after outside firms it hired
reported &#8220;high percentages of defective or at least
questionable loans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman simply ignored and did not disclose the red
flags,&#8221; the FHFA claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), 11-CV-6195; FHFA v. Barclays Bank Plc., 11-CV-
6190; FHFA v. Citigroup, 11-CV-6196; FHFA v. Credit Suisse

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) returned workers to some oil and natural gas platforms
as Tropical Storm Lee accelerated to the east-northeast, out of
the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crews are resuming production in the western Gulf after
inspecting equipment for damage, David Eglinton, a spokesman for
Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas-based said today in an e-
mail. Exxon moved about 140 employees to shore from
approximately 20 structures ahead of Lee. Shell, based in The
Hague, confirmed it began returning staff after evacuating as
many as 858 workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 60 percent of oil production from the Gulf,
equivalent to 843,223 barrels per day, remained shut as of 11:30
a.m. New York time, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement. Gas curtailments totaled
2.35 billion cubic feet, or 44 percent, down from 2.9 billion
cubic feet, or 55 percent, yesterday. The bureau said 239 of the
617 platforms in the Gulf were evacuated and 25 of the 70 rigs
currently drilling in the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interruptions will be brief, said James Williams, an
economist at WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas. &#8220;We&#8217;re not
talking about Hurricane Gustav here, moving pipelines up and
down Louisiana like it was spaghetti,&#8221; Williams said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;This one isn&#8217;t a big story. It&#8217;s a wet
story.&#8221; Gustav struck in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production Resumes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production resumed at Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)&#8217;s Nansen,
Boomvang and Gunnison platforms, the operator said today on its
website. Its Constitution, Marco Polo, Independence Hub, Neptune
and Red Hawk installations will be staffed and started as soon
as possible, The Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platforms become accessible as weather clears west to east,
Mike Hurst, chief pilot of PHI Inc. in Lafayette, Louisiana.
It&#8217;s the largest provider of helicopters to Gulf of Mexico oil
producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal flights may resume tomorrow over western and central
platforms with service to eastern platforms Tuesday, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi, is
operating normally, Katherine W. Swetman, a spokeswman, said
today in an e-mail. The unit can process as much as 360,000
barrels per day. More than 10 inches of rain fell in the area
the past four days, the National Weather Service said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Exxon Mobil refineries were operating normally today,
spokeswoman Claire Hassett said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
