<p>General Growth Properties Inc. will
support a revised financing proposal led by Brookfield Asset
Management Inc. in bankruptcy court after receiving a new
takeover bid from rival mall owner Simon Property Group Inc. </p>
<p>Brookfield and its partners, Fairholme Capital Management
LLC and Pershing Square Capital Management LP, made a proposal
with significantly enhanced terms over the group''s original
investment agreement, Chicago-based General Growth said in court
documents filed in Manhattan today. General Growth plans to move
forward with the Brookfield group even as it reviews a whole
company bid received yesterday from Simon, the filing said. </p>
<p>Simon offered about $6 billion to take over General Growth
and said it would pay down about $7 billion of unsecured debt, a
person with knowledge of the new bid said. The Indianapolis-
based company will drop its offer should the Brookfield group
receive warrants that will be issued if its plan is approved by
the bankruptcy court, said the person, who asked not to be named
because the details of the new offer aren''t yet public. </p>
<p>General Growth is scheduled to go before U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Allan Gropper in Manhattan May 5 to seek approval of the
Brookfield-led plan. Simon, spurned in a $10 billion takeover
offer for its biggest rival in February, had previously offered
to match the terms of Brookfield''s proposal while omitting a
provision that would require General Growth to issue stock
warrants. </p>
<p>One-Horse Race'' </p>
<p>General Growth has concluded that accepting a minority
investment from Simon Property Group -- even one without the
warrants -- would likely deter other parties from putting
together a competing proposal and overall create a one-horse
race, lawyers for General Growth wrote in the filing. </p>
<p>Les Morris, a spokesman for Indianapolis-based Simon, said
he had no comment. </p>
<p>The latest Brookfield proposal has as much as $7 billion in
equity commitments -- $500 million more than the prior one --
and includes an optional backstop for $1.5 billion in debt
financing if the company asks for it, according to court
documents. </p>
<p>General Growth''s board favors the Brookfield deal because
it will foster more competitive bidding, including the potential
sale of the company before or after its exit from bankruptcy,
the company''s lawyers wrote. </p>
<p>Warrant Changes </p>
<p>Under the new plan, Brookfield and its partners would get
40 percent of the warrants they''re seeking once their proposal
is approved by the court. They would receive 20 percent more on
July 12, and the remainder over the course of their commitment
to General Growth. Staggering the warrants would lower the extra
price another bidder, such as Simon, would have to pay should it
make an offer for the company. </p>
<p>Brookfield and its partners also agreed to increase the
strike price of their warrants. Once General Growth emerges from
bankruptcy, they will have warrants to buy shares of a newly
formed General Growth Properties at $10.50 each, up from $10
under the previous plan. </p>
<p>Simon estimates the 120 million warrants could cost General
Growth shareholders $895 million, while General Growth has put
their value at about $519 million. Simon Chief Executive Officer
David Simon said last week that the warrants would make General
Growth too expensive to purchase. </p>
<p>New Bid </p>
<p>Under Simon''s new offer, the company would pay $13.25
a share for the new General Growth Properties -- $10 in Simon
stock, and $3.25 in cash -- and would back-stop the $5-a-share
offering for a company to be spun off, General Growth
Opportunities, said the person familiar with the plan.Simon
also would pay down about $7 billion in unsecured General Growth
debt and assume more than $20 billion of mortgages, the person
said.
 Simon doesn''t plan to make any more offers for General
Growth should its latest one be turned down, the person said. </p>
<p>Brookfield is seeking so-called stalking horse status with
its bid, making it the first to set a value for General Growth. </p>
<p>General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
making acquisitions. Its properties include New York''s South
Street Seaport, Boston''s Faneuil Hall and the Grand Canal
Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co., the world''s biggest
media company, rose to an almost 10-year high after rivals
reported ad sales rebounded more than analyst estimated. </p>
<p>Disney, owner of ESPN, the ABC broadcast network and Disney

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. should
replace its top executives because they failed to understand the
politics of the financial crisis and mishandled regulators''
claims of fraud against the firm, according to Richard Bove, an
analyst at Rochdale Securities. </p>
<p>Goldman is going to have to pay a high price for its
ineptitude, Bove wrote in a note to investors yesterday. Its
shareholders already have. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs lost 21 percent of its value on the New York
Stock Exchange in two weeks after the company was sued on April
16 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which said
the New York-based company misled investors in a mortgage-linked
investment. Federal prosecutors are also investigating the
matter, people familiar with the matter said last week, and
Goldman Sachs executives were grilled by a U.S. Senate panel. </p>
<p>Senior management failed to understand that the government
has chosen to make Goldman Sachs an example of all of the
evils in the financial system that caused the Great
Recession,'' Bove wrote. The company behaved defensively and
with technical arguments, rather than proactively by redefining
the debate and talking about the service that Goldman Sachs
provides to the country, according to Bove. </p>
<p>It should have understood the size and enormity of the
forces being brought against it, Bove wrote. It did not.
Thus, its responses were weak and ineffectual. </p>
<p>$1 Billion Settlement </p>
<p>Bove wrote that he expects high-level executives are
going to have to be removed from their positions both in the
management suite and from the board of directors. He also
expects that the firm will pay a fine of at least $1 billion to
settle the SEC''s suit and will need to replace its legal team
with one that has greater Washington know-how. Finally, he
expects the firm will develop a new mission statement. </p>
<p>Still, Bove said he doesn''t advocate selling Goldman Sachs
stock. </p>
<p>Despite its political naivet, it is still the best
trading company in the world and the world needs to trade,
Bove wrote. </p>
<p>The shares, down 11 percent this year, rose $4.30, or 3
percent, to $149.50 at 4 p.m. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., buffeted by
a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
and a 21 percent decline in market value, is in talks to hire
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison LLP to bolster its
legal team, said a person briefed on the discussions. </p>
<p>The talks are likely to lead to an agreement to hire the
firm, said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because the
negotiations are confidential. The intention is to supplement,
not replace, the company''s current legal advisers including
Sullivan  Cromwell LLP, the person said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which generated a record $13.4 billion
profit last year, is seeking additional legal advice as it faces
issues tied to its sale of mortgage-linked securities that
include the SEC suit and a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing last
week, according to the person. Federal prosecutors are also
investigating the firm''s activities in the area, people familiar
with the matter said last week. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. Madelaine Miller, a spokeswoman for
Paul Weiss, didn''t return a call seeking comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s move to hire Paul, Weiss would echo a
similar decision made last year by Bank of America Corp. in
litigation with the SEC in federal court. The bank, based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, hired Paul, Weiss to augment a legal
team led by Cleary Gottlieb Steen  Hamilton LLP. </p>
<p>Citigroup, AIG, Spitzer </p>
<p>Paul, Weiss has also advised clients including Citigroup
Inc., American International Group Inc., former New York
Governor Eliot Spitzer and former vice presidential aide Lewis
Scooter Libby. </p>
<p>Richard H. Klapper at Sullivan  Cromwell is among the
partners leading Goldman Sachs''s defense against the SEC
lawsuit. The firm also received advice ahead of the Senate
hearing from K. Lee Blalack II of O''Melveny  Myers LLP, who has
previously worked as the subcommittee''s chief counsel and staff
director. Gregory Craig, President Barack Obama''s former White
House counsel, is now the partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher  Flom LLP assigned to advise Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Shares of Goldman Sachs rose $4.85, or 3.3 percent, to
$150.05 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading as of 1:25
p.m. The stock closed at $184.27 on April 15, the day before the
SEC filed suit, compared with $145.20 on April 30. </p>
<p>The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. faced a
renewed threat to one of the credit-card industry''s biggest
revenue sources after Senator Patrick Leahy backed legislation
to help merchants cut the cost of accepting payment cards. </p>
<p>Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, will co-sponsor a measure by Senate
majority whip Dick Durbin of Illinois that lets merchants offer
customers discounts for using cash or a particular card brand,
Durbin spokesman Max Gleischman said today. Merchants who accept
cards typically must pay about 2 percent per transaction. </p>
<p>The industry has escaped previous attempts to curtail so-
called interchange or swipe fees, which bring in more than
$40 billion a year. Now the nation''s biggest card networks and
lenders, including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase 
Co., find themselves pitted against two of the most powerful
senators over the fees, which some lawmakers and retailers have
said are excessive and hurt small businesses. </p>
<p>The motivation behind this is really to put merchants in
a position where they don''t pay their fair share, MasterCard
Chief Executive Officer Robert W. Selander said today after the
Purchase, New York-based company posted a 24 percent rise in
first-quarter net income. We think that Congress understands
that you can''t give anybody a free lunch. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s biggest
drugmaker, said first-quarter profit rose more than analysts
estimated as products added from the acquisition of Wyeth
overcame costs from the U.S. health overhaul. The shares gained. </p>
<p>Profit excluding certain items was 60 cents a share,
beating the 53 cent average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Net income decreased 26 percent to $2.03 billion, or
25 cents a share, from $2.73 billion, or 40 cents, a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Pfizer counts the pneumonia vaccine Prevnar and the
depression pill Effexor among the medicines gained in its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth, completed in October. Products from
Wyeth contributed more than $3 billion to Pfizer''s sales in the
quarter. The health-care law, enacted in March, cut revenue for
the period by $56 million, the company said. </p>
<p>Results came in better than expected, both from slightly
higher sales -- about 1 percent more than we were looking for --
and from cost saves, Joel Levington, managing director of
corporate credit for Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in
New York, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Pfizer increased 35 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $17.26 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
biggest gain among companies in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. The shares have lost 5.1 percent this year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s execution
and clearing unit agreed to pay NYSE Euronext and the Securities
and Exchange Commission $450,000 to settle allegations it broke
rules governing short sales on U.S. stocks because of a
bookkeeping error. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was censured for violating the SEC''s
Regulation SHO, which sets rules for handling bearish trades in
equities. The infractions, which are unrelated to the SEC''s
April 16 mortgage-related fraud suit against the world''s most
profitable investment bank, involved requirements implemented in
September 2008 to reduce naked short selling, in which firms
sell stock short without intending to borrow the shares required
to complete their obligations. </p>
<p>An emergency SEC rule implemented after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.''s collapse in September 2008 forced brokers to
close short sales that didn''t settle by the morning of the
fourth day after the trade. That regulation, called Rule 204T,
also imposed stricter requirements on subsequent short sales
when failures to deliver shares occurred. The rule was made
permanent in July 2009. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP initially responded
to the rule by implementing procedures that were inadequate in
that they relied too heavily on individuals to perform manual
tasks and calculations, without sufficient oversight or
verification of accuracy, the SEC said today. </p>
<p>Updating a Spreadsheet </p>
<p>The SEC said in its order that New York-based Goldman Sachs
failed to close out positions on Dec. 9, 2008, because an
employee in the firm''s operations department didn''t correctly
update a spreadsheet used to calculate market-maker obligations
related to short sales. While the company corrected the mistake
after the market opened that day, two market makers on NYSE Arca
were unable to conduct business in two securities for three
days, the SEC said. </p>
<p>The SEC also said Goldman Sachs failed to close out market-
maker positions on 46 occasions in 38 securities in January
2009. The commission said the failures resulted from the firm''s
error in calculating its potential T+6 obligations, referring
to the requirement that certain trades by market makers be
closed out by the morning of the sixth day after the transaction
occurred. These errors were the result of an employee
incorrectly removing a number used in calculations of short-sale
close-out obligations. </p>
<p>Processing Error'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. </p>
<p>This was the result of a manual processing error
following the changes in Rule 204T closeout requirements in
October 2008, Goldman Sachs spokesman Ed Canaday said in a
statement. There was no financial impact on our clients. We
now have improved, automated processes in place to avoid future
errors. </p>
<p>The company clears an average of 3 million trades a day,
said Canaday, who added that an automated system began in May
2009. </p>
<p>NYSE said that from around Dec. 9, 2008, to Jan. 22, 2009,
the Goldman Sachs unit failed about 68 times to close out
positions after short sales had failed to settle. Goldman Sachs
also didn''t notify customers that short sales in particular
stocks had failed to settle on time, the exchange said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs improperly accepted about 385 short-sale
orders from customers over the same time period, NYSE said.
Existing failed positions in specific securities required the
firm to accept only short-sale orders in those stocks when the
shares had been arranged to be borrowed in advance, which it
didn''t do, NYSE said. The broker also failed to reasonably
supervise and implement adequate controls to ensure short-sale
rules were met from Sept. 24, 2008, to Jan. 22, 2009, NYSE said. </p>

acquisition group in Europe, replacing Dieter Turowski. </p>
<p>Turowski, 44, will become global co-head of the natural-
resources advisory group in London alongside Carl Contiguglia,
who works in New York, said Morgan Stanley spokesman Michael Wang. Charlie Stewart, previously head of Latin American
investment banking, will replace Colocci as deputy head of
European investment banking, Wang said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley was the top-ranked adviser on announced
European deals last year, advising on mergers worth at least
$187 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The New
York-based firm ranks seventh this year with about $6.66 billion
of deals, the data show. The biggest transaction in 2010 was
advising flash-chip maker Numonyx Holdings BV on a $1.27 billion
offer from Micron Technology Inc. </p>
<p>European MA activity plunged in April, which was the worst
month for takeovers in the region for 1 1/2 years, with the
total value of transactions dropping to $32.8 billion from
$106.6 billion in March, according to Bloomberg data. That''s the
lowest level since November 2008, two months after the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>Colocci, 46, joined Morgan Stanley in 2004 from JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and was most recently chairman of European MA, Wang
said. He holds a bachelor of economics from Williams College and
an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. </p>
<p>Turowski, who joined Morgan Stanley in 1998, had been head
of European MA since early 2009, after replacing Gavin MacDonald. Before that Turowski was head of Morgan Stanley''s
German MA team based in Frankfurt and he also worked in the
bank''s telecommunications, media and technology team, Wang said. </p>
<p>Scott Matlock will become chairman of international MA in
London, Wang said. He was previously chairman of Asian mergers
and acquisitions in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported the appointments earlier
today on its website. </p>

company sold $5.15 billion of leveraged loans and other credits
to Carlyle Group. </p>
<p>Frey, 43, started at New York-based Highbridge as a
managing director yesterday, according to a statement. Before
joining Stanfield as a portfolio manager in 2004, he oversaw
high-yield bonds and leveraged loans as an analyst at Katonah
Capital and GoldenTree Asset Management LP. </p>
<p>David''s expertise will enhance our existing loan
activities and further strengthen our ability to serve
investors, Scott Kapnick, chief executive officer of
Highbridge Principal Strategies, said in the statement. </p>
<p>After earning a master''s of business administration at
Columbia University in 1993, Frey joined Morgan Stanley. As a
principal in the investment banking unit, he managed new issue
transactions including high-yield, high-risk loans and bonds,
bridge financing, convertible and initial public offerings. </p>
<p>Frey is a board vice chairman of the Loan Syndications and
Trading Association, a New York-based trade group. </p>
<p>Highbridge, founded in 1992, has about $21 billion of
assets under management, according to the statement. The
Principal Strategies unit manages about $4 billion in mezzanine
debt, loans, public credit securities and growth equity, the
firm said. </p>
<p>Carlyle, the Washington-based private equity firm, last
week won an auction to buy management contracts on $4.2 billion
of loans, which are packaged inside collateralized debt
obligations, and $950 million of managed accounts containing
similar securities from Stanfield in a bid to capitalize on a
recovery in loan prices and to expand its $13 billion of credit
investments. </p>

degradation of their client business, although clients keep
asking when is this going to stop, Hintz wrote. Hintz added
that the SEC case may continue for quite a while because the
firm doesn''t want to admit to a violation. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs management confirmed to Hintz that Monday
April 19, the first business day after the SEC case was filed,
was the firm''s largest day for equity commissions so far this
year, Hintz wrote. </p>
<p>Admittedly, Goldman Sachs has incurred reputation damage
and may suffer client fallout due to this case, Hintz wrote.
It is arguably difficult for a portfolio manager to buy or own
GS in an ERISA portfolio, a separately managed account or in a
mutual fund due to the current public outrage against the
firm. ERISA refers to the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974. </p>
<p>Samuel Robinson, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, confirmed that
Blankfein got a standing ovation. Robinson declined to comment
on the rest of Hintz''s note. </p>
<p>New Regulations </p>
<p>The uncertainty of new regulations is the greatest
strategic challenge facing Goldman Sachs today, Hintz wrote.
Viniar said that the firm is war-gaming a bunch of scenarios
to prepare for different potential regulatory changes, Hintz
said. </p>
<p>The firm estimates that about 75 percent to 80 percent of
derivatives that are currently traded over the counter will move
on to exchanges as the result of new regulation, Hintz said. The
rest are the highly profitable, tailored segment of the
business that will, under the current version of the Senate
bill, have to be originated outside of the company''s regulated
bank subsidiary, Hintz said. </p>
<p>This would force banks to move their fixed income
derivatives books from the bank subsidiary (that is FDIC
protected and has access to the Fed window) to a new separately
capitalized (and lower rated) derivatives subsidiary that would
likely be guaranteed by the bank holding company, Hintz wrote.
Goldman already operates its OTC fixed-income derivatives book
out of such a subsidiary and would not have to use new capital
to support this subsidiary. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is also planning a fair amount of hiring
in every part of its trading business this year, Hintz wrote. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. apologized after
James Glassman, a senior economist at the bank, said members of
the Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations showed
ignorance of market economics. </p>
<p>The report is from a single economist and does not
reflect the views of our firm, JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman
Jennifer Zuccarelli said in a May 4 statement. We disagree
with his characterizations, and we''re sorry. </p>
<p>Glassman, according to a copy of his May 3 note on the
Huffington Post''s website, criticized the low level of
economic literacy shown as the panel, led by Senator Carl Levin, grilled current and former executives from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. on April 27. The panel examined the bank''s duty to
clients and the ethics of betting against the housing market
while selling mortgage-linked securities. </p>
<p>The hearings exposed an unnerving ignorance of
fundamental principles of market economics by folks who have a
hand in remapping rules of finance that will be with us for a
while, Glassman wrote, according to the note. Now that the
financial reform debate is in the final innings, it''s time for
the grownups to step in. </p>
<p>In the note, Glassman discussed the economic troubles
facing the state of Michigan. The note included a graph
depicting the state''s employment decline since 2000 compared
with that of other states, which was titled People who live in
glass houses shouldn''t throw stones. Levin, a Democrat who was
not named in the note, is the senior senator from Michigan. </p>
<p>Tara Andringa, a spokeswoman for Levin, said the lawmaker
didn''t plan to issue a statement. Glassman didn''t return a call
seeking comment after normal business hours. Joe Evangelisti, a
spokesman for JPMorgan, had no further comment today. </p>
<p>The Senate is debating a sweeping rewrite of rules
governing Wall Street, intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008
financial crisis that led the U.S. to extend $700 billion in
taxpayer funds to firms including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.
Several senators said evidence presented at the April 27 hearing
supported the case for Congress to pass the legislation. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was late in
notifying the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority that
trader Fabrice Tourre might be sued for fraud by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar
with the matter. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs didn''t update Finra on Tourre''s status until
this week, more than two weeks after the SEC filed a lawsuit
against him and the firm for allegedly misleading investors
about a mortgage-linked security, the people said. Under Finra''s
rules, Goldman Sachs should have updated Tourre''s file within 30
days of his receiving a so-called Wells notice from the SEC last
year. </p>
<p>Penalties for failing to update Finra can include censure,
fines, suspension or expulsion from the brokerage industry. In
2004, Finra''s predecessor organization, the National Association
of Securities Dealers, fined 29 firms more than $9.2 million for
more than 8,000 late disclosures of reportable information about
their brokers and prohibited two firms, Morgan Stanley and
Wachovia, from registering new brokers for five business days. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Tourre are contesting the SEC''s suit. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported the lapse on its website
earlier today. Spokesmen for Finra and Goldman Sachs both
declined to comment. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. will start selling its
Kin mobile phones online tomorrow with Verizon Wireless, the
biggest U.S. mobile-phone carrier, as the software company tries
to take back ground in the fast-growing smartphone market. </p>
<p>The Kin One will sell for $49.99 after a $100 rebate and a
two-year service contract, the companies said in a statement.
The Kin Two, with a larger screen and higher-resolution camera,
will cost $99.99. Both phones go on sale in stores on May 13. </p>
<p>Microsoft is aiming to use the phones to regain momentum
against Google Inc. and Apple Inc. in the smartphone market.
Devices running Microsoft''s Windows operating system fell to 7.9
percent of the worldwide smartphone market in the fourth
quarter, down from 12.5 percent a year earlier, according to ABI
Research. Apple''s iPhone and phones using Google''s Android
software gained, passing Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. </p>
<p>The Kin phones are aimed at young mobile-phone users who
like to stay in touch with social networks. Customers will
listen to music through Microsoft''s Zune system and must sign up
for a Windows Live account to set up the device. </p>
<p>The stage of life and who these people are, they''re
exploring, sharing and trying to define themselves, said Eric
Hermelee, product management director for Microsoft''s mobile
communications business. We''re trying to be authentic to the
brand. </p>
<p>Video Chats </p>
<p>The company is working on improvements to its Windows Live
products, such as high-definition video chat services that
display social network updates, Brian Hall, general manager for
Microsoft Windows Live, said in an interview last month. </p>
<p>The phones will be available in Germany, Italy, Spain and
the U.K. in the fall from Vodafone Group Plc. </p>
<p>Microsoft dropped 28 cents to $29.85 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading at 4 p.m. New York time. The shares have declined 2.1
percent this year. New York-based Verizon Communications Inc.,
which co-owns the wireless company with Vodafone, fell 7 cents
to $28.68 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>The Kins have slide-out keyboards and let users check
friends'' messages and status updates on Facebook and Myspace
from their home screens. Customers will have to sign up for an
unlimited data contract for $29.99 a month, in addition to a
$39.99 calling plan, to use the phone, boosting Basking Ridge,
New Jersey-based Verizon''s sales. </p>
<p>Attractive'' Pricing </p>
<p>The price of the Kin phones may help draw customers, said
Michael Gartenberg, a partner at Altimeter Group. </p>
<p>The pricing of the devices is very attractive, said
Gartenberg. They''re competitive with feature phones that do an
awful lot less. The service fee might be much more palatable,
given the initial cost of acquisition is attractive. </p>
<p>Verizon is relying on data plan sales to maintain growth as
the market for mobile customers becomes saturated. There are
more than nine wireless devices for every 10 people in the U.S.,
according to the CTIA wireless industry association. </p>
<p>Overall, average monthly bills for customers last quarter
were little changed from a year earlier, while data charges grew
20 percent. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s credit
rating outlook was cut to negative from stable by Fitch
Ratings, which said legal actions and regulatory changes could
hurt the firm''s reputation and ability to earn money. </p>
<p>The long- and short-term issuer default ratings on New
York-based Goldman Sachs were affirmed at A+ and F+, Fitch said
today in a statement. Fitch said it''s unlikely that the long-
term rating would be cut below the A category. A+ is the fifth-
highest rating given by Fitch. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings last year,
was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for
fraud last month and was subjected to a Senate subcommittee
hearing last week that questioned its practices in underwriting
and selling mortgage-linked securities. Federal prosecutors are
also investigating the company, people familiar with the
situation said last week. </p>
<p>The rating outlook revision to negative incorporates
recent legal developments and ongoing regulatory challenges that
could adversely impact Goldman''s reputation and revenue
generating capacity, Fitch wrote in today''s statement. For
financial services companies, particularly those dependent on
the capital markets, reputation is critically important. </p>
<p>Fitch also pointed to regulatory changes under
consideration, including higher capital requirements, central
clearing of derivatives, restricted proprietary trading and
investments, that could challenge Goldman''s current business
model. </p>
<p>Absent serious negative legal results, Fitch does not
envision any adverse outcome that would precipitate a downgrade
to Goldman''s IDR below the A'' rating category, the statement
said. </p>
<p>Fitch Ratings is one of the three biggest credit rating
companies. Moody''s Investors Service rates Goldman Sachs at A1
-- the fifth highest rating -- with a negative outlook, while
Standard  Poor''s rates Goldman Sachs A -- the sixth-highest
level -- with a negative outlook. </p>
<p>Shares of Goldman Sachs rose 60 cents to $150.05 as of
11:30 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock is down about 18 percent since April 15, the day before
the SEC filed suit. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. is finding some
software pirates remain one step ahead of its efforts to
clamp down on fake or corrupted programs, the company''s anti-
piracy enforcement chief said. </p>
<p>The world''s largest software producer''s anti-piracy efforts
are hampered by programs that are difficult to distinguish from
genuine products, David Finn, associate general counsel for
anti-piracy, said by phone. That problem may be exacerbated by
the spread of cloud computing, whereby programs are hosted on
the Web rather than on users'' hard drives, he said. </p>
<p>The monetary value of unlicensed software worldwide grew by
5 percent to $50.2 billion in 2008, with the most widespread
piracy in countries including Armenia, Bangladesh, and Georgia,
according to data from Interactive Data Corp. and the Business
Software Alliance. Increases in theft are being driven by faster
growth of software in high-piracy emerging markets, they said. </p>
<p>While Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has succeeded in
combating some groups, unfortunately some of the other gangs
are one step ahead of us, Finn said. As they get smarter and
as the ways of avoiding detection get more elaborate, we have to
raise our game. </p>
<p>Last year, Microsoft joined software companies including
Symantec Corp. in asking the U.S. government to demand that
China curb software piracy. In 2006, the Chinese government
pledged to ensure that all government computers used only
genuine software, a promise the companies said had not yielded
many results. </p>
<p>The rising popularity of cloud services will make our job
tougher as more programs are hosted and used exclusively
online, Finn said. Microsoft is competing with rivals including
Google Inc. to offer Internet-based email, word processing and
calendar software. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley are among 20 financial companies competing to manage
Coal India Ltd.''s initial public offering, in what may be the
nation''s largest first-time stock sale. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and
Citigroup Inc. are also seeking the mandate, according to a
statement on the department of disinvestment''s website. Coal
India, the nation''s state-owned monopoly producer, may raise as
much as 130 billion rupees ($2.9 billion) in July, two
government officials said April 20. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the world''s second-biggest share sale
arranger, is competing for its first assignment managing a state
offering in India after the government said it will pay higher
fees. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh''s government aims to raise
$9 billion in the year ending March 31 selling stock in one
company almost every month. </p>
<p>This deal is the one to be on if you want to make a
statement in Indian investment banking circles, said
Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of equity at SMC Capitals Ltd. in
New Delhi. The amount Coal India aims to raise is large and it
is expected to be a historic public issue for India. </p>
<p>Coal India''s IPO would surpass Reliance Power Ltd.''s 115.6
billion rupee offering in January 2008 as India''s biggest,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Sensex Surge </p>
<p>The government said in January it may sell shares in 60
companies to shrink its budget deficit, after the key Sensitive
Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange jumped 81 percent in 2009,
the most in 18 years. </p>
<p>Nomura Holdings Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, DSP Merrill Lynch
 Co, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS Securities India Pvt. are
also scheduled to make presentations to the department today and
tomorrow, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Enam Securities Pvt., India Infoline Ltd., IDFC Capital
Ltd., JM Financial Ltd., ICICI Securities Ltd., Kotak Mahindra
Capital Co. Ltd., Avendus Capital Pvt., SBI Capital Markets Ltd.
and IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd. are also competing. </p>
<p>SJVN Ltd., the operator of India''s largest hydropower plant,
was the first IPO this fiscal year for the government. SJVN''s
sale was nine times oversubscribed in the institutional part and
three times in the retail portion, bringing life back to
public sector issuances, Thunuguntla said. It closed May 3. </p>
<p>The government plans to appoint as many as six book-running
lead managers for Coal India''s IPO, it said in the release. Iron
ore miner NMDC Ltd., which raised 99.6 billion rupees in the
largest state share sale in 2010 so far, had six book runners. </p>

<p>Morgan Keegan  Co., the 26th-largest
underwriter of U.S. bonds, must repay an investor $1.12 million
plus $153,000 in attorney''s fees for auction-rate securities
bought in connection with a Jefferson County, Alabama, sewer
project, an arbitration panel ruled. </p>
<p>The May 4 decision by a Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority panel in Atlanta resolves the first case to test
Morgan Keegan''s contention it shouldn''t have to repurchase
auction-rate securities connected with the Alabama deal, said
Kathy Ridley, a spokeswoman for the company. The project has
been tainted by the corruption conviction of Larry Langford, the
former Democratic chairman of the County Commission. </p>
<p>Memphis, Tennessee-based Morgan Keegan has yet to buy back
$165 million of auction-rate securities held by its clients,
including $50 million connected with Jefferson County, Ridley
said in a telephone interview today. </p>
<p>The company''s clients held as much as $2.2 billion of the
bonds at one point, most of which was either redeemed by the
issuers or repurchased by Morgan Keegan. </p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Morgan Keegan
in July, alleging the closely held company didn''t tell customers
about growing risks in the auction-rate market from Nov. 1,
2007, to March 20, 2008, when it sold $1.2 billion worth of the
securities. The instruments became inaccessible when the $330
billion market collapsed in February 2008. That case is still
pending, Ridley said. </p>
<p>Bond Refinancing </p>
<p>Auction-rate securities were marketed as a near-cash
alternative that could be liquidated at sales typically held
every seven, 14 or 35 days. The market froze in 2008 when banks
that sold the securities stopped serving as buyers of last
resort at the auctions, causing the transactions to fail. </p>
<p>A $3 billion refinancing of the sewer debt led by JPMorgan
Chase  Co. in 2002 and 2003 nearly bankrupted the county during
the credit crisis. Officials had sought to lower borrowing costs
by issuing floating-rate bonds and entering into swaps through
which the county would pay a fixed rate in exchange for a
variable rate meant to cover the bonds. The financing fell apart
when the companies guaranteeing the debt lost their top credit
ratings, causing the interest rates on the debt to soar. </p>
<p>While we agree whole-heartedly that investors should
recover their lost investments in the auction-rate securities
issued by Jefferson County, Alabama, we strongly believe that
the burden of recovery appropriately lies with the underwriters
of these failed securities, namely JPMorgan, not Morgan
Keegan, the firm''s press release states. </p>
<p>Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York,
declined to comment. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. may be
undervalued as U.S. Senate Democrats struggle to muster votes
for legislation to help merchants cut credit-card fees, Morgan
Stanley analyst Adam Frisch said. </p>
<p>The severity of the language in the proposed amendments,
in their current form, increases the potential for a 60-vote
approval requirement, Frisch wrote today in a note to clients
before the companies'' shares fell the most since October 2008.
We would be buyers on weakness. </p>
<p>Three proposals by Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of
Illinois could threaten more than $40 billion a year in
interchange or swipe fees collected by card-issuing banks
including Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. MasterCard and
San Francisco-based Visa set the rates. </p>
<p>Visa and Purchase, New York-based MasterCard fell yesterday
and today after Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, backed an amendment to the
financial industry overhaul bill that would let merchants offer
discounts for cash or a particular card brand, and allow
retailers to set maximum or minimum transaction amounts. </p>
<p>MasterCard fell 3.2 percent to $230.30 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares tumbled as
much as 11 percent today when the Dow Jones Industrial Average
plunged the most since 1987, before paring losses. Visa declined
4.1 percent to $82.92 after dropping as much as 12 percent. </p>
<p>Earnings Surge </p>
<p>MasterCard also declined as the euro slumped against the
dollar. Europe is MasterCard''s biggest market outside the U.S.
and the firm may face more competition there as banks plan to
create a rival payments network. Visa doesn''t process European
card transactions as that role is filled by London-based Visa
Europe Ltd., a separate company. </p>
<p>In the past week, Visa Inc. and MasterCard said net income
surged in the quarter ended March 31 amid a rebound in card
spending and as more consumers worldwide switch from cash and
checks to plastic. Net income at MasterCard climbed 24 percent
to $455 million, while Visa''s increased 33 percent to $713
million. Both companies'' results exceeded analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>There has been very little, if anything, in Visa''s and
MasterCard''s results to justify the selloff, Frisch said. </p>
<p>The other amendments from Durbin would limit the amount
payment networks can charge for debit-card transactions and
mandate that the government receive the lowest interchange
rates, which average about 2 percent per transaction. Durbin has
said the U.S. is a major user of credit cards. </p>
<p>Letter to Senators </p>
<p>There should be a fee associated with the use of credit
cards, but it has reached a point now of unreasonableness,
Durbin said yesterday during debate on the overhaul bill. </p>
<p>Merchants including convenience-store chain 7-Eleven Inc.
have complained to Congress that they are powerless to bargain
with Visa and MasterCard, calling them a duopoly. Finance-
industry groups including the Electronic Payments Coalition and
the American Bankers Association oppose Durbin''s proposals,
saying the measures would harm consumers, small businesses and
the economy. </p>
<p>Such amendments amount to express government price
setting of business-to-business transactions and would hurt the
ability of local banks to serve their communities, the Bankers
Association said today in a letter to senators. These
amendments would harm consumers by driving up the cost of credit
and by limiting the benefits consumers have come to expect. </p>
<p>Some state governments have crafted their own rules. </p>
<p>Vermont''s senate unanimously approved a bill May 4 to let
merchants decline credit cards for purchases under $10 and offer
discounts for cash or other card brands. Republican Governor Jim Douglas hasn''t decided whether to veto the legislation, said his
spokesman, David Coriell. </p>
<p>He does have some concerns, Coriell said yesterday.
You certainly don''t want to discourage people in any way from
coming to the Green Mountains and going on a ski vacation
because we''ve passed some regulation that makes it harder for
them to spend their money. </p>

<p>Rajat Gupta, the Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. director who is being investigated by U.S. authorities over
his links to Galleon Group LLC founder Raj Rajaratnam, had a
long-standing business relationship with the billionaire hedge
fund manager. </p>
<p>Interviews, public records, lawsuits and regulatory filings
show a 13-year history of co-investing and other business
collaborations between Gupta, 61, the former worldwide head of
consulting firm McKinsey  Co., and Rajaratnam, 52, the central
figure in the Galleon insider trading probe. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam has a stake in a fund managed by New Silk Route
NSR Partners LLC, founded by Gupta and three others in 2006 to
invest in South Asian companies, according to a New Silk Route
spokeswoman. The fund owns stakes in at least 11 Indian
companies, including cell phone tower operator Reliance Infratel
Ltd. and the Cafe Coffee Day chain. </p>
<p>Mr. Rajaratnam has had a well-known relationship with Mr.
Gupta for many years, and it is one that he is both proud and
fond of, Rajaratnam''s spokesman, Jim McCarthy, said yesterday
in a statement. Their association as investors has led to many
successful ventures around the world and made a large and
positive impact for a long list of worthy businesses and
charities. But just as important, they have always conducted
those efforts with integrity and diligent attention to sound,
ethical practices. </p>

<p>James Glassman, a senior economist at
JPMorgan Chase  Co., said it was a mistake for him to call
members of a Senate panel ignorant and to call for grownups to
step in to the financial reform debate. </p>
<p>It was a stupid thing to do, Glassman said today in an
interview after the New York-based bank apologized for his
remarks yesterday. I fell into the same trap of getting
emotional about these issues, when what I meant by saying the
grownups need to step in'' was that we all need to cool down and
find some common ground. </p>
<p>Glassman, in a May 3 note to clients, criticized the low
level of economic literacy shown as the Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations, led by Senator Carl Levin, grilled current
and former executives from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on April 27.
The Senate is debating legislation aimed at restructuring
financial-system oversight to head off a future crisis,
including regulation of derivatives that could eliminate
billions of dollars of revenue from Wall Street firms. </p>
<p>There are political pressures on the bank that limit what
it can say about Congress, said Richard Bove, a bank analyst
with Rochdale Securities who left Ladenburg Thalmann Financial
Services Inc. last year after a disagreement over settling a
defamation lawsuit against him. There are significant
limitations on the freedom given to analysts to express their

<p>Republicans filed an amendment today to remove language

off their swaps-trading operations. Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon told analysts last month that the bill would cost
the firm anywhere from several hundred million to a couple
billion dollars. </p>
<p>President Barack Obama''s senior adviser, David Axelrod, and
National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers met with
Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Dimon, and about 13 other
executives on April 6 in Washington and pressed them to stop
lobbying against the financial reform bill, people who attended
the meeting said last month. </p>
<p>JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli said in a May 4
statement that Glassman''s report is from a single economist
and does not reflect the views of our firm. </p>
<p>We disagree with his characterizations, and we''re
sorry, Zuccarelli said in the statement. </p>
<p>Public Face'' </p>
<p>Glassman, 63, said economists are often the public face
of a company, even though he doesn''t speak for the bank.
They were right to distance from this and to issue an
apology, he said. </p>
<p>Analysts'' controversial views have created problems for
their employers in the past. </p>
<p>Bove was sued in July 2008 by BankAtlantic Bancorp, which
said he defamed the company by saying it might fail in a report
titled Who is Next? Bove said at the time that he left
Ladenburg because it was moving to settle the suit while Bove
thought it had no merit. The case is still outstanding. </p>
<p>In 1990, analyst Marvin Roffman was fired by Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. after he expressed doubts about the future
of Donald Trump''s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, prompting
Trump to threaten a lawsuit. The Taj Mahal project was forced
into bankruptcy months after Roffman''s comments. </p>
<p>Glassman said he has received positive responses from
colleagues in the financial industry to his note, which he said
reflects the frustration felt as Wall Street is criticized by
politicians and pundits for the housing collapse and financial
crisis. </p>
<p>Singled Out'' </p>
<p>I understand the outrage and I understand why many people
in the industry feel we''re being unfairly singled out when there
is plenty of blame to go around, Glassman said. But Wall
Street was a part of the problem and bears some blame, and there
are things that need to be fixed. </p>
<p>Glassman said in the research note that the ignorance
shown by senators in the Goldman Sachs hearing is also plaguing
reform efforts. The present form of the legislation does little
to resolve the issue of banks being too big to fail and
rather focuses on issues that didn''t cause the crisis, he said
in the note. </p>
<p>The hearings exposed an unnerving ignorance of
fundamental principles of market economics by folks who have a
hand in remapping rules of finance that will be with us for a
while, Glassman wrote in the note. Now that the financial
reform debate is in the final innings, it''s time for the
grownups to step in. </p>
<p>Munger Impressed </p>
<p>Not everyone shared Glassman''s view of the proceedings.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Vice Chairman Charles Munger said in an
interview on May 3 that he was impressed with the senators''
understanding of the issues involved. </p>
<p>I thought they were the best I''d ever seen under such
circumstances in my history of watching senators, Munger said.
I thought it was an unusually intelligent and aggressive bunch
of people. </p>
<p>In the note, Glassman discussed the economic troubles
facing the state of Michigan and included a graph depicting the
state''s employment decline since 2000 compared with that of
other states, which was titled People who live in glass houses
shouldn''t throw stones. Levin, a Democrat who was not named in
the note, is the senior senator from Michigan. </p>
<p>Glassman said today the note was unfair to the senators
and said his main concern is the unintended consequences that
could arise from quickly pushing a financial reform bill through
Congress. </p>
<p>Tara Andringa, a spokeswoman for Levin, said yesterday the
lawmaker didn''t plan to issue a statement. Joe Evangelisti, a
spokesman for JPMorgan, had no further comment yesterday. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. notes, the most
actively traded U.S. corporate bonds today, fell as investors
sell riskier credit amid concerns that Europe''s financial crisis
may broaden. </p>
<p>The company''s defaulted 8.375 percent securities due in
2033 declined 1.75 cent to 33.25 cents on the dollar as of 11:19
a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Detroit-
based GM restructured in bankruptcy last year. </p>
<p>The automaker''s debt has fallen amid a broad pullback
across the distressed market, said Timothy Daileader, director
of research at Knight Capital Group Inc. in Greenwich,
Connecticut. High-yield bond spreads rose 23 basis points
relative to similar-maturity Treasuries yesterday, the most
since June 2009, to 591 basis points, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. </p>
<p>GM bonds are an easy sell for distressed accounts to
raise liquidity, Daileader said. Those investors have been
buyers of European bank paper, and that is directly affected by
the pullback in Europe. </p>
<p>High-yield, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody''s
Investors Service and BBB- by Standard  Poor''s. Distressed
companies are those in default or with yield spreads of more
than 10 percentage points, or 1,000 basis points. </p>

<p>A Pfizer Inc. unit won a re-trial of a
Pennsylvania lawsuit over its menopause drugs that ended in a
first jury''s award of $1.5 million in damages, the company said. </p>
<p>A Philadelphia judge yesterday ruled lawyers for the
plaintiff, Merle Simon, must ask another jury to consider
whether Pfizer''s Pharmacia  Upjohn subsidiary hid the health
risks of its Provera hormone-replacement drug. In December, an
appeals court reinstated Simon''s original verdict after it was
thrown out by the trial court, giving the judge the option of
ordering a new trial. </p>
<p>We anticipate we have a good opportunity to win another
verdict on behalf of Mrs. Simon, Jim Morris, one of the
woman''s lawyers, said in a telephone interview today. We
intend to push forward with this case until justice is served. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women have taken hormone-replacement
medicines to treat menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, night
sweats, and mood swings. Until 1995, many patients combined
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug made by Wyeth, with progestin-
laden Provera, made by Upjohn. </p>
<p>Wyeth later combined the two hormones in Prempro. The drugs
are still on the market. New York-based Pfizer, the world''s
largest drugmaker, completed its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth
in October. </p>
<p>Appropriate'' New Trial </p>
<p> We are pleased with the judge''s ruling as we believe a new
trial is appropriate given the facts of this case, Chris Loder, Pfizer''s spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement today. </p>
<p>A three-judge Superior Court panel on Dec. 31 found state
Judge Nitza Quinones Alejandro erred in finding Simon''s claims
were barred by Pennsylvania''s statute of limitations on
lawsuits. </p>
<p>The panel noted it was entirely unreasonable to assume
women knew the links between hormone-replacement drugs and
breast cancer until the 2002 Women''s Health Initiative study,
sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, made it
clear. The study found that women using menopause medicines have
a higher risk of breast cancer. </p>
<p>The panel sent the case back to Alejandro so she could
decide whether Pfizer was entitled to a new trial, and in the
meantime, ordered the jury verdict reinstated, according to the
38-page ruling. </p>
<p>The appeals court still must rule on whether to accept
Alejandro''s decision on the new trial. </p>
<p>Morris said a new trial would reinstate Wyeth as a
defendant in the case. Jurors in the original case rejected
Simon''s claims that Wyeth''s menopause medicine was also a cause
of her breast cancer. </p>
<p>The case is Simon v. Wyeth, 040604229, Court of Common
Pleas (Philadelphia). </p>

<p>Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceutical Co.,
the drugmaker controlled by China''s wealthiest couple, jumped in

paper return on its investment in the company. </p>
<p>Hepalink, the world''s biggest maker of the blood-thinner
heparin, climbed to 175.17 yuan on the Shenzhen stock exchange
from its initial public offer price of 148 yuan. Today''s 18
percent gain values Goldman''s stake, bought for $4.9 million in

<p>The IPO price was the highest by any company in China,

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
buying the Mexican peso against the dollar, saying strengthening
growth in the Latin American country''s economy will help the
currency recover after an irrational sell-off. </p>
<p>The peso added 0.7 percent to 12.9002 at 3:40 p.m. New York
time today and will advance 5.7 percent to 12.2 per dollar,
Fiona Lake, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note today.
The peso has dropped 4.6 percent versus the dollar this week,
its biggest decline since November 2008, on concern the European
debt crisis will derail the global economic rebound. </p>
<p>The global macro picture remains extremely supportive of
a clear pro-cyclical stance, Lake said. Markets have
displayed a certain degree of irrational behavior in recent
days, which suggests the related price action may have overshot.
The peso outlook has improved very significantly as growth has
strengthened rapidly. </p>
<p>Before this week''s decline, the peso had risen 6.3 percent
this year against the dollar, the best performance among 16
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, as the recovery in the
U.S., Mexico''s largest trading partner, boosted its exports.
Reports showed today that U.S. payrolls surged by the most in
four years in April, while German industrial production rose
more than economists forecast in March. </p>
<p>Mexico is well placed to benefit from the improving
growth outlook in the U.S., Lake said. </p>
<p>Central banks have more tools to provide liquidity to
financial institutions than in 2008 and some reports of
sovereign contagion risks in Europe have been overstated,
Lake said. </p>
<p>Investors should exit the trade if the peso declines to
13.2 per dollar, according to the note. </p>

<p>Iron Man 2 may top $400 million in
domestic ticket sales, kicking off what is likely to be a record
summer for Hollywood studios, analysts said. </p>
<p>The film, made by Walt Disney Co''s Marvel Entertainment and
distributed by Viacom Inc.''s Paramount Pictures, opens in
theaters today and is projected to take in as much as $155
million this weekend in the U.S. and Canada, according to
Jeffrey Hartke, an analyst with Hollywood Stock Exchange.com. </p>
<p>Higher ticket prices and demand for 3-D movies will likely
push box-office sales beyond last summer''s record $4.25 billion,
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com''s box-office
tracking unit. Screenings in 3-D have accounted for $851
million, or 25 percent, of all box-office revenue this year,
according to Hollywood.com. Theaters typically charge about $3
more per ticket for a 3-D movie. </p>
<p>We''re definitely going to have a record, Dergarabedian
said in an interview. </p>
<p>As of May 3, year-to-date receipts totaled $3.36 billion in
U.S. and Canadian theaters, up 6.3 percent from $3.25 billion a
year ago, according to Hollywood.com. </p>
<p>Studios are scheduled to release seven three-dimensional
films this summer, including Disney''s Toy Story 3 on June 18
and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc''s Shrek Forever After on
May 21. The average ticket price for 3-D and 2-D movies combined
in the U.S. and Canada is about $7.95, up from $7.45 last
summer, according to Hollywood.com. </p>
<p>Iron Man 2, which was not filmed in 3-D, features
Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, who dons an armored, jet-
powered suit. Mickey Rourke and Scarlett Johansson co-star. </p>
<p>Twilight: Eclipse'' </p>
<p>The original film, released in 2008, generated worldwide
ticket sales of $585 million, according to researcher Box Office
Mojo. Iron Man 2 has taken in $132.9 million since its
release last week outside the U.S. The movie may reach $400
million in domestic sales, Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with
Wunderlich Securities in Denver, said in a May 3 note. </p>
<p>Other films likely to generate significant sales this
summer include Summit Entertainment LLC''s The Twilight Saga:
Eclipse, the third film in the series based on the novels by
Stephenie Meyer, Dergarabedian said. The first two movies,
starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, have had
worldwide sales of $1.1 billion, according to Box Office Mojo. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc.''s board
backed the latest financing proposal from a group led by
Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in court, rejecting Simon
Property Group Inc.''s best and final offer. General Growth
fell as much as 13 percent in New York trading. </p>
<p>The Brookfield-led plan is better than Simon''s, General
Growth President Thomas Nolan said in testimony read in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan today. Lawyers for Simon, the
largest U.S. mall owner, said the company will withdraw from
bidding if U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper approves the
Brookfield plan, partly because the stock warrants that
accompany it would make Simon''s buyout more expensive. </p>
<p>Under the revision introduced today, Brookfield''s
investment partner Pershing Square Capital Management LP would
forgo any warrants until General Growth''s reorganization is
complete, and Toronto-based Brookfield would increase the strike
price on its warrants to $10.75 from $10.50, General Growth
lawyer Marcia Goldstein told Gropper. Another partner, Fairholme
Capital Management LLC, also would get warrants. </p>
<p>The hearing comes a day after Indianapolis-based Simon
stepped up its three-month quest to acquire General Growth by
making a $6.5 billion bid for the Chicago-based company.
Brookfield''s rival proposal would leave General Growth an
independent company. </p>
<p>$20 a Share </p>
<p>Simon''s offer is valued at $20 a share, the company said
yesterday in a statement. It consists of $5 in cash, $10 in
shares of Simon stock and the distribution of shares in a new
company, General Growth Opportunities, valued at $5. </p>
<p>General Growth fell $1.24, or 7.8 percent, to $14.60 at
1:59 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading. The shares earlier
traded as low as $13.86. </p>
<p>These offers are best and final, Simon Chief Executive
Officer David Simon said in a letter to General Growth''s board.
Simon will not participate in the bidding process in the GGP
bankruptcy proceeding in any way once GGP commits to issue the
warrants associated with the latest Brookfield-sponsored plan. </p>
<p>Pershing Square''s Chief Executive Officer William Ackman
responded today with a letter to the General Growth board
offering to forgo 17 million interim warrants. Ackman made the
offer in an effort to push through Brookfield''s plan, saying
Simon''s bid posed antitrust risks because it would link the
nation''s two largest mall owners. </p>
<p>Simon estimates the warrants could cost General Growth
shareholders $895 million. Ronen Bojmel, a managing director at
General Growth''s financial adviser Miller Buckfire  Co.,
testified today that they would be worth about $688 million. </p>
<p>Unsecured Debt </p>
<p>Simon''s original bid on Feb. 16 would have given General
Growth stockholders $9 a share, including $6 in cash. That was
turned down as too low. Both that plan and the new one pay all
General Growth unsecured creditors, who hold about $7 billion in
debt, in full. </p>
<p>General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
making acquisitions. Its properties include New York''s South
Street Seaport, Boston''s Faneuil Hall and the Grand Canal
Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. </p>

<p>The $3.1 billion merger of UAL Corp.''s
United Airlines and Continental Airlines Inc. was only the
year''s 38th-largest deal. That didn''t keep some of Wall Street''s
top rainmakers from getting involved. </p>
<p>James B. Lee Jr., a vice chairman and veteran merger
adviser at JPMorgan Chase  Co., and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s
Michael Carr, a senior member of the firm''s merger leadership
group, advised UAL Chief Executive Officer Glenn Tilton. Morgan
Stanley''s Robert Kindler, head of global mergers and
acquisitions, worked with Continental, alongside Lazard Ltd.''s
Harry Pinson, a banker in the carrier''s home city of Houston. </p>
<p>The merger, which creates the world''s biggest airline with
almost 86,000 employees, was the second effort in two years to
bring United and Continental to the altar. In April 2008, the
airlines were hours away from approving a deal when Continental
pulled out of talks and resolved to remain independent. </p>
<p>The deal executed last Sunday night was virtually the same
transaction we negotiated two years ago, Lee said in an
interview with Charlie Rose published in Bloomberg
Businessweek''s May 10 issue. The seeds were planted quite some
time ago. </p>
<p>United and Continental announced the merger on May 3 after
signing the deal the night before at the offices of Cravath,
Swaine  Moore LLP, United''s legal counsel. </p>
<p>GE, PepsiCo </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s team included Thomas Miles, Christopher Ventresca, co-head of North American mergers and acquisitions,
and David Fox, head of Midwest investment banking. Goldman''s
Patrick McClymont also advised Chicago-based United. Morgan
Stanley''s Nelson Walsh and Josh Connor were part of the group
advising Continental. </p>
<p>The deal is the latest in a series of high-profile mandates
for Lee and Kindler. Lee, 57, a longtime adviser to UAL''s
Tilton, helped General Electric Co. sell a majority stake in NBC
Universal to Comcast Corp. last year and led negotiations with
the U.S. Treasury on behalf of Chrysler LLC bank-debt holders. </p>
<p>Kindler, 56, advised PepsiCo Inc.''s biggest bottler on its
sale to the soda and snack maker last year, and helped CF
Industries Holdings Inc. win a year-long battle to buy Terra
Industries Inc. Carr has been helping Airgas Inc. defend against
a hostile takeover bid from Air Products  Chemicals Inc. </p>

<p>Iron Man 2, a sequel based on the
Marvel superhero comics, opened as the top movie in U.S. and
Canadian theaters, kicking off the summer film season with
$133.6 million for Walt Disney Co. and distributor Paramount
Pictures. </p>
<p>The film posted the fifth-highest opening weekend gross
ever, Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>The movie marks what is likely to be a record summer box-
office season for Hollywood, Hollywood.com said. The original
Iron Man, released in 2008, generated total worldwide ticket
sales of $585 million, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. </p>
<p>It delivered on what it promised, said Jeff Bock,
senior box-office analyst at Los Angeles-based Exhibitor
Relations Co. The original film set the bar so high, but this
was on target with all expectations in what it offered. </p>
<p>In the sequel, Robert Downey Jr. returns as Tony Stark, an
industrialist who dons a jet-powered, armored suit to fight
villains. </p>
<p>The movie had $10.2 million in sales at Imax Corp.
theaters, a record for the company. </p>
<p>Time Warner Inc.''s The Dark Knight holds the record for
the highest grossing film with $158.4 million in its opening
weekend in July 2008. It went on to earn $533.3 million at the
domestic box office, Hollywood.com said. </p>
<p>Nightmare on Elm Street'' </p>
<p>Higher ticket prices and demand for 3-D movies will likely
push box-office sales beyond last summer''s record $4.25 billion,
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com''s box-office
tracking unit. Screenings in 3-D have accounted for $851
million, or 25 percent, of all box-office revenue this year,
according to Hollywood.com. Theaters typically charge about $3
more per ticket for a 3-D movie. </p>
<p>A Nightmare on Elm Street dropped to second place with
$9.2 million for Time Warner Inc.''s New Line studio. The film,
which features Jackie Earle Haley as serial-killer Freddy
Krueger, has taken in $48.5 million in two weeks. </p>
<p>How to Train Your Dragon, from DreamWorks Animation SKG
Inc., dropped to third place from second with sales of $6.8
million. The film has made $201 million in six weeks of release. </p>
<p>Date Night, a comedy starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell, fell to fourth place from third, taking in $5.3 million
for News Corp. </p>
<p>Robin Hood'' </p>
<p>The Back-Up Plan, from CBS Corp.''s film division,
dropped to fifth place from fourth with sales of $4.3 million.
The romantic comedy starring Jennifer Lopez, has made $29.4
million in three weeks. </p>
<p>Robin Hood will debut next weekend and likely won''t
take the No. 1 spot from Iron Man 2, Bock said. </p>
<p>It will be tough to beat Iron Man,'' he said. Only
Shrek Forever After'' and Toy Story 3'' may have a chance. Those
are probably the top three movies of the summer. </p>
<p>Sales for the top 12 films rose 21.9 percent to $173.9
million from $142.8 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com said.
Year-to-date receipts total $3.66 billion, up 6.5 percent from
$3.43 billion. Attendance has fallen 0.08 percent this year. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank, said a new tax on executive bonuses in the
U.K. will be material, without specifying how much it will
cost the company. </p>
<p>The impact of this legislation is in the process of being
quantified, and is expected to be material, JPMorgan said in a
regulatory filing today. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said the charge will appear in the second quarter,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., ranked
first and third in the U.S. by assets, said in separate filings
last week that they expect to pay $465 million and $400 million,
respectively. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has estimated the tax may
cost more than $600 million. </p>
<p>U.K. officials, seeking to assuage public outrage over
bailout programs, imposed a one-time tax on bonuses of more than
25,000 pounds, or about $37,000 at current exchange rates. The
levy covers bonuses awarded between Dec. 9, 2009, and April 5.
George Osborne, the U.K. Conservative lawmaker in charge of the
party''s Treasury policy, said in January large cash bank bonuses
are unacceptable at a time when ordinary workers are struggling
to cope with the recession. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank, said in a
filing last week that it will recognize a charge without saying
how much. </p>
<p>The U.K. Treasury, which initially said the tax would raise
550 million pounds, has estimated it may net as much as 2
billion pounds, according to a government official who declined
to be identified. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which repaid $25 billion in U.S. aid last year,
remained profitable throughout the financial crisis, relying on
fee income to counter loan losses in mortgage lending and credit
cards. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche
Bank AG are in talks to provide about $2 billion of financing to
a group led by Centerbridge Partners LP and Paulson  Co. that
is bidding for bankrupt U.S. hotel chain Extended Stay Inc., two
people familiar with the situation said. </p>
<p>The Centerbridge-Paulson led group, which also includes
Blackstone Group LP, has committed to invest up to $905.4
million into Extended Stay, trumping an early offer from a group
lead by Starwood Capital. A deal with the banks, which would be
backed by Extended Stay''s real estate, hasn''t been completed,
said the people, who declined to be named because the
negotiations are private. </p>
<p>Extended Stay, which filed the largest bankruptcy case by a
U.S. hotel owner in June, withdrew its request for approval of
the Starwood proposal last month. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. are in talks to provide the Starwood-led group
with about $2.2 billion of financing, a person familiar with the
situation said. </p>
<p>At an April 8 hearing, Marcia Goldstein, a lawyer for
Extended Stay at Weil, Gotshal  Manges LLP in New York, said
the company favored the Centerbridge-Paulson offer over
Starwood''s. Under the terms, the hotelier can seek better deals,
and an auction is planned for May 27, she said. </p>
<p>Bundling Debt </p>
<p>The banks plan on bundling the debt to be sold as bonds,
said the people. Sales of commercial mortgage-backed securities
plummeted to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record $232.4 billion
in 2007 as credit markets seized up, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Even with U.S. government aid, only $3.04 billion
of the bonds were sold last year, and a $309.7 million issue was
the only offering this year. </p>
<p>David Lichtenstein''s Lightstone Group LLC bought Extended
Stay in 2007, relying on more than $7 billion in debt financing
to complete the $8 billion deal just weeks before the leveraged-
buyout market imploded. </p>
<p>Representatives of JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup
declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Starwood.
Representatives of Centerbridge, Paulson and Goldman Sachs
didn''t immediately respond to requests for comment. </p>
<p>The Centerbridge-Paulson offer includes $450 million in
cash, $200 million to backstop a rights offering and as much as
$255.4 million to creditors who elect to take cash at a 30
percent discount to the value of the stock the reorganization
plan otherwise would give them. </p>
<p>May 17 Deadline </p>
<p>The $450 million equity injection is for 43 percent of the
new company and the backstop represents another 19 percent. </p>
<p>The deadline for proposals for investing in Extended Stay
is May 17. Starwood plans to bid for the hotel chain, Bruce Zirinsky, a lawyer for Starwood at Greenberg Traurig LLP in New
York, said at an April 22 court hearing. </p>
<p>Five Mile Capital Partners LLC, an alternative-investment
firm in Stamford, Connecticut, and TPG, a private-equity firm in
Fort Worth, Texas, are part of Starwood''s investment group. The
talks with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup were previously reported
by the Wall Street Journal. </p>
<p>The case is In re Extended Stay Inc. 09-13764, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s traders
made money every single day of the first quarter, a feat the
firm has never accomplished before. </p>
<p>Daily trading net revenue was $25 million or higher in all
of the first quarter''s 63 trading days, New York-based Goldman
Sachs reported in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission today. The firm reaped more than $100 million on 35
of the days, or more than half the time. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which is facing a fraud lawsuit from the SEC
related to the sale of a mortgage-linked security in 2007,
generated $9.74 billion in trading revenue in the first quarter,
exceeding all of its Wall Street competitors. Trading accounted
for 76 percent of first-quarter revenue. The lack of trading
losses could add to the perception that Goldman Sachs has an
unfair advantage in the markets, said one shareholder. </p>
<p>It will reinforce the heads we win, tails you lose
mentality that people think actually exists and promotes the
concept of an unfair advantage, said Douglas Ciocca, a
managing director at Renaissance Financial Corp. in Leawood,
Kansas, which oversees about $2 billion in assets including
Goldman Sachs shares. It''s too politically charged not to, how
is that possible that they only make money? </p>
<p>Record Earnings </p>
<p>The bank, which reported record earnings last year, is
contesting the SEC''s lawsuit and the firm''s executives were
interrogated at a Senate subcommittee hearing last month.
Goldman Sachs, which maintains that it did nothing wrong, is
also being investigated by federal prosecutors, said people
familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>This is the first time we have reported zero trading loss
days in a quarter, Samuel Robinson, a Goldman Sachs spokesman,
said in an e-mail. We believe it shows the strength of our
customer franchise and risk management. </p>
<p>Ciocca echoed that view, saying he thinks the performance
proves the strength of the firm''s risk-management models and its
ability to make money even in markets with low volatility. </p>
<p>The statistical probability of going through what we did
would never favor them making money every day, Ciocca said.
It actually speaks very well of their capability to manage
through different types of markets. </p>
<p>Reaching Out </p>
<p>Ciocca said he''s had first-hand experience of Goldman
Sachs''s efforts to reach out to clients in the wake of the SEC
lawsuit to answer questions about the matter. He said
representatives from Goldman Sachs''s asset-management division
contacted his firm during the last week of April even though
they hadn''t been in touch for a year before that. </p>
<p>It was tactical, it was appropriate, it wasn''t
patronizing, it was very sincere, Ciocca said. </p>
<p>In its SEC filing today, Goldman Sachs said it is expecting
further litigation related to sales of collateralized debt
obligations. </p>
<p>We anticipate that additional putative shareholder
derivative actions and other litigation may be filed, and
regulatory and other investigations and actions commenced
against us with respect to offering of CDOs, the bank said. </p>
<p>The company also laid out in the filing a worst-case
scenario of what could happen if the firm doesn''t resolve the
SEC case and can''t obtain appropriate waivers from relevant
regulators. </p>
<p>Imposing Restrictions </p>
<p>The results could include an inability to act as a
registered broker-dealer or provide certain advisory and other
services to U.S. registered mutual funds, the filing said.
In addition, regulators could impose restrictions on the
activities of our banking, commodities, investment advisory or
other regulated businesses. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s first-quarter earnings were the second-
highest in the company''s history. </p>
<p>The firm''s stock dropped 22 percent from before the SEC
lawsuit was filed on April 16 through May 7, making it the worst
performer among the six largest U.S. banks so far in 2010. </p>
<p>The shares rose 84 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $143.83 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, as global
stocks soared with the European loan program to end the
sovereign-debt crisis. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. lost a bid to
dismiss a lawsuit filed by Jefferson County, Alabama, that
claims the bank enticed it into a risky refinancing of about $3
billion of sewer debt by making $8 million in payments to
friends of county officials. </p>
<p>Circuit Judge Caryl Penney Privett in Birmingham rejected
the New York-based bank''s arguments that the county is barred by
the statue of limitations, a time limit for bringing action, and
its contention that the county failed to show that JPMorgan was
involved in a conspiracy, in a ruling issued May 7. </p>
<p>Jefferson County, in the suit filed in November, alleged
fraud, conspiracy and unjust enrichment against those who have
brought the county and its citizens to the brink of financial
disaster while lining their own pockets. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, advised
the state''s most populous county in 2002 and 2003 to enter into
a series of floating-rate bond and interest-rate swaps that
created an inherently flawed financial structure that imploded
within just a few years, according to the county''s complaint. </p>
<p>Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
today. </p>
<p>Charles LeCroy and Douglas MacFaddin, also named in the
suit, were the managing directors at New York-based JPMorgan who
oversaw the sewer-debt transactions. LeCroy and MacFaddin are
accused of arranging $8.2 million in illegal payments to local
broker-dealers who were friends of county commissioners, in
exchange for the county''s business. </p>
<p>Larry Langford, former mayor of Birmingham and president of
the county commission at the time of the debt refinancing, is
serving a 15-year sentence in a federal prison in Kentucky for
accepting $241,000 in bribes from William Blount, of Montgomery
investment firm Blount Parrish  Co. Blount was paid $2.8
million by JPMorgan during the bond transactions. </p>
<p>Bankruptcy Brink </p>
<p>Jefferson County, home to Birmingham, has teetered on the
brink of bankruptcy after interest rates on $3.2 billion in
bonds soared in 2008, when companies that insured them lost
their credit ratings because of losses on unrelated mortgage-
backed securities. </p>
<p>In November, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million settlement
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end a probe
into derivative sales to the county. </p>
<p>The bank paid $50 million outright to the county, and
agreed to cancel $647 million in fees the county faced to unwind
the transactions. JPMorgan, which also paid $25 million to be
placed in a fund to compensate affected investors, neither
admitted nor denied wrongdoing. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley said that China''s
central bank changed language relating to yuan policy in its
latest monetary policy report, signaling its intention to let
the yuan appreciate. </p>
<p>Policy makers plan to further improve the managed float
exchange-rate regime and keep the currency broadly stable
based on market demand and supply, and with reference to a
currency basket, the People''s Bank of China said in the
outlook section of a quarterly statement today. The previous
report called for improving policies in a controllable and
gradual manner. </p>
<p>The change is big, it''s huge, said Wang Qing, chief
economist for Greater China in Hong Kong at Morgan Stanley.
They haven''t used this language of saying the currency should
be determined on a currency basket, and determined by market
demand and supply and a managed-float exchange regime. This
language has been missing for many reports. </p>
<p>China halted the currency''s 21 percent, three-year advance
against the dollar in July 2008 to help exporters weather
recessions in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Officially its
exchange-rate regime still involves managing the exchange rate
against a basket of currencies including the euro and the
Japanese yen. </p>
<p>Export Gain </p>
<p>Before the statement, yuan forwards strengthened the most
this year after China reported a pickup in exports, fanning
optimism policy makers will let the currency appreciate.
Exports rose 30.5 percent in April from a year earlier, the
customs bureau said today, exceeding the previous month''s 24.3
percent gain and the 28.9 percent forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of economists. </p>
<p>Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.5 percent
to 6.6778 per dollar as of 5:50 p.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting
bets the currency will strengthen 2.2 percent from the spot
rate of 6.8265, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That''s
the biggest increase since Dec. 22. </p>
<p>The yuan''s 12-month forwards also climbed after European
Union finance ministers announced an aid package worth as much
as 750 billion euros ($962 billion). Interest-rate swaps
increased before inflation data is released tomorrow. </p>
<p>China had a trade surplus of $1.68 billion last month, the
customs bureau said, compared with a deficit of $7.24 billion
in March. Economists forecast a shortfall of $550 million,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>Banks have interpreted shifts in language before only to
be proved wrong. The central bank scrapped the pledge to keep
the yuan basically stable in its quarterly monetary policy
report on Nov. 11. Subsequent reports included the language
again. </p>

the board take action to address alleged misconduct by Goldman
Sachs and certain officers and employees, it said in the filing.
The demands are in connection with the 2007 CDO transaction at
the heart of the SEC case, Goldman said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which makes more money from trading than any
other Wall Street firm, also disclosed that its traders
generated $100 million or more on 35 days during the first
quarter and lost money on no days. The firm set a record when it
made $100 million or more on 46 days in the second quarter. </p>

in group premiums is likely to be driven by this line
of business. </p>
<p>Cesare Geronzi, appointed Generali''s new chairman last
month, wants to boost growth outside Italy. The insurer is
already expanding in emerging markets, including China and the

<p>Analysts including Ralph Hebgen at Keefe, Bruyette  Woods
Ltd. expect non-life business to be affected by claims related
to winter storm Xinthia, which Generali estimated to fall within
a range of 60 million euros to 80 million euros. Life premiums
are expected to rise 19 percent to more than 14 billion euros. </p>
<p>The insurer is due to report earnings on May 12 at about

<p>Copper is looking attractive
after the recent selloff, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Copper fundamentals, which have begun to tighten, will
likely continue to do so as developed markets demand continues
to improve against slowing but still robust emerging markets
demand, the bank said in an e-mailed report. </p>
<p>Copper will be the first of the metals to hit supply
constraints on a sustained basis, the bank''s analysts including
Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report today. </p>
<p>The metal had its worst week in three months last week on
concern that Europe''s debt crisis may derail the global economic
recovery. Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 2.2 percent to $7,100.75 a metric ton
today, after tumbling 6.5 percent last week. </p>
<p>Copper prices more than doubled last year as government
stimulus packages, including China''s $586 billion program, drove
demand. Copper has fallen 4.1 percent this year on concern that
China''s measures to rein in lending and curb property
speculation will curb demand for the metal used in construction
and automobiles. </p>
<p>The fundamentals for zinc are expected to tighten
meaningfully in the next 12 to 24 months, hastened by mine
retirements, the analysts wrote. </p>
<p>These fundamental views suggest that price risk is skewed
to the upside for copper in the near-to-medium term and for zinc
in the medium-to-longer term, especially given the magnitude of
the recent pullback, they wrote. Consumers should view price
dips in these metals as buying opportunities, with recent price
action providing a compelling opportunity for copper in
particular. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
buying a basket of Asian currencies against the yen, saying
there is little obvious contagion risk from Europe''s debt
crisis. </p>
<p>The bank especially recommended the Malaysian ringgit,
Philippine peso and Indonesian rupiah because of strong growth,
solid external balances and declining risk aversion, according
to a research note today written by analysts including Fiona
Lake and Mark Tan. All 10 Asian emerging-market currencies
gained today versus the yen after the European Union unveiled an
unprecedented loan package to stop Greece''s fiscal woes from
spreading. </p>
<p>Given that European policy makers have now announced a
credible package to shore up the system in euroland, we expect
the market to turn its attention to trading the macro data,
the report said. The macro backdrop in Malaysia, Philippines
and Indonesia remains strong. </p>
<p>The ringgit led gains in Asian currencies versus the yen
this year, climbing 7.1 percent, followed by the rupiah with a
3.6 percent advance. The peso has climbed 2.2 percent against
the yen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs targets a basket of currencies including the
ringgit, peso and the rupiah to rise 6 percent against the yen,
without specifying a time frame. It recommended limiting losses
on the trade after a 2 percent decline. </p>
<p>Regional Growth </p>
<p>Indonesia''s economy grew at the fastest pace in more than a
year last quarter, expanding 5.7 percent from a year earlier,
the Central Statistics Office said today. Malaysia''s gross
domestic product probably expanded 9.3 percent in the first
three months from a year earlier, after growing 4.5 percent the
previous quarter, a government report on May 13 may show,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. </p>
<p>The yen fell against all 10 Asian major currencies today as
demand for high-yielding assets surged after the Bank of Japan
said central banks from the U.S., Japan and Europe will
participate in temporary U.S. dollar swap agreements to contain
the debt crisis. European Union finance ministers announced an
aid package worth as much as 750 billion euros ($962 billion),
according to Spanish Economy Minister Elena Salgado. </p>
<p>The yen is a favorite currency for funding carry trades, in
which money borrowed in a nation with low interest rates is
invested in a country offering higher returns. The risk is that
currency moves erase those gains. </p>

<p>Four of the largest U.S. banks,
including Citigroup Inc., racked up perfect quarters in their
trading businesses between January and March, underscoring how
government support and less competition is fueling Wall Street''s
revival. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., the first, second and fifth-biggest U.S. banks
by assets, all said in regulatory filings that they had zero
days of trading losses in the first quarter. Citigroup Inc., the
third-largest, doesn''t break out its daily trading revenue by
quarter. It recorded a profit on each trading day, two people
with knowledge of the results said. </p>
<p>The trading profits of the Street is just another way of
measuring the subsidy the Fed is giving to the banks, said
Christopher Whalen, managing director of Torrance, California-
based Institutional Risk Analytics. It''s a transfer from
savers to banks. </p>
<p>The trading results, which helped the banks report higher
quarterly profit than analysts estimated even as unemployment
stagnated at a 27-year high, came with a big assist from the
Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank helped lenders by holding
short-term borrowing costs near zero, giving them a chance to
profit by carrying even 10-year government notes that yielded an
average of 3.70 percent last quarter. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co., the world''s largest
media company, said fiscal second-quarter profit climbed 55
percent on a rebound at the film studio. The shares fell after
the television units'' profit missed some analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>Programming costs rose at ESPN, which had a mid-single-
digits percentage increase in advertising sales, Burbank,
California-based Disney said today. The ABC broadcast network
was hampered by lower prime-time ratings and higher expenses. </p>
<p>The cable network margins were a little bit light of what
people were expecting, said Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen 
Co. in San Francisco. Disney had talked about how they were
going to have sports programming-rights expenses, but I think
the magnitude of that caught some people by surprise. </p>
<p>Disney fell $1.20, or 3.4 percent, to $34.56 in extended
trading after the results were announced. The shares gained 47
cents to $35.76 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading and have increased 11 percent this year. </p>
<p>Net income rose to $953 million, or 48 cents a share, from
$613 million, or 33 cents, a year earlier, Disney said in a
statement. That beat the 46-cent average of 22 analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in the period ended April
3 gained 6.1 percent to $8.58 billion after the January takeover
of Marvel Entertainment. Analysts expected $8.42 billion. </p>
<p>Bookings Drop </p>
<p>Hotel reservations at the theme parks are pacing down 10
percent in the current quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a conference call after the results. The company
is using fewer discounts to lure visitors to parks near Orlando,
Florida, and in Anaheim, California. </p>
<p>To the extent that they had a beat in the quarter it was
driven by film. I think people would rather have seen it
driven by cable and parks, Creutz, who rates the shares
neutral, said in an interview. </p>
<p>Profit in the cable division led by ESPN totaled $1.18
billion, short of the $1.21 billion estimate of Imran Khan, an
analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. who has a neutral rating on the
stock. Revenue in the division, including the Disney Channel,
gained 9.4 percent to $2.41 billion, led by increases in
affiliate fees, the company said. </p>
<p>Ad Revenue </p>
<p>ESPN''s ad revenue was up by a mid-single-digits
percentage in the quarter, Rasulo said. </p>
<p>Discovery Communications Inc., the owner of Animal Planet,
reported a 9 percent gain in U.S. cable ad revenue last week.
Time Warner Inc., the owner of CNN and TBS, said cable ad sales
gained 9 percent. </p>
<p>Sometimes some of the numbers we see out there are not
apples-to-apples across different companies, Rasulo said. He
said Disney reports ad revenue that includes cash sales and
make-goods. </p>
<p>Profit in Disney''s broadcast division, including ABC, fell
24 percent to $123 million, while revenue gained 1.1 percent to
$1.43 billion. Khan had expected profit of $170.1 million. </p>
<p>In the current quarter, prices for commercials on ABC sold
close to air date are up 30 percent from spots sold last year in
advance of the current TV season, Disney said. Ad sales at ESPN
and the TV stations are pacing up by double digits compared
with a year ago, Rasulo said. </p>
<p>ESPN Ad Sales </p>
<p>Worldwide ticket sales of $960.4 million for the 3-D
Alice in Wonderland revived Disney''s film profit. Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger named Rich Ross, former head of
the Disney Channel, to lead the studio in October and completed
the $4.2 billion purchase of Marvel, maker of Iron Man 2, in
January. </p>
<p>Led by Alice, which was shown in three-dimensional and
standard format, the studio reported a profit of $223 million,
compared with $13 million a year earlier. Revenue increased 7
percent to $1.54 billion from $1.44 billion a year earlier, when
Disney''s films included Race to Witch Mountain and
Confessions of a Shopaholic. </p>
<p>Iron Man 2, distributed by Viacom Inc.''s Paramount, has
collected $323.4 million in global ticket sales as of May 9,
according to Box Office Mojo, a unit of Seattle-based Amazon.com
Inc. Toy Story 3, from Disney''s Pixar studio, will be in
theaters on June 18. </p>
<p>Profit from theme parks fell 12 percent to $150 million,
while revenue gained 1.7 percent to $2.45 billion as higher
guest spending countered a drop in attendance. Pension and
retiree medical costs rose. </p>

<p>Electrical Components International
Inc., a maker of wire harnesses for appliances, won court
approval of its restructuring plan, paving the way for the
company to exit bankruptcy after less than two months. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin J. Carey gave Electrical
Components approval of its pre-packaged reorganization plan,
which swaps debt for new equity, at a hearing today in
Wilmington, Delaware. </p>
<p>The plan will reduce the company''s debt by about half,
according to court documents. Electrical Components expects to
leave bankruptcy protection within a few days, said Stephen A. Youngman, a lawyer for the company. </p>
<p>Under the plan, lenders with the highest level of
repayment, owed a principal amount of about $261.4 million, will
get 54.7 percent of the new common stock and a $145 million term
loan, court papers show. Some of the lenders elected to receive
$10.4 million in cash rather than stock. </p>
<p>Investors, including BlackRock Kelso Capital Corp. and
Sankaty Advisors, will buy the remaining 45.3 percent of the new
stock for about $32.9 million, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Lenders with a secondary priority of repayment, owed a
principal of about $60 million, will share $10 million, court
papers show. Unsecured creditors won''t be affected by the
restructuring. </p>
<p>Francisco Partners </p>
<p>The St. Louis-based company listed assets of about $363.6
million and debt of about $435.7 million in Chapter 11 documents
filed March 30. The company is owned by San Francisco-based
private-equity firm Francisco Partners LP. </p>
<p>Electrical Components makes wire harnesses, bundles of
wires or cables fitted with connectors or plugs that deliver
electricity throughout appliances, according to court documents. </p>
<p>The company said it is the largest supplier of wire
harnesses to the North American white-goods market, a term used
for large appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines.
The company''s products also are used in automobiles and
construction and agriculture equipment, according to its Web
site. </p>
<p>Electrical Components generated about $460 million in sales
for the year ended Dec. 31, court papers show. The company
supplies companies such as General Motors Co., Chrysler Group
LLC, General Electric Co., and the world''s largest appliance
maker, Whirlpool Corp. </p>
<p>The case is In re Electrical Components International Inc.,
10-11054, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington). </p>

<p>Financial markets are likely to
remain volatile as investors weigh the consequences of Europe''s
rescue package, said Gary Cohn, president and chief operating
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>We will continue to have relatively volatile markets
until we get a better understanding, Cohn said today at a
conference in New York hosted by UBS AG. To the extent that
the understanding is that it is a socialization of the risk into
many of the other European economies, we may have continued
negative fallout from that because there is an overall view that
some of those other European economies are not strong enough
themselves to be part of a global bailout. </p>
<p>European policy makers yesterday unveiled a loan package
worth almost $1 trillion and a program of bond purchases in an
effort to stop a sovereign-debt crisis that could jeopardize the
euro. The euro and stocks surged around the world yesterday,
then reversed course earlier today. New York-based Goldman Sachs
generates more revenue from sales and trading than any Wall
Street bank. </p>
<p>I think 24 hours after the realization that there''s a
solution in Europe, people are more reflective right now on what
does that solution mean longer term? Cohn said. Are we
socializing the risk throughout Europe? What does it mean to
other weaker European countries? </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s infrequent
sales and trading losses are evidence that the division doesn''t
depend on proprietary trading to generate revenue, President and
Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn said. </p>
<p>There is often speculation that proprietary trading
revenues drive our outperformance in these businesses, Cohn
said today at a financial services conference hosted by UBS AG
in New York. Over the last 12 months we have only recorded 11
loss days. It is implausible that a proprietary-driven business
model could be right 96 percent of the time. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which makes more money from sales and
trading than any Wall Street firm, reported yesterday that it
made at least $25 million trading every single day of the first
quarter, the first perfect quarter in the company''s history. The
company''s fixed-income, currencies and commodities business,
known as FICC, and equities unit generate those returns by
making markets for clients rather than betting the firm''s own
money, Cohn said. </p>
<p>The simple answer is that our FICC and equities
businesses are largely global market-making businesses where we
intermediate flows and commit capital and liquidity and in the
process generate revenue including bid-offer spreads, Cohn
said. These franchises create numerous opportunities for the
firm. </p>

<p>The higher beta names are down a little bit today after
the euphoria of yesterday, said Mike Dudas, an analyst at
Jefferies  Co. Inc. in New York. Coal equities tend to be
volatile and subject to rapid money flows. The fear trade is in
the commodities. More general nervousness about global growth. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc are considering a sale of natural-gas storage capacity
in Germany as they focus on exploration, according to three
people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The companies may begin the process next month after
deciding what assets to sell from their BEB Erdgas und Erdoel
GmbH unit, said one of the people, who declined to be identified
because the plans are private. The price would depend on what
parts are sold. </p>
<p>Shell and Exxon hold equal stakes in the Hanover, Germany-
based gas-storage operator, which has about 2 billion cubic
meters of working storage spread over three facilities in the
north of the country, according to its Web site. </p>
<p>Energy companies are selling filling stations, pipelines
and refineries as they boost spending on oil and gas production
to take advantage of rising prices. Shell is divesting two
German refineries to curb costs and spending, while Exxon sold a
stake in a Norwegian pipe network in April as it reviews assets. </p>
<p>The BEB storage assets may attract energy suppliers seeking
to stockpile gas to lessen the impact of price fluctuations. Gas
futures in the U.K., Europe''s largest market for the fuel,
slumped 43 percent in 2009 and are up 15 percent this year. </p>
<p>Gas-Price Volatility </p>
<p>The attraction of this kind of asset has risen because of
volatility on the gas market, said Christian Kleindienst, an
analyst at UniCredit SpA''s Munich unit with a market weight
rating on Shell bonds and no coverage of Exxon notes. You
don''t want to be just a middleman -- utilities will be looking
to bolster their margins by securing gas they can use to counter
price fluctuations. </p>
<p>David Williams, a spokesman for Shell, declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News today. Gabriele Radke, a
spokeswoman for ExxonMobil Central Europe Holding GmbH, didn''t
immediately answer an e-mail seeking comment and a call to her
office went unanswered. </p>
<p>Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, sold its 9.43 percent
stake in Norwegian gas-pipeline network Gassled to Njord Gas
Infrastructure AS last month. </p>
<p>Shell said May 6 that it''s in talks with potential buyers
for some of its liquefied petroleum gas assets. The company is
also in discussions with India''s Essar Oil Ltd. and other
interested parties on the sale of three refineries in Germany
and the U.K. </p>
<p>Exxon and Shell sold about 3,100 kilometers (1,925 miles)
of gas pipelines in Germany to Dutch grid operator Nederlandse
Gasunie NV in 2007. </p>
<p>Most of Germany''s gas storage is located in the north of
the country, where rock formations are suited to holding the
fuel. BEB also sells crude oil and sulfur, according to its Web
site. </p>

<p>China, the world''s second-biggest
electricity consumer, increased power output by the most in
three months in April because of rising demand from industrial
users including carmakers and steel factories. </p>
<p>Electricity output climbed 21 percent to 331.6 billion
kilowatt-hours last month, according to data from the Beijing-
based National Bureau of Statistics. Crude-oil output gained 4.2
percent to 16.3 million metric tons. The bureau didn''t provide
coal production data today. </p>
<p>Industrial production rose 18 percent in April from a year
earlier, increasing electricity needs from factories in the
world''s biggest exporter of goods. Baoshan Iron  Steel Co.,
China''s largest publicly traded steelmaker, is running plants at
full capacity as carmakers including General Motors Co. said
they can''t build enough vehicles to meet demand. </p>
<p>Demand from industries will keep getting stronger, Yi Qiao, a power analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said by telephone
from Shanghai. </p>
<p>Property prices rose by a record 12.8 percent in April from
a year earlier, boosting electricity use by builders and makers
of construction materials. </p>
<p>Power output gained last month as the recovery in high-
energy consuming industries accelerated, Sheng Laiyun, spokesman
for the statistics bureau, said today. </p>
<p>China, the world''s third-biggest economy, expanded by 11.9
percent in the first quarter, the fastest pace in almost three
years. The economy will grow four times faster than the U.S.
this year, the United Nations said in December. </p>
<p>Energy-Saving Target </p>
<p>China is facing pressure to meet its energy-saving targets
as the economy expands, Sheng said today. </p>
<p>The country''s energy consumption per unit of gross domestic
product rose 3.2 percent in the first quarter, adding to
pressure to cut power intensity for the rest of the year,
Premier Wen Jiabao said in a statement on May 6. </p>
<p>The first-quarter increase was caused by rapid growth
in industries including power generation, steel, non-ferrous
metals, construction materials, petroleum and chemicals, Wen
said. </p>
<p>China''s electricity use increased 6 percent last year,
according to official data. The country''s biggest electricity
generators include Huaneng Power International Inc. and Datang
International Power Generation Co. </p>

Jeremy Gerard</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>British critics have been set
atwitter that the abundantly laureled stage satire Enron
expired on Broadway Sunday night after barely three weeks,
losing its entire $3.6 million capitalization. </p>
<p>In London, the show has been a runaway hit since opening
last January in the West End after a sold-out run at the Royal
Court. Here in New York, Enron didn''t receive a single major
Tony nomination other than best score -- and it''s not even a
musical! </p>
<p>Since 9/11 the insular Americans have become terribly
sensitive to criticism, Jerry de Groot wrote in the Telegraph.
They don''t mind when Jon Stewart dumps bucketloads of heavy-
handed political satire on the Daily Show,'' but they get tetchy
when the criticism is delivered with an English accent. </p>
<p>Michael Billington, the critic of the U.K.''s Guardian,
suggested Americans were just too stupid to appreciate a satire
requiring a sense of history and a modest understanding of
accounting legerdemain. </p>
<p>If Enron''s'' melancholy saga proves anything,
Billington wrote, it is Broadway''s irrelevance to serious
theatre. </p>
<p>He added this: At heart, Broadway is a big, gaudy
commercial shop-window, where fortunes are won and lost. Stop
the presses! </p>
<p>Comic Strip </p>
<p>Still, the abrupt closing shocked me, too. Enron isn''t
a great play. But a big, gaudy commercial entertainment? It''s
that in spades. </p>
<p>Rupert Goold''s production of Lucy Prebble''s broad-stroke
comic strip was as gimcrack as any American idiot could want. It
had four whimsical LED-eyed Velocirapting humanoids devouring
debt. And hot office sex, starring doughy nerd turned master of
his universe Jeffrey Skilling and his in-house competitor
Claudia Roe, while the flashing stock price raced around them. </p>
<p>Not since Faye Dunaway moaned ratings numbers during a sex
scene in Network have lust and power been so entertainingly
entangled. </p>
<p>I called the show''s lead producer, Jeffrey Richards, whom
I''ve known since his first Broadway flop, Rex, in 1976. For
someone lighter by almost $4 million, he was pretty chipper. </p>
<p>Race'' Survived </p>
<p>Look, I believe the straight play can be viable on
Broadway, Richards, 61, said. He''s had a number of hits
recently, including David Mamet''s Race, which, unlike
Enron, survived mostly tepid reviews this season, recovering
its investment. </p>
<p>When I asked what went wrong with Enron, Richards
blamed Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>We opened with a sizable advance, but we ate into it
during previews, he said. Then the Goldman Sachs hearings
began. Suddenly we were competing with reality. </p>
<p>This is something of a stretch, though fatigue with
business malfeasance may indeed be one reason the show didn''t
catch on. </p>
<p>Richards also said that the play lacked a wow factor.
People weren''t leaving the Broadhurst Theatre bristling with the
need to tell anyone who would listen, You must see this
show. </p>
<p>I have a different theory, one more typically applied to
musicals: Don''t confuse your audience. Tell them what to expect
and then give it to them. They''ll leave happy. </p>
<p>This is famously what happened when Stephen Sondheim added
Comedy Tonight to the beginning of A Funny Thing Happened
on the Way to the Forum. It let even the dumbest folks in on
the joke, telling them that they were supposed to laugh. </p>
<p>Addams Family'' </p>
<p>It''s also what happened more recently, when composer-
lyricist Andrew Lippa rewrote the opening of The Addams
Family, turning a show critics hated into one that audiences
can''t get enough of (and the critics still hated). </p>
<p>Who do you think is gonna win in the end, the greedy or
the inept? Norbert Leo Butz''s Skilling asked, after a
delicious screed about the inevitable showdown between
capitalists and bureaucrats. We''re not perfect, but wait til
you see the other guys. </p>
<p>That prompted a collective gasp -- and nervous titters --
the night I saw the show. No one needed to tell these
theatergoers about the parallels between Enron 2001 and Goldman
Sachs 2010. Such bitter pith merely studded the cartoony script. </p>
<p>Fatal Mistake </p>
<p>Richards and his marketing team made a fatal mistake in
selling Enron as the story of Enron. I''d have put Skilling
in Devil''s p.j.s, with the Enron E as his pitchfork. Bring
in a carny barker hawking its Side Show wares. See the Scaly
Raptors! The Two-Faced Man! The Disappearing Cash! </p>
<p>Then, perhaps, the New York Times''s Ben Brantley might have
approached the show in a lighter mood, instead of treating it
like a kvetch, an annoying pain he had to endure. He called it
a flashy but labored economics lesson... Well, maybe for
him. But anyway, that rang the death knell. </p>
<p>Ever the diplomat, Richards was having none of it. </p>
<p>It is not fair to blame the New York Times for the
failure of the show. There are plays that make it without the
Times. </p>
<p>Not this one. Enron promised a memory we''d rather
forget, instead of a thrill ride most of us could really use
just now. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. expects customers to
adopt the new version of Office at the fastest pace in the
software''s 20-year history, helping reverse a sales slump and
fend off competition from Google Inc.''s Web-based programs. </p>
<p>The software has been tested by 8.6 million users,
Microsoft said, more than three times as many as any previous
version, signaling that adoption will be quick. Users also are
likely to upgrade to the new package of business software at the
same time they install Windows 7, released last year, said Chris Capossela, a senior vice president in the Office group. </p>
<p>This version will be the best ever in terms of adoption
speed, both because of the interest we are seeing and the
Windows 7 adoption curve, Capossela said in an interview last
week. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, the world''s largest
software maker, held an event in New York today to mark the
official release of Office 2010 to businesses. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s $19 billion business division, which gets most
of its revenue from Office, could use the boost. Its sales will
drop 3 percent in the fiscal year ending in June, UBS AG analyst
Brent Thill estimated. While the new software will spur orders
in the coming year, the comeback will hinge on whether
businesses recommit to technology spending -- something they''ve
been slow to do in the wake of the recession. </p>
<p>Precarious Recovery'' </p>
<p>It''s still a precarious recovery, said Sarah Friar, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in San Francisco, who
recommends buying Microsoft shares. We''re in the camp of
expecting a more moderate migration. It''s kind of, steady as
she goes.'' It''s not a raging rush to upgrade. </p>
<p>Microsoft said last month that a recovery in corporate
spending on personal computers and software was just beginning.
Multiyear contracts, which account for 60 percent of the Office
unit''s sales, are still taking longer to close because
businesses are keeping a lid on expenses. </p>
<p>Home-computer shoppers have fueled the PC industry''s
rebound so far, snapping up laptops and netbooks. </p>
<p>I wish I could predict what business PC adoption is going
to be, Microsoft''s Capossela said. It''s wonderful to see
consumers buying PCs in such numbers. That sets us up for a
great consumer uptake. The business uptake will also be
excellent, but businesses are certainly slower to start spending
money again. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 56 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $29.44 at 4
p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have
declined 3.4 percent this year. </p>
<p>Aging Software </p>
<p>More than half of Office customers now use a version of the
program that''s at least seven years old, giving Microsoft an
opportunity to get them to upgrade, Thill said. For the year
starting July 1, the new Office will spur an increase of 12
percent in sales for the business division, he predicts. </p>
<p>General Electric Co. plans to switch about half of its
desktop computers, or about 175,000 machines, to Office 2010
this year, Capossela said today. Royal KPN NV and its subsidiary
Getronics NV already have put the program on some machines and
will roll it out to more than 45,000 this year. </p>
<p>For the first time, Office will include Web-based versions
of popular programs like Word and Excel. The company already has
40 million users of Internet-delivered versions of its Exchange
e-mail server and SharePoint server programs, which let
customers'' employees create internal company websites and
collaborate on projects. </p>
<p>Editing Functions </p>
<p>Office 2010 also adds the ability to edit photos and videos
in PowerPoint presentations, and co-authoring features let
different people work on one file at the same time. Users can
select an option to save documents on the Internet, so they can
be retrieved when employees are away from the office. </p>
<p>Customers also can broadcast PowerPoint slide shows over
the Internet to any user with a Web browser. The Outlook Social
Connector turns the e-mail program into a central repository for
data from sites like Facebook, MySpace and LinkedIn. </p>
<p>Adding Internet features gives Microsoft fresh ammunition
against Google, which has targeted Office customers with its
Internet-based Google Apps. </p>
<p>Businesses that already have Office 2007 should just update
it with Google Apps to add Internet and collaboration features,
Google says. Many workers don''t need a new version of Office, or
any version at all, said Chris Vander Mey, a product manager at
Mountain View, California-based Google. </p>
<p>Office is a really good product and every company should
have two or three copies, he said. But there''s a significant
number of employees that don''t need it. </p>
<p>Google Apps </p>
<p>Google says 3,000 businesses sign up each day for its apps.
The company lands a large corporate customer every few weeks,
mostly for the Gmail e-mail service, said Andrew Kovacs, a
Google spokesman. Recent new customers include packaging company
MeadWestvaco Corp. and Air France-KLM Group''s KLM unit, which
will have its 11,200 crew members use Gmail. </p>
<p>Capossela said Office programs like Outlook and Word are
used by the bulk of workers at Microsoft''s corporate customers.
Most employees don''t want to switch to Google, he said.
Uploading a file to Google Apps often doesn''t preserve details
and formatting, Capossela said. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s push into Web-based programs is motivated more
by customer demand than competition with Google, said Friar at
Goldman Sachs. Growth in software delivered as an Internet
service is going to outpace standard programs by 5-to-1, she
said. </p>
<p>It''s a must for them to have done it -- the world is
moving to software as service, she said. It''s the biggest
shift in the software market. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, seeking to boost earnings
by focusing on software and services, said he plans to spend $20
billion on acquisitions in the next five years. </p>
<p>Operating earnings will jump to at least $20 a share by
2015 from $11.35 or more this year, helped by cost savings and
software demand, Palmisano said in a meeting with investors in
New York today. The company also predicted sales growth that
beat analysts'' estimates, sending the stock higher. </p>
<p>Palmisano is signaling his pace of acquisitions may be
accelerating. He spent more than $20 billion on 100 purchases in
the eight years since taking over in 2002, partly to focus on
the higher-margin businesses of services and software. He has
also bought back shares and cut jobs to make up for slowing
corporate spending amid the recession. </p>
<p>IBM will keep investing in markets that help customers be
more efficient, such as software that helps analyze or predict
trends and cloud computing, which lets them store and access
information on shared servers, Palmisano said. The company is
also developing services to monitor highways, electrical grids
and other infrastructure so they can be run more efficiently. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Europe''s
third-biggest insurer, said first-quarter profit surged on lower
writedowns and higher life premiums. </p>
<p>Net income increased to 527 million euros ($668 million)
from 104 million euros a year earlier, when the results were
affected by 1.5 billion euros of writedowns related to equity
holdings, Generali said in a statement today. That beat the
477 million-euro median estimate of 12 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The group expects a full-year operating profit of about
4 billion euros, Chief Executive officer Raffaele Agrusti said
on a conference call. The insurer also forecast stable non-
life premiums for the year and an improvement in margins at
the life business. </p>
<p>Cesare Geronzi, named Generali''s new chairman last month,
wants to boost growth outside Italy. The insurer is already
expanding in emerging markets, including China and the Middle
East, and in eastern Europe as it seeks to recover from the
global financial crisis. </p>
<p>Although the macroeconomic climate remained difficult,
Generali was able to close the first quarter with strong
growth, Geronzi said. The group can continue to set
ambitious targets. </p>
<p>Storm Claims </p>
<p>The non-life business, which was affected by rising claims
including many related to Europe''s winter storm Xinthia,
recorded gross premiums in the period of 6.6 billion euros. The
combined ratio increased to 98 percent in the three months to
the end of March, showing that the company''s insurance
underwriting is less profitable. Life premiums rose 19 percent
to 14.2 billion euros. </p>
<p>Generali had better results overall because of new
life business and improved operating results at the life unit,
Atanasio Pantarrotas, an analyst at Cheuvreux, wrote in a note
to clients today. </p>
<p>Generali''s net exposure to Greek government bonds is
810 million euros, Agrusti said, adding that the insurer has
800 million euros and 670 million euros of exposure to
Spanish and Portuguese government debt, respectively. </p>
<p>Generali rose 0.4 percent to 15.74 euros at 5 p.m. in
Milan, giving the company a market value of 24.6 billion euros.
The Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index has dropped 1 percent
in the past six months, compared with Generali''s 13 percent
decline. </p>

<p>As International Business Machines
Corp. meets with investors in New York today, some shareholders
want the world''s largest computer-services provider to go beyond
profit goals and pledge itself to more specific sales growth. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano used the shareholder
briefing three years ago to establish a target of $10 in
earnings per share by 2010, a goal he has already reached. Some
investors expect him to set a similar benchmark this year, and
they want him to lay out specific plans for boosting sales at
more than the current low-single digit rate. </p>
<p>I want to see revenue growth, said Peter Sorrentino, a
Cincinnati-based portfolio manager at Huntington Asset
Management, who helps manage $13.3 billion, including more than
$100 million of IBM shares. Sam Palmisano has come through the
storm, but where do we go from here? What''s next, Mr. Wizard? </p>
<p>Though investors give IBM credit for reaching the $10-a-
share profit mark a year early, many have sold shares, saying
profit growth may suffer without higher revenue gains. IBM''s
sales have been little changed in the past five years, while
sales at rival Hewlett-Packard Co. have risen more than 7
percent annually on average, in part because of acquisitions.
IBM''s earnings per share have been bolstered by stock buybacks
and jobs cuts, which some investors say may not be sustainable. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s biggest
software maker, lost its challenge to a patent that led to a
change in its Word program and to damages of more than $290
million. </p>
<p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office affirmed a patent
owned by i4i LP of Toronto after a review requested by
Microsoft, closely held i4i said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Put simply: i4i''s patent is clearly and unequivocally
valid, i4i Chairman Loudon Owen said in the statement. Even
though Microsoft attacked i4i''s patent claims with its full
arsenal, the Patent Office agreed with i4i and confirmed the
validity of the patent. </p>
<p>I4i''s invention is related to customizing extensible markup
language, or XML, a way of encoding data to exchange information
among programs. </p>
<p>We are disappointed, but there still remain important
matters of patent law at stake, and we are considering our
options to get them addressed, including a petition to the
Supreme Court, Kevin Kutz, a spokesman for Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Microsoft lost a jury trial over the patent last year and
was ordered to alter its Word program or halt sales. A U.S.
appeals court upheld both the verdict and the court order. </p>
<p>XML is a common way of encoding data, and nothing in the
order prevented Microsoft from continuing to offer that feature
in Word, or for allowing customized XML when it''s used in plain
text. The disputed feature is one used by large companies to add
special data to Word files. </p>
<p>The case is i4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 2009-1504, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower-court case is i4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 07-cv-113, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). </p>
<p>Court Tells Patent Holder to Stop Suing PG, Kimberly-Clark </p>
<p>A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that
bars a Maryland patent owner from filing any new patent-
infringement cases against Procter  Gamble Co. and Kimberly-
Clark Corp. </p>
<p>The Washington-based court, which hears appeals of patent
cases, told Allegra D. Hemphill that a trial court properly
rejected her infringement claims against the two consumer-
products companies as baseless accusations. </p>
<p>Hemphill is the named inventor on patent 4,557,720, for a
disposable vaginal applicator. She claimed that personal hygiene
products such as Cincinnati-based PG''s Always, and Dallas-based
Kimberly-Clark''s Kotex and Poise infringed her patent, issued in
December 1985, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Trial courts determined that the sanitary-napkin products
made by the consumer companies didn''t constitute vaginal
swabs as the term is used in the patent. </p>
<p>Hemphill has made hundreds of pages of largely repetitive
filings that failed to support her case, and engaged in a
vexatious pattern of filing multiple duplicative lawsuits,
forum-shopping among various district and appellate courts the
appeals court said. The court said it is apparent that her
claims are without merit and baseless. </p>
<p>The patent owner represented herself in the appeal. </p>
<p>The case is Hemphill v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 10-01047,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). </p>
<p>SABMiller Patents Easy-to-Open Beer Can That Doubles as Cup </p>
<p>SABMiller Plc said it patented an easy-to-open beer can
that doubles as a cup after the entire top has been removed. </p>
<p>The can is a first in the global beer industry and will be
used at the World Cup soccer tournament that starts in South
Africa next month, Norman Adami, managing director of the
Johannesburg-based unit, told reporters in the city yesterday. </p>
<p>The brewer, which said it has invested 170 million rand
($22.6 million) in support of the World Cup, said in a statement
yesterday that it expects to sell the equivalent of 30 million
more bottles of beer during the tournament than it normally
sells in June and July in South Arica. </p>
<p>Pesticide Management Bill Faces Opposition Over Data Monopoly </p>
<p>India''s Bjaratiya Janta Party opposes a bill for pesticide
management currently under consideration, the Economic Times
reported. </p>
<p>The party''s objection is to a section on pesticide-testing
data exclusivity, which it claims is the result of pressure
from U.S. chemical companies, the newspaper reported. </p>
<p>The bill gives researchers a 20-year monopoly over their
data, which the party claims would make it difficult for generic
versions of the product to be created, according to the Economic
Times. </p>
<p>Permitting data monopoly to go ahead may lead to higher
pesticide prices, a party leader told the Economic Times. </p>
<p>Prisoner-Restraint Patent Issued to Utah Inventors </p>
<p>Two Utah inventors received a U.S. patent yesterday for a
method of securing a prisoner to a motor vehicle. </p>
<p>Patent 7,723,300 covers a device that can be hooked to the
prisoner''s handcuffs that will keep the prisoner''s hands behind
his back and prevent his escape from a police vehicle. </p>
<p>According to the patent, the device can be triggered
remotely, and can be used even if the prisoner is placed in a
vehicle''s front seat. While the prisoner is tethered to the car
seat, the police officer can then go about his other necessary
duties which may include: dealing with other suspects, searching
or inventorying a vehicle, talking with victims and witnesses. </p>
<p>The device can be used in conjunction with an automobile
seatbelt, and, in the event of a collision, can be released by
means of a remote-control switch, or cut with a knife or
scissors. </p>
<p>The application for the patent was filed in March 2006 with
assistance from the Bateman IP Law Group of Salt Lake City. The
patent was issued to Keith D. Squires of Morgan, Utah, and Omar
L. Issa of Venice, Utah. </p>

<p>The lawsuit related to an Indian movie, Singh is Kinng,
which American Rights Management Co. of New York claims is
derived from Runyon''s Madame La Gimp. The 2008 Bollywood
film was directed by Anees Bazmee and starred Akshay Kumar and
Katrina Kaif. </p>
<p>Viacom was sued as the film''s distributor. Vipul Amrutlal
Shah, producer of Singh is Kinng told Agence France-Presse
that he was truly baffled at the infringement allegations,
and the fact that the rights holder waited two years to file a
complaint. </p>
<p>The Runyon story, originally published in 1929 in Hearst
Corp.''s Cosmopolitan magazine, is generally recognizable by
the public through several derivative films, Frank Capra''s
Lady for a Day and Pocketful of Miracles, and Jackie
Chan''s Miracles, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>American Rights claims that the Bollywood film also
infringes the copyright for the two Capra films. </p>
<p>The short story''s copyright holder claims the Bollywood
film is similar in essence, structure, pattern and sequence,
pace, setting, characterization and mood. The defendants
purposefully employed immaterial variations or transparent re-
phrasing to produce essentially an update of the Runyon story,
according to the complaint. </p>
<p>American Rights asked the court to order the defendants to
quit infringing the copyright, including barring future
distribution of the film. Additionally, the rights holder
requested an award of money damages, litigation costs and
attorney fees, and extra cash compensation to punish the
defendants'' for their actions. </p>
<p>The rights holder is represented by Steven M. Hayes, of New
York''s Hanly Conroy Bierstein Sheridan Fisher LLP, and Clay M.
Townsend and Keith R. Mitnik, of Orlando, Florida''s Morgan 
Morgan PA. </p>
<p>The case is American Rights Management v. Viacom 18 US,
1:10-cv-03690-VM, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan)). </p>

<p>EA to Take Make Spore'' Darker, Trademark Application Hints </p>
<p>Electronic Arts Inc., whose Spore was the most pirated
game in 2008, is taking the game to the dark side, if recent
trademark applications are any indication. </p>
<p>The Redwood City, California-based games company filed four
applications to register Darkspore with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office on May 3. </p>
<p>Electronic Arts seeks to register the mark for a wide range
of goods and products including film production, online computer

shirts, and computer and video-game software. </p>
<p>Newspaper Reveals Hidden Ownership of Bafana Bafana Brand </p>
<p>A month before South Africa hosts the World Cup soccer
games, the country''s Times newspaper reported that Wayne Smidt,
a Johannesburg businessman, owns 49.9 percent of Slam, a company
that controls the trademark rights to Bafana Bafana, the
country''s national team. </p>
<p>The South African Football Association owns the other 50.1
percent of the company, according to the Times. </p>
<p>Smidt told the Times he objected to the newspaper''s
drawing sinister motives from his refusal to divulge more
information about the ownership or how much money he expected to
make during the World Cup games. </p>
<p>Vivian Casaletti, Slam''s chief executive, said she expected
at least 1.6 million Bafana Bafana items to be sold, and that
the team licensing program  -- under which Slam makes 15 percent
on each item sold -- is the most successful licensing program
in Africa, according to the Times. </p>

<p>Makeup of Chemical Dispersant Used in Gulf a Trade Secret </p>
<p>Scientists and Louisiana fishermen say they are worried
about damage chemical dispersants may cause the region''s

used, the U.K.''s Telegraph reported. </p>
<p>More than 325,000 gallons of dispersants have been used on
waters in the Gulf of Mexico in efforts to halt the spread of
the oil that has been spewing from beneath the sea since the
April 20 explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon rig leased
by BP Plc, according to the Telegraph. </p>
<p>The product used to break up the oil is Corexit, produced
by Nalco Holding Co.''s Nalco Energy Services, the newspaper

<p>Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman denied allegations the U.S. bank misled
investors about mortgage derivatives it sold them. </p>
<p>The firm is being probed by U.S. prosecutors over whether
the bank misled clients when it sold them collateralized debt
obligations as its own traders bet that the value of the
securities would drop, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
The New York-based firm hasn''t been contacted by the Justice
Department, Gorman told reporters in Tokyo today. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms are facing unprecedented scrutiny from
lawmakers and prosecutors over whether they missold CDOs linked
to the subprime mortgages that caused the credit crisis. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. is fighting a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, which alleges the firm misled investors
about a mortgage-linked security in 2007. </p>
<p>We should expect to see a whole slew of cases appear
through the rest of the year, said Ralph Silva, an analyst at
London-based Silva Research Network, which specializes in
financial services firms. Because they are near-impossible to
prove, I suspect most are going to be settled on the threat of a
perp walk. </p>
<p>The bank fell to $27.72 at 12:15 p.m. in German trading
from its $28.38 close in New York yesterday. The shares have
dropped 4 percent this year, compared with the Standard  Poor''s
500 Financials Index''s 10 percent gain in the period. </p>
<p>No Substance'' </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley arranged and sold CDOs backed by home loans,
even as its trading desk would sometimes bet that their value
would fall, the Journal said, citing traders. The investigation
is reviewing whether Morgan Stanley clearly represented its
roles, according to the report. </p>
<p>We have no reason to believe there is any substance behind
any supposed investigation that appeared in the Wall Street
Journal article, Gorman said at the press conference, convened
to discuss the firm''s Japanese securities and investment banking
ventures with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney''s office and the
SEC declined to comment, the Journal said. </p>
<p>Government officials in the U.S. are seeking to assuage
public anger over bank bailouts by tightening regulations after
the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The
changes are intended to prevent a repeat of the crisis that led
to $1.78 trillion in writedowns and losses by financial firms. </p>
<p>The probe stemmed from an ongoing civil-fraud investigation
of more than a dozen Wall Street firms'' mortgage bond businesses
by the SEC that began in 2009, the newspaper said. The Manhattan
U.S. Attorney''s office is conducting a criminal probe into some
of those firms'' activities, it said. </p>
<p>Buchanan, Jackson </p>
<p>The government frequently begins criminal investigations
without filing charges, the Journal said. In bringing criminal
charges, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that the firm or its employees misled investors, it said. </p>
<p>Two of the transactions being probed were named after U.S.
Presidents James Buchanan and Andrew Jackson, and were called
the Dead Presidents deals by traders, the newspaper said,
citing a person familiar with the matter. Morgan Stanley
arranged and bet against the deals, and didn''t market them to
clients, it said. </p>
<p>The firm made money on the two transactions, though it lost
$9 billion on mortgage-related investments in 2007, the

<p>Procter  Gamble Co., the world''s

five-year bonds to 75 billion yen ($809 million) from an initial
50 billion yen, according to two people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent told
investors it may price the notes to yield between 28 basis
points and 30 basis points more than the yen swap rate, said the

<p>Good credit companies like PG can attract investors
even amid market jitters over Europe''s sovereign debt crisis,
Nobuto Yamazaki, an executive fund manager at DIAM Asset

<p>Bond issuance worldwide has tumbled amid investor
skepticism that a $1 trillion rescue package announced by the
European Union will be enough to bolster the region''s most-
indebted governments. Companies have sold $15 billion of debt
this month, a 62 percent decline from the same period in April,

<p>PG, based in Cincinnati, is rated Aa3 by Moody''s Investors

<p>Mitsubishi UFJ Securities, Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings

<p>Morgan Stanley is being probed by U.S.
federal prosecutors over allegations it misled investors about
mortgage derivatives, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
people familiar with the matter that it didn''t identify. </p>
<p>Investments known as collateralized debt obligations, or
CDOs, backed by home loans, were arranged and sold by Morgan
Stanley even as its trading desk would sometimes bet that their
value would fall, the newspaper said, citing traders. The
investigation is reviewing whether Morgan Stanley clearly
represented its roles, the WSJ said. </p>
<p>The probe, which is at a preliminary stage, marks deepening
scrutiny of Wall Street firms by U.S. regulators following the
global financial crisis, the Journal said. Rival Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. is contesting a fraud lawsuit from the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleges the firm
misled investors about a mortgage-linked security in 2007. </p>
<p>We have not been contacted by the Justice Department

<p>Bonds sold by U.S. financial firms
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. offer value after a fraud
lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission caused spreads
to widen, according to BT Investment Management Ltd. </p>
<p>BTIM, a manager of about A$13.5 billion ($12.1 billion) of
cash and fixed-income assets, has been buying bonds of U.S.
institutions such as Goldman Sachs that mature in about a year,
and is considering buying more, head of income strategies Scott Osborne and senior portfolio manager Jean-Luc Petit said in an
interview in Sydney. </p>
<p>Short-dated U.S. financial notes offer more bang for your
buck than their global peers, said Osborne. While the
spreads have widened on the recent SEC probe issues, the U.S.
economic recovery will underpin the strength of the financial
system in the medium term. </p>
<p>U.S. financial debt has lost almost 1 percent since the SEC
filed its suit against the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history on April 16, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index shows,
after handing investors profits in 11 of the 12 months ending
March. The lawsuit sparked concern the government will crack
down on Wall Street and hurt profits, even as the U.S. economy
recovers from the worst global recession since World War II. </p>

<p>Procter  Gamble Co., the world''s
largest consumer products company, raised 100 billion yen ($1.1
billion) from its first sale of bonds denominated in the
Japanese currency for a decade. </p>
<p>The maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent priced 0.95
percent, five-year notes to yield 28 basis points more than the
yen swap rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It told
investors earlier this week that it planned to sell 50 billion
yen of notes at a spread of as much as 35 basis points,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>While the spread has narrowed, it still looks attractive
for Japanese investors, said Katsuyuki Tokushima, chief fixed-
income analyst at NLI Research Institute, a unit of Nippon
Mutual Life Insurance Co. </p>
<p>Japanese corporate bond sales slumped 17 percent to 2.9
trillion yen this year compared with the same period of 2009
amid concern about contagion from Europe''s sovereign debt crisis,
Bloomberg data show. The extra yield investors demand to own yen
notes sold by overseas borrowers in Japan, or Samurai bonds,
fell to 147 basis points yesterday from 152 basis points May 7
before European governments announced a $1 trillion stability
plan, according to an index compiled by Nomura Securities Co. </p>
<p>Investment Grade </p>
<p>PG, based in Cincinnati, is rated Aa3 by Moody''s Investors
Service, the risk assessor''s fourth-highest investment grade. It
last sold yen-denominated debt in May 2000, when it raised 50
billion yen from 10-year, 2 percent bonds maturing next month,

<p>Five-year, 0.71 percent notes sold by Mizuho Corporate Bank
in April were quoted yesterday at 3 basis points less than the
yen swap rate, according to Japan Securities Dealers Association
prices on Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The unit of Mizuho Financial Group Inc. is also rated Aa3
by Moody''s. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. fell in
New York trading after the U.S. Senate included limits on debit-
card fees in the financial-overhaul bill and analysts said the
House is likely to approve the amendment. </p>
<p>The measure would empower the Federal Reserve to curb
debit-card interchange, or swipe fees, charged to merchants.
Visa, the world''s biggest payments network, dropped $8.47, or
9.9 percent, to $77.26 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, and has fallen 20 percent from a closing high
of $96.59 on April 23. MasterCard fell $19.86, or 8.6 percent,
to $212.45, also sliding 20 percent in three weeks. </p>
<p>Shares of networks and banks came under pressure last week
as Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin pushed the fee curbs. The
limits may crimp revenue at Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo 
Co. and JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. debit-card
issuers. The measure cleared the Senate because of the
industry''s terrible attitude toward merchants, Durbin said. </p>
<p>They do things that are just totally indefensible,
Durbin said today in a telephone interview. They really have
done everything they can to suppress any competition between the
two giants. </p>
<p>The Senate voted 64-33 to approve Durbin''s amendment, which
passed with the support of 17 Republicans. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will buy
Nexen Inc.''s North American natural-gas trading business for an
undisclosed price, reducing volatility in Nexen''s earnings. </p>
<p>Nexen Vice President Pierre Alvarez confirmed the sale in
an e-mail today. The trading assets will be sold to J. Aron 
Co., the commodity-trading division of Goldman Sachs, Alvarez
said. Michael Duvally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, confirmed the sale and refused further comment. </p>
<p>The sale is expected to be cash-neutral, Nexen said in an
April 30 filing, and the Calgary-based company said it would
likely report a $250 million to $290 million non-cash loss
associated with the sale. The company said in the filing its
marketing business has generated about $800 million in cash
during the last 10 years. </p>
<p>They probably had contracts that were loss positions that
these guys had to take, so as a result it was cash-neutral,
said Kristopher Zack, an analyst with Raymond James Ltd. in
Calgary. </p>
<p>While the sale won''t boost Nexen''s cash flow, it will
likely remove volatility from the oil exploration and production
company''s results, Zack said. </p>
<p>Nexen sold its European gas and power-marketing business
earlier this year. The company was formed by Occidental
Petroleum Corp. when it combined its Canadian units in the early
1970s. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
securities firm that makes about 10 percent of its revenue from
trades on its own behalf, is ceasing proprietary trading in one
type of structured debt, according to a person close to the
firm. </p>
<p>A group of traders who were focused on making bets on
collateralized loan obligations with the New York-based firm''s
own money are now handling trades for clients, the person said,
speaking anonymously because the plans aren''t public. CLOs are
bonds backed by pools of corporate loans. Andrea Rachman, a
spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm, merged
the proprietary trading desk with the team that handles
transactions for clients as it wound down the positions in the
proprietary trading book, the person said. Both groups were run
by Gerald Ouderkirk, who was promoted to managing director in
October 2006. </p>
<p>Asset-Backed Alert, an industry newsletter, reported on the
changes in Goldman Sachs''s CLO trading division in its May 14
issue. </p>
<p>CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation, debt
instruments that repackage loans into securities of varying risk
that pay investors different yields. The market boomed in the
first half of the last decade, helping fuel a spree of leveraged
buyouts by providing demand for loans that helped reduce the
cost of funding. The market dried up in 2007 and 2008 as the
mortgage market crisis caused investors to flee from structured
credit into simpler and safer securities. </p>
<p>The fair value of Goldman Sachs''s retained interests in
CDOs and CLOS dropped to $367 million at the end of November
2008 from $1.97 billion two years earlier, according to company
filings. </p>

<p>Twenty-one-year-olds never listen.
Just ask Jamie Dimon. </p>
<p>Individual to individual, all interaction has been pretty
amicable, said Mariel Fiedler, the Syracuse University senior
who fielded a call from Dimon after helping lead protests
against his selection as commencement speaker. Otherwise, it''s
just difference in opinion. </p>
<p>More than 1,200 Syracuse students, alumni and supporters
have signed an online petition urging the university to rescind
the invitation to Dimon, JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s chief executive
officer. The group said it opposed allowing JPMorgan to use the
occasion to restore the public image of the banking industry
and validate the anti-environmental and anti-humanitarian
interests of JPMorgan Chase. </p>
<p>Dimon, 54, told reporters on April 14 that he planned to
deliver the address as planned and that the students should
stand up for what they believe in. He called Fiedler that

<p>We had a really in-depth conversation, Fiedler,
a broadcast journalism and English major from Long Island, said
in an interview yesterday. He basically just asked me 
what it was that we were so opposed to with having him speak
here. I laid out the different reasoning that people had. </p>

<p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission launched an

the latest iteration of PG''s $9-billion-a-year brand, causes
rashes and chemical burns. The company denied the claims. </p>
<p>Parent bloggers can damage companies that anger them, said
Jackie Huba, principal of Ant''s Eye View, an Austin, Texas,

<p>General Motors Co. said slowing
growth in China won''t prompt the company, the largest overseas
automaker in the nation, to revise its 2010 sales forecast. </p>
<p>GM sales in China will exceed 2 million vehicles this year,
said Kevin Wale, president of the company''s China operations, in
Ningbo, China, reiterating an earlier projection. Carmakers will
sell a combined 15.5 million vehicles in China in 2010, he said. </p>
<p>China''s monthly car-sales growth slowed in April to the
lowest level since March 2009 amid rising consumer and property
prices. Sales of cars, sport-utility vehicles and multipurpose
vehicles increased 33 percent to 1.11 million from a year
earlier, compared with a 63 percent jump in March, the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers said on May 10. </p>
<p>Slowing growth is a natural part of the industry cycle,
Wale said today at a conference in Ningbo, a city in the eastern
part of China. People need to manage it so they don''t end with
excess inventory. The market is still very strong. Underlying
demand is very strong. </p>
<p>China, which overtook the U.S. as the world''s biggest auto
market last year, has become GM''s largest market. The carmaker
aims to sell 3 million vehicles a year in China by 2015. It
plans to introduce 25 new or updated models in the country by
the end of 2011. </p>
<p>In April, Detroit-based GM sold 213,115 vehicles in China.
The company and its ventures sold 1.83 million vehicles in the
country last year. </p>
<p>The Chinese car market is stabilizing, it''s not
continuing to grow at the rapid rate of last year, Wale said.
It''s going to be a good year for the industry, and a good year
for General Motors in China. </p>

<p>An international study that is the
largest yet to focus on mobile-phone use and certain types of
brain cancer didn''t find a conclusive link, researchers said. </p>
<p>The study of more than 10,000 people found that most use
didn''t raise the risk of developing two types of tumors,
according to results in the International Journal of
Epidemiology. There was a suggestion that the heaviest
mobile phones use may be tied to gliomas, a form of brain
malignancy, the authors said. That data, though, was flawed, the
authors concluded, saying that more study would be needed to
establish a definitive link. </p>
<p>The report by the World Health Organization''s International
Agency for Research on Cancer is the latest in a series of
conflicting studies exploring whether a connection exists
between mobile phones and cancer. Most have failed to identify a
link. The debate has turned on the fact that the phones emit
radio waves and, at higher levels than that released by phones,
the emissions heat body tissue and spur tumors, according to the
National Cancer Institute''s website. </p>
<p>An increased risk of brain cancer is not established,
said Christopher Wild, director of the International Agency for
Research on Cancer, in a statement. More studies are needed to
definitely rule out a link in the heaviest mobile-phone users to
malignancy, the researchers said. </p>
<p>Brain Tumors </p>
<p>The study participants included 5,117 patients who had
either a meningioma, a slow-growing brain tumor, or glioma, a
deadly type of brain tumor. They were matched with comparison
subjects who didn''t have brain cancer, and all were questioned
on their mobile phone use. </p>
<p>Researchers found suggestions of a 40 percent higher
risk of glioma in those who were in the top 10 percent for the
longest cumulative call time, the study authors said. That risk
was greatest in people with brain cancer who reported that they
often held their phones on the same side of their head as their
gliomas developed, the authors said. </p>
<p>The higher cancer risk seen in heaviest users may not be a
reliable finding because it was based on the amount of time
people remembered talking on their phones, according to the
study. Brain tumors can confuse thinking and affect memory,
which could influence the results. Researchers said a higher
proportion of people with gliomas were judged by their
interviewers to have poor memory. </p>
<p>Too Early'' </p>
<p>It''s still too early to say if there is a higher risk
because cancer, particularly brain cancer, can take years to
develop, often longer than the 10 years of phone use in some
participants of the WHO study, said Henry Lai, a bioengineering
researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle, in a
telephone interview. Lai, who has studied mobile phone safety,
wasn''t involved in the WHO research. </p>
<p>It''s not beyond the realm of possibility that there''s a
link between mobile phone use and cancer, said Peter Inskip,
senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute in
Bethesda, Maryland. </p>
<p>More study is needed to look at a possible link between
brain cancer and growing use of mobile phones by children,
Inskip said. What we might have considered heavy use 10 years
ago might not be considered heavy use now, he said. </p>
<p>People in the study reported spending a median time of 2 to
2.5 hours a month on their mobile phones, the study said. The
heaviest users -- about 10 percent of the total -- said they
spent 1,640 cumulative hours on the phone. Participants reported
their use for periods ranging from one year to more than 10
years, according to the research. </p>
<p>FDA Statement </p>
<p>The study''s findings show little or no risk of brain tumors
for most long-term users of cell phones, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration said today in a statement. </p>
<p>There are still questions on the effect of long-term
exposure to radio frequency energy that are not fully answered
by the WHO study, Abiy Desta, network leader for science at the
FDA''s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said today in
the statement. However, this study provides information that
will be of great value in assessing the safety of cell phone
use. </p>
<p>The FDA has the authority to require manufacturers to
notify consumers and repair, replace or recall mobile phones if
they are ever found to emit radiofrequency energy at a hazardous
level, according to a fact sheet on the agency''s website. </p>
<p>Young People </p>
<p>Today, mobile phone use has become much more prevalent,
and it is not unusual for young people to use mobile phones for
an hour or more a day, the WHO researchers said in a
statement. The increased use is partially offset by younger
people''s preference for hands-free calling, texting over phone
calls and lower emissions of some newer phones, the researchers
said. </p>
<p>The study''s findings are consistent with conclusions
reached in an already large body of scientific research on this
subject, John Walls, a spokesman for CTIA-The Wireless
Association, a Washington-based trade group for the wireless
industry, said today in a statement. </p>
<p>More than one-third, or $6.8 million, of the study''s $23.7
million cost came from the mobile-phone and other industry
sources, according to a news release from the World Health
Organization. The researchers came from 13 countries, including
Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel,
Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the U.K. No one
was involved from the U.S. </p>
<p>Not Established'' </p>
<p>The number of wireless accounts grew to 285.6 million in
December from 109.5 million in 2000, according to CTIA. The
number of U.S. households that only have wireless phones was
almost 23 percent in December, up from 8.4 percent in 2005, the
CTIA said. </p>
<p>Previous studies include a December report by investigators
from the U.S. National Cancer Institute using cancer registries
in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, covering more than 16
million adults, to track the number of people diagnosed with
brain tumors since 1974, when mobile phone use in those
countries began seeing widespread use. The researchers found no
surge in brain cancer cases. </p>
<p>A study of 420,000 Danish people who used mobile phones for
an average of 8.5 years, reported in December 2006, also found
no increase in cancers. </p>
<p>Ramon Llamas, a phone-industry analyst at Framingham,
Massachusetts-based International Data Corp., suggested studying
the use of mobile phones going forward was a moving target. </p>
<p>No one wants to do something that endangers their health,
but consumer behavior on mobile phones is changing dramatically
already, Llamas said in an interview. Every carrier has seen
a dramatic change toward people texting and using data more,
which brings the phone away from the ear. </p>
<p>The newest study illustrates how difficult it is to
identify and corroborate, or definitively rule out, any possible
association, said John E. Niederhuber, director of the U.S.
National Cancer Institute. </p>

<p>The discussions, which started earlier this month, were

another law firm instead, a person briefed on the matter said,

<p>Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, confirmed

<p>A JPMorgan Chase  Co. reverse-
convertible note paying 64 percent annualized interest plunged
in value on May 14, three days after being sold, showing the
risks of these products usually bought by individual investors. </p>
<p>The structured notes offered 10.7 percent in interest
payments over their two-month term and a return of principal, as
long as shares of TiVo Inc. didn''t fall more than 25 percent,
according to a prospectus. TiVo dropped 42 percent on May 14
after an adverse court ruling, triggering a provision that will
leave investors holding the possibly depressed stock at
maturity. </p>
<p>Banks including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Barclays Plc
sold $656 million of reverse convertibles in the U.S. last
month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities,
which combine features of bonds and stock options, are often
sold to individuals who don''t understand the risks, said Jake Zamansky, a New York-based attorney who represents investors. </p>
<p>It''s being sold as a bond, an income-generating product,
and I don''t think it''s being explained to people that you can
get stuck with the stock, the securities lawyer at Zamansky 
Associates said in a telephone interview on May 14. He has
represented investors in lawsuits related to the products. </p>
<p>Justin Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment.
The prospectus''s listing of risk considerations includes the
statements your investment in the notes may result in a loss
and your protection may terminate on any day. Protection
refers to the feature where the principal is returned unless, on
any day, the stock closes 25 percent below its initial price. </p>
<p>Receiving Stock </p>
<p>Because that level was breached, noteholders will receive
at maturity as many shares of the stock as their investment
would have bought at the initial price, hence the name reverse
convertible. </p>
<p>Individuals should be buying reverse convertibles on
stocks that they otherwise would consider owning outright,
said Keith Styrcula, chairman of the New York-based Structured
Products Association, in a telephone interview today. </p>
<p>Investors in JPMorgan''s notes could make money if TiVo''s
share price recovers. The stock was up 5.8 percent, to $10.75,
at 1:09 p.m. today in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange,
compared with $16.88 when the notes were issued. </p>
<p>JPMorgan sold $800,000 of the TiVo-linked products, it said
in the prospectus. The 64 percent interest rate was the highest
offered on any reverse convertible in months, according to Craig McCann, a Fairfax, Virginia-based litigation consultant who''s
preparing a study of the market. </p>
<p>Ridiculous'' Commission </p>
<p>The price of the securities included a 1.75 percent sales
commission, of which JPMorgan received 0.75 percentage point,
according to the prospectus. That''s 10.5 percent on an
annualized basis, which is much higher than the commission
charged on comparable investments, according to Seth Lipner, a
Garden City, New York-based attorney. </p>
<p>A 10.5 percent commission is ridiculous, Lipner said in
a telephone interview on May 14. The cost would be much
lower for investors to make the same kind of market bet using
various options rather than reverse convertibles, he said. </p>
<p>Structured notes generally include other costs, such as to
offset risks related to the security, as well as a profit for
the issuer. The built-in costs of the TiVo-linked note were
limited to the 1.75 percent commission, according to the
prospectus. </p>
<p>Each $1,000 TiVo note was worth $945 on the day it was
offered, according to Bloomberg''s reverse-convertible pricing
model. McCann said his model came up with an initial value of
$960. Prices generated by the models vary based on the source of
market data and assumptions about liquidity and volatility. </p>
<p>Court Case </p>
<p>TiVo''s decline came after an appeals court said on May 14
it would reconsider the company''s victory over Dish Network
Corp. and EchoStar Corp. in a digital-video recording patent
case. Dish and EchoStar had asked on April 5 for the full panel
of the appeals court to rehear the case. </p>
<p>I don''t think something with a major development about to
take place, positive or negative, should be put into a reverse
convertible, Zamansky said. There''s just too much
volatility. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s prospectus states that TiVo''s stock has
experienced significant fluctuations. It doesn''t mention the
pending patent case. </p>
<p>Many investors who lost money on reverse convertibles have
filed arbitration claims against their brokers, according to
Zamansky. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a trade
group, said in a February letter to its members that reverse
convertibles can be difficult for retail investors and
registered representatives to evaluate. Brokers'' sales pitches
must be fair and balanced, it said. </p>
<p>Brokers often market reverse convertibles as a way for
individuals to take advantage of the sophisticated derivatives
trading that banks use, according to Chris Vernon, a Naples,
Florida-based attorney who represents structured-note investors. </p>
<p>The pitch with these complex structured products is that
this is what the big boys are doing and now you can do it too,
Vernon said in a telephone interview on May 14. But the big
boys aren''t paying 10 percent-plus commission per year. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. agreed to settle a
wrongful-death lawsuit alleging its Neurontin epilepsy medicine
caused a retired minister to commit suicide two months after he
started taking the drug. </p>
<p>Lawyers for New York-based Pfizer, the world''s biggest
drugmaker, told a judge in Nashville, Tennessee, they resolved
claims by the family of Richard Smith, which were set to go to
trial today. It''s the second settlement of claims that officials
of a Pfizer unit knew the epilepsy drug posed a suicide risk and
failed to disclose it to patients and doctors. </p>
<p>I''m very pleased the case has been resolved, U.S.
District Judge Aleta Trauger told lawyers for Smith''s family and
the company today. The terms weren''t disclosed. Smith, 79, was a
retired Church of Christ minister, according to court papers. He
was taking the drug to deal with chronic pain, not epilepsy, the
filings show. </p>
<p>Pfizer faces more than 1,000 lawsuits accusing it of
illegally promoting Neurontin for unapproved uses and helping to
cause some users'' suicides. In March, a Boston jury ordered
Pfizer to pay more than $140 million in damages to an insurer
over its marketing practices in connection with the drug. Pfizer
has denied any wrongdoing in connection with its handling of
Neurontin. </p>
<p>Great Sympathy'' </p>
<p>Its Warner-Lambert subsidiary pleaded guilty in 2004 to
criminal charges filed by the Justice Department in connection
with allegations it illegally marketed Neurontin and paid a $430
million fine. Pfizer bought Warner-Lambert for $120 billion in
2000. </p>
<p>We are pleased to have reached an agreement with the
Smith family to resolve this case as it avoids the time and
expense of a trial, Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement. We have great sympathy for the Smith
family and respect their desire for privacy regarding the
outcome of the case. </p>
<p>By prescribing Neurontin as a painkiller, Smith''s doctor
was recommending a so-called off-label use of the drug. While
doctors may prescribe a medicine for uses not approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, companies are barred from
promoting products for off-label uses. </p>
<p>As part of the guilty plea, Warner-Lambert officials
acknowledged the company engaged in deceptive off-label
marketing of Neurontin, Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. said in 2004. </p>
<p>Snake-Oil List'' </p>
<p>A former Warner-Lambert medical liaison testified in an
earlier Neurontin suit he was trained to market the drug to
doctors for uses beyond those approved by regulators. Dr. David
Franklin, who won a $25 million whistleblower suit against the
drugmaker over the medicine, said he was given a snake-oil
list of unapproved uses to help pump up Neurontin''s sales.
Franklin had been set to testify in Smith''s case. </p>
<p>Smith, who worked part-time as a service manager at a
Nashville office-machines store, began taking Neurontin in March
2004 to deal with chronic pain tied to back and neck surgeries,
according to court filings. Lawyers for his family say in the
filings that Warner-Lambert officials didn''t properly warn
Smith''s doctors the drug had been found to cause depression and
suicidal thoughts in some users. </p>
<p>Forgive Me'' </p>
<p>In May, Smith killed himself with a gunshot to the head,
according to the filings. In a note he left to his family, Smith
indicated he was tired of being in pain. </p>
<p>Forgive me; I cannot go on like this, I cannot have my
body, the temple of the Holy Spirit, cut on anymore, Smith
said in the note. I have talked to God all night and he
understands. </p>
<p>Lawyers for Smith''s family said he''d told relatives prior
to his suicide that the Neurontin was making him feel not
himself, according to court filings. Mr. Smith''s death was
inexplicable to family members because Mr. Smith was a godly man
and he knew suicide was wrong, they added in the filing. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s lawyers countered in their filings Smith suffered
through numerous surgeries which left him dealing with
increasing pain. The retired minister told his family he
wished he could die because of the pain and the depression,
the filing added. </p>
<p>The case is Ruby Smith v. Pfizer Inc., 05-cv-11515-PBS,
U.S. District Court, Middle District of Tennessee (Nashville). </p>

<p>Supertanker shipping rates may more
than double to $50,000 a day as the premium the third-month
futures contract holds over the front month encourages traders
to use the tankers to store crude, Morgan Stanley said. </p>
<p>With the forward price of crude oil surging, the amount
of vessels used for floating storage should coincidentally
increase, cutting available supply to the market and driving
freight rates up, Ole Slorer, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said
in a report yesterday. </p>
<p>The premium the third-month Brent crude contract holds over
the front month, a formation known as a contango, rose to $2.31
a barrel on May 13 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, the
highest level since Oct. 15, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That''s up from 55 cents on March 17. The contango was
$1.84 today. </p>
<p>At current contango levels, we calculate that the current
spread justifies VLCC rates above $50,000 per day, Slorer
said. </p>
<p>The average shipping rates for very-large crude carriers,
or VLCCs, was $22,281 a day as of May 14, according to the
London-based Baltic Exchange. The rate to ship oil to Japan from
the Middle East using VLCCs was $30,225. </p>
<p>VLCCs can haul about 2 million barrels of oil. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., operator of the
Altona oil refinery in Australia''s Victoria state, said power at
the plant is restored after an outage yesterday shut a number
of units. </p>
<p>The units were getting back to normal by midmorning
today, Alan Bailey, a Melbourne-based spokesman for the Irving,
Texas-based company, said by telephone. The outage occurred
shortly before 9 p.m. local time yesterday, he said. </p>
<p>Altona, the smallest of Australia''s seven refineries, is 13
kilometers (8 miles) west of Melbourne and supplies half of
Victoria''s fuel needs, according to Exxon''s website. The plant
makes about 13 million liters (3.4 million gallons) of products
a day. </p>
<p>It took some time for the power to be restored and then
it took us a little while to get the plant up and running
again, Bailey said. It does have a short-term impact, but
we''re not anticipating any measurable supply impacts out in the
market place as a result of this. </p>

a quick view of photos and videos at the top of e-mails. The
upgrade also helps users easily send photos, videos and other

<p>Microsoft, which sells ads next to Hotmail inboxes, is
updating the service to attract users from rivals such as Yahoo!
Inc. and Google Inc. While Hotmail is the leading e-mail service
worldwide, it''s No. 2 in the U.S. behind Yahoo Mail, according
to ComScore Inc. in Reston, Virginia. Google''s Gmail, the
fastest-growing of the leaders, was third. </p>
<p>This update, I think, is the most significant one we''ve

The shares have fallen 6.2 percent this year. </p>
<p>With the Hotmail upgrade, users can quickly see whether
they have e-mails from friends and social networks, along with
messages about package shipments or appointments, without
sorting through the inbox. Another feature, called sweep,
lets users clean out or move a block of similar e-mails with a

<p>Morgan Stanley shareholders voted
against a proposal that would have required the chairman be an
independent director who hasn''t previously served as an
executive officer of the company. </p>
<p>Shareholders rejected the plan today at the company''s
annual meeting in Purchase, New York, where they approved all of
management''s proposals and voted against all of the measures
proposed by shareholders, Chief Legal Officer Gary Lynch said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s board of directors unanimously opposed the
idea, saying in the proxy that investors are best served by
maintaining the flexibility to have any individual serve as
chairman of the board. The proposal was submitted by the
Laborers National Pension Fund. Current Chairman John Mack, 65,
was also chief executive officer until this year, when James Gorman, 51, took over. </p>
<p>In response to a shareholder at the meeting who said it
appeared Mack was still running the company, Mack said he would
quit if Gorman ever told him he was an obstacle. </p>
<p>I made it very clear to James Gorman that at any point if
I''m in his way, he needs to let me know and I''ll resign, Mack
said. </p>
<p>The meeting was held at the headquarters of Morgan
Stanley''s wealth-management unit. Fewer than 75 outside
shareholders attended the one-hour meeting, including one woman
who was knitting throughout the proceedings. </p>
<p>Board Re-Elected </p>
<p>Shareholders voted to re-elect board members, and approved
38 million additional shares to be used for equity-based
compensation during the next year. Morgan Stanley said in the
proxy that the shares are needed to address calls from
regulators that a greater proportion of pay be comprised of
stock. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley executives have sent letters to shareholders
in the past month asking them to vote in favor of the proposal
on approving new shares. Two proxy advisory groups have come out
in opposition and four institutional shareholders have sent in
their votes against it, according to the website Proxy
Democracy. </p>
<p>Shareholders approved 25 million shares at last year''s
meeting as the firm added thousands of employees from Smith
Barney, and Morgan Stanley said in a letter that it will likely
be back to request more shares in 2011. </p>
<p>U.S. Rescue </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley last month reported its largest quarterly
profit since 2007, as it recovers from the financial crisis that
included a $10 billion bailout from the government in 2008 and
the bank''s first annual per-share loss in 2009. Last year, it
repaid the taxpayer funds and took a controlling stake in a
joint venture with Citigroup Inc.''s Smith Barney brokerage. </p>
<p>The firm and competitors remain embroiled in a Securities
and Exchange Commission probe, started at least a year ago,
that''s examining whether Wall Street misled investors when
selling mortgage-linked securities. </p>
<p>Gorman said today in an interview after the meeting that
the company hasn''t received any Wells notices or recent
subpoenas from the SEC and hasn''t been contacted by the
Department of Justice. Wells notices are issued by regulators to
inform companies of completed investigations that may have
discovered infractions. </p>
<p>Across the Spectrum'' </p>
<p>The agency has been looking for abuse across the
spectrum, enforcement chief Robert Khuzami said April 16, when
the SEC sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc., accusing the company of
fraud in the sale of a collateralized debt obligation. While
federal prosecutors are scrutinizing the market, Morgan Stanley
isn''t the subject of a formal criminal investigation, a person
familiar with the government''s review said last week. Goldman
Sachs is contesting the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s operating environment is extremely
fluid because of regulatory reform legislation being debated
in Congress and various industrywide regulatory probes,
Gorman said. He said regulators looking into practices from
several years ago is a necessary consequence of the
financial crisis and is appropriate. </p>
<p>The financial industry needs to acknowledge the mistakes
that were made in recent years and work to regain trust of the
public, Gorman said. </p>
<p>We need to understand why people are so angry at Wall
Street, he said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley fell 38 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $26.73 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:15 p.m. The
shares have declined 9.7 percent this year, compared with the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials Index''s 3.6 percent gain. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. will close eight
manufacturing plants and scale back operations at six other
sites worldwide, eliminating 6,000 jobs as part of a previously
announced plan to trim its workforce. </p>
<p>The drugmaker plans to shut manufacturing operations over
the next five years at plants in Puerto Rico, Ireland, and
Rouses Point, New York. Operations at plants in Germany,
Ireland, Puerto Rico, the U.K. and U.S. will be cut back, the
New York-based company said in a statement today. </p>
<p>The cuts are part of the more than 19,000 jobs Pfizer said
it would eliminate after its $68 billion acquisition last year
of Wyeth. Pfizer said it has spent the past six months reviewing
how to reduce the combined company''s manufacturing operations. </p>
<p>Pfizer is slashing costs as it braces to lose patent
protection next year on the company''s top-selling Lipitor
cholesterol pill, which generated about a quarter of Pfizer''s
sales last year. The drugmaker has eliminated 48,000 positions,
or 38 percent of its total workforce, over the past six years. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell 30 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $15.81 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, its lowest price
since Aug. 14. </p>
<p>The plants that will be closed include those in Caguas,
Puerto Rico; Carolina, Puerto Rico; Dublin; Loughbeg, Ireland;
Shanbally, Ireland; Rouses Point, New York; Richmond, Virginia;
and Pearl River, New York. </p>
<p>Wyeth said in 2005 that it would sell the Rouses Point,
site. Research operations in Pearl River and Richmond won''t be
affected by the manufacturing cuts, Pfizer said. </p>
<p>Operations will be downsized in Guayama, Puerto Rico;
Newbridge, Ireland; Andover, Massachusetts; Sanford, North
Carolina; Havant, U.K.; and Illertissen, Germany. </p>
<p>The restructuring of our global plant network is critical

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., the world''s
largest oil company, said its plan to drill a deep-water oil
well in the Gulf of Mexico called Hadrian has been delayed by a
U.S. moratorium on offshore drilling permits. </p>
<p>Exxon moved a rig to a site in 6,941 feet (2,116 meters) of
water in anticipation of drilling the well before the moratorium
was imposed earlier this month, halting any additional work on
the project, said Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for the Irving,
Texas-based company. </p>
<p>A U.S. Interior Department report issued today that
included Hadrian in a list of deep-water projects that began in
the week ended May 17 may have been referring to Exxon''s
preparatory work, Jeffers said. The moratorium on new permits
was declared after an April 20 explosion and fire aboard a
Transocean Ltd. rig that killed 11 workers and triggered subsea
oil leaks. </p>
<p>Caryl Fagot, a spokeswoman for the department''s Minerals
Management Service, which produced today''s report, didn''t
immediately return a telephone message seeking comment. </p>
<p>The agency''s weekly deep-water activity report also showed
Newfield Exploration Co. and ATP Oil  Gas Corp. began drilling
deep-water oil wells in the Gulf in the past week. </p>
<p>Pyranees Drilling </p>
<p>Keith Schmidt, a spokesman for Newfield, confirmed drilling
has begun on a well at the company''s Pyranees project in 2,095
feet of water. Isabel Plume, an ATP spokeswoman, didn''t
immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment on
the deep-water report. Both companies are based in Houston. </p>
<p>Exxon dropped 48 cents to $62.79 as of 4:01 p.m. in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Newfield fell
$1.07, or 2 percent, to $51.44. ATP declined 42 cents to $14.71
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. </p>
<p>There are at least 37 deep-water drilling projects
operating in the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico, the report
showed. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil''s state-controlled
explorer, is overseeing the deepest, Chinook, in 8,850 feet of
water. </p>
<p>BP Plc, the London-based company that was leasing the rig
that exploded, burned and sank last month, is drilling a relief
well to halt leaks in the one damaged in the disaster that
claimed 11 lives. It''s BP''s only active deep-water project,
according to the report. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. shareholders
rejected a proposal to split the roles of chairman and chief
executive officer currently held by Jamie Dimon, who gave
investors an upbeat outlook on the U.S. economy. </p>
<p>The resolution to separate the positions failed to pass
with about 34 percent of the vote, according to a preliminary
tally given to investors at today''s annual meeting in New York.
All members of the board standing for election received at least
89 percent of the vote, said General Counsel Stephen Cutler.
More than a dozen homeowners with Chase mortgages and consumer
advocates, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson appealed to Dimon to
do more for borrowers seeking loan modifications. </p>
<p>Dimon, 54, who has led the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets and its board for more than four years, told shareholders
there''s a chance down the road that the lender would
reinstate a stock-buyback program. When asked whether the firm
would consider repurchasing shares, he said not quite yet.
He said he hoped to reinstate the quarterly dividend, which was
cut to 5 cents in 2009, at 30 percent to 40 percent of earnings. </p>
<p>The economy is growing as we speak, he said. We think
it''s better to wait when things are stable so we can pay a
dividend you can count on. It was the company''s first public
meeting since posting a 55 percent increase in net income for
the first quarter to $3.33 billion. </p>
<p>Votes on Proposals </p>
<p>Shareholders also approved a resolution for an advisory
vote on executive compensation by more than 95 percent. They
backed by 54 percent a measure allowing investors to take
actions outside of the public-meeting process if they have the
written consent of a majority of shares outstanding. </p>
<p>A proposal allowing anyone with at least 10 percent of
outstanding common stock to call shareholder meetings lost while
attracting 44 percent of the vote. Another proposal seeking more
detailed derivatives disclosures and stricter collateral
requirements won about 34 percent of the vote. </p>
<p>We already do substantially some of the things you''re
talking about, not all of them, but some of them, Dimon told
Sister Barbara Aires, who spoke on behalf of the groups of nuns
and priests who submitted the derivatives proposal. Aires said
in an interview that the same proposal received similar support
from shareholders at Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and Bank of America Corp. </p>
<p>About two dozen borrowers came to the meeting and appealed
for help on their home loans. Dimon referred them to mortgage
specialists sitting outside to answer questions about specific
foreclosure cases and pending modifications. </p>
<p>This is a government program, so it''s not always up to
JPMorgan in deciding who qualifies and who doesn''t for the
Home Affordable Modification Program, Dimon said. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc., fighting a
fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators who accuse the company of
misleading investors, is trying to persuade more Americans to
trust the firm with their retirement funds. </p>
<p>The New York-based company is promoting alternative asset
funds and designing target-date funds that provide guaranteed
income to grab a bigger piece of the $2.7 trillion 401(k)
market, said Bill McDermott, a managing director at Goldman
Sachs Asset Management and head of its defined-contribution
business. </p>
<p>We understand risk and we understand asset allocation,
said McDermott, who joined the firm in February to strengthen
its retirement-plan products and marketing. We''re looking to
leverage that for the 401(k) market. </p>
<p>Goldman''s 401(k) plan assets totaled $17.5 billion as of
March 31, according to the company. Fidelity Investments, the
largest 401(k) asset manager, had $347.8 billion as of December
31. Assets in 401(k) plans are estimated to increase 41 percent,
to $3.8 trillion, by the end of 2014, according to data from
Cerulli Associates in Boston. </p>
<p>Goldman and BlackRock Inc., the world''s largest asset
manager, don''t administer retirement plans and have been seeking
more 401(k) business. The business has been dominated by firms
such as Boston-based Fidelity and Vanguard Group, based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, which administer plans as well as
manage assets. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s biggest
software maker, agreed to pay VirnetX Holding Corp. $200 million
and license technology to communicate privately over the
Internet, ending a patent dispute. </p>
<p>We believe that this successful resolution of our
litigation with Microsoft will allow us to focus on the upcoming
pilot system for a virtual private network, Chief Executive
Officer Kendall Larsen said yesterday in a statement. </p>
<p>VirnetX, which won a $105.8 million jury verdict in its
patent-infringement lawsuit in March, was seeking a court order
to block Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft from continuing to
use the technology in its Windows operating system and
Communications Server. The jury award also could have been
tripled by the court''s judge. </p>
<p>Microsoft argued at trial that the patents were valued at
no more than $15 million. Investors bet the patents were worth
more, driving Scotts Valley, California-based VirnetX''s share
price up almost 300 percent in the past 12 months. VirnetX had a
market value of $267.9 million, based on the May 14 price. </p>
<p>VirnetX had been public in its desire to be bought to
resolve the dispute. The agreement in which it obtained the
patents from defense contractor SAIC Inc. included a provision
that SAIC would get 10 percent of any proceeds if VirnetX were
acquired by Microsoft, according to a company regulatory filing. </p>
<p>The patents relate to use of a domain-name service to set
up virtual private networks, through which a website owner can
interact with a customer in a secure way or an employee can work
at home and access a company''s files. The technology stemmed
from work performed for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to
develop secure communications, VirnetX said. </p>
<p>After winning the trial, VirnetX filed another lawsuit
against Microsoft in the same court, arguing that Windows 7 also
infringed the patent. </p>
<p>The Windows 7 case is VirnetX v. Microsoft Corp., 10cv94,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). The
older case is VirnetX Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 07cv80, in the
same court. </p>
<p>Hyundai Motor Wins Reversal of $34 Million Patent Verdict </p>
<p>Hyundai Motor Co. won its appeal of a $34 million verdict
that said South Korea''s largest automaker infringed a Texas
company''s patent for computerizing the sale of car parts. </p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit yesterday
said Orion IP LLC''s patent was invalid and vacated the verdict.
The opinion was posted on the court''s website. </p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support the jury''s
verdict in Orion''s favor on the question of validity, the
three-judge court panel ruled. </p>
<p>Orion, a patent-licensing firm based in Longview, Texas,
had sued 20 automakers, claiming infringement of a patent for a
way to help a salesperson select auto parts without relying on
catalogs or order forms. The other auto companies settled before
the 2007 trial in Tyler, Texas. </p>
<p>Hyundai argued that companies other than Orion had come up
with the idea of electronic parts catalogs in 1987, and the
patented computer-assisted system a year later wasn''t different
enough to be considered a new invention. The Federal Circuit
agreed. </p>
<p>Following the verdict, U.S. District Judge Leonard Davis
ordered Seoul-based Hyundai to pay a 2 percent royalty on parts
revenue generated through its website or dealer communication
system after June 19, 2007. </p>
<p>The case is Orion IP LLC V. Hyundai Motor America, 2009-
1130, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The lower court case is Orion IP LLC v. Mercedes-
Benz USA LLC, 05cv322, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Texas (Tyler). </p>
<p>Sanofi-Aventis Wins Patent Case Against Mylan in Delaware Ruling </p>
<p>Mylan Pharmaceutical Inc. extended-release bladder tablets
will infringe on asserted claims of a patent held by Sanofi-
Aventis known as the 491 patent, according to May 14 decision by
a federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. </p>
<p>The May 14 decision concerned Mylan''s proposed 10 mg
extended release alfuzosin hydrochloride tablets. The drug is an
alpha1-blocker that relaxes the smooth muscle in the lower
urinary tract, including bladder neck and prostate, to treat
illnesses of the prostate. </p>
<p>The 491 patent was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
office April 28, 1987, to Synthelabo, a predecessor of Sanofi-
Aventis, the court wrote in the decision. </p>
<p>Mylan filed its application in 2007. The court found that
Sanofi-Aventis showed by weight of the evidence that Mylan
literally infringes the asserted claims of the 491 patent. </p>
<p>The case is In re Alfuzosin Hydrochloride Patent
Litigation, 08-md-1941, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington). </p>
<p>Chrysler Seeks to Block Imports of China''s Jeepzter Knockoff </p>
<p>Chrysler Group, the U.S. automaker run by Fiat Spa, filed a
trade complaint to block U.S. imports of the Jeepzter, a car it
calls a knockoff of its Jeep off-road vehicle. </p>
<p>Chrysler filed a complaint May 14 with the U.S.
International Trade Commission in Washington against Xingyue
Group Co., claiming the Chinese company is making a vehicle that
copies a patented design for the Jeep Hurricane. The Hurricane,

<p>The Jeepzter is the same or substantially the same to the

<p>Chrysler, whose U.S. sales plummeted 36 percent last year,

of a turnaround of its Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler brands. </p>
<p>Chrysler also filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit in
federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 11 against
three companies selling Jeepzters in the U.S. That case claims
the companies are selling vehicles that copy the grille design
of the Jeep Wrangler. </p>
<p>Noel Farbman, president of USA Wholesale Scooters in
Florida, said he took ads for the Jeepzter off his website as
soon as he heard of the lawsuit. He said he sold three of the
vehicles before learning of Chrysler''s complaint. </p>
<p>Wade Liu, manager of Excalibur Motor Sports in Chino,
California, one of the companies named in the ITC complaint,
said he hadn''t yet received any of the Jeepzters and planned to
pull ads off his company''s website. </p>
<p>Also named in the ITC case were three other businesses in
Tennessee, Texas and North Carolina that advertised the
vehicles, as well as importers connected to Xingyue. Efforts to
reach Xingyue''s U.S. offices in California were unsuccessful. </p>
<p>The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Automotive

<p>Cable Companies Lose at High Court on Must-Carry Rule </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court, refusing to reconsider a
longstanding cable industry complaint, left intact a federal
requirement that providers include local broadcast stations in
their channel lineups. </p>
<p>The high court yesterday rejected an appeal from New York-
area cable provider Cablevision Systems Corp., which objected on
free-speech grounds to a requirement that it make a local
station available to customers on Long Island. </p>
<p>The appeal sought to overturn 1994 and 1997 Supreme Court
decisions that upheld the must-carry rule, which Congress
enacted in 1992 to protect the broadcasting industry from the
growing power of cable TV networks. Cablevision, backed by Time
Warner Cable Inc. and an industry trade group, said the
rationale behind the must-carry rule no longer exists, in part
because satellite services have captured more of the TV market. </p>
<p>The issue is pitting the cable industry and some program
providers against broadcasters and the Obama administration,
which is defending the must-carry requirements. </p>
<p>In urging the high court not to hear the case, U.S.
Solicitor General Elena Kagan argued that cable systems now have
far greater channel capacity than they did in the 1990s. </p>
<p>The case is Cablevision Systems v. FCC, 09-901, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley co-chief global
economist Joachim Fels said there''s a risk of some nations
eventually breaking away from the 16-member euro region should
the response to the debt crisis lead to fiscal instability
and sustained pressure on the currency. </p>
<p>If there''s further weakness and a rise in inflation
pressures, then some of the more stability-minded European
countries might decide to break away, Fels told Bloomberg
Television in an interview from London today. Clearly that''s a
long-term story, not a story for now. </p>
<p>The euro remained close to a four-year low against the
dollar today, partly on concern that the almost $1 trillion aid
package European Union ministers agreed to last week won''t keep
the fiscal crisis from spreading. The EU today transferred 14.5
billion euros ($18 billion) to Greece, the first installment to
help restore investor confidence and prevent a sovereign
default. </p>
<p>The euro fell as much as 0.7 percent today to $1.2315 and
was little changed at $1.2420 at 12:16 p.m. in London. </p>
<p>Greece has pledged to implement austerity measures of
almost 14 percent of gross domestic product in exchange for the
rescue funds that EU officials hoped would stem declines in the
euro and stop the crisis from spreading to other countries such
as Spain and Portugal. Luxembourg''s Jean-Claude Juncker, who
leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said today that
there are good reasons to believe Greece is on the right
path. </p>
<p>Still, Fels said that the rescue package may create more
emergencies over the medium term. If governments know that
there''s a fund to bail them out eventually, they''ll pursue
a more expansionary fiscal policy, he said. </p>
<p>Europe is on a slippery slope now toward more fiscal
instability, he said. </p>
<p>Spain and Portugal this month announced additional budget
cuts to tame the region''s third- and fourth-biggest deficits
after their bonds plunged. </p>
<p>What I am worried about is that those countries that are
tightening fiscal policy account for less than 20 percent of
euro-area GDP, Fels said. I think we have to look at the
large countries in the core, especially France and Germany,
where I see no signs whatsoever of fiscal tightening and these
countries account for more than half of euro-area GDP. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks to sell
its Australian service stations after a proposed A$300 million
($262 million) deal with Caltex Australia Ltd. was blocked by a
regulator. </p>
<p>It''s not our business model, Exxon Mobil Australia
Chairman John Dashwood said in an interview in Brisbane today.
I guess the distinction I make is, are you an oil and gas
company or are you a groceries company? The industry has changed
to the point where the two meld, and some have used the shop to
move fuel. We''re not in the business of being a shop. </p>
<p>The deal to buy 300 filling stations would have increased
Caltex'' ability to compete for fuel sales with BP Plc and
supermarket chains Woolworths Ltd and Wesfarmers Ltd.''s Coles.
Exxon Mobil Australia wants to focus on natural-gas projects,
with plans to spend many billions of dollars in Australia
and Papua New Guinea in three to five years, Dashwood said. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. energy company is operator of a $15
billion liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea and is
a partner in the $38 billion Gorgon venture in Australia led by
Chevron Corp. Exxon is also developing the Turrum and Kipper gas
ventures, which it estimates will cost A$3 billion. </p>
<p>It''s a substantial amount relative to what we''ve been
investing here over the past five years, Dashwood said,
declining to give a specific figure for the company''s spending
in Australia. It''s a re-energizing of the organization. </p>
<p>Kipper, Turrum </p>
<p>Exxon aims to decide in 2010 how to develop the Scarborough
gas field 300 kilometers (185 miles) off the coast of Western
Australia, he said. The project is a joint venture with BHP
Billiton Ltd. </p>
<p>The budgets and schedules for Turrum and Kipper off
southeastern Australia are under review, partner BHP
Billiton said in April. Santos Ltd., which owns 35 percent of
Kipper, said this month that first gas from the project has been
delayed until the second half of 2011 due to design issues. </p>
<p>While the timeline has probably shifted a little bit,
Exxon has not strayed from its 2011 target, Dashwood said today
on the sidelines of the Australian Petroleum Production and
Exploration Association conference. </p>
<p>Caltex Australia, the nation''s biggest oil refiner,
scrapped plans to buy Exxon Mobil''s filling stations after the
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission opposed a
transaction that would have given the company an estimated 22
percent of the country''s branded fuel market. The regulator said
in December it was concerned the deal would lead to higher
prices. </p>
<p>We jointly decided we wouldn''t proceed with that deal,
Dashwood said. In the meantime we''ve got to operate those
facilities. We''ll see where commercial discussions take us. </p>
<p>He declined to reveal the potential buyers. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. filed two lawsuits to
combat what it says is a previously unknown form of pay-per-
click fraud on its adCenter network that has cost advertisers
hundreds of thousands of dollars. </p>
<p>The company alleged that RedOrbit Inc., a Texas operator of
a website about science-related topics, its president and
unidentified defendants have used technical measures to make
invalid ad clicks appear to have originated from legitimate
sources, according to a Microsoft statement. </p>
<p>With click fraud, a company inflates the number of times an
ad is clicked on, often boosting advertising costs for a
competitor. In some cases, a website operator uses the technique
to increase its own revenue. Microsoft said RedOrbit''s actions
represent click laundering, a form of the practice designed
to evade fraud detection systems. </p>
<p>These are indications of the increasing sophistication
of click fraud, said Jim Jansen, an associate professor of
information sciences at Penn State in University Park,
Pennsylvania. It highlights that the ad platforms cannot get
complacent. </p>
<p>In the past, advertisers have sued companies, such as
Google Inc., that make money based on the number of times Web
users interact with online advertisements. Google, the most-used
Internet search engine, agreed in 2006 to pay $90 million to
settle a lawsuit with companies that said they paid for clicks
on ads that had no chance of generating sales. </p>
<p>Best Defense'' </p>
<p>Microsoft''s legal moves suggest Internet companies are
taking a more proactive role in cracking down on click fraud,
said Laurence Pulgram, a lawyer at Fenwick  West in San
Francisco. </p>
<p>This is a case of the search engine deciding the best
defense is a good offense, so the advertisers won''t be blaming
them, Pulgram said. </p>
<p>Microsoft said investigators uncovered the fraud following
dramatic and irregular growth in click traffic on two sites
within its adCenter network. </p>
<p>RedOrbit.com click traffic increased from 75 clicks a day
to 10,000 clicks over a three-month period, according to one of
two complaints filed in federal court in Seattle by the Redmond,
Washington-based company, the world''s largest software maker. </p>
<p>It is RedOrbit''s policy not to comment on pending
litigation, said Eric Ralls, founder of RedOrbit, listed as
the defendant in one of the lawsuits. However, we do not, nor
have we ever, engaged, assisted in, or condoned click fraud. We
are disappointed that Microsoft has made these completely
baseless allegations, and intend to defend against them
vigorously. </p>
<p>Mask the Masking? </p>
<p>Richard Boscovich, a senior attorney with Microsoft, says
Ralls figured out how to trick adCenter into making clicks that
weren''t valid look as though they had come from a legitimate
site. </p>
<p>We found that he''d done something that was thought to be
technically unfeasible, Boscovich said. While many websites
have used methods to mask the true source of traffic, he was
able to mask the fact that he was masking. </p>
<p>Google said it has taken steps to root out click fraud,
including in cases where the traffic is automated. </p>
<p>We design our systems to catch bot-related attacks,
said Deanna Yick, a spokeswoman for Mountain View, California-
based Google. Because a significant amount of malicious
traffic is automated, advertisers are protected from these kinds
of attacks. </p>
<p>The cases are Microsoft v. Eric Ralls, 10-818, and
Microsoft v. John Does, 10-820, U.S. District Court, Western
District of Washington (Seattle). </p>

<p>The move by General Electric Co. and
several Wall Street banks to salvage a Chicago lender with White
House ties prompted Republicans to demand that the Obama
administration answer questions about any role it may have
played in the rescue. </p>
<p>ShoreBank Corp., which needs about $200 million in
additional capital to stave off regulators, also is receiving
help from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp., the Chicago Tribune
reported. Representative Spencer Bachus, the ranking Republican
on the House Financial Services Committee, said they were doing
so to gain favor with the administration. </p>
<p>Some believe that ShoreBank was really saved because of an
assumption that high-ranking officials in the Obama
administration favored a bailout of this failing institution
with deep political ties, Bachus, an Alabama lawmaker, said in
a letter he sent to President Barack Obama. </p>
<p>General Electric said yesterday it''s investing $20 million
in the community bank, which is based on Chicago''s South Side
and has long-standing ties to the president. After Obama was
elected, former ShoreBank executive Robert Weissbourd served on
the president-elect''s transition team. </p>
<p>There is no way a bank without ShoreBank''s political
connections would receive this kind of attention, Bachus said
in a statement. </p>
<p>White House Question </p>
<p>Administration officials haven''t met with ShoreBank about
its efforts to raise capital nor asked other lenders to provide
it with financial assistance, Amy Brundage, a White House
spokeswoman, said in a statement. </p>
<p>The bank, a 1970s-era pioneer in lending to low-income
neighborhoods, has raised more than its target of $125 million
in private capital, said Brian Berg, a ShoreBank spokesman. The
remaining money may come from government funds, he said. </p>
<p>We''re still looking into what Bachus is asking for,
Berg said. </p>
<p>Bachus''s letter to the president also was signed by
Republican Representative Judy Biggert of Illinois. They said it
is unfair for a politically connected hometown bank to get
assistance as others are closed by regulators. </p>
<p>The Republicans urged the White House to release all
communication records that may exist between the administration
and financial executives involved in helping ShoreBank. </p>
<p>The investment is consistent with our focus on small- and
medium-sized businesses, and it is a valuable community bank,
GE spokesman Russell Wilkerson said yesterday. GE Capital, the
Stamford, Connecticut-based unit of GE, makes loans to
businesses through its commercial lending and leasing division. </p>
<p>Goldman''s Role </p>
<p>Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New
York, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Goldman has agreed to invest $20 million in ShoreBank and
never had contact from the White House on the matter, said a
person familiar with Goldman''s involvement. The firm''s
connections were through Ellen Seidman, who is on ShoreBank''s
board and is a founding member of the advisory council of a
Goldman small-business initiative, as well as former U.S.
Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig and Sheila Bair,
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the person
said. </p>

<p>Roy Bostock, the Morgan Stanley
director whose re-election was opposed by proxy advisory groups,
received the highest percentage of negative shareholder votes
among directors elected at the annual meeting. </p>
<p>Bostock, the chairman of Yahoo! Inc., faced opposition from
35 percent of shareholders'' votes yesterday, the New York-based
firm said today in a regulatory filing. Last year, about 29
percent of shares were voted against his re-election. </p>
<p>About 27 percent of shareholders'' votes supported a
proposal that would have required the company''s chairman be an
independent director who hasn''t previously served as an
executive officer of the company, the bank said. Current
Chairman John Mack, 65, was also chief executive officer until
this year, when James Gorman, 51, took over. </p>
<p>Shareholders approved all management proposals and rejected
all measures proposed by shareholders at the meeting in
Purchase, New York. </p>
<p>Bostock''s re-election was opposed by Glass Lewis and
RiskMetrics because he serves on the nominating and governance
committee even though his son-in-law, Daniel Waters, is co-CEO
of FrontPoint Partners, an asset-management division of Morgan
Stanley. Bostock has served on Morgan Stanley''s board since
2005. </p>
<p>About 35 percent of shares were voted against approving 38
million additional shares to be used for equity-based
compensation during the next year. That compares with 36 percent
that were voted against approving 25 million shares at last
year''s meeting. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Global
Economist Jim O''Neill said that while Europe''s debt crisis has
eased the euro''s overvaluation, policy makers may have to
take coordinated steps to shore up the currency. </p>
<p>People need to remember that for the past couple of years
the euro''s been very expensive, O''Neill told Bloomberg Radio
from London today. Still, the euro''s recent slide indicates
expectations that monetary union could unravel, so, there
needs to be something done by European policy makers to
stabilize the euro in the near future, he said. </p>
<p>The euro has shed 15 percent against the dollar this year
on concern a Greek fiscal crisis will spread across the 16-
member currency region. While European leaders last week pledged
a rescue package worth almost $1 trillion and the European
Central Bank started purchasing government bonds, investors
remain concerned about nations'' ability to push down deficits. </p>
<p>The euro remained near a four-year low against the dollar
today, trading at $1.2292 at 1:45 p.m. in London. It dropped as
low as $1.2144 today, the lowest level since April 17, 2006. </p>
<p>Greece on May 18 received the first installment of a
European Union aid package allowing it pay back 8.5 billion
euros of bond maturing today and avoid default. The government
pledged 30 billion euros of budget cuts to secure the aid and
pledged to reduce the budget gap to 8.1 percent of gross
domestic product this year from 13.6 percent in 2009. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. racked up
trading profits for itself every day last quarter. Clients who
followed the firm''s investment advice fared far worse. </p>
<p>Seven of the investment bank''s nine recommended top
trades for 2010 have been money losers for investors who
adopted the New York-based firm''s advice, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg from a Goldman Sachs research note sent
yesterday. Clients who used the tips lost 14 percent buying the
Polish zloty versus the Japanese yen, 9.4 percent buying
Chinese stocks in Hong Kong and 9.8 percent trading the British
pound against the New Zealand dollar. </p>
<p>The struggles for analysts at Goldman Sachs, which is 
fighting a fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators who accuse the
company of misleading investors in a mortgage-linked security, 
show the difficulty of predicting market movements as widening 
budget deficits, a fragile global economic recovery and tighter
financial regulations increase volatility. Stock and currency
fluctuations rose to the highest in a year this month as Europe
pledged about $1 trillion to stop a debt crisis in the region. </p>
<p>This says that Goldman''s guys are only human, said Axel Merk, who oversees $500 million as president and chief
investment officer of Merk Investments LLC in Palo Alto,
California. No one is always right. There are a lot of cross
currents in this market. </p>
<p>Gia Moron, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>China''s Bear Market </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s trading profits come from capturing bid-
offer spreads when its traders act as intermediaries for
clients, Gary Cohn, the firm''s president and chief operating
officer, said last week in New York. Proprietary trading isn''t a
main driver of earnings, he said. </p>
<p>The trade advice for customers is distributed by Goldman
Sachs''s global markets economic research group. It tracks the
performance of the trades in a daily research note. The time
period of the recommendations is 12 months. </p>
<p>The performance this year is a reversal from 2009, when
nine of Goldman Sachs''s 11 trading recommendations made money.
Investors saw a 22 percent return owning Chinese stocks and a 12
percent gain buying the British pound versus the dollar,
according to a Goldman Sachs note on Dec. 1. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs analysts made eight trade recommendations for
this year in December, including telling clients to buy the
British pound against the New Zealand dollar. On April 1,
Goldman Sachs added a ninth top trade, telling clients to
buy Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong and predicting the Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index would rise 19 percent to 15,000. </p>
<p>Tough Analysis </p>
<p>Since then, the gauge has slid 9.4 percent to 11,426.18.
The Shanghai Composite index has entered a bear market, losing
about 21 percent this year. That''s the third biggest decline in
the world after Greece and Cyprus. The decline accelerated this
month on concern Greece, Spain and Portugal will struggle to
finance their budget deficits and dismantle the euro. </p>
<p>The Chinese stock recommendation was made by a group led by
Dominic Wilson, a senior Goldman Sachs economist in New York.
Wilson cited inexpensive valuations and robust economic
growth. He also said investors have already factored in the risk
of higher interest rates in China. </p>
<p>Wilson wasn''t available to comment because he was out of
the office traveling, according to an e-mail. </p>
<p>Exit Calls </p>
<p>Emerging markets appear superior to the developed world,
but the market isn''t trading that relationship, said Eric Fine, who manages Van Eck Associates Corp.''s G-175 Strategies
emerging-market hedge fund. It may be that some assets are
mispriced, but if the market starts to discount the end point of
the game, such as the collapse of the euro, it''s not that
mispriced. </p>
<p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs recommended investors exit two
trades in February, one involving interest-rate swap rates in
the U.K. and another advising clients to buy credit-default
swaps in Spain and sell similar contracts in Ireland. The first
trade had a potential loss of 24 basis points and the other had
a return of 2.9 percent, according to figures issued in the
appendix of the research note in February. </p>
<p>Owning currencies that are tied to growth is the only
remaining trade that has increased in value this year, according
to Goldman Sachs. The Goldman Sachs FX Growth Index
has climbed 3.4 percent since the firm made the recommendation
in December. </p>
<p>Betting on Markets </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs makes more money from trading than any other
Wall Street firm. In the first quarter, the bank''s $7.39 billion
in revenue from trading fixed-income, currencies and commodities
dwarfed the $5.52 billion made by its closest rival, Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America Corp. In equities, Goldman
Sachs''s $2.35 billion in revenue was about 50 percent higher
than its nearest competitor. </p>
<p>Cohn told investors at a May 11 conference in New York that
the firm lost money on only 11 days in the last 12 months. He
said that uncanny streak of success refutes suspicions that the
bank depends on proprietary bets with its own money. </p>
<p>It is implausible that a proprietary-driven business
model could be right 96 percent of the time, Cohn said.
Instead, he said the simple answer is that the firm makes
money by capturing bid-offer spreads when acting as an
intermediary for client trades. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs executives have grappled before with
questions about whether they''re better at making money for the
firm than for their clients, according to an internal e-mail
dated Sept. 26, 2007, that was released by a U.S. Senate
subcommittee last month. </p>
<p>U.S. Lawsuit </p>
<p>The e-mail to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein from
Peter Kraus, who was then co-head of the company''s investment-
management division, explains that individual investors, unlike
institutional clients, occasionally make comments like ur good
at making money for urself but not us. </p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit
against Goldman on April 16 accusing the company of misleading
investors in a mortgage-linked asset. Goldman denies those
allegations and said it will fight the charges. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit
Suisse Group Inc. cut profit and share-price estimates for
Chinese property companies, citing a government clampdown on
speculation to avoid asset bubbles. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, ranked second for Asian property coverage by
Institutional Investor magazine, lowered its 2010 net income
estimates by an average 13 percent and reduced earnings
forecasts for the next two years by 25 percent, analysts led by
Yi Wang wrote in a report today. Credit Suisse pared earnings-
per-share estimates by as much as 15 percent for 2010 and 20
percent for 2011. </p>
<p>The MSCI China Real Estate Index''s 16 companies have
slumped an average 23 percent this year as the central bank
raised bank reserve requirements three times, while the
government raised down payment requirements for second homes and
banned loans for third homes. The slump in property stocks
outpaced the 9.5 percent drop in the broader MSCI China Index
that tracks mostly Hong Kong-traded stocks. The brokerages also
slashed share-price targets by as much as 57 percent. </p>
<p>In view of the revised tightening measures since mid-
April, we turn more cautious on the property sector,
particularly on transaction volumes for the remainder of the
year, Credit Suisse analysts led by Jinsong Du wrote in a
report yesterday. </p>
<p>Falling Transactions </p>
<p>Property transaction volumes will tumble by about 15
percent on average this year from 2009, the brokerage estimated,
keeping an earlier forecast that prices will slump 30 percent
from current levels. There are signs the government may adopt
a more cautious stance on tightening amid the European
sovereign-debt crisis, according to the report. </p>
<p>China''s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has slid 21
percent this year, Asia''s worst performer. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs predicted volumes will fall 40 percent
between May and December from a year earlier, while home prices
will fall as much as 30 percent from current levels, according
to a note today. </p>
<p>A number of developers with funding gaps may face
refinancing issues if banks tighten credit to developers
further, the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. We suggest
investors avoid such secondary real estate brokers due to their
high leverage to transaction volumes. </p>
<p>Guangzhou RF, Sino-Ocean </p>
<p>Sales of new homes in Shanghai fell to a five-year low last
week as tightening measures took effect, property consultant
Shanghai UWin Real Estate Information Services Co. said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Sales from May 10 to May 16
fell 16 percent to 60,000 square meters from the week before,
the lowest level for the same period since 2005. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs cut its ratings for Guangzhou RF Properties
Co., Shimao Property Holdings Ltd., Sino-Ocean Land Holdings
Ltd. and Yanlord Land Group Ltd. to neutral from buy. It
downgraded IFM Investments Ltd., Shanghai Forte Land Co. and
Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town Holdings Co. to sell from
neutral, while upgrading China Resources Land Ltd. to
buy from sell. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse lowered its recommendation for Greentown
China Holdings Ltd. to underperform from neutral and
downgraded Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. and Hopson
Development Holdings Ltd. to neutral from outperform. </p>
<p>Standard Chartered Bank also downgraded Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd. and Sino Land Co. today to in-line from
outperform, citing a less visible outlook for Hong
Kong''s residential prices, according to an e-mailed note by
analyst John Chan. </p>
<p>Guangzhou RF, the largest developer in the southern
Chinese city, fell 1.9 percent in Hong Kong trading, pacing a
retreat among property stocks. Shimao declined 1.2 percent while
Sino-Ocean Land lost 2.3 percent. Greentown China fell 2.2
percent while Hopson dropped 2.3 percent. Evergrande, China''s
second-biggest developer by first-quarter sales, tumbled 6.6
percent. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. and Celldex Therapeutics
Inc.''s said 70 percent of patients getting their experimental
brain tumor vaccine were alive without their cancer worsening
about eight months after diagnosis, a study found. </p>
<p>Cancer typically progresses in about 50 percent of patients
during that time period, said Tom Davis, Celldex''s chief medical
officer. The finding, involving 40 patients, is from an interim
analysis of a study reported today by the American Society for
Clinical Oncology. The full results will be presented June 5 at
the group''s annual meeting in Chicago. </p>
<p>New York-based Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker,
licensed rights to the drug last year from Needham,
Massachusetts-based Celldex for as much as $440 million, plus
royalties. If approved for brain cancer, the vaccine could have
$450 million in peak annual sales and come on the market in
2013, said Joseph Pantginis, an analyst with Roth Capital
Partners LLC. </p>
<p>Some investors may be disappointed because previous,
smaller studies appeared to show a greater benefit with about 90
percent of patients alive without their cancer worsening after
the treatment, called CDX-110, Pantginis said. That may be a
misinterpretation of the data because the studies aren''t
apples-to-apples comparisons, he said. </p>
<p>Celldex fell 8.9 percent to $6.99 at 7:06 p.m. New York
time in extended trading after the close of the Nasdaq Stock
Market. Pfizer fell 13 cents to $15.10 in extended New York
trading. </p>
<p>More Data Needed </p>
<p>Further data on the vaccine''s survival benefit will be
needed to draw definitive conclusions on the treatment, said
Pantginis, who has a buy'' rating on Celldex shares. </p>
<p>There might be some disappointment out there because you
have erosion to the progression rate, he said. This is still
a positive progression number, but the data are immature. </p>
<p>The treatment is designed to ramp up the body''s immune
response to fight off the tumor. The vaccine targets the
molecule called epidermal growth factor receptor variant III,
which plays a role in cell growth. The strategy could be applied
to breast, ovarian and prostate cancer as well, though none of
those indications are in human testing, Celldex said. </p>
<p>The drug is in the second of three stages of testing
required to get U.S. regulatory approval. Pfizer hasn''t
announced plans to start final-stage testing. The next step
likely will be a placebo-controlled study looking at about 200
patients worldwide, Davis said. </p>
<p>In the research, newly diagnosed patients received
injections of CDX-110 along with radiation therapy and Merck 
Co.''s Temodar until their tumor progressed. All patients
received the experimental treatment, rather than giving the
medicine to half of the participants while the other half
received placebos. </p>
<p>Final results from 65 patients enrolled in the trial should
be available by year''s end, Davis said. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-biggest U.S. mall operator, finished restructuring its
$15 billion secured-debt load, clearing an obstacle from its
path out of bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in Manhattan today approved
a restructuring agreement on a $95 million loan tied to a
Louisiana mall. It''s the last of the Chicago company''s secured
debt that needed to be restructured in bankruptcy, Anup Sathy, a
lawyer for General Growth, said in court. </p>
<p>I''m pleased to report, your honor, that our last loan is
done, Sathy, an attorney with law firm Kirkland  Ellis, told
the judge. </p>
<p>Today''s ruling by Gropper marks a milestone in General
Growth''s bankruptcy case. The mall operator has spent months
obtaining court approvals for restructuring deals on its secured
debt. </p>
<p>Gropper said he was delighted that General Growth and
creditors reached a deal. A unit of Citigroup Inc. represents
holders of the loan, according to court documents. </p>
<p>I think everyone has benefited from the restructurings of
all the loans, the judge said. The company is now on an
entirely different economic footing than when the case
started. </p>
<p>Extended Maturity </p>
<p>General Growth reached agreements with lenders on a total
of 108 loans worth $15 billion, Sathy said. The debt is tied to
144 properties. The deal approved today, on the Oakwood Center
mall in Gretna, Louisiana, extends the maturity of the loan to
June 1, 2014, according to court papers. </p>
<p>General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
making acquisitions. Its properties include New York''s South
Street Seaport, Boston''s Faneuil Hall and the Grand Canal
Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. </p>
<p>With agreements on its secured debt in place, General
Growth can now turn its attention to the final phase of its
reorganization: cementing an agreement for new financing
commitments that will fund the company''s exit from bankruptcy
protection. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, the company won court approval to move
forward with an investment proposal from Brookfield Asset
Management Inc., Fairholme Capital Management LLC, and Pershing
Square Capital Management LP. They have agreed to invest $6.5
billion into the company, subject to higher bids from other
investors. The company plans to seek court approval of the
financing commitments in September, according to court
documents. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., the energy producer
fighting lawsuits over drilling in Ecuador, must wait until
May 31 before proceeding with a subpoena seeking outtakes from a
movie about oil exploration, a judge ruled. </p>
<p>Chevron won a court ruling May 6 ordering filmmaker Joseph Berlinger to surrender outtakes from his documentary about the
San Ramon, California-based company''s drilling in Ecuador. The
company argued that footage shot for Crude: The Real Price of
Oil may be relevant in a lawsuit brought by Ecuadorians, in
Chevron''s arbitration against Ecuador, and in criminal
proceedings in the South American country. </p>
<p>A Chevron subpoena required Berlinger to surrender his
outtakes by tomorrow. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New
York today granted a 10-day postponement so that Berlinger may
appeal the judge''s May 6 ruling to the Court of Appeals in New
York. </p>
<p>Berlinger''s lawyer, Maura Wogan, argued yesterday that
Kaplan''s earlier ruling will compromise the rights of other
documentary makers not to disclose unpublished material. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s contract
to serve as financial adviser to New York''s Metropolitan
Transportation Authority won''t be renewed, according to a person
familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The decision to drop Goldman wasn''t related to a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the firm last
month, accusing it of misleading investors in a mortgage-linked
security, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the decision wasn''t public. The agency, which carries
8.5 million passengers a day, went through its normal process of
requesting proposals and found a better deal, said the person,
declining to be more specific. </p>
<p>The advisory assignment with the MTA, one of the biggest
issuers of U.S. municipal debt, is among the market''s most
lucrative. The MTA, the largest mass-transit system in the U.S.,
plans to sell about $9 billion in bonds for capital projects in
the four years through 2013. </p>
<p>Goldman became the MTA''s financial adviser in 2000, and its
contract was renewed in 2004. The firm earned about $21 million
advising the agency on bond issues, based on its fee of 65 cents
per each $1,000 unit sold since early 2002. The agency has
issued more than $31 billion in debt since March 2002, according
to audited financial statements. </p>
<p>The MTA''s finance committee will recommend the board change
advisers on May 24, the person said. </p>
<p>The MTA''s decision not to renew Goldman''s contract was
reported earlier by the New York Post and New York Times. </p>
<p>Jeremy Soffin, a spokesman for the MTA, and Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, declined to comment. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc., the
mall operator reorganizing in bankruptcy, clashed with lenders
on a $400 million loan over whether the company must disclose
now any plan to convert the debt to equity. </p>
<p>General Growth said in court papers filed today in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan that the lenders are improperly
demanding to be told if the loan will be converted as part of
the company''s plan to restructure its debt. </p>
<p>The Chicago-based mall owner said the request constitutes
an attempt to extinguish General Growth''s bargained-for
contractual rights under the loan, which allows the company to
convert some or all of the debt to common stock when it exits
bankruptcy. </p>
<p>David Feldman, an attorney for Law Debenture Trust Co. of
New York, which represents the lenders, declined to comment. </p>
<p>In a court filing today, Law Debenture said General
Growth''s obligation to provide notice was triggered when the
company won approval earlier this month for new financing
commitments from a group of investors. General Growth loses the
option to convert the debt if it doesn''t provide notice within
one day, the Law Debenture said. </p>
<p>The lenders specifically negotiated the right to know
whether they will be repaid in cash or stock, Law Debenture said
in its court filing. The lenders will incur significant
risks if they don''t know for certain how their debt will be
treated, it said. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper is scheduled to hold a
May 27 hearing on the dispute. </p>

<p>Analysts predict Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. will pay $1 billion or more to settle a Securities and
Exchange Commission fraud suit that triggered a 26 percent drop
in the firm''s stock. Extracting such a record-setting penalty
may be easier said than done. </p>
<p>When it comes to presenting a settlement for court
approval, the SEC will have to have a good explanation and
justification for the number, said Donald Langevoort, a former
SEC attorney who teaches securities law at Georgetown University
in Washington. </p>
<p>Looming over negotiations between the SEC and Wall Street''s
most profitable investment bank is a reminder from Judge Jed Rakoff that courts can reject settlements -- even when the SEC''s
adversary is willing and able to pay. Rakoff, a U.S. district
court judge in Manhattan, refused to sign off on a $33 million
accord with Bank of America Corp. in September, noting that the
SEC didn''t adequately explain how it came up with the dollar
amount. </p>
<p>A sanction in the range of $1 billion would be hard to
support based on the allegations in the Goldman Sachs complaint,
according to James Coffman, a former SEC enforcement official
who retired in 2007. That figure would be more than double what
any Wall Street firm has agreed to pay as part of a civil
settlement with authorities. </p>
<p>Under one formula outlined in securities laws, the SEC
could impose a maximum $15 million penalty on the bank to
resolve fraud allegations that it misled buyers of mortgage-
backed investments. That formula has been routinely ignored in
enforcement cases and the SEC will seek more from a firm
depicted as an icon of Wall Street greed at congressional
hearings, Coffman said. </p>
<p>$1 Billion Goalpost'' </p>
<p>The SEC''s April 16 complaint accused Goldman Sachs of
defrauding investors in a collateralized debt obligation linked
to home loans. The firm concealed the fact that Paulson  Co., a
New York-based hedge fund, picked components of the CDO and bet
it would collapse, the agency said. Goldman Sachs, which
underwrote and marketed the product in 2007, collected about $15
million in fees and Paulson reaped a $1 billion profit. The
remaining investors lost more than $1 billion, according to the
complaint. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, has denied wrongdoing. Paulson hasn''t been
accused of any impropriety and the firm''s founder, John Paulson,
has said it didn''t market the transaction or have authority to
select securities in the CDO. </p>
<p>The $1 billion loss for investors has become the minimum
goalpost that the public expects the SEC to reach, according
to James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University in
Durham, North Carolina. </p>
<p>Whatever it Takes'' </p>
<p>A settlement would cost the firm at least $1 billion, if
not more, which they can easily pay, Matt McCormick, an
analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Inc. in Cincinnati, which manages about
$2.8 billion, said in an April 30 Bloomberg Television
interview. The firm will do whatever it takes to get this
away, or at least they should. </p>
<p>As the agency''s first effort to punish a bank for creating
and selling securities tied to subprime mortgages, the Goldman
Sachs case will be dissected by the industry, in Congress and in
the media, Coffman said. </p>
<p>There''s been a lot of attention paid to this on Capitol
Hill and in the press, said Coffman, who predicts Goldman
Sachs will pay about $100 million. The SEC will consider how
much public interest there is in sending a strong message and
coming up with a settlement that shows the cops are on the
beat. </p>
<p>SEC spokesman John Nester and Goldman Sachs spokesman
Michael Duvally declined to comment. </p>
<p>Softening Its Tone </p>
<p>Public statements from Goldman Sachs have softened in the
month since the SEC announced its case as the firm''s image and
stock price have taken a beating. </p>
<p>In an April 16 press release, Goldman Sachs called the suit
completely unfounded and pledged to vigorously defend
its reputation. Four days later, co-General Counsel Greg Palm
broached the idea of resolving the case, saying on a conference
call with investors that you always have the option of
settling if both sides forge an agreement. </p>
<p>In the days following an April 27 Senate hearing where
Goldman Sachs managers were accused of putting the firm''s
interest ahead of clients, two executives at the firm who spoke
on condition of anonymity said the company was eager to settle
the SEC case in an attempt to contain the reputational damage. </p>
<p>Ramifications of Accord </p>
<p>The subject of how much money the firm may pay hasn''t been
raised during early discussions between the SEC and Goldman 
Sachs, according to a person briefed on the matter, speaking
anonymously because the talks were private. </p>
<p>Negotiations are more likely to stall over the way the SEC
ultimately describes the firm''s conduct, rather than the size 
of any fine, said two people familiar with Goldman Sachs''s
thinking. Goldman would resist agreeing to a settlement that
includes an allegation of fraud, because doing so could hurt
the firm''s business, they said. </p>
<p>Settling a fraud case would restrict Goldman Sachs and its
employees from managing investment companies registered with the
SEC, unless the bank got an exemption from the agency. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s asset management unit currently oversees
mutual funds, money-market funds and bond funds, according to
its website. Goldman Sachs would also risk losing its ability to
raise money quickly through securities sales without meeting
certain regulatory burdens. </p>
<p>The SEC and New York-based Goldman Sachs will have to
litigate if they can''t agree on an accord. </p>
<p>Pecuniary Gain'' </p>
<p>The SEC suit cites the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Both laws limit their most
severe fines to either $650,000 per violation or the pecuniary
gain reaped by the defendant. </p>
<p>SEC investigators don''t have to follow those limitations if
they can persuade companies to pay more, a majority of agency
commissioners vote to approve the settlement and a judge signs
off on the accord, said former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins. </p>
<p>It''s basically what the two sides hammer out, he said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs argues the $15 million in commissions it
received for putting the CDO together were offset by more than
$90 million the firm lost on its own stake in the transaction. </p>
<p>ABN Amro Bank NV lost more than $840 million and
Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG lost
most of its $150 million investment, according to the SEC. </p>
<p>The SEC typically requires defendants in a settlement to
pay a fine and return ill-gotten profits to victims. </p>
<p>Citigroup''s 2003 Settlement </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. paid $400 million in 2003 to settle SEC and
state allegations that its analysts hyped telecommunications
stocks that its researchers privately thought were
underperformers. </p>
<p>The SEC said in its complaint that Citigroup made $790
million in revenue from underwriting telecom securities from
1999 through 2001, relying on analysts to generate substantial
profits for the company''s investment bankers. </p>
<p>Citigroup agreed to a $150 million fine, returned $150
million of ill-gotten gains, and paid $100 million to provide
clients with independent research and investor education. </p>
<p>Bank of America, in the second-biggest agreement between
the SEC and a bank in the past decade, paid $375 million in 2004
to settle claims the company didn''t disclose that some of its
mutual funds allowed clients to make trades detrimental to other
investors. </p>
<p>Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America paid a $125
million fine and $250 million in disgorgement. Its fine was 10
times the $12.5 million in revenue the SEC said it received from
one of the hedge funds making improper trades. </p>
<p>Prudential''s Choice </p>
<p>Prudential Securities Inc. agreed in a 1993 settlement
with the SEC and state regulators to pay $371 million in
restitution and fines, and to fully compensate all investors who
lost money in oil, gas and real estate partnerships it sold
without disclosing the risks. Over time the company paid more
than $1 billion to resolve claims dating back to the 1980s. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs remains the most profitable firm in Wall
Street history. It earned $13.4 billion in 2009 and an
additional $3.5 billion in the first three months of 2010. </p>
<p>Money hurts but limitations on business can hurt in a lot

<p>Coda Automotive, which makes
batteries in China for its electric cars, plans to open a
factory in Ohio as a hedge against a possible rise in the yuan,
Senior Vice President Mark Atkeson said. </p>
<p>Coda of Santa Monica, California, paired with Tianjin
Lishen Battery Co., majority owned by Chinese energy producer
Cnooc Ltd., to make batteries in Tianjin. Coda also gets auto
parts from a plant in northern China, to be assembled in
California for sale in the U.S. later this year. </p>
<p>We feel in the long-run there is a need for a global
manufacturing base, Atkeson told reporters on May 22. One
reason is that the renminbi will go up, he said, using
another name for the Chinese currency. That would increase the
costs of goods exported to the U.S., he said </p>
<p>The yuan''s value has been fixed to about 6.83 to one U.S.
dollar for almost two years, and China is being pressed by
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner to let the value of the
currency appreciate to boost domestic demand and control
inflation. Geithner met with Chinese officials in Beijing
yesterday as part of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue. </p>
<p>Closely held Coda, which has former U.S. Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson on its advisory board, aims to sell 14,000
electric cars by the end of next year, Atkeson said in an e-mail
exchange on May 23. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. is less optimistic
about China as a market than India or Indonesia because of the
country''s lack of progress in stamping out software piracy,
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said. </p>
<p>India is not perfect but the intellectual property
protection in India is far, far better than it would be in
China, the head of the world''s largest software maker said in
an interview in Hanoi, Vietnam, yesterday. China is a less
interesting market to us than India, than Indonesia. </p>
<p>Ballmer''s concerns underscore growing dismay among U.S.
companies toward operating in the world''s third-largest economy.
Google Inc. in March moved its Chinese service out of the
mainland to avoid censorship rules, and the American Chamber of
Commerce in Beijing said last month its members face an
increasingly difficult regulatory environment. </p>
<p>China has implemented more than 1,000 measures related to
the protection of intellectual property and the government will
continue such efforts, said Chen Rongkai, a media officer at the
nation''s Ministry of Commerce in Beijing. </p>
<p>China''s effort at strengthening protection of
intellectual property is universally recognized, Chen said. </p>
<p>Lack of progress in protecting intellectual property has
led China, which may overtake the U.S. as the world''s biggest
personal-computer market in a year, to generate less revenue for
Microsoft than India and South Korea, Ballmer said. China''s
gross domestic product is twice the two economies combined. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley hired Deutsche Bank
AG''s David Heaton, an investment banker to fund managers
including Legg Mason Inc., said a person with direct knowledge
of the matter. </p>
<p>Heaton, 43, will join in August and run investment banking
for asset-management companies, said the person, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because Heaton hasn''t joined the firm
yet. Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Morgan Stanley, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Heaton has worked on some of the biggest asset-management
deals, helping Merrill Lynch  Co. sell its investment
management unit to BlackRock Inc. in 2006 and helping Legg
Mason, the Baltimore-based money manager, raise capital from
investors including KKR  Co. in 2008. </p>
<p>Heaton will be offering merger and financing advice to fund
management companies, many of whom rely on Morgan Stanley''s
18,000-strong retail brokerage venture to distribute their
investment products. Before joining Deutsche Bank, Heaton spent
almost two decades at Merrill Lynch, formerly the largest retail
brokerage. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Smith Barney eclipsed Merrill Lynch last
year when it was created as a joint venture of Morgan Stanley
and Citigroup Inc. </p>
<p>Heaton was part of a group of 12 Merrill Lynch bankers who
defected to the German bank last year after Merrill Lynch was
sold to Bank of America Corp. New York-based Merrill Lynch filed
a lawsuit over their departures that was later resolved with a
confidential agreement. </p>
<p>Also part of the group that went to Frankfurt-based
Deutsche Bank last year were Heaton''s brothers Eric and Seth Heaton. Eric and Seth Heaton remain at Deutsche Bank. John Gallagher, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, declined to comment. </p>

<p>International Business Machines

that helps businesses conduct transactions. </p>
<p>IBM will buy Dublin, Ohio-based Sterling from ATT Inc.,
the biggest U.S. phone carrier, according to a statement from
the companies today. Its software helps businesses share
information and transfer files to other companies. </p>
<p>IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano plans to spend
$20 billion on takeovers in the next five years as he bolsters
the software business, IBM''s most profitable. Sterling''s
programs allow companies to manage and create their networks on
external servers, a business known as cloud computing -- which
IBM expects to reach $3 billion by 2015. </p>
<p>Plugging this gap was crucial for IBM, said Ken
Vollmer, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Syracuse, New
York. IBM will be able to take the technology and meld it
together with theirs. </p>
<p>The transaction will likely close in the second half of
2010, the companies said. ATT probably will record a pretax
gain of $750 million on the deal once it''s completed. About
2,500 Sterling employees will join IBM''s software division. </p>

<p>General Electric Co., the world''s
second-biggest maker of wind turbines, won its first order for a
U.S. offshore project, to be built in Lake Erie near Cleveland. </p>
<p>GE will supply five direct-drive turbines that can generate
as much as 4 megawatts each in a project with the Lake Erie
Energy Development Corp. that they expect to complete in 2012,
the company said today in a statement. GE will also provide
maintenance services. </p>
<p>Offshore wind has the potential to create thousands of
new jobs in Ohio and become a major source of economic growth,
Victor Abate, who runs GE''s renewable energy businesses, said in
the statement. </p>
<p>GE will work with Lake Erie Energy to identify additional
locations for offshore wind projects, with the goal of
developing 1,000 megawatts by 2020, he said. </p>
<p>Ohio Governor Ted Strickland said the project will help
reduce the state''s reliance on generating electricity from coal.
The state gets about 90 percent of its power from burning the
fossil fuel, which contributes the largest single man-made
source of greenhouse gases. </p>
<p>Governor Praises Move </p>
<p>There are associated costs with coal that don''t make it
into the cost of electricity, Strickland said today in a media
briefing at a wind energy conference in Dallas. We want to use
this project to find ways to produce wind power cheaper. </p>
<p>GE bolstered its access to offshore-turbine technology last
year with its purchase of the ScanWind unit of Morphic
Technologies AB in Sweden for 130 million kronor ($18 million).
ScanWind''s gearless conversion box is designed to cut
maintenance costs, helping GE compete with offshore leader
Siemens AG. </p>
<p>The U.K., the nation with the most offshore wind capacity,
has about 8 gigawatts (8,000 megawatts) operating or planned and
is targeting an additional 25 gigawatts, its government said in
June. Growth will also be driven as designs improve for large
offshore turbines, which are costlier and more difficult to
repair than land-based versions, Abate said. </p>
<p>Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE slipped 23 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $16.19 a share as of 1:22 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 7.1 percent

<p>Disney, the world''s biggest media company, resumed talks
with Los Angeles investors Alec and Tom Gores, who had earlier
made an offer, said a third person. The people asked not to be
identified because the talks aren''t public. </p>
<p>Burkle remains interested, one of the people said. He is
working with Bob and Harvey Weinstein, the Miramax founders who
sold the studio to Disney in 1993. The group is talking with the
board of the Weinstein Co. to resolve legal issues that caused
delays, the person said. If a settlement is reached, a deal
could be revived, two people said. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Disney ended
talks. Burkle had offered $625 million, two of the people said.
The Weinstein brothers, who weren''t expected to hold an equity
stake, were to receive pay and performance bonuses for
overseeing the studio and library. </p>
<p>Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Burbank, California-
based Disney, declined to comment. Dani Weinstein, a spokeswoman

Burkle didn''t respond to a request for an interview. </p>
<p>Weinstein Co. investor Mark Cuban said on April 21 that he
may try to stop the Weinstein brothers from joining Burkle''s
bid. The Cuban dispute involves the 2009 release The Road,
Dani Weinstein said at the time. The film, produced for $25
million, took in $23.9 million in worldwide ticket sales,

<p>International Business Machines Corp.
and trade groups for major U.S. companies are pressing Congress
to defeat a jobs bill containing billions of dollars in taxes on
their global operations. </p>
<p>The effort is led in part by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
and an alliance of companies including IBM, Microsoft Corp. and
General Electric Co. They are targeting a measure that extends
aid to unemployed workers, promotes bonds for infrastructure
projects and renews more than three-dozen business tax breaks,
including a credit for experimental research that many of the
companies support. </p>
<p>In a letter to lawmakers yesterday, Armonk, New York-based
IBM, the world''s biggest computer-services provider, told
lawmakers it strongly opposes the legislation and would
rather do without the research credit than face new taxes on
overseas profits. </p>
<p>Although our company has been a long-time supporter of
the RD tax credit that has enjoyed bipartisan support in
Congress over many years, the pending legislation would impose
significant new tax increases that will completely overwhelm any
positive economic effect of the tax credit, wrote Christopher Padilla, vice president of governmental programs for IBM. </p>
<p>No Meaningful Benefit'' </p>
<p>IBM reduced its effective tax rate by 9 percentage points
in 2009 because it was able to defer U.S. taxes on money earned
in lower-tax countries, according to filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The value of its research tax credits
wasn''t specified. IBM, in a June 2008 policy document, said it
has been unable to derive meaningful benefit from the
research credit for many years. </p>
<p>Opposition from major U.S.-based multinational corporations
injects a new lobbying front into an effort to defeat the bill,
which has been opposed most prominently by private-equity firms
such as New York-based Blackstone Group LP and Washington-based
Carlyle Group, the National Venture Capital Association and the
Real Estate Roundtable. </p>
<p>Those groups are trying to block a proposed tax increase on
carried interest, the share of profits that fund executives earn
as part of their compensation. Carried interest is taxed at the
lower capital-gains rate when it involves long-term gains. That
rate is currently 15 percent and is scheduled to rise to 20
percent in 2011. </p>
<p>Ordinary Rates </p>
<p>The bill would begin taxing half of carried interest at
ordinary rates as high as 35 percent this year. By 2013, three-
quarters of carried interest would be subject to ordinary rates,
which are scheduled to be more than 40 percent. </p>
<p>IBM and the business groups are protesting eight provisions
in the bill projected to raise about $14.5 billion by making it
harder for U.S.-based companies to claim credits for taxes they
pay to other governments. The tax credits are intended to
prevent double taxation and can only be claimed when those
foreign profits are repatriated to the U.S. </p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers, including House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat, say companies are
using a variety of techniques to reduce their U.S. tax bills
without ever bringing their profits to the country. </p>
<p>Some have used techniques to maximize the amount of money
they leave overseas at the same time they''re claiming the
foreign tax credit to avoid U.S. taxes on other income
sources, Levin told reporters on a conference call today. He
called the technique a manipulation of the tax code that is
tilting the playing field in favor of investment overseas. </p>
<p>Government Spending </p>
<p>The bill also faces some opposition in the Senate because
it would add to the deficit. It would spend $63 billion to
postpone cuts in Medicare fees to doctors, $55 billion to extend
unemployment benefits and $24 billion to aid state governments.
Lawyers, oil companies and businesses that use offshore tax
havens would see their taxes go up. </p>
<p>The House is scheduled to debate the broader tax measure
this week, and the Senate is poised to act too. Lawmakers are
under pressure to adopt the bill because the unemployment aid
expires May 31. </p>
<p>Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, on
the conference call with Levin, wouldn''t say how soon the bill
will come to the floor. I''m confident that we will have the
votes to pass it, he said. </p>
<p>Opposition to international tax provisions are complicating
the effort to pass more than three-dozen tax breaks that have
been popular with lawmakers in the past, even as they were
criticized for bestowing narrow benefits on special interests
including race track owners, makers of toy bows and arrows,
restaurant operators, and tuna canners. </p>
<p>Build America Bonds </p>
<p>The package would also extend the Build America Bonds
program and renew a provision that benefits companies such as
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE and New York-based Citigroup
Inc. that sell financial products in overseas markets. </p>
<p>The tax breaks, which generally expired Dec. 31 and must be
renewed to be available this year, also include benefits for
individuals, such as a $250 deduction for teachers who buy their
own classroom supplies and a write-off for state and local sales
taxes that primarily benefits residents of states like Texas,
Alaska and Florida, which have no income taxes to deduct on
federal forms. </p>
<p>While the economy needs an extension of expiring
provisions, the chamber cannot support legislation which imposes
onerous, permanent tax increases to pay for the temporary
extension of these provisions, wrote Bruce Josten, executive
vice president of government affairs for the Chamber of
Commerce. </p>
<p>Principles of Fairness'' </p>
<p>A separate coalition, Promote America''s Competitive Edge,
which counts GE; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft; Peoria,
Illinois-based Caterpillar Inc., and Cincinnati-based Procter 
Gamble Co. among its members, also protested the bill, saying
the international tax changes run contrary to the principles
of fairness and due process. </p>
<p>The National Association of Manufacturers, a Washington
trade group, today urged lawmakers to strip the international
tax provisions from the bill. It said the way companies use the
foreign tax credit has been mischaracterized as loopholes. </p>
<p>NAM strongly urges policymakers to advance legislation
that includes much-needed tax relief without anti-growth, anti-
competitiveness revenue raisers, the group wrote to House
members. </p>

Investment-banking fees in Asia jumped 68 percent in the first
four months from a year earlier to a record $5.6 billion,

<p>Mangla and Khullar will report to Doug Howland and Kester Ng, who were promoted to joint heads of equity capital and
derivatives markets for Asia-Pacific, the person said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s Hong Kong-based spokeswoman Marie Cheung
declined to comment, as did Rob Stewart of Merrill Lynch, the
investment-banking division of Bank of America Corp. Mangla and
Gupte weren''t available, said a person who answered the phone at
JPMorgan''s Hong Kong offices. </p>
<p>Merrill Lynch hired Mangla in late April to run its
convertible bond underwriting business in the Asia-Pacific
outside Japan, people with knowledge of the matter said at the
time. Gupte joined Merrill Lynch at the same time. Both bankers
were on so-called gardening leave and hadn''t yet started work at
Merrill Lynch when JPMorgan rehired them, one person said. They

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall
Street''s most profitable firm, sold $1.25 billion of 10-year
senior notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The 6 percent fixed-rate debt priced to yield 280 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage points. </p>
<p>The sale came as companies sold $6 billion in debt today,
the most in five weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Issuance of corporate bonds has fallen 59 percent this month
from April amid growing concerns that European countries will
struggle to manage their debts, slowing the global economic
recovery, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Goldman is pretty good at timing the market when these
chances open up, said Charles Sanford, who helps manage $129
billion at Babson Capital Management LLC in Springfield,
Massachusetts. It was an opportunistic deal on Goldman''s
part. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs paid more to tap the corporate debt market
than it did two months ago, when it sold $750 million of 10-
year, 5.375 percent notes at a spread of 175 basis points on
March 19 in a reopening of an issue from earlier that month,
Bloomberg data show. It paid a 190 basis-point spread when it
sold $2 billion of the notes on March 1, the data show. </p>
<p>Those notes traded at 95.862 cents on the dollar at 3:53
p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt
yields 5.94 percent, or 273.6 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, Trace data show. On May 25, the bonds ended
trading at a 276.1 basis-point spread, the data show. </p>
<p>Buying Opportunity'' </p>
<p>We think it''s a buying opportunity now, said Michael Donelan, director of trading and head portfolio manager at Ryan
Labs Inc., who yesterday bought 10-year Goldman Sachs notes. </p>
<p>Spreads on all investment-grade corporate bonds fell 2
basis points to 204 basis points, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch Corporate Master Index. Bonds issued by
banks fell 7 basis points to 276 basis points. </p>
<p>Investors have demanded higher yields from the world''s
biggest financial institutions than other corporate bond issuers
because of concern that Europe''s sovereign debt crisis will
reduce lenders'' creditworthiness and that regulatory efforts to
control risk taking will crimp their profits. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s $1.5 billion of 10-year notes sold
on March 25 rose 0.409 cent on the dollar to 100.263 cents at
3:30 p.m. in New York, according to Trace data. The notes yield
4.915 percent, or 171.6 basis points more than benchmarks, Trace
data show. </p>
<p>Companies selling bonds today included TransCanada
Pipelines Ltd., which offered $1.25 billion of 5- and 30-year
notes, and Discovery Communications Inc., which issued $3
billion of debt in a three-part offering, according to Bloomberg
data. Today''s total is the most since $12.3 billion on April 21,
Bloomberg data show. </p>

<p>The U.S. economy will expand up to 4
percent annually for a couple of years and then settle into
a predicted new normal of slow growth, according to Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>New York-based Kasman said that while he agrees with
Pacific Investment Management Co.''s new-normal concept, the
economy may be initially buoyant. Pimco Chief Executive Officer
Mohamed A. El-Erian has forecast the worst slump since the Great
Depression will be followed by an environment of below-average
economic expansion, increased regulation and lower consumption
amid higher unemployment. </p>
<p>We are buyers of the idea that there is a new normal in
terms of where unemployment rates are going to be, what the
supply side of the U.S. economy''s going to deliver, Kasman
said in a Bloomberg Radio interview today with Tom Keene. Our
distinction is we can see a lot of reasons to be pessimistic
about structural performance here in medium-term trends and
still see a couple of years of pretty good growth, 3 to 4
percent. </p>
<p>Newport Beach, California-based El-Erian wrote in a
Bloomberg News column in February that the U.S. economy faces a
protracted post-crisis resetting as high unemployment
persists. </p>
<p>Kasman, a former researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, correctly predicted January''s unexpectedly strong 5.7
percent gain in GDP. JPMorgan forecasts GDP growth for the
second and third quarters to be 4 percent, slowing to 3.5
percent in the fourth quarter and to 3.2 percent for 2011. </p>
<p>The new-normal thesis makes sense in terms of what''s
happening underneath the surface, but I don''t think you want to
apply it to GDP and production and labor income data in a world
in which there''s going to be a cyclical lift that carries us for
a while, Kasman said. </p>

<p>One in six U.S. mobile-phone
customers has faced unexpected monthly fees, according to a
survey released by the Federal Communications Commission as part
of a drive to wrest clearer information from wireless carriers. </p>
<p>Almost half of consumers subscribing to plans with fees for
dropping service before the end of a contract didn''t know the
amount they would be charged, the agency said today in an e-
mailed statement, citing the survey. </p>
<p>There is still more that can be done to help customers
navigate what is sometimes a confusing marketplace, FCC
Chairman Julius Genachowski said in the statement. Consumers
would be helped by simple and easy to understand purchase
and billing procedures, he said. </p>
<p>Verizon Wireless, ATT Inc. and other service providers may
face rules similar to those in Europe, where carriers must send
text messages to subscribers who are close to plan limits, the
FCC said May 11. The agency said it is talking with wireless
industry groups about steps to improve bills. </p>
<p>We really can''t say at this point whether this all will
result in a rulemaking or voluntary standards, Joel Gurin,
chief of the FCC Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, said
on a conference call with reporters. </p>
<p>Of the 30 million Americans who said they were surprised by
their bills, 88 percent weren''t contacted by their carriers when
charges increased, the agency said today. About 84 percent
weren''t contacted when they were about to exceed their allowed
minutes, text messages, or data downloads, the agency said. </p>
<p>FCC Micromanage'' </p>
<p>It seems the commission is going to attempt to
micromanage what is an incredible array of choices for
consumers, said Steve Largent, president of the Washington-
based CTIA - The Wireless Association, in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The wireless industry does provide simple and easy to
understand'' plans for every type of American consumer, Largent
said. </p>
<p>Only 36 percent of mobile-phone customers who are
familiar with their bills said that they include very clear
information on early termination fees, the agency said. </p>
<p>More than a third of people surprised by a bill said
charges jumped by at least $50, and 23 percent said the increase
was $100 or more, the FCC said. </p>
<p>The telephone survey of 3,005 adults was conducted from
April 19 to May 2 by Abt/SRBI and Princeton Survey Research
Associates International, the FCC said. For responses based on
those with personal cell phones, or about 80 percent of
respondents, the margin of error was plus or minus two
percentage points, the agency said. </p>
<p>ATT, Verizon </p>
<p>ATT on May 21 said that beginning June 1, it will increase
early termination fees to $325 from $175 for users of the Apple
Inc. iPhone and other devices used for computing on the go. </p>
<p>Verizon Wireless, owned by Verizon Communications Inc. and
U.K.-based Vodafone Group PLC, told the FCC Dec. 18 that
consumers are protected by detailed disclosure practices
about early termination fees, which doubled in November to $350
for advanced phones. </p>
<p>Increases in charges for ending a service contract is just
not an area we''re getting into, at least at this point, Gurin
said. We''re focused on clarity, disclosure, consumer
information. </p>

<p>PTC India Financial Services Ltd., a
company backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Macquarie Group
Ltd., is planning a share sale to tap growing investor interest
in the South Asian nation''s power projects, the chairman said. </p>
<p>PFS, which invests in electricity generation plants and
assets, needs to raise as much as 10 billion rupees ($211
million) and may make an initial public offering by end
September, said Tantra Narayan Thakur, who is also chairman of
parent company PTC India Ltd. </p>
<p>Today is the best time to invest in the Indian power
market, Thakur said in an interview in New Delhi. More and
more people want electricity. </p>
<p>India plans to double its installed electricity capacity in
the next seven years to meet energy demand and reduce blackouts
in the world''s second-fastest growing major economy. The federal
government has raised at least 102 billion rupees from selling
shares in three state-owned power-related companies since
January. </p>
<p>PFS may sell a stake to a private equity investor before
the IPO, said Thakur. JM Financial Ltd., SBI Capital Markets Ltd.
and ICICI Securities Ltd. will advise the sale, he said. </p>
<p>PTC, India''s largest power trader, has a 77 percent stake
in PFS and plans to retain a 51 percent holding after the sale,
Thakur said. Goldman Sachs and Macquarie currently hold 11.5
percent each, he said. </p>
<p>Ashmore Fund </p>
<p>The banks paid 16 rupees a share for their holdings in 2008,
he said. Macquarie spokesman Paul Scanlon said in an e-mail the
company had no comment. Deepa Jayaraman, a New Delhi-based
spokeswoman at IPAN Hill  Knowlton, which handles public
relations for Goldman Sachs, was unable to respond immediately
to an e-mail requesting comment. </p>
<p>PTC India is setting up a $1 billion fund with the U.K.-
based Ashmore Group Plc to finance electricity generation
projects in India, he said. </p>
<p>PTC and Ashmore aim to raise $500 million in the first
round by the end of September that will be invested in eight to
10 thermal and hydropower projects in the pipeline, he said. </p>
<p>The fund plans to make minimum investments of $25 million
each, mostly in power projects and potentially in energy assets
such as gas import terminals and pipelines, Thakur said. </p>
<p>PTC may spend up to 3 billion rupees to acquire coal assets
abroad as part of an effort to diversify into fuel sources,
Thakur said. The power trader raised $400 million by selling
shares to institutional investors in January 2008 and May 2009. </p>
<p>The government sold stakes in Rural Electrification Corp.,
a state-owned lender for power projects, NTPC Ltd., the
country''s biggest power generator, and SJVN Ltd., operator of
India''s largest hydropower plant. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., the
world''s biggest payment networks, may raise antitrust concerns
if they collude with larger banks to block limits on debit-
card interchange fees and frighten small banks into joining
the opposition, U.S. Senator Richard Durbin said. </p>
<p>If your companies were to coordinate such punitive
actions in the same way that you appear to have coordinated your
messaging tactics, serious concerns would be raised that you are
engaging in an unlawful restraint of trade, Durbin, the
Illinois Democrat and majority whip, said today in a letter to
the chief executive officers of San Francisco-based Visa and
Purchase, New York-based MasterCard. </p>
<p>Durbin is pushing legislation that empowers the Federal
Reserve to impose limits on debit-card interchange or swipe
fees that merchants pay to accept the cards. Curbing the fees,
which average about 1 percent per transaction, could crimp
revenue at Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo  Co. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. debit-card issuers. </p>
<p>The Senate voted 64-33 to approve the measure as part of
the financial overhaul bill. The proposal becomes law if it
survives a bipartisan panel assigned to merge the House and
Senate versions of the legislation, and President Barack Obama
signs it. Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat
nominated to participate in the talks, said she expects changes
in Durbin''s proposal, without elaborating. </p>
<p>Stock Reaction </p>
<p>Visa, which had climbed 2.4 percent today in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, erased most of its gains and
finished with a gain of 29 cents to $73.69. MasterCard increased
$2.80, or 1.4 percent, to $207.80. </p>
<p>The two firms are saying they may alter network operating
rules and swipe fees for small banks to frighten them into
opposing the legislation, Durbin said. I warn you that such
changes might be seen as restraining trade, Durbin said. </p>
<p>Industry groups representing community banks and credit
unions said Durbin''s exemption for banks with assets of less
than $10 billion failed to win their support because it would
make their debit cards more expensive for merchants compared
with those issued by the biggest lenders. </p>
<p>Community banks don''t need Visa or MasterCard to help them
recognize the harm this amendment will cause to their
institutions and their customers, said Jason Kratovil, a vice
president at the Washington-based Independent Community Bankers
Association of America. </p>
<p>Fee Levels </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard could lower interchange rates for all
banks to levels that prompt credit unions and community lenders
to re-evaluate their ability to issue debit cards, the ICBA
and the Credit Union National Association said in a May 12
letter to senators. </p>
<p>This opposition appears to be based on community banks''
and credit unions'' recognition that the Durbin amendment would
turn the economics of the entire payment system on its head with
negative consequences for all participants, including
consumers, MasterCard said today in an e-mailed statement from
spokesman James Issokson. </p>
<p>The National Association of Federal Credit Unions hasn''t
been threatened by Visa and MasterCard and is not aware of
any threats to its members, Fred Becker, the group''s
president, said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Retail Stores </p>
<p>The interchange provision will do nothing but add to the
bottom line of big-box stores and giant retailers -- all at the
expense of consumers and small financial institutions, Becker
said. </p>
<p>Visa spokeswoman Denise Dunckel had no comment. </p>
<p>Durbin, in his letter to Visa CEOJoseph W. Saunders and
MasterCard chief Robert W. Selander, sought a pledge from both
companies that they wouldn''t take steps to purposely
disadvantage small issuers if his amendment becomes law. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nebraska Treasurer Shane Osborn wrote to
lawmakers saying that curbs on debit-card fees could increase
costs to taxpayers and harm citizens who receive benefits on
prepaid cards. The letter contains a passage almost identical to
one on Visa''s website. </p>
<p>We''ve researched this significantly to try and go out and
get information on what''s going on as this thing changes, so we
use all types of resources, Osborn said in an interview today. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley raised its forecast
for the dollar''s value against the euro to $1.16 from $1.24 by
the end of the year after the Greek debt crisis undermined
the European Central Bank. </p>
<p>The 16-nation currency touched a four-year low of $1.2144
on May 19 as Germany''s ban on some speculative trades against
bank and government credit quality added to concern Greece''s
funding crisis would spread through the region. The ECB had said
on May 10 it would start buying public- and private-sector debt
as part of a bid to halt the fiscal crisis and rescue the euro. </p>
<p>The initial fiscal problem in the periphery (Greece) has
now become a fiscal problem for core Europe, Morgan Stanley''s
Stephen Hull in London wrote in a report today. More
importantly for the euro, it has also undermined the credibility
of the ECB. </p>
<p>The shared currency will reach a low around $1.12 in the
first quarter of 2011 before recovering later in the year, the
research note said. It will probably rise against the pound,
buying 90 pence by the end of the year from 84.77 pence today,
Morgan Stanley predicted. The U.K. currency will probably fall
to $1.29 in December from $1.4582 today. </p>
<p>We see the dollar being well supported for the remainder
of 2010, Hull wrote in the report. U.S. growth is still
surprising on the upside. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for the dollar versus the
yen, citing data showing a larger flow of funds into Japanese
equities from investors outside the island nation. The New York-
based financial institution predicts gains in the U.S. currency
to 98 yen by the end of the year, less than its previous
estimate of 109 yen. One dollar bought 91.04 yen as of the U.S.
close today. </p>
<p>The greenback will probably reach the 109 level versus the
yen by the end of 2011, Hull predicted. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s Wyeth unit lost a bid
at Canada''s highest court to block a lawsuit that alleges the
menopause drug Premarin caused breast cancer. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada today declined to hear Wyeth''s
appeal of a British Columbia decision denying the company''s
claim that its U.S. units couldn''t be sued in the province. The
high court gave no reason for its decision. </p>
<p>The ruling clears the way for the suit to proceed to a
certification hearing in December, where plaintiff Dianna
Stanway will ask a judge to let all Canadian women who took
Wyeth''s hormone-replacement medicines sue as a group, said David
Klein, Stanway''s lawyer at Klein Lyons in Vancouver. </p>
<p>About nine out of 10 pharmaceutical lawsuits in Canada
are certified, Klein said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Wyeth''s U.S. and Canadian units were sued in 2006 by
Stanway, of Sechelt, British Columbia. Stanway claimed she
developed breast cancer as a result of taking estrogen-based
Premarin in combination with the drug progestin. Wyeth''s U.S.
units urged the appeals court to throw out the suit, claiming
British Columbia courts lacked jurisdiction to try the case. </p>
<p>Wyeth sold and promoted the drug in Canada and its
conduct amounts to personal subjection to the jurisdiction,
Judge Kenneth Smith wrote on behalf of the appeals panel. It
was therefore reasonable for them to contemplate they might be
sued in British Columbia. </p>
<p>Acted Responsibly'' </p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruling was procedural and not a decision
on the merits of the case, said Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman. </p>
<p>We continue to believe Wyeth acted responsibly by
conducting or supporting more than 180 studies on hormone
therapy''s benefits and risks, Loder said. The company
provided proper, accurate and science-based information to
patients and doctors. </p>
<p>Pfizer faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the menopause
medicines. New York-based Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker,
completed its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth last year. </p>
<p>The Canadian suit won''t include women who took menopause
drugs that weren''t made by Wyeth, which had the biggest market
share in the country, or who suffered from other side effects,
Klein said. </p>
<p>This case is about breast cancer, he said. </p>
<p>The case is Wyeth Pharmaceuticals v. Dianna Louise Stanway,
33580, Supreme Court of Canada (Ottawa). The appeals court case
is Between Dianna Louise Stanway and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
CA036317, Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Vancouver). </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. fell too far in a
selloff that pushed the software maker''s market value below
Apple Inc., according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, slumped 18 percent
in May through yesterday, when Apple of Cupertino, California,
was worth $2.94 billion more. Microsoft lost 4.1 percent
yesterday after Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said that
the effects of the European debt crisis will spread. </p>
<p>While European contagion is a concern, Ballmer''s comments
were not Microsoft specific, Sarah Friar, an analyst at New
York-based Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report to clients dated
yesterday. The shares underperformed large-cap tech despite
having relatively lower exposure outside of the U.S. Given
significant underperformance and attractive valuation levels, we
are buyers of the shares. </p>
<p>Technology companies in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index had
retreated 11 percent this month through yesterday. Today,
Microsoft jumped 4 percent, the most since Oct. 23, to $26. </p>
<p>Goldman''s Friar said that Microsoft''s fourth-quarter
earnings, scheduled for July 22, will show signs of improving
corporate demand for personal computers. On average, analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg estimate sales of $15.2 billion at the
world''s largest software maker, compared with $13.1 billion a
year earlier. </p>
<p>Missing Estimates </p>
<p>Microsoft reported third-quarter revenue last month that
missed analysts'' most optimistic predictions. Sales rose 6.3
percent to $14.5 billion, compared with analysts'' estimates that
were as high as $14.8 billion for the quarter. </p>
<p>While Microsoft''s Windows business has benefited from
increased consumer demand for personal computers, corporations
have avoided purchases of machines and long-term contracts.
Investors held out for evidence of a spending resurgence after
chipmaker Intel Corp. forecast record profit margins for 2010. </p>
<p>FBR Capital Markets Corp. today raised its rating for
Microsoft to outperform from market perform, also citing
the outlook for increased demand from corporations. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s stock market value exceeded $400 billion in
2000 before falling to $227.9 billion today. Apple''s worth has
surged to $230.5 billion from less than $5 billion in 2003. </p>
<p>The stock market will take care of itself, Ballmer said
in New Delhi today. What''s the expression? On any given day
the stock market is a voting machine, in the long run only is it
a weighing machine. So let''s see what happens. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. lost a bid to have a
judge throw out a $9.4 million jury award to an Alabama woman
who developed breast cancer after taking the company''s menopause
drugs. </p>
<p>A state-court judge in Philadelphia denied requests by
Pfizer''s Wyeth unit to set aside the award to Audrey Singleton
or reduce the $6 million in punitive damages jurors awarded over
her use of the drugmaker''s hormone-replacement medicines.
Singleton''s lawyers alleged the company hid the drugs'' health
risks. </p>
<p>The judge''s ruling validates the jury system and confirms
that this community is outraged by Wyeth''s conduct, Zoe Littlepage, one of Singleton''s lawyers, said in an interview
today. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women have taken hormone-replacement
medicines to treat menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, night
sweats and mood swings. Until 1995, many patients combined
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug made by Wyeth, with progestin-
laden Provera, made by another Pfizer unit. Wyeth combined the
two hormones in its Prempro medicine. </p>
<p>While we are disappointed in the trial court''s ruling, it
clears the way for the company to appeal this decision, Pfizer
spokesman Chris Loder said today in an e-mailed statement. We
stand by our belief that there is no basis in fact or law for
the jury''s verdict. </p>
<p>Pfizer faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the menopause
medicines, which are still on the market. New York-based Pfizer,
the world''s largest drugmaker, completed its $68 billion
purchase of Wyeth last year. </p>
<p>Litigation Record </p>
<p>Wyeth has lost seven of the 11 Prempro cases that have been
considered by jurors since the cases began going to trial in
2006. The company has persuaded judges to throw out some of
those verdicts at the post-trial stage and reduce awards in
others. </p>
<p>Singleton, a retired school-bus driver from Chatom,
Alabama, began taking Prempro in August 1997. A mammogram at
that time was normal, her lawyers said during the trial. She
stopped taking the drug in January 2004 after her breast cancer
diagnosis. </p>
<p>The woman''s lawyers argued in the case that Wyeth
executives hid or downplayed Prempro''s health risks as part of a
marketing campaign designed boost sales and put profits over
women''s health. </p>
<p>Annual sales of Wyeth''s hormone-replacement drugs topped $2
billion before the 2002 Women''s Health Initiative study,
sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, suggested
women using the medicines had a higher breast-cancer risk. </p>
<p>No New Trial </p>
<p>Jurors in Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas concluded in
February Singleton deserved $3.45 million in compensatory
damages and $6 million in punishment damages over Wyeth''s
failure to properly warn about the drug''s risks. </p>
<p>The drugmaker''s lawyers asked Judge Mark Bernstein to throw
out the verdict and grant Wyeth a new trial or to cut
Singleton''s damage award. Bernstein denied the company''s request
in a May 20 order that was made public yesterday, according to
court records. </p>
<p>Canada''s highest court today declined to hear Wyeth''s
appeal of a judge''s decision to allow a class-action case over
Premarin to proceed in that country''s courts. A group of
Canadian women are pressing claims that the drug helped cause
their breast cancers. </p>
<p>The Philadelphia case is Singleton v. Wyeth Inc.,
050102885, Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County,
Pennsylvania. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s largest
software maker, may cut the monthly fee it charges for streaming
music on its Zune portable player, senior product manager Terry
Farrell said in an interview. </p>
<p>Zune Pass, which features unlimited music streaming and 10
song downloads a month, now costs $14.99. Farrell didn''t say by
how much Microsoft may cut the service''s price. </p>
<p>It''s definitely a challenging business, Farrell said,
referring to competition in online music. </p>
<p>Microsoft is contending with rivals that offer music at
little or no charge, while striving to erode Apple Inc.''s lead
in the market for digital music players and downloadable songs.
RealNetworks Inc.''s Rhapsody service in April slashed the
monthly price of a premium music service to $10 from $14.99. </p>
<p>Zune had 2 percent of the U.S. digital music player market
in the first quarter, compared with 76 percent for Apple
products, according to NPD Group Inc., a Port Washington, New
York-based researcher. </p>
<p>Users can access Microsoft''s download service on personal
computers and the company''s Zune players and Kin phones. The
company plans to offer the service on smartphones running its
Windows Phone 7 software later this year, Farrell said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may spend
$621 million to settle the Securities and Exchange Commission''s
fraud suit that triggered a 13 percent one-day drop in the
firm''s stock, analyst Brad Hintz said. </p>
<p>Negotiations between the SEC and Wall Street''s most
profitable investment bank may end with Goldman Sachs paying a
fine of about $250 million, plus $371 million to reimburse
investors in the disputed trades, Hintz, an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co., wrote in a note to clients today. </p>
<p>While this would be painful to Goldman, we believe it
would allow both Goldman Sachs and the SEC to walk away
declaring victory'', said Hintz, who has had an outperform
rating on the stock since June 2009. Certainly Goldman wants
this case settled. Its management has stated that it wants a
''normal'' relationship with its regulators. </p>
<p>The amount could reduce the New York-based firm''s earnings
per share by $1.05, or 5.4 percent of 2010 earnings, which are
estimated to be $19.55, according to the average estimate of
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs slumped on April 16 when the SEC accused
Goldman Sachs of defrauding investors in a collateralized debt
obligation linked to home loans. The firm concealed the fact
that Paulson  Co., a New York-based hedge fund, picked
components of the CDO and bet it would collapse, the agency
said. The bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein,
55, has denied wrongdoing. </p>
<p>SEC spokesman John Nester and Goldman Sachs spokesman
Michael Duvally declined to comment. </p>

<p>General Motors Corp.''s bankruptcy
estate won four more months to wind down under court protection,
an extension that a judge said was warranted because the company
must resolve asbestos and environmental liability claims. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber in New York today gave
the bankrupt part of the automaker the exclusive right to
control its liquidation until this fall. The company has until
Sept. 27 to file a Chapter 11 plan and until Nov. 29 to solicit
creditor support. </p>
<p>Its obvious to anyone that, despite what''s been
accomplished so far, this is still a very, very large case with
some major issues, Gerber said. </p>
<p>The company, Motors Liquidation Co., is liquidating assets
of the former General Motors Corp. The still-operating Detroit-
based automaker is General Motors Co. </p>
<p>Joseph H. Smolinsky, a lawyer for the company, told Gerber
that the uncertain size of asbestos claims and resolution of
environmental liabilities were holding back formulation of a
consensual plan. </p>
<p>Progress has been made on environmental issues since
President Obama allocated $800 million last week to clean up and
develop 90 General Motors properties, Smolinsky said. </p>
<p>We can finally report some tangible, meaningful
progress, the lawyer said, noting that the money would be put
into a trust for properties in 14 states that covers thousands
of acres around the U.S. </p>
<p>U.S. Government </p>
<p>It''s the first time the federal government has spoken
with one voice, he said. Not only the Auto Task Force but
also the Environmental Protection Agency has worked with
materials we''ve provided to them. </p>
<p>Dean Trafalet, legal representative for holders of future
asbestos personal-injury claims, filed a court statement in
support of the extension, saying that due to the latency periods
for asbestos-related diseases, some victims may not be in a
position to assert claims yet. </p>
<p>The investigation of the debtors'' current and future
asbestos-related liabilities is in its infancy, Trafalet said,
noting that his group needed time to investigate all asbestos-
related liabilities. </p>
<p>Unsecured creditors said they supported the extension, and
asked in court documents that the company outline its timeline
to exit Chapter 11 given tens of thousands of unsecured
creditors awaiting a distribution on their claims. </p>
<p>Under GM''s transfer of its assets to new General Motors,
the debtor received 10 percent of stock in the new company and
15 percent of the warrants. Unsecured creditors say they expect
the stock and warrants will be distributed to them. </p>
<p>The case is In re Motors Liquidation Co., 09-50026, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley Saudi Arabia is
seeing growth in its swaps business that lets international
investors buy into the kingdom''s stock market and is looking
closely at exchange-traded funds. </p>
<p>Not only has the volume of trade been growing, but the
client base has been growing as well both in size and
diversification, Habib Achkar, Morgan Stanley''s managing
director and regional manager for the Middle East and north
Africa, said in an interview in Dubai on May 25. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Saudi Arabia was set up three years ago when
it started a joint venture with the Capital Group, a Saudi-based
investment bank. In August 2008, Morgan Stanley began executing
swap transactions on behalf of non-resident foreign investors.
The Persian Gulf''s first exchange-traded fund opened March 25 on
the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. </p>
<p>We can execute ETF trades for Saudi, Gulf Cooperation
Council and international investors, Chairman Fahad Almubarak
said in the joint interview on May 25. At this stage we are
not a market maker, but it is certainly something we are looking
at very closely. </p>
<p>The world''s largest oil supplier is spending $400 billion
over five years, starting from 2008, to strengthen the economy
and help finance infrastructure projects. Saudi banks tightened
lending after Saad Group, the business owned by billionaire Maan al-Sanea, and Ahmad Hamad Al-Gosaibi  Brothers Co. defaulted on
loans last year. April bank claims on the private sector
increased an annual 3.2 percent compared with 2.4 percent in
March, according to central bank data. </p>
<p>Appetite'' for Lending </p>
<p>We are definitely seeing an increase in bank lending,
Almubarak said. There''s appetite and competition to lend to
higher-quality corporates, but the banks have taken a much more
rigorous approach to their lending criteria. </p>
<p>Oil prices are down about 16 percent from a 19-month high
of $87.15 reached on May 3. Futures touched a record $147.27 on
July 11, 2008. </p>
<p>Sabic Capital, a unit of Saudi Basic Industries Corp.,
delayed the sale of a bond because of unfavorable spreads, Saudi
Basic''s Chief Financial Officer Mutlaq Al-Morished said
yesterday. </p>
<p>We are working on a number of bond mandates which we may
see as early as the second half of the year, Almubarak said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the
world''s largest brokerage, cut about 200 jobs as the joint
venture moves closer to full integration, according to a person
with knowledge of the reductions. </p>
<p>The cuts were mostly from product support areas and didn''t
involve brokers, said the person, who declined to be named
because the reductions aren''t public. The brokerage also plans
to hire about 150 private bankers and 35 employees for the
unit''s capital markets operations, the person said. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, who led the unit
before succeeding John Mack in January, said earlier this year
that the joint venture expects to realize $1.1 billion of cost
savings by the end of 2011. The division reported pretax income
of $278 million for the first quarter, compared with $119
million in same period a year earlier, before the deal was
completed. </p>
<p>The brokerage, which has $1.6 trillion in client assets,
was formed last year when Morgan Stanley purchased a controlling
stake in the joint venture with Citigroup Inc.''s Smith Barney. </p>
<p>The joint venture will probably close about 120 additional
U.S. offices to eliminate overlapping locations, Charles Johnston, the unit''s president, said last month. Morgan Stanley
Smith Barney had 18,140 advisers as of March 31, and Johnston
said that figure will likely stay around 18,000. </p>
<p>As we near our one-year anniversary, we are well along in
the integration of the two firms, Morgan Stanley spokesman Jim Wiggins said. </p>
<p>The brokerage''s pretax profit margin was 9 percent in the
first quarter, up from 7 percent in the fourth quarter. Gorman
has said the firm expects to increase that margin to 15 percent
by the end of this year and more than 20 percent by the end of
2011. </p>
<p>Fox Business Network reported the job cuts earlier today. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley more than doubled
Chairman John Mack''s annual base salary to $2 million effective
June 1, according to a regulatory filing by the bank. </p>
<p>Mack''s base salary had been $800,000, and he had opted to
forgo a bonus for the last three years. His salary hadn''t
increased since he rejoined the New York-based firm in 2005 as
chairman and chief executive officer, according to today''s
filing. </p>
<p>Mack, 65, stepped down as CEO at the end of last year,
having led the company through its first quarterly loss in 2007
and the financial crisis in 2008. Mack told shareholders at a
meeting earlier this month that he would resign as chairman if
current CEO James Gorman ever told him he was in the way. </p>
<p>The raise followed the firm''s strategy to move away from
a compensation program focused largely on annual incentive
awards toward one that is balanced between fixed, short-term and
long-term compensation and to be in line with his new role and
responsibilities as executive chairman of the company''s Board of
Directors, Morgan Stanley said in the filing. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano will probably cede the
post next year, raising the possibility of the first female or
first black CEO in the 99-year-old company''s history. </p>
<p>Three of IBM''s last four chief executives have stepped down
at 60, with the exception being John Akers, who was forced out
by IBM''s board before he reached that age. Palmisano, who has
led the company for more than eight years, will hit that mark
next July. IBM''s tradition of CEOs stepping aside at 60 helps
retain top executives, said Val Rahmani, former general manager
of an IBM security software business. </p>
<p>People need to see that there''s the opportunity to
progress, said Rahmani, who left IBM last year and is now CEO
of the Atlanta-based security software firm Damballa Inc. She
said Palmisano will probably retire next year. There''s loads
of speculation going on at the moment. </p>
<p>IBM, the world''s largest computer-services provider, has
brought in a CEO from outside the company only once, when it
named Louis V. Gerstner Jr. to succeed Akers in 1993. The likely
candidates this time are internal, including the senior vice
presidents who oversee sales, hardware, consulting and
technology services. Steve Mills, the well-respected senior vice
president for software, may be unlikely to take over the top
post since he also turns 60 next year. </p>

<p>200 Jobs Cut </p>
<p>Mack said earlier this year that compensation on Wall

<p>Morgan Stanley hired Kazunobu Ezawa,
a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managing director, for its
fixed-income business in Japan, according to an internal company
memo obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Ezawa, 42, this month joined Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities
Co., a joint venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,
to help boost fixed-income sales to listed Japanese companies
and add new clients, the Morgan Stanley memo said. </p>
<p>New York-based Morgan Stanley in April posted earnings that
beat analysts'' estimates as fixed-income trading revenue more
than doubled from a year earlier. The bank follows UBS AG and
other overseas banks in luring executives away from rivals in
Japan after the value of domestic bond transactions in the
country rose 12 percent to 16 trillion yen ($174 billion) last
year. </p>
<p>Natsuo Nishio, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Morgan Stanley,
confirmed the hiring, without commenting further. Ezawa wasn''t
immediately available for comment. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ started two joint
ventures this month for investment banking and trading. Teaming
up with Mitsubishi UFJ, which invested $9 billion in the Wall
Street firm in 2008, may help Morgan Stanley bolster its ranking
in advising on Japanese mergers and securities underwriting. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ ranked second in Japanese domestic bond
underwriting last year and Morgan Stanley ranked eighth,
according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>First-quarter revenue from fixed-income sales and trading
at Morgan Stanley jumped to $2.7 billion last quarter from $1.29
billion a year earlier helping it return to a net income of
$1.78 billion in the period, it said in a statement on April 21. </p>
<p>Ezawa will be a managing director at the bank, according to
the internal memo. </p>
<p>UBS, Switzerland''s biggest bank, earlier this month hired
former Nomura Holdings Inc. executive Zenji Nakamura to run its
fixed income, currencies and commodities unit in Japan. Bank of
America Corp. last month recruited Tomomi Kikuchi from JPMorgan
Chase  Co. to head sales of mortgage-backed securities in Japan.
Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co., a unit of Bank of America,

<p>China''s stocks may meander at
current levels for the next few months on concern that policy
tightening and Europe''s debt crisis will derail global growth,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s Jing Ulrich. </p>
<p>In the near term, we still remain quite cautious on both
A shares and H shares because you still have a lot of
uncertainty in China, Ulrich, chairwoman of China equities and
commodities at JPMorgan, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview, referring to yuan-denominated Chinese stocks and
those traded in Hong Kong. Globally, in Europe, people are
beginning to question the global economic recovery, whether
that''s intact, she said. </p>
<p>The Shanghai Composite Index lost 9.7 percent last month,
the most since August, and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
retreated 5.6 percent as the government raised bank reserve
requirements for a third time this year and Europe stepped up
measures to cut budget deficits. Europe is China''s biggest
export destination, making up 20 percent of total overseas sales. </p>
<p>Chinese manufacturing expanded at a slower pace in May,
data showed today, adding to signs that growth may moderate in
the world''s third-biggest economy. </p>
<p>Real estate closings in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in
May plunged as contract numbers dropped by as much as 70 percent
from April, the Shanghai Securities News reported today, citing
data from a local property website, a property agent and the
government. </p>
<p>Property Curbs </p>
<p>We''re certainly seeing momentum slowing. Back in mid
April, the Chinese government introduced a series of measures to
tighten control of the property sector, Ulrich said. Since
then we''ve seen transaction volumes fall, we''ve seen the stock
market correcting and in the meantime, I think the sentiment is
spilling over to the industrial sector as well. </p>
<p>Stocks will only rally when government policy stabilizes
and uncertainties removed, she said. </p>
<p>In the last two weeks of April, the government raised
mortgage rates and down payment ratios, barred lending for
third-home purchases and ordered tighter scrutiny of developers''
financing to restrain property prices that surged 11.7 percent
in March. </p>
<p>The Purchasing Managers'' Index fell to 53.9 from 55.7 in
April, the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today.
That was less than the median 54.5 estimate in a Bloomberg News
economist survey. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion. A
separate purchasing managers'' index from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics fell to 52.7 in May from 55.2 in April. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. aims to almost double
annual retail sales of licensed merchandise in five to seven
years after buying comic-book and film maker Marvel
Entertainment in December. </p>
<p>Products licensed by Disney may reach $50 billion in sales,
compared with $27 billion in fiscal 2009, Andrew Mooney, head of
the Burbank, California-based company''s consumer-products
division, said today on a webcast presentation. </p>
<p>The company plans to open a redesigned store in New York''s
Times Square this fall as the U.S. continues to recover from the
recession, Mooney said. Disney''s media networks, the biggest
division, contributed 71 percent of operating income last year,
compared with 9 percent from consumer products. </p>
<p>Products tied to Toy Story 3, in theaters June 18, will
sell $2.4 billion in related merchandise, Mooney said. Cars
has averaged $2 billion annually in retail sales of branded
products since its 2006 release. A Cars sequel, due in
theaters next year, may set a record for merchandise sales, he
said. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s biggest media company, climbed $1.41,
or 4.2 percent, to $34.74 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares have gained 7.7 percent this year. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co., the world''s largest
media company, went on trial over claims it cheated the U.K.
creator of the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire game show
through self-dealing. </p>
<p>Celador International Ltd. sued Disney six years ago,
alleging Disney''s Buena Vista Television unit broke an implied
promise by failing to negotiate a higher license fee with
Disney''s ABC television network after the show proved a hit.
Celador says that prevented Buena Vista from making a bigger
profit it would have had to share with the creators. </p>
<p>They agreed that BVT would only be paid enough money to
cover the cost of making the show and BVT would never make a
profit, Roman Silberfeld, a lawyer for Celador, said today
during his opening statement in federal court in Riverside,
California. When they got through making their secret deal,
the ad revenue was shielded, no one could ever get to it. </p>
<p>The quiz show came on the air in the U.S. in 1999 and
helped lift ABC to first place from third in audience ratings in
2000, prompting the network to run the program four times a
week. Millionaire was first broadcast in the U.K. in 1998
and has been carried in 106 countries, including Australia,
India, Japan, Germany and Russia, Celador said. </p>
<p>Share of Profit </p>
<p>Closely held Celador entered into an agreement with Buena
Vista, a production and distribution unit of Disney, and ABC in
1998 that entitled the creators to a share of the profit from
the show in North America, according to a 2006 amended
complaint. Silberfeld said Buena Vista made an implied promise
in the agreement to act in good faith to obtain the highest
possible price for the show. </p>
<p>Instead, Celador said in its lawsuit, ABC paid below-market
value for Millionaire because Buena Vista, at Disney''s
behest, didn''t seek a higher fee after the show became a
success. The creators also claim Disney, using an affiliated
production company, inflated production costs. </p>
<p>The creators seek more than $200 million in damages for the
network run of Millionaire as well as $16 million for
merchandising, Silberfeld said today. </p>
<p>Disney''s lawyer Martin Katz responded in his opening
statement that Buena Vista has shopped the show to other
networks who weren''t interested. </p>
<p>Buena Vista took the financial risk and there was no
secret deal between Buena Vista and ABC, Katz said. The
division of rights between ABC and BTV is just how one would
expect division of rights to be, Katz said. </p>
<p>Celador so far has received $19.2 million in production
fees for the shows, $13 million for the network broadcasts, $6.2
million for syndicated shows, Katz said. </p>
<p>The case is Celador International Ltd. v. Walt Disney Co.,
04-3541, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Riverside.) </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. isn''t considering
delaying sales of its DVDs to video-rental kiosk operator Redbox
as other studios have, Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said. </p>
<p>Iger, speaking at a conference sponsored by Sanford C.
Bernstein today, said Disney hasn''t seen any cannibalization of
new DVD sales from Coinstar Inc.''s Redbox, which rents movies
for $1 a day. </p>
<p>Disney has a higher ratio between box-office and home
entertainment sales than rivals who are delaying titles to
Redbox, Iger said. Redbox agreed to begin carrying discs 28 days
after DVDs from Time Warner Inc.''s Warner Bros. and Universal
Studios go on sale. In return, Redbox receives discounts that
are unacceptable to Disney, Iger said. </p>
<p>We would not have made as much money, Iger said.
Selling them units at a 50 percent reduction in cost, or
whatever the proposition, even for the 28-day window was not an
equation that made sense to us. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s biggest media company, gained $1.09 to
$34.42 at 12:20 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares climbed 3.4 percent this year before today. </p>
<p>Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG LLC in New York,
criticized Iger today in a report for allowing Alice in
Wonderland to be available in Redbox kiosks. </p>
<p>A key thesis behind our buy rating on Disney is the
dramatic improvement we expect in studioentertainmentover the
coming year, Greenfield wrote. Disney should want us to buy,
not rent for $1/day. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s Ian Henderson,
manager of $7 billion in natural-resource assets, sold about a
quarter of his combined Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd.
holdings on concern a proposed Australian tax will curb growth. </p>
<p>I''m sorry to say we''ve reduced our Australian exposure,
Henderson said in a phone interview today. It''s been a wake-up
call frankly. I had not thought that the changes in Australia
would be quite as drastic as they are proposed to be. </p>
<p>Australia last month said it planned to impose a 40 percent
tax on mining company profits from 2012 to raise A$12 billion
($10 billion) in the first two years of the changes. Rio, BHP
and Xstrata Plc are reviewing the viability of some projects in
the country and are pressing for changes to the plan. </p>
<p>It clearly does reduce the attractions of developing new
projects in Australia and indeed investing in Australian-based
mining ventures, Henderson, who has been a fund manager with
JPMorgan since 1991, said from London. It has made people
aware of the potential for these industries to be used as milk
cows by governments. That has altered the risk profile for the
mining industry probably for quite a long time. </p>
<p>Rio, the third-largest mining company, had been Henderson''s
top holding, comprising about 4.5 percent of his funds,
including the Global Natural Resources Fund. The stake in the
company has been reduced by about $100 million, he said. The
fund returned 111 percent in 2009, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>While Henderson cut stakes in companies with Australian
assets shortly after the tax plan was announced, he has raised
holdings of gold miners. Prices of the metal are up 11 percent
this year and reached a record $1,249.40 an ounce on May 14. </p>
<p>Buying Gold </p>
<p>Our gold exposure has gone up over the past couple of
months, Henderson said. </p>
<p>Among the companies likely to be affected by the taxation
plan, Henderson also made a reasonably significant reduction
in his holdings of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. </p>
<p>Fortescue, Australia''s third-largest iron ore exporter, put
about $15 billion of projects on hold because of the plan, the
Perth-based company said May 19. AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., the
world''s third-largest gold producer, will also cut exploration
spending in the country if the tax is approved, Chief Executive
Officer Mark Cutifani said today by phone from Canberra. </p>
<p>Rio, based in London, fell 1.4 percent to 3,107.5 pence by
12:31 p.m. in the city and has dropped 7.9 percent since the
plan was announced on May 2. Melbourne-based BHP declined 1.7
percent and is down 8.9 percent from May 2. </p>
<p>Rio yesterday said it was paying its fair share of
taxes after contributing more than $20 billion in the past
decade. Xstrata Chief Executive Officer Mick Davis said the
proposed levy may prompt companies to cancel investments. </p>
<p>Immovable Feast </p>
<p>Resources are immovable but diversified mining companies
have a choice of countries in which to invest, Davis wrote in
a letter today in the Financial Times. Investments in
Australian resources are at risk of being delayed or
cancelled. Xstrata is based in Zug, Switzerland. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd yesterday vowed to push ahead
with his proposals, which will apply to profits on resource
projects above the long-term bond rate, currently about 6
percent. Australia is the biggest exporter of coal and iron ore. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley Smith Barney fired
George Friedlander, a municipal bond strategist for more than
three decades, as it integrates two formerly separate firms,
according to a person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Friedlander, 62, worked at Citigroup Inc. and its
predecessors for 34 years, publishing weekly analysis of the
U.S. municipal market. He joined the Morgan Stanley unit in
2009. The world''s largest brokerage, with $1.6 trillion in
client assets, was formed last year as a joint venture when
Morgan Stanley bought control of the Smith Barney broker unit of
Citigroup. </p>
<p>Friedlander was among 200 employees let go, mostly from
product support areas, according to a person with knowledge of
the reductions. Friedlander declined to comment, citing a
confidentiality agreement. Jim Wiggins, a Morgan Stanley
spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Friedlander, who provided market and portfolio ideas to
rich investors and institutional clients, was named to
Institutional Investor''s All-American Research Team for 14
years, according to his biography. He was a member of the
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association''s
municipal division executive committee for 29 years. In 1997,
Friedlander received the association''s Chairman''s Contribution
Award, for service to the industry. </p>
<p>Friedlander graduated from the State University of New York
at Stony Brook with a bachelor''s degree in mathematics. He
received a master''s degree in business administration from Pace
University in New York. </p>
<p>The Bond Buyer newspaper reported Friedlander''s firing
earlier today. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp.''s new motion-

<p>Code-named Natal, the device will be an add-on to the Xbox
360, which has shipped 40million units in five years and trails
only Nintendo Co.''s Wii. Natal sits in front of the TV and has
built-in sensors, letting users play games without a controller.
Natal picks up the motion while gamers drive a pretend car or
swing a virtual baseball bat, Bloomberg Businessweek reports in
its June 7 issue. </p>
<p>Reinvigorating Xbox360 sales may help Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft delay having to field a new machine, which would
lose hundreds of millions of dollars for a few years. Xbox sales
have slowed since Sony Corp. cut the price of the PlayStation 3
console last summer. Natal''s technology is another step in
Microsoft''s decade-long push to move beyond PCs and into game
consoles, music players and smartphones. </p>
<p>You''re going to see a bunch of third party games to take
advantage of the Natal technology, says Katherine Egbert, an

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s London unit
was fined a record 33.3 million pounds ($48.6 million) by
Britain''s financial regulator for not properly separating client
money from the firm''s accounts. </p>
<p>An average of $8.6 billion wasn''t properly segregated by
JPMorgan Securities Ltd. in an error that went undetected for
seven years, the Financial Services Authority said in a
statement today. As much as $23 billion of client money held by
the bank''s futures and options business wasn''t put in separate
overnight customer accounts between 2002 and 2009, the FSA said. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which
roiled financial markets worldwide in 2008, forced the FSA to
put financial companies on notice that they must properly
separate client funds. New York-based Lehman''s creditors filed
more than $830 billion of claims and regulators worldwide are
trying to unravel how money moved through its global units. </p>
<p>The FSA has repeatedly emphasized the importance of
ensuring that client money is adequately protected, said
Margaret Cole, the FSA''s enforcement director. This penalty
sends out a strong message to firms of all sizes that they must
ensure client money is segregated in accordance with FSA rules.
Firms need to sit up and take notice of this action -- we have
several more cases in the pipeline. </p>
<p>Had the company gone bankrupt, clients could have lost all
their money because they would have been unsecured creditors
rather than having the right to claim back money from ring-
fenced accounts, according to the regulator. </p>
<p>Reduced Fine </p>
<p>JPMorgan spokesman David Wells declined to comment. The New
York-based bank escaped a 47.6 million-pound fine by cooperating
with the regulator, according to the FSA''s statement. No clients
lost money, and the mistake didn''t affect the bank''s financial
reporting, the FSA said. JPMorgan said in August that it may
have mixed 8.5 billion pounds of clients'' money with its own
funds, and that it hired KPMG LLP to review its accounts. </p>
<p>The breach was regretful, according to an internal memo
by JPMorgan Securities Chief Executive Officer Daniel Pinto and
obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>The settlement involves us paying a fine based on a fixed
formula of 1 percent of the average amount of client money held
by our FO business, Pinto said in the memo. As the FSA
acknowledges, JPMorgan Securities Ltd. is one of the largest
holders of client money in the U.K., and the size of the fine
reflects that. </p>
<p>Patently Inconsistent'' </p>
<p>The error stemmed from the 2000 merger of JPMorgan  Co.
with the Chase Manhattan Corp., according to the FSA''s
investigative report. After the merger the combined treasury
function didn''t recognize client money from the futures and
options business, according to the report. </p>
<p>The regulator said in January that two firms that it didn''t
identify faced a penalty after the FSA started investigations
into how they held client money. Those inquiries were started at
the same time as a London judge ruled that the FSA''s client-
money rules were patently inconsistent and flawed in a case
over the administration of Lehman''s European unit. </p>
<p>The regulator said at the time that it would consult on
changes to parts of its rulebook, specifically over transfer
arrangements and on firms keeping buffers that could top up
client-money accounts. Proposals are scheduled later this year. </p>
<p>The client-money regime was neglected by the FSA prior to
the financial crisis, said Darren Fox, a regulatory lawyer at
Simmons  Simmons advising a hedge fund in the Lehman case. I
wonder whether today''s fine is symptomatic of the FSA''s guilty
conscience in relation to the Lehman client-money failings, for
which the FSA received a fair bit of flak. </p>
<p>Tougher Approach </p>
<p>Today''s fine is nearly twice as much the then-record 17
million-pound fine levied against Royal Dutch Shell Plc in 2004
for market abuse. </p>
<p>The agency has said fines will increase as part of its new
tougher approach following the financial crisis. In some cases,
penalty size will triple. </p>
<p>The U.K.''s coalition government has said it will merge some
of the FSA''s enforcement powers with other prosecutors to form a
white-collar crime agency even in the wake of increased
penalties and criminal cases filed by the FSA. </p>
<p>The FSA may also lose its independence to the Bank of
England and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is
considering scrapping it, the Guardian newspaper reported today,
citing government sources. </p>
<p>It''s good to see they''re doing their job; they''ve got to
crack down on abuses, Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat
lawmaker who is the coalition government''s business secretary,
said of today''s fine in a Bloomberg TV interview. The basic
point, which I know the chancellor is trying to ensure, is that
the Bank of England has proper oversight of systemic risk. How
you do it administratively is not an easy task. </p>
<p>Amid the uncertainty, the FSA enforcement team separately
suffered a defeat today with its first loss of an insider-
trading trial. Two lawyers and a former chief financial officer
were cleared today by a London court in the regulator''s fourth
criminal case of insider dealing to reach jury trial. </p>

<p>Ian Henderson, who manages about $7
billion in natural-resource assets at JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
added to his holdings in gold mining companies in the last two
months as the metal advanced to a record. </p>
<p>Shares of precious-metal and diamond mining companies now
account for 39 percent of holdings, Henderson said in an
interview from London yesterday. His funds reduced holdings in
companies with links to Australia after the government announced
a mining tax, freeing up cash for the gold purchases, he said. </p>
<p>Gold climbed to a record $1,249.40 an ounce on May 14 and
is set for a 10th consecutive annual advance, the longest
winning streak since at least 1920. Fund managers including
George Soros and John Paulson bought bullion as investors sought
to protect themselves from plunging stock markets after the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 and this
year''s sovereign-debt crisis in Europe. </p>
<p>Gold mining stocks are as cheap as they''ve been for a
long time because for the first time in years they are making
proper profits, Henderson said. Gold and precious metals
accounted for 34.1 percent of holdings at the end of April, he
said at a conference in London today. </p>
<p>Barrick Gold Corp., the world''s biggest gold mining
company, is trading at 18.9 times earnings, down from as much as
26.6 times in December, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
Toronto-based company in April reported first-quarter profit
that beat analysts'' estimates. Newmont Mining Corp., the largest
U.S. gold producer, trades at 16.4 times earnings, down from
26.7 times in December. </p>
<p>Strongest Since 1970s'' </p>
<p>Gold in portfolios is the strongest it''s been since the
1970s, Henderson said today. </p>
<p>Henderson''s 1.9 billion-euro ($2.3 billion) Gl obal Natural
Resources fund and 1.95 billion-pound ($2.9 billion) U.K.
Natural Resources own shares in both Barrick and Newmont.
Barrick has climbed 8.1 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange
this year and Newmont is up 18 percent in New York trading. </p>
<p>Henderson also reduced holdings in uranium mining
companies on expectations that supply will continue to outpace
demand, he said. </p>
<p>Uranium was at $40.75 a pound this week, according to
Roswell, Georgia-based Ux Consulting Co. The metal, used in
nuclear reactors, reached a record $136 a pound in 2007. </p>
<p>Investments in energy companies account for about 27
percent of the assets in Henderson''s funds, with about 29
percent in iron ore and industrial metals and the rest in
fertilizers and agriculture. </p>

estimate, Hatzius said. Goldman''s estimate for private sector
hiring held at 150,000. It also forecasts the unemployment rate

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Europe''s
third-biggest insurer, may be interested in buying parts of
American International Group Inc.''s operations in Asia, two
people familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>The Italian insurer would consider an acquisition if AIG
decides to sell units rather than pursue an initial public
offering for AIA Group Ltd., the holding company controlling the
Asian businesses, said the people, who asked not be identified
because the matter is confidential. </p>
<p>Generali, which weighed a bid for AIG''s Chinese business at
the end of 2008, is expanding in emerging markets, including
China and the Middle East, to offset the impact of the worst
recession in more than 30 years in Italy last year. </p>
<p>Generali would have to sell shares to finance a purchase,
Alberto Villa, an analyst at Milan-based brokerage Intermonte
Sim SpA, wrote in a note yesterday. The failure of talks to sell
AIA Group to London-based Prudential Plc may open the interest
of Generali for some activities in case of a break up, he
said. </p>
<p>A Generali spokesman said it''s premature to discuss the
matter given that AIG hasn''t decided how to proceed. The Italian
insurer''s interest in AIG assets was reported by newspaper MF
earlier today. </p>
<p>AIG, which is selling assets to repay its $182.3 billion
U.S. bailout, is revisiting plans for a Hong Kong offering of
AIA Group after the collapse of the Prudential deal. The U.K.
insurer said yesterday it terminated an agreement to buy the AIG
unit for $35.5 billion and cancelled a rights offering linked to
the acquisition. </p>

<p>General Motors Co., the best selling
overseas automaker in China, said sales in the nation rose at
the weakest pace last month since March 2009, as growth slowed
at its SAIC-GM-Wuling Automotive Co. joint venture. </p>
<p>GM and its partners in China sold 196,004 vehicles in May,
an increase of 25.4 percent from a year earlier, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today. Its rate of growth was in
line with the wider passenger-car market, which grew 25 percent
to 885,000 vehicles in May, the China Automotive Technology 
Research Center said on June 1. </p>
<p>Falling stock prices and rising inflation are eroding
wealth in the world''s largest automobile market. Meanwhile,
buyers are becoming cautious after the government introduced
measures to clamp down on a property market bubble, said Yale Zhang, a Shanghai-based director at CSM Asia, an automotive
consulting company. </p>
<p>This is not a single carmaker''s problem, it''s the
market''s problem, Zhang said in a phone interview today.
After record-high sales last year demand growth is getting
weaker each month, he said </p>
<p>Liuzhou-based SAIC-GM-Wuling, which accounts for over half
of GM''s China volume, increased sales by 5.2 percent to 105,395
units in May, GM said. That''s down from an 18.9 percent increase
in April, 42.6 percent in March and a gain of 37.7 percent in
February, according to GM''s website. </p>
<p>$4,000 Mini Vehicles </p>
<p>The partnership, which sells mini vehicles including
Sunshine vans for as little as $4,000 each, is 34 percent-owned
by the U.S. automaker. SAIC Motor Corp., China''s largest
domestic car company, owns 50.1 percent and Liuzhou Wuling
Automotive Co. owns 15.9 percent. </p>
<p>The unit''s relatively low growth is explained by strong
sales in the month a year earlier, CSM Asia''s Zhang said. New
models may help GM may do better than other carmakers this year,
he said. </p>
<p>Sales at Shanghai General Motors Co., a venture with SAIC
Motor, which makes Buicks in China, rose 48.7 percent from a
year earlier to 83,302 units, according to the statement. </p>
<p>The 25 percent growth rate for Chinese passenger car sales
in May compares with April''s 34 percent advance, according to
the automotive center. </p>
<p>GM China President Kevin Wale said last month that while
the country''s car sales growth will slow this year, the
automaker is keeping a forecast to sell than 2 million cars this
year. </p>
<p>Industry Cycle'' </p>
<p>Weaker growth is a natural part of the industry cycle,
Wale said at a conference in Ningbo, a city in the eastern part
of China, on May 16. Underlying demand is very strong. </p>
<p>GM and its partners in the nation sold 1.03 million units
in the first five months of the year, an increase of 53.9
percent from a year earlier, the Detroit-based company said
today. </p>
<p>China, which overtook the U.S. as the world''s biggest auto
market last year, is GM''s largest market. The carmaker aims to
sell 3 million vehicles a year in China by 2015. It plans to
introduce 25 new or updated models in the country by the end of
2011. </p>

<p>Inside an industrial warehouse in
South San Francisco, California, Harrison Dillon, chief
technology officer of startup Solazyme Inc., examines a beaker
filled with a brown paste made of sugar cane waste. While the
smell brings to mind molasses, this goo, called bagasse, won''t
find its way into people-pleasing confections. </p>
<p>Instead, scientists will empty it into 5-gallon metal
flasks of algae and water. The algae will gorge on the treat --
filling themselves with fatty oils as they double in size every
six hours, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its July issue. </p>
<p>Down the hall, past a rainbow of algae strains arrayed in
Petri dishes, Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Wolfson shows off
a gallon-size bottle of slightly viscous liquid. After drying
the algae, wringing out the oil and shipping it to a refinery,
this is the prize: diesel fuel that Wolfson says is chemically
indistinguishable from its petroleum-based equivalent and which
has already powered a Jeep Liberty and a Mercedes Benz sedan. </p>
<p>We''ve produced tens of thousands of gallons, and by the
end of 2010, I hope I can say we''ve produced hundreds of
thousands, Wolfson, 39, says. In the next two years, we
should get the cost down to the $60 to $80-a-barrel range. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is facing a
tough operating environment that could affect earnings,
according to two analysts who released notes to investors today. </p>
<p>Sandler O''Neill  Partners analysts led by Jeff Harte said
Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told them in
a recent meeting that market participants are in a state of
paralysis because of fear and uncertainty regarding economic
challenges in Europe and regulatory changes. </p>
<p>Richard Bove at Rochdale Securities cut his estimates for
Goldman''s earnings and stock price because of the debt crisis in
Europe and because the current business environment is weak,
according to a note he sent investors. Bove cut his estimate for
Goldman Sachs''s 2010 earnings to $17.17 a share from an earlier
estimate of $18.72 and slashed his share price target to $182
from $200. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the bank facing a fraud lawsuit from the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, reported record
earnings in 2009 and its second-best quarter ever in the first
three months of the year. The stock is down $1.09 to $142.95 at
3 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading today and
has dropped 15 percent so far this year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. arranged a
$450 million collateralized loan obligation, according to people
familiar with the transaction, making it the third widely
syndicated transaction of the year. </p>
<p>Last week''s deal marks a reversal for CLO issuance, which
according to Moody''s Investors Service, fell to $26.5 billion in
2009, its lowest level in more than a decade as the credit
crisis and subsequent drop in loan prices made it economically
difficult to arrange new funds. Loan prices on the SP/LSTA US
Leveraged Loan 100 Index ended at 89.07 cents on the dollar
yesterday, gaining 50 percent since Dec. 17, 2008, and helping
lure investors back to these types of investments. </p>
<p>There are still a lot of challenges for the new-issue
market to emerge in a robust form, but it''s certainly the case
that it has begun to thaw a bit, said Vishwanath Tirupattur,
an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. The signs are
positive. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. priced a $525 million CLO overseen by WCAS
Fraser Sullivan Investment Management LLC in March, the first
new issue backed by widely syndicated loans in a year. The bank
also arranged a $325 million loan package last month for Apollo
Management LP, the first deal of the year backed by new-issue
debt. Both deals were increased from initial plans, bringing
total issuance this year to $1.3 billion. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley''s Asia Chairman
Stephen Roach will return to New York from Hong Kong, ending a
three-year stay in the world''s fastest-growing region, to take a
teaching post at Yale University. </p>
<p>Roach, formerly the firm''s chief economist, will remain
with Morgan Stanley and assume the role of non-executive
chairman for Asia from July 1, the New York-based company said
in a statement today. </p>
<p>The 64-year-old economist, who has predicted China will
overtake the U.S. as the dominant economy by 2025, relocated to
Hong Kong in 2007 to lead a push to arrange more takeovers and
stock sales in the region. Roach, who joined Morgan Stanley in
1982, said he wants to rejoin his family after three years
living out of a suitcase in Asia and plans to use the
teaching post to correct misperceptions of China. </p>
<p>I''m not walking away from Morgan Stanley, Roach said in
a telephone interview today. I have a lot of our clients and
will continue to spend as much time with them in the future as I
have in the past. </p>
<p>Roach will travel regularly for Morgan Stanley and stay
connected to clients, governments and regulators in Asia and
other parts of the world, the firm said in today''s statement. </p>
<p>He is also accepting a joint appointment at the Jackson
Institute for Global Affairs and the School of Management,
according to the statement. </p>

<p>Attorney Olivier Metzner says
thousands of Societe Generale SA''s own computer records will
clear his client, Jerome Kerviel, of responsibility for the
bank''s record 4.9 billion-euro ($6 billion) trading loss,
Bloomberg News'' Alan Katz and Heather Smith report. </p>
<p>Riding through Paris in his chauffeur-driven Jaguar XF,
Metzner, 60, chuckles. He suspects that his success in getting
that data -- more than a year after French investigators had
completed their probe without digging into them -- unnerved
prosecutors. </p>
<p>Ah, yes, I irritate the powers that be, said Metzner. </p>
<p>Metzner took over Kerviel''s defense more than a year after
the 33-year-old former trader was blamed for Societe Generale''s
loss. Kerviel goes on trial June 8 for abuse of trust, faking
documents and computer hacking. He faces as many as five years
in jail if found guilty. </p>
<p>The trial pits him against France''s second-biggest bank by
market value. The bank''s former chairman, Daniel Bouton,
described Kerviel as a fraudster and a terrorist the day
he announced the loss on Jan. 24, 2008. </p>
<p>The disclosure came months before Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.''s bankruptcy and the revelation of the Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC Ponzi scheme. It also turned Kerviel
into a local hero, seen by 77 percent of France as a victim of
the system, according to a poll taken two weeks after the loss
was announced. </p>
<p>Metzner has made a career mining case files and legal
technicalities to spring clients from jail and get companies and
executives out of trouble. </p>
<p>While he speaks passionately of defending the underdog,
Metzner''s clients include a lot of big names. About 80 percent
of his practice is corporate. He''s on retainer for Bouygues SA,
France''s second-biggest construction company. And he defended
Houston-based Continental Airlines Inc. against manslaughter
charges after a French investigation concluded debris from a
Continental plane brought down the Concorde supersonic jet in
2000. A verdict in the four-month trial, which ended May 28, is
due in December. </p>
<p>Metzner can grasp things quickly, keep them all in mind,
and distill them, said Carson Seeligson, head of Continental''s
Concorde crash legal team. And he always keeps the bigger
picture in mind. </p>

<p>Wells Fargo Wins Minnesota Verdict on Punitive Damages </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. won a jury decision yesterday rejecting
punitive damages above the $30.1 million awarded to four
Minnesota nonprofits that claimed the bank marketed a risky
securities-lending program it portrayed as safe. </p>
<p>The nonprofits asked the jury to impose at least $100
million in punitive damages in the second phase of the trial
yesterday. Wells Fargo argued that no punitives were warranted
in the case. </p>
<p>A state court jury in St. Paul, Minnesota, found Wells
Fargo liable for breach of fiduciary duty and violations of
Minnesota''s consumer fraud act on June 2. </p>
<p>The Minnesota Workers'' Compensation Reinsurance Association
and three charitable foundations sued in 2008, claiming the bank
failed to disclose the deteriorating value of the investments
until it was too late and blocked them from getting out of the

<p>JPMorgan London Unit Gets Record Fine From U.K.''s FSA </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s London unit was fined a record 33.3
million pounds ($48.8 million) by Britain''s financial regulator
for not properly separating client money from the firm''s
accounts. </p>
<p>An average of $8.6 billion wasn''t properly segregated by
JPMorgan Securities Ltd. in an error that went undetected for
seven years, the Financial Services Authority said in a
statement yesterday. As much as $23 billion of client money held
by the bank''s futures and options business wasn''t put in
separate overnight customer accounts between 2002 and 2009, the
FSA said. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which
roiled financial markets worldwide in 2008, forced the FSA to
put financial companies on notice that they must properly
separate client funds. New York-based Lehman''s creditors filed
more than $830 billion of claims and regulators worldwide are
trying to unravel how money moved through its global units. </p>
<p>The FSA has repeatedly emphasized the importance of
ensuring that client money is adequately protected, said
Margaret Cole, the FSA''s enforcement director. This penalty
sends out a strong message to firms of all sizes that they must
ensure client money is segregated in accordance with FSA rules.
Firms need to sit up and take notice of this action -- we have
several more cases in the pipeline. </p>
<p>Had the company gone bankrupt, clients could have lost all
their money because they would have been unsecured creditors
rather than having the right to claim back money from ring-
fenced accounts, according to the regulator. </p>
<p>JPMorgan spokesman David Wells declined to comment. The New
York-based bank escaped a 47.6 million-pound fine by cooperating
with the regulator, according to the FSA''s statement. No clients
lost money, and the mistake didn''t affect the bank''s financial
reporting, the FSA said. JPMorgan said in August that it may
have mixed 8.5 billion pounds of clients'' money with its own
funds, and that it hired KPMG LLP to review its accounts. </p>

<p>Ex-NeuTec Executive, Two Lawyers Cleared in FSA Case </p>
<p>NeuTec Pharma Ltd.''s former chief financial officer and two
lawyers were cleared of insider-trading charges yesterday by a
London court, handing the U.K. financial regulator its first
defeat in a criminal case. </p>
<p>Andrew King, the former CFO of Novartis AG''s NeuTec unit,
and Michael McFall, a former mergers lawyer at McDermott Will 
Emery LLP were cleared by a London jury. The judge told the jury
to find Andrew Rimmington, another lawyer whose case was halted
last month after his brother was killed, not guilty after they
gave their verdicts on the other two men. </p>
<p>Wallace said she was delighted with the verdict. </p>
<p>We always believed the FSA''s case against him was flawed
but Mr. King has faced a long fight to clear his name and he and
his family have faced years of worry, Wallace, a partner at
Irwin Mitchell LLP in London, said in a statement. Having
worked with them throughout this, we are very pleased that they
can now move on with their lives. </p>
<p>McFall declined to comment outside the courtroom. </p>
<p>Insider dealing cases are challenging to prove, but these
were serious charges and we considered that the evidence
provided a proper basis to put the case before a jury for them
to decide, Margaret Cole, the FSA enforcement director, said
in a statement. Criminal prosecutions are integral to the
FSA''s long-term strategy of delivering credible deterrence and
combating insider dealing. </p>
<p>Prosecutor Michael Bowes said during the trial that the two
lawyers made 39,000 pounds each ($57,000) in June 2006 after
King gave McFall an early warning about Basel, Switzerland-based
Novartis''s plan to purchase NeuTec. McFall gave the information
to Rimmington, Bowes said. </p>

<p>Ladbrokes, Betfair Lose Dutch Betting-Ban EU Appeal </p>
<p>Ladbrokes Plc, owner of more than 2,700 betting shops, and
Betfair Ltd. lost a European Union court challenge to Dutch
rules blocking them from opening their websites to gamblers in
the Netherlands. </p>
<p>This prohibition may, on account of the specific features
associated with the provision of games of chance on the
Internet, be regarded as justified by the objective of combating
fraud and crime, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg
said yesterday in a ruling that applies to the EU''s 27 nations
and can''t be appealed. </p>
<p>Ladbrokes and Betfair have been fighting in Dutch courts
for at least seven years seeking to overcome the government''s
refusal to grant them licenses or allow citizens access to their
services. Dutch courts handling the cases sought guidance from
the EU tribunal on the legality of the policy. </p>
<p>At least 11 cases over challenges to German, Austrian and
Swedish gambling restrictions are pending at the EU court.
Germany and Sweden are among countries which have been
threatened by the European Commission to loosen some of their
restrictions and some recently started to do so. </p>
<p>Ladbrokes said in an e-mailed statement it was
confident that the ruling will lead to a detailed assessment
in the Dutch courts. </p>
<p>The Ladbrokes and Betfair cases have clearly demonstrated
the fragility of the entire Dutch legal framework in relation to
gambling, said John O''Reilly, a managing director at
Ladbrokes. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s ruling once again demonstrates the need for
the commission to take a lead on this issue, so that we can
separate fact from fiction and settle the online gambling debate
once and for all, said Tim Phillips, a Betfair spokesman, in
an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The cases are C-203/08 The Sporting Exchange Ltd, trading
under the name Betfair'' v. Minister for Justice, Stichting de
Nationale Sporttotalisator and Scientific Games Racing; C-258/08
Ladbrokes Betting  Gaming Ltd. and Ladbrokes International Ltd.

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Philip Morris, Reynolds Sue New York for Smoking Ads </p>
<p>U.S. cigarette makers Philip Morris USA and R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. sued New York, alleging the city''s mandated anti-
smoking ads violate their First Amendment rights and are
preempted by federally mandated warnings. </p>
<p>The cigarette makers and Lorillard Tobacco Co. allege in a
complaint filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
that the city''s graphic health-warning signs force them to carry
messages they wouldn''t carry at the point of sale. The signs
show cancerous lungs, a decayed tooth and a brain damaged by
stroke and bear the message Quit Smoking Today. </p>
<p>The companies, joined by state retail associations, seek a
court order to stop New York from enforcing the law. The city
resolution, amended in September, requires that any business
selling tobacco face-to-face to consumers also prominently
display the tobacco health-warning signs. </p>
<p>Through words and imagery, the signs urge consumers not
to purchase plaintiffs'' products, the cigarette makers said.
The mandated signs also restrict plaintiffs'' ability to
communicate about lawful products with their adult customers. </p>
<p>Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman with the city''s Law
Department, said in an e-mailed statement that her office is
reviewing the complaint. </p>
<p>However, while these proposed changes were under
consideration, we carefully considered all of the legal issues,
as well as comments we received from the public, she said.
We are confident that the health code provisions being
challenged will withstand legal scrutiny. </p>
<p>The case is Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. New York City Board of
Health, 10-cv-4392, U.S. District Court (Manhattan). </p>
<p>BanxCorp Sues Dow Jones, New York Times Over Rate Sites </p>
<p>BanxCorp, operator of the BanxQuote website, sued media
companies including News Corp.''s Dow Jones  Co. and New York
Times Co., accusing them of forming a cartel to sell information
on bank interest rates on their websites. </p>
<p>BanxCorp on June 2 added the companies, as well as AOL
Inc., to an antitrust lawsuit filed on May 14 against Tree.com
Inc.''s LendingTree LLC in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. </p>
<p>The companies conspired with BanxQuote competitor Bankrate
Inc. to gain an unfair advantage over the plaintiff by
fixing the prices banks pay to have rates listed on websites,
according to the complaint. BanxCorp, based in Scarsdale, New
York, estimates damages at more than $500 million. </p>
<p>Financial institutions pay to list their interest rates on
websites run by BanxCorp and Bankrate, then consumers use the
sites to find the most competitive rates for financial products
such as certificates of deposit and mortgages. The media
companies republish the data. </p>
<p>The other defendants named are General Electric Co.''s CNBC,
Time Warner Inc.''s Cable News Network, Microsoft Corp.''s and
GE''s MSNBC Interactive News LLC, News Corp.''s Fox News Network
and Move Inc. </p>
<p>Jack Horner, a News Corp. spokesman; Sara Anissipour, an
outside spokeswoman for Microsoft; and Anne Eisele of GE, Alysia
Lew of AOL and Julie Reynolds of Move.com said their companies
had no comment. </p>
<p>We haven''t been served and haven''t seen the complaint,
Diane McNulty, a New York Times spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.
Mona Marimow of LendingTree and Christa Robinson of CNN didn''t
return messages for comment. </p>
<p>BanxCorp also sued Bankrate in federal court in New Jersey.
That suit is pending, BanxCorp Chief Executive Officer Norbert
Mehl said in a telephone interview. </p>

<p>Miami Beach Hotel Developers Enter Not Guilty Pleas </p>
<p>Two Miami Beach hotel developers pleaded not guilty
yesterday to charges of hiding more than $150 million in assets
from the Internal Revenue Service. </p>
<p>Mauricio Cohen Assor, 77, and his son, Leon Cohen Levy, 46,
were indicted May 25 on charges of conspiracy and filing false
tax returns. They face as long as 14 years in prison if
convicted. </p>
<p>The pair is accused of using shell companies such as
American Leisure Resorts Inc. as part of a conspiracy to conceal
their ownership of a $45 million investment portfolio, $55
million in commercial properties in Miami Beach, homes in New
York and Florida, and cars including a Rolls-Royce Phantom, a
Porsche Carrera GT and Ferrari Testarossa. They failed to pay
taxes on their assets, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>The Cohens were arrested April 15 as part of a tax-day
sweep targeting offshore tax evasion. U.S. Magistrate Judge
Lurana Snow in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 20 ordered the
two men held without bail, saying they posed a flight risk. </p>
<p>The Cohens developed high-end hotels under the name
Flatotel International. After selling the New York Flatotel in

<p>Infineon Loses Bid to Dismiss Lawsuit in Canada Court </p>
<p>Infineon Technologies AG and other computer memory
manufacturers lost a bid at Canada''s top court to throw out a
group lawsuit claiming they fixed prices and overcharged
customers between 1999 and 2002. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada yesterday denied the
chipmakers'' request for a hearing, upholding a British Columbia
Court of Appeal ruling that allowed the suit to proceed. </p>
<p>Infineon, Hynix Semiconductor Inc. and Samsung Electronics
Co. were sued in British Columbia after having pleaded guilty in
the U.S. to criminal charges arising from an international
conspiracy to fix prices of dynamic random access memory, or
DRAM, computer chips. The companies weren''t charged in Canada
and haven''t paid any fines to regulators. </p>
<p>Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd., a Richmond, British Columbia,
computer consulting company, sued Infineon, Hynix, Samsung and
Micron Technology Inc. on behalf of all buyers of the memory in
the province, claiming it paid more for the memory chips that it
should have because the companies fixed prices. They seek to
recover damages, including restitution for unjust enrichment and
an order for the companies to give up profits earned. </p>
<p>The companies claimed a group, or class-action, suit was
improper because each customer would have to prove damages
individually. Supreme Court of British Columbia Judge David
Masuhara agreed with the companies and dismissed the suit. He
also ruled Pro-Sys wouldn''t fairly or adequately represent the
interests of the class. </p>
<p>The Court of Appeal overturned the decision, unanimously
saying liability can be determined on a common basis without
resort to individualized inquiries, and a class suit was
preferable. </p>

Ltd., 33522, Supreme Court of Canada (Ottawa). </p>

<p>JJ Misled Pennsylvania on Drug''s Risks, Lawyer Says </p>
<p>A Johnson  Johnson unit misled Pennsylvania officials
about the health risks of its Risperdal anti-psychotic drug and
duped the state into paying $289 million more than it should
have for the medicine, a lawyer said. </p>
<p>Pennsylvania officials wouldn''t have paid a premium for
Risperdal had they known it was no more effective than existing
anti-psychotic drugs and was found to cause diabetes, Fletch
Trammell, a lawyer for the state, told a Philadelphia jury
yesterday. Pennsylvania is seeking to recover $289 million it
paid for Risperdal prescriptions. </p>
<p>There were a dozen anti-psychotics that were just as good
as Risperdal and cost a fraction as much, Trammell said in
opening statements in the trial of the state''s rebate lawsuit
against JJ. </p>
<p>JJ''s lawyer contended in his opening statement that the
drugmaker did nothing wrong in marketing Risperdal to state-
sponsored health-care programs. </p>
<p>There is no merit in the case that the state will
present, Thomas Campion, JJ''s lawyer, told jurors yesterday. </p>
<p>We have always been committed to ethical business
practices and we are fully prepared to defend ourselves against
these claims, Greg Panico, a JJ spokesman, said in a written
statement. </p>

<p>Court News </p>
<p>New Orleans Judge Sells Bonds to Avoid Spill Conflict </p>
<p>A New Orleans federal judge said he sold his investments in
companies tied to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill to avoid any
conflict of interest in presiding over lawsuits involving spill-
damage claims. </p>
<p>So there is no perception of a conflict in these cases,
yesterday I instructed my broker to sell the few Transocean and
Halliburton bonds in my account, U.S. District Judge Carl
Barbier said in an e-mail yesterday. </p>
<p>BP Plc and Transocean Ltd. oil-spill lawsuits may be
combined before a judge from outside the Gulf Coast states,
because judges in the region are withdrawing from cases, citing
conflicts of interest. </p>
<p>Six of 12 active judges assigned to the federal judicial
district based in New Orleans already have removed themselves
from spill-damage lawsuits, according to a court official and
public records. The judges found conflicts tied to oil
investments or personal relationships with lawyers or companies
involved. </p>
<p>Several additional federal judges in districts based in
Lafayette, Louisiana; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida,
have also disqualified themselves from oil-spill cases,
according to public records. </p>
<p>Barbier''s portfolio contained Transocean Sedco Forex notes
and Halliburton Co. debentures, according to financial
disclosure forms posted by Judicial Watch, a self-styled
conservative advocacy group based in Washington. </p>
<p>More than 170 proposed class-action lawsuits, representing
potentially thousands of claims, have been filed in courthouses
from Texas to Florida. BP, the owner of the offshore lease, and
Transocean, the rig owner, are named in virtually all the cases.
Halliburton Energy Services Inc., which provided cementing
services to the well, and Cameron International Corp., which
supplied blowout prevention equipment, are also named in most of
the lawsuits. </p>
<p>The case is In re Oil Spill By the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, U.S. Judicial Panel
on Multidistrict Litigation, MDL-2179, Washington. </p>

<p>Visa Inc., the world''s biggest
payments network, told banks and merchants to use its system to
process international transactions by Chinese holders of cards
co-branded with China UnionPay Data Co. </p>
<p>Visa regularly reminds its global clients and partners of
their obligations to adhere to these rules as well as
enforcement actions for non compliance, Jeremy Griffith, a
Sydney-based spokesman for Visa, said in e-mailed comments today.
This is not a new rule and is not specific to China UnionPay
or any other network. </p>
<p>Foreign banks in China must co-brand with Chinese
operators on credit cards and execute payments through UnionPay,
the country''s largest electronic payment network. Visa said
international transactions must be processed over its network
while UnionPay said in a statement yesterday that the U.S.
company doesn''t have the right to block the use of dual-currency
credit cards abroad. </p>
<p>UnionPay is expanding its global reach, with its cards now
accepted in 90 countries and regions outside China, according to
its website. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in March
the Obama administration is weighing complaints that China is
violating trade rules by shutting out U.S. companies. </p>
<p>Visa continues to be fully committed to working with
China UnionPay to find areas of common interest that will enable
both companies to meet their respective business objectives,
Griffith said. </p>
<p>Possible Penalties </p>
<p>Visa has told banks that use UnionPay''s system to handle
international transactions for co-branded credit cards that it
will start charging penalties from Aug. 1, the Financial Times
said today. </p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company''s rules require that all
international transactions initiated by Visa-branded cards are
processed through its VisaNet system, according to Griffith. </p>
<p>In Hong Kong and Macau, Visa will continue to allow Chinese
holders of dual-currency cards to use either its network or that
of China UnionPay, Visa said in a statement issued through
public relations firm Ketchum. </p>
<p>Kirk told reporters in Brussels on March 26 that the U.S.
hasn''t decided if it will file a complaint at the World Trade
Organization over the rules, which block companies such as Visa
and MasterCard Inc. from processing credit- and debit-card
transactions in China. </p>
<p>The case between the world''s largest and third-biggest
economies adds to disputes ranging from currency policy to
import duties to Web censorship. U.S. trade associations
including the Business Software Alliance in January accused
China of developing policies that favor local companies. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley lowered its forecasts
for Asian currencies, including the South Korean won and the
Indian rupee, as Europe''s debt crisis saps demand for the
region''s exports. </p>
<p>The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
10 most-traded Asian currencies outside of Japan, reached an
eight-month low on May 25 as concern Europe''s funding woes will
slow a recovery wiped more than $4 trillion from the value of
global equities last month. The euro dropped to its lowest level
in four years against the dollar before the Group of 20 nations
gathers today in South Korea to discuss the currency''s decline. </p>
<p>A weak euro and fiscal drag in Euroland will impart
weaker external-demand conditions for Asian currencies ex-
Japan, analysts Stewart Newnham and Yee Wai Chong wrote in a
report dated yesterday. We are mindful that if China slows too,
this would further soften the regional currency outlook. </p>
<p>South Korea''s won will likely strengthen to 1,175 per
dollar by year-end, compared with an earlier forecast of 1,050,
the report said. The currency closed trading at 1,201.80 in
Seoul today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. India''s
rupee may climb to 46 and the Singapore dollar to S$1.39. The
bank''s previous estimates were 43.50 and S$1.32. </p>
<p>The rupee dropped 0.6 percent this week to 46.63 against
the dollar and the Singapore dollar lost 0.2 percent to S$1.40.
The won fell 0.6 percent. </p>
<p>The Asia Dollar Index reached 108.77 on May 25, the lowest
level since Sept. 15. The euro touched $1.2111 on June 1, the
weakest since April 14, 2006. </p>
<p>Tightening Delays </p>
<p>Overseas shipments to Europe range from 9 percent to 27
percent of exports from Asian countries, with India sending 27
percent, China 23 percent and the Philippines 16 percent, the
report said. </p>
<p>Asian currencies may become less attractive to investors as
central banks delay raising interest rates, Morgan Stanley said.
Asia, powered by China''s booming economy, has been leading the
global economic recovery, where countries including Malaysia and
India have increased borrowing costs. </p>
<p>Central banks in Indonesia and the Philippines kept
interest rates at record lows yesterday and Thailand left
borrowing costs unchanged a day earlier, as policy makers judged
the European crisis to be a bigger risk to their economies than
inflation. </p>
<p>China''s economic growth may slow to 9 percent in 2011 from
an estimate of 11 percent in 2010, according to Morgan Stanley''s
report. </p>
<p>Asian currencies ex-Japan may also lose the support from
a monetary tightening bias, Morgan Stanley said. </p>
<p>Developing Asia will expand 8.7 percent in 2011, outpacing
global growth of 4.3 percent, according to estimates from the
International Monetary Fund on April 21. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley plans to double its
private bankers in Asia over the next three years as Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman aims to boost profits from the
global wealth management unit that he''d previously helmed. </p>
<p>The company plans to hire almost 100 bankers in the region
this year, Charles Mak, head of private wealth management for
Asia, said in an interview. It also appointed Nick Chan, an ex-
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who was running New York-based
Morgan Stanley''s Indonesian private bank, to a newly-created
recruiting and staff development role for Mak''s group this year. </p>
<p>This will be our most aggressive expansion in the private
wealth space in Asia, Mak said by telephone from Hong Kong.
This region has the best economic growth, the highest levels
of wealth creation, and many players are coming to this part of
the world, or are expanding. </p>
<p>The bank is competing with rivals including UBS AG,
Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Julius Baer Group Ltd.
to hire financial advisers in a market with an estimated $7.4
trillion of private riches. Growth in the region''s wealth will
outstrip the global average as its economies outperform,
Capgemini SA and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management said in October. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley provides services for the so-called ultra-
high net worth segment in Asia, aiming at clients who have at
least $10 million in wealth. In India and Australia, it also
targets people starting with $1 million or more. </p>
<p>Global Operations </p>
<p>Separately today, Morgan Stanley said its Asia chairman
Stephen Roach will relocate to New York from Hong Kong and
become its non-executive chairman for Asia. The move will take
effect on July 1. </p>
<p>Pretax profit for Morgan Stanley''s global-wealth management
unit more than doubled to $278 million for the first quarter.
The company paid $2.75 billion in cash in June 2009 to create
the world''s largest brokerage by gaining control of Citigroup
Inc.''s Smith Barney and the biggest U.S. team of financial
advisers. </p>
<p>Gorman, who led the brokerage before succeeding John Mack
at the helm of Morgan Stanley in January, said in a letter to
shareholders in April that the joint venture will play an
increasingly important role in our growth and profitability. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Smith Barney President Charles Johnston has
said the venture will look to expand outside the U.S. because
those markets are set to grow faster. The unit employed about
18,140 advisers globally and managed client assets of about $1.6
trillion at the end of the quarter, Morgan Stanley said April 21. </p>
<p>Chan, 39, will relocate to Hong Kong from Singapore next
week. He joined Morgan Stanley in 2006 with three of his five-
member team from Goldman Sachs. He had previously overseen the
private banking business in Indonesia from Singapore for Goldman
Sachs, after starting his career in investment banking with
Smith Barney Asia Inc. in 1994 in Hong Kong. </p>

<p>An experimental pill from Pfizer Inc.
shrank tumors in patients with a rare form of lung cancer that
is caused by a defective gene and occurs mostly in nonsmokers, a
study showed. </p>
<p>The medicine, crizotinib, reduced tumor size in 57 percent
of patients and stopped the progression of the disease in 87
percent of those in a study released today at the meeting of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. Most of the
trial''s participants never smoked or were former smokers. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s drug is the only compound in human testing to
target a defect in a gene called ALK, which can turn deadly when
a piece of it breaks away and fuses with a neighboring gene,
causing cells to grow out of control, said Alice Shaw, a
thoracic cancer specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston. The gene flaw occurs in about 5 percent of lung cancer
patients. If effective in larger studies, the drug could be
available in 2013 and generate annual sales of $800 million,
said Barclays Capital analyst Tony Butler, in a note to clients. </p>
<p>The drug has shown remarkable activity against tumors,
said Shaw, one of the study''s researchers. As a lung cancer
doctor, you just don''t see changes like this in patients. </p>
<p>Crizotinib is among 24 new tumor-fighting medicines that
New York-based Pfizer is developing to help offset the $11
billion in revenue it will start losing next year when generic
copies of its cholesterol pill Lipitor enter the market. </p>
<p>Countering Setbacks </p>
<p>Investor confidence in Pfizer''s ability to replace that
revenue with new medicines has waned following some research
failures this year, said Trevor Polischuk, an analyst with
OrbiMed Advisors LLC in New York. Data on crizotinib and at
least four other experimental drugs that Pfizer will report on
at the cancer meeting may help to restore some of that
confidence, he said. </p>
<p>What ASCO can do is remind people that there is a
pipeline there and opportunity there, Polischuk said in a
telephone interview. </p>
<p>In March, the company said its experimental Alzheimer''s drug
Dimedon, which analysts said could have generated $5 billion in
annual sales, failed to help patients in a late-stage study.
That same month, the company said Sutent, approved for kidney
and stomach cancers, failed in two studies to shrink tumors of
the breast, and its experimental drug figitumumab didn''t help
lung cancer patients. </p>
<p>The results released today on crizotinib are from the
second of three stages of study required to get U.S. regulatory
clearance. More than 100 patients have been treated with the
drug and Pfizer has evaluated 82 patients for a response. The
drug has now advanced into final testing and the company plans
to seek U.S. approval for crizotinib in the first half of 2011,
Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder said. </p>
<p>Cancer Killer </p>
<p>Lung cancer killed 159,000 people in the U.S. last year and
219,000 new cases were diagnosed, according to the National
Cancer Institute. About 85 percent of people with lung cancer
will die within five years of being diagnosed because the
disease usually isn''t caught until its late stages and there are
few effective treatments, according to the American Cancer
Society. About 15 percent of lung cancer cases worldwide occur
in patients with no history of smoking. </p>
<p>The defective gene that crizotinib is designed to thwart
occurs in about 6,000 cancer patients a year in the U.S., said
Shaw. It is believed to be most common in people who have never
smoked and are middle-age, she said. </p>
<p>One such patient, Linnea Duff, an artist who lives in New
Hampshire, was among the first to receive the experimental pill.
At age 45, Duff, who had never smoked, was diagnosed with lung
cancer and given a 15 percent chance of living five years.
Available treatments failed to help her and she was preparing to
die when given her first dose of the drug in September 2008. </p>
<p>Blew Everyone Away'' </p>
<p>A few days later she noticed her cough went away and she
was no longer out of breath. Seven weeks later, a scan showed
that her lung tumor, which had marched through every other
treatment, had disappeared. The results blew everyone away,
she said. </p>
<p>Before this drug, it was definitely the end of my life. I
was seeing a psychiatrist at the hospital to try to deal with
this and try to prepare, Duff recalls. Now I''ve returned to
that state of mind where I think about the future again. I''ve
gotten back into the habit of making plans and in September I''m
going to Sweden with my oldest son. </p>
<p>The early research that led to the development of
crizotinib was started by Sugen Inc., a Redwood City,
California-based biotechnology company that also discovered the
kidney cancer treatment Sutent. Sugen was acquired by Pharmacia
 Upjohn Inc. in 1999 for $650 million and Pfizer acquired
Pharmacia in 2003 for $58 billion. Pfizer researchers in La
Jolla, California then picked up the research and developed the
compound used in today''s study. </p>
<p>Blocking Cell Signals </p>
<p>When Pfizer first started developing crizotinib, they knew
it could block the signals from the defective ALK gene and a
protein called c-MET, and they believed it could help patients
with lymphoma and sarcoma. What they didn''t know was that it
could also be a potential treatment for lung cancer patients.
Then, in August 2007 a study by Japanese researchers found the
defect in a lung cancer patient. </p>
<p>That discovery sent Shaw and her team of researchers
scrambling to find lung cancer patients to add to the study and
four months later they started testing the drug in lung cancer.
Duff was one of those that Shaw initially recruited. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, has been throwing
its weight behind cancer research since 2008 hoping to grab a
larger share of the $53 billion market for cancer drugs. The
company created a division focused on discovering and selling
medicine for cancer in 2008 and spends about a quarter of its $8
billion research budget on cancer research. </p>
<p>Other Research </p>
<p>Pfizer also released data today from a separate study that
found patients taking a lung cancer treatment called PF-299
lived a month longer without their disease worsening than those
taking Roche Holding AG''s Tarceva. The study followed 188
patients for an average of 12 weeks and was part of the second
of three stages of testing required to get FDA approval.
Patients taking Pfizer''s drug were more likely to have diarrhea,
acne or a rash. </p>
<p>On June 7, Pfizer will present data at the cancer meeting
showing that leukemia patients who failed to benefit from or
were unable to tolerate Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG''s
Gleevec responded to its experimental treatment bosutinib. The
drug is being studied in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia
and is now in the final stages of testing. </p>
<p>Pfizer has been trying to take a more targeted approach to
its cancer research by matching its drugs to a specific tumor''s
traits. In the case of crizotinib, Pfizer has partnered with
rival drugmaker Abbott Laboratories, based in Abbott Park,
Illinois, to develop a test to detect which patients have the
gene flaw that the drug targets. </p>
<p>Biological Insights'' </p>
<p>We are trying to bring more focus to drug development
based on genetic and biological insights from the cancer, said
Mace Rothenberg, Pfizer''s vice president of clinical affairs for
cancer. This is what patients will value because the goal will
be to deliver drugs to patients who are most likely to benefit
and patients won''t be exposed to potentially toxic drugs
unnecessarily. </p>
<p>Researchers for the past decade have been trying to figure
out why certain treatments work in some patients and not in
others. For instance, Tarceva from Basel, Switzerland-based
Roche Holding AG and Iressa from London-based AstraZeneca Plc
work best in patients with a certain mutation called EGFR that
occurs in about 10 percent of lung cancer cases. </p>
<p>Ten years ago, no matter what the type of tumor, patients
were all getting chemo, said Mark Kris, a lung cancer
specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New
York. Science now tells us that that isn''t the way it should
be. Just like we are all individuals, cancer is individual too
and we need to treat the cancer in that person. </p>
<p>Not a Cure </p>
<p>Crizotinib isn''t a cure for most patients as tumors are
expected to eventually develop a resistance to the treatment,
said Shaw. After 19 months on the pill, Duff says that her
cancer is now back. She is still taking the drug in hopes it
will slow progression enough for her to be able to get into a
trial for a similar-acting drug. </p>
<p>The side effects from the drug are mild and less than seen
with other cancer therapies, said Rothenberg. The most common
side effects are loss of appetite and in some cases patients''
night vision is distorted, according to the study. </p>
<p>The current treatments for lung cancer include surgery,
chemotherapy, radiation and targeted drug therapies, led by
Roche''s Avastin and Tarceva. </p>

<p>Doctors treating brain cancer have a
limited toolkit. They can cut tumors out with a knife, burn them
with radiation or try to poison them with drugs. </p>
<p>NovoCure Ltd., a closely held Israeli company, has added a
fourth option for hard-to-treat tumors. It''s an array of
electrodes resembling a tight-fitting helmet that bathes the
cancer in a faint electric field, scrambling the inner workings
of the rampaging cells and preventing them from multiplying. </p>
<p>The helmet, powered by a 6-pound battery pack, is designed
to zap deadly glioblastomas, the malignancy that killed U.S.
Senator Ted Kennedy in August 2009. In a study reported today,
it helped patients with recurrent tumors live 7.8 months,
compared with a median 6.1 months for patients given the best
available chemotherapies or Roche AG''s Avastin. </p>
<p>The technology is so different from other treatments, it
was difficult to convince patients and doctors to try it, said
Philip Gutin, primary investigator for the study. This new
data actually shows that it''s effective, said Gutin, the chair
of neurosurgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York. People will ask for this now. </p>
<p>The electric fields resonate at a frequency designed to do
no harm to healthy brain tissue. In the test, the only side
effect was mild scalp irritation, Gutin said. If it continues
to look as good as it does, it will be used in lots of different
treatments. There''s no downside to it. </p>
<p>The study, reported at the American Society of Clinical
Oncology in Chicago, followed 237 very sick patients whose
cancers had returned after prior treatment and whose tumors, on
average, were 4 centimeters (1.57 inches) in diameter. </p>
<p>Topping Chemotherapy </p>
<p>The study was designed to show that patients using the
helmet fared significantly better than those taking chemotherapy
and Avastin. On this basis, it was a failure. That''s because
more than 50 patients either died or dropped out before they
completed the first round of treatment, said Eilon Kirson, head
of NovoCure''s research and development. </p>
<p>When those patients are excluded from both arms of the
analysis, the helmet performed better than other treatments,
Kirson said. Under either analysis, the trial found the helmet
to be at least as good as other approaches, but without the
vomiting, fatigue and infections associated with chemotherapy. </p>

Nest, Kirson emphasized that NovoCure''s technology is new. The
helmet is the first cancer therapy to use alternating polarities
in electric fields as a way to disrupt the cell division process
known as mitosis. </p>
<p>Bad Name </p>
<p>Electricity has gotten a bad name in medicine in the last
century or two, Kirson said in a telephone interview. People
hear electric fields'' and of course they are skeptical. In
order to cross that barrier into biology and medicine, we had to
start at the end. The end is glioblastoma. </p>
<p>NovoCure, based in Haifa, was started by Yoram Palti, a
professor of electrophysiology and biophysics at Technion-Israel
Institute of Technology. Early funding came from Bill Doyle,
founder of investment firm WFD Ventures and now chairman of
NovoCure. Pfizer Inc. and Johnson  Johnson are also investors,
according to a NovoCure statement. </p>
<p>Early prototypes were cumbersome for patients, weighing
about 15 pounds, Kirson said. The current battery pack looks
like a white laptop computer that slips into a shoulder bag, and
the company plans to shrink the device further. </p>
<p>Patients wore NovoCure''s helmet for about 20 hours a day,
shaving their heads twice weekly before reapplying the electrode
patches. The patients were able to conduct most of their usual
routine with the machine and took occasional breaks for athletic
or social events. </p>
<p>A Nice Shower </p>
<p>We have a patient who plays tennis, Kirson said.
Whenever she replaces her electrodes, she goes and plays
tennis for a couple of hours, she has a nice shower, she goes
into the sauna, and when she gets out she''ll put it back on and
keep going. Now NovoCure is testing the helmet simultaneously
with chemotherapy in early cases of glioblastoma with hope that
a combination will enhance the effectiveness of both treatments. </p>
<p>NovoCure is using today''s trial to apply for U.S. marketing
approval, and the company seeks to begin U.S. sales next year,
Kirson said. The helmet is already approved for use in Europe,
though health plans there won''t currently pay the $10,000 to
$15,000 a month it costs to wear it. </p>
<p>NovoCure is testing similar devices for other types of
hard-to-treat cancer. The results of a test in 42 lung cancer
patients will likely be released at the European Society of
Medical Oncology meeting in September, Kirson said. </p>
<p>I must admit that when I first saw this I thought it was
complete and utter trash -- I''m being that honest about it,
Kirson said. It''s such a novel technology, you have to show
that you are the real thing. The real reason I went into this
was because I had worked with Professor Palti, and I believed in
him. I thought he was a brilliant man, and I still do. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Asset Management plans to
raise a 200 million-pound ($290 million) investment trust that
takes all its income from emerging markets, the Financial Times
reported, without saying where it obtained the information. </p>
<p>The fund, to be announced on June 7, is a response to
investor demand for income from outside the U.K., the FT
reported. The trust will pay an initial yield of 4 percent, the
newspaper said. </p>
