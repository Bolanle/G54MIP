&lt;p&gt;Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA dropped
after JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its rating on the stock, saying
Brazilian steel price increases will be limited by foreign
competition as a stronger currency lures imports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian steelmakers will have less flexibility for
passing on rising raw-materials costs to customers because
importers will compete with domestic metals producers, JPMorgan
analysts including Rodolfo De Angele wrote in a note to clients.
The New York-based bank cut CSN, as Brazil&#8217;s third-biggest
steelmaker is known, to &#8220;underweight&#8221; from &#8220;neutral,&#8221; citing
delays in its Casa de Pedra ore expansion and the stock&#8217;s
valuation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSN lost 1.6 percent to 30.75 reais. Gerdau SA, Latin
America&#8217;s largest steelmaker, lost 1.8 percent to 27.95 reais.
The Bovespa stock index slid 0.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain cautious on the extent of margin expansion as
rising imports (in flat steel products) are likely to limit
price increases, especially as the Brazilian real has resumed
its appreciation, thereby increasing the appeal of imports,&#8221; he
wrote. &#8220;The main impact should come from higher coking coal
costs that should add to production costs, but these should be
more than offset by higher steel prices as domestic demand
remains strong, allowing room for margin expansion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s biggest
media company, rose to an almost 10-year high after rivals
reported ad sales rebounded more than analyst estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, owner of ESPN, the ABC broadcast network and Disney
Channel, is benefiting from the same recovery that lifted Viacom
Inc. and Discovery Communications Inc., David Joyce, a Miller
Tabak  Co. analyst in New York, said today in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Comments that advertisers are opening up their wallets
and the upfront negotiations are going to be in TV&#8217;s favor&#8221; are
pushing up media stocks, Joyce said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney climbed 72 cents, or 2 percent, to $37.56 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the highest since
October 2000. The shares have gained 16 percent this year. The
Burbank, California-based company reports earnings on May 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovery Communications, based in Silver Spring, Maryland,
said today advertising revenue climbed 44 percent outside the
U.S. and 9 percent domestically in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philippe Dauman, CEO of New York-based Viacom, said on an
April 29 call that the owner of MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy
Central has seen an &#8220;upswing&#8221; in ad markets and he expects
&#8220;happier&#8221; pre-season ad sales in 2010 compared with 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. should
replace its top executives because they failed to understand the
politics of the financial crisis and mishandled regulators&#8217;
claims of fraud against the firm, according to Richard Bove, an
analyst at Rochdale Securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman is going to have to pay a high price for its
ineptitude,&#8221; Bove wrote in a note to investors yesterday. &#8220;Its
shareholders already have.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lost 21 percent of its value on the New York
Stock Exchange in two weeks after the company was sued on April
16 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which said
the New York-based company misled investors in a mortgage-linked
investment. Federal prosecutors are also investigating the
matter, people familiar with the matter said last week, and
Goldman Sachs executives were grilled by a U.S. Senate panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior management failed to understand that the government
has chosen to make Goldman Sachs &#8220;an example of all of the
evils in the financial system that caused the &#8216;Great
Recession,&#8217;&#8221; Bove wrote. The company behaved defensively and
with technical arguments, rather than proactively by redefining
the debate and talking about the service that Goldman Sachs
provides to the country, according to Bove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It should have understood the size and enormity of the
forces being brought against it,&#8221; Bove wrote. &#8220;It did not.
Thus, its responses were weak and ineffectual.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$1 Billion Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bove wrote that he expects &#8220;high-level executives are
going to have to be removed from their positions both in the
management suite and from the board of directors.&#8221; He also
expects that the firm will pay a fine of at least $1 billion to
settle the SEC&#8217;s suit and will need to replace its legal team
with one that has greater &#8220;Washington know-how.&#8221; Finally, he
expects the firm will develop a new mission statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Bove said he doesn&#8217;t advocate selling Goldman Sachs
stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite its political naivet&#233;, it is still the best
trading company in the world and the world needs to trade,&#8221;
Bove wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares, down 11 percent this year, rose $4.30, or 3
percent, to $149.50 at 4 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., buffeted by
a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
and a 21 percent decline in market value, is in talks to hire
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison LLP to bolster its
legal team, said a person briefed on the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks are likely to lead to an agreement to hire the
firm, said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because the
negotiations are confidential. The intention is to supplement,
not replace, the company&#8217;s current legal advisers including
Sullivan  Cromwell LLP, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which generated a record $13.4 billion
profit last year, is seeking additional legal advice as it faces
issues tied to its sale of mortgage-linked securities that
include the SEC suit and a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing last
week, according to the person. Federal prosecutors are also
investigating the firm&#8217;s activities in the area, people familiar
with the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. Madelaine Miller, a spokeswoman for
Paul Weiss, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s move to hire Paul, Weiss would echo a
similar decision made last year by Bank of America Corp. in
litigation with the SEC in federal court. The bank, based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, hired Paul, Weiss to augment a legal
team led by Cleary Gottlieb Steen  Hamilton LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, AIG, Spitzer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, Weiss has also advised clients including Citigroup
Inc., American International Group Inc., former New York
Governor Eliot Spitzer and former vice presidential aide Lewis
&#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard H. Klapper at Sullivan  Cromwell is among the
partners leading Goldman Sachs&#8217;s defense against the SEC
lawsuit. The firm also received advice ahead of the Senate
hearing from K. Lee Blalack II of O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP, who has
previously worked as the subcommittee&#8217;s chief counsel and staff
director. Gregory Craig, President Barack Obama&#8217;s former White
House counsel, is now the partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher  Flom LLP assigned to advise Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs rose $4.85, or 3.3 percent, to
$150.05 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading as of 1:25
p.m. The stock closed at $184.27 on April 15, the day before the
SEC filed suit, compared with $145.20 on April 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil&#8217;s
state-controlled oil company, fell the most on the Bovespa stock
index on the prospect that the company will open its share sale
to new investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut the stock to &#8220;neutral&#8221; today and
said a traditional stock issue casts doubt on speculation that
the government will invest in the share offering to make up for
any lack in demand from existing shareholders. Petrobras also
said in a filing today it hasn&#8217;t set a value for the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening the sale to new shareholders &#8220;will bring lower
potential for short-term share price appreciation,&#8221; wrote Banco
BTG Pactual SA analyst Gustavo Gattass in a note to clients
today. &#8220;With the capital raise now a book-build based capital
increase, buying at the deal might be the best course of
action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras&#8217; preferred, or non-voting shares, fell 2.9
percent to 31.85 reais, the lowest since Feb. 8. The Rio de
Janeiro-based company&#8217;s common voting shares dropped 3.1 percent
to 35.80 reais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli said in an
interview April 30 the company will do a traditional stock issue
by the end of July if Congress fails to approve the plan,
testing investor demand for Brazilian share sales after five of
seven initial public offerings this year raised less than
originally sought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rally Halted? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras is seeking Congress&#8217;s approval for a plan to swap
new shares for 5 billion barrels of oil reserves at a price
determined by the government. Existing shareholders will be
given &#8220;priority rights&#8221; in the sale, the company said in an
April 30 statement, without giving further details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the relative outperformance that shares have
registered since Feb. 5 could come to a halt after the
announcement that the equity raise will be done through a global
share offering and with less information than originally
intended,&#8221; wrote JPMorgan analysts Sergio Torres and Felipe Dos
Santos in a note to clients. &#8220;We believe the potential campaign
for new investors would open the door for further
underperformance against oil prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras, with a market value of 309 billion reais ($178
billion), expects to spend $200 billion to $220 billion through
2014, more than any other oil producer in the world. Most of the
investment will go into developing Brazil&#8217;s pre-salt area in
deep South Atlantic waters where Petrobras found Tupi, the
Americas&#8217; largest oil discovery since 1976. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the sale &#8220;will depend on our capex plan that
we are going to approve next month,&#8221; Gabrielli said. &#8220;We are
finishing our evaluation of our different projects and the cash
flow that we can generate, and after that we can decide how much
we need in equity issuance,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing non-shareholders to buy into the offering will
likely &#8220;maximize investor participation in the deal,&#8221; wrote
BTG&#8217;s Gattass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. faced a
renewed threat to one of the credit-card industry&#8217;s biggest
revenue sources after Senator Patrick Leahy backed legislation
to help merchants cut the cost of accepting payment cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, will co-sponsor a measure by Senate
majority whip Dick Durbin of Illinois that lets merchants offer
customers discounts for using cash or a particular card brand,
Durbin spokesman Max Gleischman said today. Merchants who accept
cards typically must pay about 2 percent per transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry has escaped previous attempts to curtail so-
called interchange or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, which bring in more than
$40 billion a year. Now the nation&#8217;s biggest card networks and
lenders, including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase 
Co., find themselves pitted against two of the most powerful
senators over the fees, which some lawmakers and retailers have
said are excessive and hurt small businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The motivation behind this is really to put merchants in
a position where they don&#8217;t pay their fair share,&#8221; MasterCard
Chief Executive Officer Robert W. Selander said today after the
Purchase, New York-based company posted a 24 percent rise in
first-quarter net income. &#8220;We think that Congress understands

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, said first-quarter profit rose more than analysts
estimated as products added from the acquisition of Wyeth
overcame costs from the U.S. health overhaul. The shares gained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit excluding certain items was 60 cents a share,
beating the 53 cent average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Net income decreased 26 percent to $2.03 billion, or
25 cents a share, from $2.73 billion, or 40 cents, a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer counts the pneumonia vaccine Prevnar and the
depression pill Effexor among the medicines gained in its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth, completed in October. Products from
Wyeth contributed more than $3 billion to Pfizer&#8217;s sales in the
quarter. The health-care law, enacted in March, cut revenue for
the period by $56 million, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Results came in better than expected, both from slightly
higher sales -- about 1 percent more than we were looking for --
and from cost saves,&#8221; Joel Levington, managing director of
corporate credit for Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in
New York, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer increased 35 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $17.26 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
biggest gain among companies in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. The shares have lost 5.1 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. said owners of Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPad played more than 1.5 million episodes of ABC
television shows since the computer went on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 400,000 copies of the free ABC player have been
downloaded since April 3, Burbank, California-based Disney said
today in an e-mailed statement announcing additional features.
Free shows are sponsored by advertisers. Others are for sale
from the Apple&#8217;s iTunes store, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest media company is seeking new ways to
deliver TV shows as viewers shift to the Internet and video
games for entertainment. Disney was the first to sell
commercial-free TV shows on the iTunes media store and was the
first to provide ad-supported shows at the ABC website. Disney
is also an investor in the Hulu.com video site with News Corp.&#8217;s
Fox and General Electric Co.&#8217;s NBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, based in Cupertino, California, said yesterday
1 million iPad tablet computers were sold in April after the
device&#8217;s release, outpacing the original iPhone. Apple Chief
Executive Officer Steve Jobs is Disney&#8217;s largest individual
shareholder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version of ABC&#8217;s player software released today
supports new iPads with 3G wireless Internet and improves the
rewind and fast-forward functions, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 85 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $36.72 at 1:51

the shares had climbed 16 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple slid $6.88, or 2.6 percent, to $259.47 on the Nasdaq

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s execution
and clearing unit agreed to pay NYSE Euronext and the Securities
and Exchange Commission $450,000 to settle allegations it broke
rules governing short sales on U.S. stocks because of a
bookkeeping error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was censured for violating the SEC&#8217;s
Regulation SHO, which sets rules for handling bearish trades in
equities. The infractions, which are unrelated to the SEC&#8217;s
April 16 mortgage-related fraud suit against the world&#8217;s most
profitable investment bank, involved requirements implemented in
September 2008 to reduce naked short selling, in which firms
sell stock short without intending to borrow the shares required
to complete their obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An emergency SEC rule implemented after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s collapse in September 2008 forced brokers to
close short sales that didn&#8217;t settle by the morning of the
fourth day after the trade. That regulation, called Rule 204T,
also imposed stricter requirements on subsequent short sales
when failures to deliver shares occurred. The rule was made
permanent in July 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP &#8220;initially responded
to the rule by implementing procedures that were inadequate in
that they relied too heavily on individuals to perform manual
tasks and calculations, without sufficient oversight or
verification of accuracy,&#8221; the SEC said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updating a Spreadsheet &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said in its order that New York-based Goldman Sachs
failed to close out positions on Dec. 9, 2008, because an
employee in the firm&#8217;s operations department didn&#8217;t correctly
update a spreadsheet used to calculate market-maker obligations
related to short sales. While the company corrected the mistake
after the market opened that day, two market makers on NYSE Arca
were unable to conduct business in two securities for three
days, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC also said Goldman Sachs failed to close out market-
maker positions on 46 occasions in 38 securities in January
2009. The commission said the failures resulted from the firm&#8217;s
&#8220;error in calculating its potential T+6 obligations,&#8221; referring
to the requirement that certain trades by market makers be
closed out by the morning of the sixth day after the transaction
occurred. These errors were the result of an employee
incorrectly removing a number used in calculations of short-sale
close-out obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Processing Error&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was the result of a manual processing error
following the changes in Rule 204T closeout requirements in
October 2008,&#8221; Goldman Sachs spokesman Ed Canaday said in a
statement. &#8220;There was no financial impact on our clients. We
now have improved, automated processes in place to avoid future
errors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company clears an average of 3 million trades a day,
said Canaday, who added that an automated system began in May
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE said that from around Dec. 9, 2008, to Jan. 22, 2009,
the Goldman Sachs unit failed about 68 times to close out
positions after short sales had failed to settle. Goldman Sachs
also didn&#8217;t notify customers that short sales in particular
stocks had failed to settle on time, the exchange said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs improperly accepted about 385 short-sale
orders from customers over the same time period, NYSE said.
Existing failed positions in specific securities required the
firm to accept only short-sale orders in those stocks when the
shares had been arranged to be borrowed in advance, which it
didn&#8217;t do, NYSE said. The broker also failed to &#8220;reasonably
supervise and implement adequate controls&#8221; to ensure short-sale
rules were met from Sept. 24, 2008, to Jan. 22, 2009, NYSE said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highbridge Capital Management LLC, a
subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s asset management unit,
hired David Frey of Stanfield Capital Partners LLC after that
company sold $5.15 billion of leveraged loans and other credits
to Carlyle Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frey, 43, started at New York-based Highbridge as a
managing director yesterday, according to a statement. Before
joining Stanfield as a portfolio manager in 2004, he oversaw
high-yield bonds and leveraged loans as an analyst at Katonah
Capital and GoldenTree Asset Management LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;David&#8217;s expertise will enhance our existing loan
activities and further strengthen our ability to serve
investors,&#8221; Scott Kapnick, chief executive officer of
Highbridge Principal Strategies, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After earning a master&#8217;s of business administration at
Columbia University in 1993, Frey joined Morgan Stanley. As a
principal in the investment banking unit, he managed new issue
transactions including high-yield, high-risk loans and bonds,
bridge financing, convertible and initial public offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frey is a board vice chairman of the Loan Syndications and
Trading Association, a New York-based trade group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highbridge, founded in 1992, has about $21 billion of
assets under management, according to the statement. The
Principal Strategies unit manages about $4 billion in mezzanine
debt, loans, public credit securities and growth equity, the
firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle, the Washington-based private equity firm, last
week won an auction to buy management contracts on $4.2 billion
of loans, which are packaged inside collateralized debt
obligations, and $950 million of managed accounts containing
similar securities from Stanfield in a bid to capitalize on a
recovery in loan prices and to expand its $13 billion of credit
investments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross
&#8220;believes&#8221; in Goldman Sachs Group Inc., echoing the sentiment
of another billionaire, Warren Buffett. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chairman of New York-based WL Ross  Co. said in an
interview today with Tom Keene on Bloomberg Radio that Buffett&#8217;s
$5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs in 2008 is a vote of
confidence that Ross supports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Warren, as you know, is a large investor in Goldman,&#8221;
Ross said. &#8220;He, being a canny investor, clearly believes in
Goldman, and so do I. I think that Goldman is the best-managed
of the big firms without a doubt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway
Inc., said on May 1 at the company&#8217;s annual meeting in Omaha,
Nebraska, that Goldman Sachs shouldn&#8217;t be blamed for losses
suffered by clients who invested in mortgage bets at the center
of a fraud suit filed by regulators against the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs executives were grilled last week by U.S.
lawmakers who compared the bank&#8217;s mortgage bankers to bookies,
and Senator Carl Levin asked why they sold securities company
employees derided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross said in the Bloomberg Radio interview that complicated
derivatives didn&#8217;t cause the financial crisis that pushed the
U.S. into the worst slump since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You need two sides to the trade in order to have it
occur,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Only one side is going to be right at any
point in time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banking acquisitions will increase, according to Ross,
whose company recently invested $200 million in Troy, Michigan-
based First Michigan Bancorp. He cited Canada, where few banks
dominate a nation &#8220;one-tenth&#8221; the size of the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking &#8216;Consolidation&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have an enormous consolidation of banks in
this country,&#8221; said Ross. &#8220;The U.S. has 8,000 banks, and of
those 8,000 banks, a couple of hundred have already failed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross added to his fortune by buying bankrupt steel, coal
and textile companies and selling them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If former President George W. Bush&#8217;s tax cuts including
reduced dividend rates are allowed to expire this year,
corporations will probably hold on to cash instead of returning
value to shareholders, Ross said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ll see corporations retaining more of the cash,
either for internal growth or for acquisitions,&#8221; Ross said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s employee
morale remains good and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
received a standing ovation from partners at an April 20
earnings call, analyst Brad Hintz told clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the firm, &#8220;employees are pulling together
like a team under pressure,&#8221; Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co., wrote in a note to clients today after a
meeting with five senior executives at Goldman Sachs. &#8220;The
partnership has closed ranks, too, and at Goldman&#8217;s April 20,
2010, managing directors earnings call, Lloyd Blankfein received
a standing ovation from his partners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the New
York-based firm on April 16, and a Senate panel grilled
executives including Blankfein on April 27. Federal prosecutors
also are investigating the firm, people familiar with the matter
said last week. Analyst Richard Bove at Rochdale Securities LLC
said May 2 the firm&#8217;s top executives should be replaced for
mishandling the financial crisis and fraud claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hintz, who rates Goldman Sachs stock &#8220;outperform,&#8221; wrote
his note following an April 30 meeting with Goldman Sachs
President Gary Cohn, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, Co-
Head of Investment Banking David Solomon, as well as Harvey Schwartz and David Heller, two of the co-heads of the securities
division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock Reaction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs stock dropped 21 percent from its close on
April 15, the day before the SEC filed charges, and its close on
April 30, the day after reports that federal prosecutors are
investigating the company. The stock rose $4.30, or 3 percent,
to $149.50 yesterday, and traded at $148.58 at 9:48 a.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Hintz is predicting the
stock will reach $210. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives told Hintz that so far they&#8217;ve seen &#8220;no
degradation&#8221; of their client business, although clients keep
asking &#8220;when is this going to stop,&#8221; Hintz wrote. Hintz added
that the SEC case may continue for &#8220;quite a while&#8221; because the
firm doesn&#8217;t want to admit to a violation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs management confirmed to Hintz that Monday
April 19, the first business day after the SEC case was filed,
was the firm&#8217;s largest day for equity commissions so far this
year, Hintz wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Admittedly, Goldman Sachs has incurred reputation damage
and may suffer client fallout due to this case,&#8221; Hintz wrote.
&#8220;It is arguably difficult for a portfolio manager to buy or own
GS in an ERISA portfolio, a separately managed account or in a
mutual fund due to the current public outrage against the
firm.&#8221; ERISA refers to the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samuel Robinson, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, confirmed that
Blankfein got a standing ovation. Robinson declined to comment
on the rest of Hintz&#8217;s note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Regulations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncertainty of new regulations is the &#8220;greatest
strategic challenge facing Goldman Sachs today,&#8221; Hintz wrote.
Viniar said that the firm is &#8220;war-gaming a bunch of scenarios&#8221;
to prepare for different potential regulatory changes, Hintz
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm estimates that about 75 percent to 80 percent of
derivatives that are currently traded over the counter will move
on to exchanges as the result of new regulation, Hintz said. The
rest are the &#8220;highly profitable, tailored segment&#8221; of the
business that will, under the current version of the Senate
bill, have to be originated outside of the company&#8217;s regulated
bank subsidiary, Hintz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This would force banks to move their fixed income
derivatives books from the bank subsidiary (that is FDIC
protected and has access to the Fed window) to a new separately
capitalized (and lower rated) derivatives subsidiary that would
likely be guaranteed by the bank holding company,&#8221; Hintz wrote.
&#8220;Goldman already operates its OTC fixed-income derivatives book
out of such a subsidiary and would not have to use new capital
to support this subsidiary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is also planning a &#8220;fair amount of hiring&#8221;
in every part of its trading business this year, Hintz wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trustee overseeing the liquidation
of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm is near a &#8220;multibillion-dollar&#8221;
settlement with the estate of Jeffry Picower, the longtime
Madoff investor who drowned in his swimming pool last year, a
bankruptcy judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland said he blocked legal
claims filed by two investors against Picower, finding the
claims threatened to interfere with the near-complete
negotiations between the bankruptcy trustee, Irving Picard, and
the Picower estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trustee has engaged in months of active settlement
negotiations with the Picower defendants and has obtained
information through his investigation subsequent to the filing
of his complaint,&#8221; Lifland said in the opinion. &#8220;The trustee
indicates that he is on the verge of a settlement with the
Picower defendants that promises to achieve a substantial,
multibillion-dollar sum for distribution to Madoff victims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifland&#8217;s opinion yesterday follows a hearing on the matter
last week and the disclosure by a lawyer for Picard on April 30
that the parties were &#8220;on the brink&#8221; of settling. Picard sued
Picower and several related parties in May 2009 to help repay
victims of Madoff&#8217;s multibillion dollar Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can confirm that settlement discussions are going on,&#8221;
said Picower attorney William Zabel of Schulte Roth  Zabel LLP
in New York. &#8220;We hope we&#8217;re getting very close to settlement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty last year and is serving a 150-
year sentence for orchestrating history&#8217;s biggest Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picower, who was 67 at the time, had a heart attack in his
Palm Beach, Florida, swimming pool and drowned Oct. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard claimed in his suit that Picower knew, or should
have known, that Madoff was running a fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Fox, 10-3114, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Kimelman Trading Records Sought by Defense &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was asked by a defense lawyer to
produce trading records of Michael Kimelman, who is accused of
using secret tips in the Zvi Goffer insider-trading case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimelman&#8217;s defense attorney Morris J. Fodeman filed the
request for Kimelman&#8217;s trading records on April 15. A copy of
his subpoena was made public in court files yesterday in
Manhattan federal court. It seeks &#8220;any and all trading
records&#8221; associated with Kimelman&#8217;s account and asks that they
be provided by May 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fodeman said in an interview that the subpoena is a routine
request for documents. Kimelman was a proprietary trader at Quad
Capital and a broker at Lighthouse Financial Group, and his
trades were cleared through Goldman Sachs, Fodeman said. He said
Goldman Sachs hasn&#8217;t objected to the request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimelman was among 14 people, including hedge fund managers
and an ex-employee of Galleon Group, as part of a probe of an
alleged-insider trading scheme. At the center of the case is
Goffer, a former Galleon employee, along with Craig Drimal, who
worked at the Manhattan firm&#8217;s offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 1:10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel Criticizes SocGen Pre-Trial Investigation, JDD Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerome Kerviel, the former Societe Generale SA trader whose
unauthorized positions led to a 4.9 billion-euro ($6.5 billion)
loss, criticized the investigation ahead of his trial in an
interview with Le Journal du Dimanche. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel, facing trial next month on charges including
forgery and posting false trading data, contested some of the
methods of the investigating magistrates, the French weekly
reported May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel is quoted as saying he was twice denied the
opportunity to be present during investigations at his former
workplace and that no independent checks were made to establish
that the Paris-based bank had handed over all relevant
documents. Societe Generale spokeswoman Laura Schalk declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the trading loss incurred when the bank unwound the
positions after Kerviel&#8217;s departure, &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t me who lost the
money,&#8221; he was quoted as saying in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If found guilty, Kerviel, 33, faces a prison sentence of as
many as five years and a 375,000-euro fine in addition to
possible damages. He has admitted to covering up his
unauthorized bets on stock-index futures with fake orders, while
maintaining that there was no crime because the bank knew what
he was doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Says Ex-Employee Told Deutsche Bank Secrets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. sued Gautam Hazarika, a former Singapore-
based director in its global markets unit, accusing him of
handing confidential information to Deutsche Bank AG before
joining the German bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank&#8217;s head of corporate flow sales for Asia,
excluding Japan, denied the allegations and was scheduled
yesterday to ask Singapore&#8217;s High Court to set aside an order
allowing Citigroup to search his apartment, car and home
computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hazarika was in &#8220;flagrant breach&#8221; of his employment
contract and duties to Citigroup by sending e-mails containing
trade secrets to Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered Plc and his
personal account, the New York-based lender said in its Nov. 30
lawsuit. Deutsche Bank isn&#8217;t a defendant in the Citigroup suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s suit comes after Merrill Lynch  Co. sued
Deutsche Bank for allegedly raiding its bankers and
misappropriating trade secrets last year and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc fired its Singapore-based chief currency
trader in May last year for sending e-mails allegedly containing
confidential data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases highlight the intense rivalry among banks for
bankers who can &#8220;bring across a decent book of clients,&#8221; said
Siraj Omar, head of litigation at Premier Law LLC in Singapore,
who isn&#8217;t involved in the suit. &#8220;The idea is to make things as
difficult as possible for the bankers who are leaving, which is
only logical from the banks&#8217; perspective.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s Singapore-based spokesman Adam Rahman declined
to comment, as did Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Mark Bennewith. Hazarika
couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup is represented by Drew  Napier LLC and Tan Rajah
 Cheah is acting for Hazarika. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Citicorp Investment Bank (Singapore) Ltd. v.
Gautam Iswar Hazarika S1008/2009 in the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continental Shareholders Sue to Stop United Merger &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continental Airlines Inc. shareholders filed suit in state
court in Houston to block a proposed merger with United Airlines
Inc., saying the deal is rushed and underpriced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, which names both airlines and Continental&#8217;s
board of directors, says some Continental directors violated
their fiduciary duty to get shareholders a better deal than the
$3 billion stock swap announced yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed acquisition is the result of a hurried and
unfair process that lasted a mere two weeks and offers an unfair
price of only 1.05 shares of UAL common&#8221; for every share of
Continental common stock, Houston lawyer Andrew Edison said in
the complaint. The price represents &#8220;over $1.50 per share less
than where Continental stock traded just two weeks before&#8221; the
deal was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed shareholder class action asks the court to
rescind the United merger and direct Continental&#8217;s board members
to seek a better price for the Houston-based airline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Page v. Continental Airlines Inc., 2010-27738,
in 113th Judicial District of Harris County, Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Asks Appeals Court to Review Bailout-Data Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve Board asked an appeals court to
reconsider a ruling requiring the agency to disclose documents
identifying financial firms that might have collapsed without
the largest U.S. government bailout ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for the Fed yesterday asked the full U.S. Court
of Appeals in New York to reconsider a unanimous ruling by a
three-judge panel. If the court refuses, the Fed can appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision is of exceptional importance,&#8221; the Fed&#8217;s
lawyers wrote in a legal brief. &#8220;The real-world consequence of
the panel&#8217;s decision will be serious, perhaps irreparable harm
to the institutional borrowers whose information will be
revealed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals panel ruled March 19 that the Fed must
release records of the unprecedented $2 trillion U.S. loan
program launched primarily after the 2008 collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. The ruling upheld a decision of a lower-
court judge who in August ordered that the information be
released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed argued in the case, which was launched by Bloomberg
LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, that disclosure of the
documents threatens to stigmatize borrowers and cause them
&#8220;severe and irreparable competitive injury,&#8221; discouraging
banks in distress from seeking help. The appeals court panel
rejected that argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, &#8220;sets forth
no basis for the exemption the board asks us to read into it,&#8221;
U.S. Circuit Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs wrote in the March 19
opinion. &#8220;If the board believes such an exemption would better
serve the national interest, it should ask Congress to amend the
statute.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed argued that it could withhold the information under
an exemption that allows federal agencies to refuse disclosure
of &#8220;trade secrets and commercial or financial information
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Clearing House Association, which processes payments
among banks, joined the case and sided with the Fed. The group
includes ABN Amro Bank NV, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Plc,
Bank of America Corp., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Citigroup
Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
US Bancorp and Wells Fargo  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Bloomberg argued in court that the public has
the right to know basic information about the &#8220;unprecedented
and highly controversial use&#8221; of public money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bloomberg LP v. Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, 09-04083, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit (New York). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays Had Right to Walk Away From Lehman Deal, Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc had &#8220;a right to walk away&#8221; from a 2008 deal
to buy bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s brokerage unit
and would have if certain assets had been left out, the U.K.
bank&#8217;s top in-house lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That was clearly in Barclays&#8217;s mind at that point in
time,&#8221; Jonathan Hughes, Barclays&#8217;s global general counsel, told
a bankruptcy judge in New York yesterday, referring to the
bank&#8217;s discovery during the negotiations that Lehman couldn&#8217;t
deliver all the promised assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hughes testified for a second day in a trial of Lehman&#8217;s
claim that Barclays should pay Lehman as much as $11 billion for
an alleged &#8220;windfall&#8221; it got as result of the purchase of the
brokerage. The deal occurred within days of Lehman&#8217;s September
2008 bankruptcy, the biggest in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan before
Judge James Peck pits the U.K.&#8217;s third-biggest bank against
Lehman, which wants money to pay off creditors and brokerage
customers. The brokerage&#8217;s trustee, James Giddens, seeks $6.7
billion from Barclays to pay brokerage clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disputed assets include $4 billion in margin deposits
that backed part of Lehman&#8217;s exchange-traded derivatives --
assets Hughes said Barclays needed to continue Lehman&#8217;s
derivatives business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the trustee and Lehman&#8217;s creditors have said transfer
of the margin and the other assets weren&#8217;t approved by the
judge, the terms were spelled out in a so-called clarification
letter that was part of the sale documents, Hughes said, when
questioned by Barclays&#8217;s lawyer David Boies of New York-based
Boies Schiller  Flexner LLP. The clarification letter was filed
in court as the deal closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s second witness was James Seery, a New York
lawyer with Sidley Austin LLP who used to head Lehman&#8217;s fixed
income loan business. He said he had recommended to the U.S.
Federal Reserve and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Unit Granted New Hearing on Investor Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court told a lower court to reconsider a
ruling letting a woman sue a Bank of America Corp. unit that
allegedly promised her the equivalent of an 8 percent annual
return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America&#8217;s Trainer Wortham  Co. unit contends that
investor Heide Betz waited too long to press her case, not suing
for years after she learned that her $2.2 million investment was
losing money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices had deferred acting on the appeal until they
decided a Merck  Co. case that raised similar issues. The court
unanimously last week ruled against Merck and said the two-year
window for shareholder suits doesn&#8217;t begin until a &#8220;reasonably
diligent&#8221; investor would have indications of intentional
company wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In letting the Betz case go forward, the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals pointed to evidence she received &#8220;active
assurances from the highest levels of the securities firm that
there was no problem with her account and all would be made
right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-judge panel said a jury should be allowed to
consider whether Betz acted reasonably in relying on those
assurances, rather than filing her suit earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The 9th Circuit has declared itself a haven for hucksters
and procrastinators and has all but converted brokers and
investment advisers into unwilling guarantors of market
performance,&#8221; Trainer Wortham&#8217;s parent company, First Republic
Bank, argued in its appeal, filed in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Trainer Wortham v. Betz, 07-1489, U.S. Supreme
Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express Gets New Hearing on Merchant Class-Action Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court cast doubt on a lower court ruling
that would let merchants collectively claim that American
Express Co. violated federal antitrust laws by forcing retailers
to honor all its cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday told the New York-based 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision, which said
the merchants weren&#8217;t bound by an arbitration agreement
requiring them to press any complaints against American Express
individually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices pointed to an April 27 decision in which they
said companies can&#8217;t be forced to submit to class arbitration
unless they had previously agreed to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York and California merchants contend that American
Express is illegally bundling its products through its &#8220;Honor
All Cards&#8221; policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retailers want to be able to accept the American
Express charge cards, which require cardholders to pay their
balance each month, without having to accept the company&#8217;s newer
credit cards, which don&#8217;t require full payment. The complaint
says the newer cards aren&#8217;t used by the high-end customers
preferred by stores and consequently aren&#8217;t worth the high fees
imposed on merchants by American Express. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express&#8217;s standard agreement with its merchants
calls for all disputes to be resolved through individual
arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court said that clause &#8220;cannot be enforced in
this case because to do so would grant Amex de facto immunity
from antitrust liability by removing the plaintiffs&#8217; only
reasonably feasible means of recovery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is American Express v. Italian Colors Restaurant,
08-1473. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Rejected by U.S. High Court on Celebrex Shareholder Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court refused to halt a class-action
lawsuit that accuses Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Pharmacia unit of misleading
investors by distorting the results of a clinical study on the
painkiller Celebrex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high court yesterday turned away contentions by Pfizer
and Pharmacia that six pension funds waited too long to file
suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices had deferred acting on the Pfizer appeal until
they decided a Merck  Co. case that raised similar issues. The
court last week unanimously ruled against Merck and said the
two-year window for shareholder suits doesn&#8217;t begin until
investors have indications of intentional company wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Celebrex case, company investors say Pharmacia
falsely claimed that its drug had a better safety profile than
other pain relievers. Pharmacia, which Pfizer acquired in 2003,
allegedly manipulated data obtained in a long-term clinical
study of Celebrex&#8217;s effect on the gastrointestinal system,
releasing only a six-month portion of the study in April 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2001, Food and Drug Administration officials
concluded that Pharmacia hadn&#8217;t proved that Celebrex was easier
on the stomach than older drugs, scuttling the company&#8217;s request
to market the drug without the standard gastrointestinal warning
label. The investors say that finding sent the company&#8217;s shares
into a slide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors say they had no reason to suspect intentional
company deception until an August 2001 Washington Post story
showed that Pharmacia had deliberately concealed data from the
study. They filed suit about 18 months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court rejection leaves intact a federal appeals
court ruling letting the suit go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pharmacia v. Alaska Electrical Pension Fund,
08-1315. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Will Pay $27.6 Million to Settle Waste Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. agreed to pay California governments
$27.6 million to settle a lawsuit over accusations that the
company illegally dumped pesticides, paint, aerosols and acids
at its stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis of San Diego County and
the state announced the settlement yesterday in a statement, as
did the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governments claimed Wal-Mart, the world&#8217;s largest
retailer, and its Sam&#8217;s Club stores as well as distribution and
storage facilities violated environmental laws in dumping the
waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s important to note that these incidents happened at
least four years ago,&#8221; Phyllis Harris, Wal-Mart vice president
for environmental compliance, said in an e-mail statement.
&#8220;Since then, we have worked closely with the State of
California on a comprehensive hazardous-waste plan that includes
improved training programs, policies and procedures.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart said the settlement won&#8217;t affect fiscal 2011
first-quarter results.
&#160;    The case is California v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 37-2010-
00089145, California Superior Court (San Diego County). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Said to Be in Talks to Hire Law Firm Paul, Weiss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., buffeted by a fraud lawsuit from
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a 21 percent
decline in market value, is in talks to hire Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison LLP to bolster its legal team, said
a person briefed on the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks are likely to lead to an agreement to hire the
firm, said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because the
negotiations are confidential. The intention is to supplement,
not replace, the company&#8217;s current legal advisers including
Sullivan  Cromwell LLP, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which generated a record $13.4 billion
profit last year, is seeking additional legal advice as it faces
issues tied to its sale of mortgage-linked securities that
include the SEC suit and a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing last
week, according to the person. Federal prosecutors are also
investigating the firm&#8217;s activities in the area, people familiar
with the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. Madelaine Miller, a spokeswoman for
Paul Weiss, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard H. Klapper at Sullivan  Cromwell is among the
partners leading Goldman Sachs&#8217;s defense against the SEC
lawsuit. The firm also received advice ahead of the Senate
hearing from K. Lee Blalack II of O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP, who has
previously worked as the subcommittee&#8217;s chief counsel and staff
director. Gregory Craig, President Barack Obama&#8217;s former White
House counsel, is now the partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher  Flom LLP assigned to advise Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Court News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christie May Be Blocked in Replacing New Jersey Justice Wallace &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey Senate President Stephen Sweeney plans to block
Governor Chris Christie&#8217;s choice of Anne Murray Patterson for
the state Supreme Court, replacing John E. Wallace Jr., the
court&#8217;s only black member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweeney, a Democrat from West Deptford, said yesterday that
he won&#8217;t authorize confirmation hearings on the nomination of
Patterson, 51, a registered Republican. The senate president
controls the chamber&#8217;s agenda, including nomination hearings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallace, 68, is the first sitting justice not to win
reappointment, the court&#8217;s chief justice said. Nominated by
former Governor James McGreevey, a Democrat, Wallace&#8217;s seven-
year term ends May 20. Christie, a former U.S. Attorney, cited
&#8220;differing judicial philosophies&#8221; yesterday in naming
Patterson, a lawyer, to replace Wallace.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s the wrong message,&#8221; Sweeney said, explaining why he
won&#8217;t act on the nomination. &#8220;If I called a hearing, I&#8217;d be
sending the wrong message to all of the justices and judges on
the bench right now that the governor can remove you if you make
the wrong decision,&#8221; he said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christie won&#8217;t withdraw Patterson&#8217;s nomination because of
Sweeney&#8217;s &#8220;reflexive&#8221; threat, said Michael Drewniak, a
spokesman for the governor.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;The court, over the course of three decades, has gotten
out of control and has invaded the executive and legislative
constitutional functions,&#8221; said Christie, a Republican who took
office Jan. 19. &#8220;This is about a different constitutional
philosophy. I believe that New Jersey has suffered mightily
because of some of the decisions of the court,&#8221; he said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a briefing for reporters, the governor declined to
specify exactly which of Wallace&#8217;s decisions he disagreed with
and said he had reviewed them &#8220;extensively.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patterson is a partner with the law firm Riker, Danzig,
Scherer, Hyland  Perretti LLP in Morristown, New Jersey,
specializing in state and federal product-liability and
commercial litigation. She is a registered Republican, Christie
told reporters. His office said she has been a member of the
state Bar Association for 27 years, and was a deputy attorney
general and special assistant to former state Attorney General
Peter N. Perretti Jr. in 1989 and 1990. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Profits from turning petroleum into
chemicals used in shirts, tires and plastics may fall as Exxon
Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Saudi Basic Industries
Corp. add capacity faster than demand increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cracking margins for making ethylene from naphtha may
decline to $150 a metric ton at the end of this year from more
than $400 in the first quarter, according to a survey of four
analysts. Shell opened its new petrochemicals complex in
Singapore today, increasing volume by 800,000 tons for ethylene,
450,000 tons for propylene and 230,000 tons for benzene annually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Petrochemical margins are under pressure and will go down
in the second half of this year,&#8221; said Sriharsha Pappu, an
analyst with HSBC Ltd.&#8217;s private bank in Dubai. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot
of capacity coming up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refiners worldwide postponed expansion projects and idled
plants as the global recession eroded demand and squeezed profit
margins. ConocoPhillips, which pulled out of a proposed Yanbu
joint-venture refinery with Saudi Aramco last month, said in
March it may sell some refinery interests as it plans to reduce
daily processing capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producers in the Middle East, China and Singapore are
adding as much as 26 million tons of chemical cracking capacity
by 2013, boosting global capacity by 13 percent to 144 million
tons from 2008, said Jagdish Meghnani, an analyst with Mumbai-
based Alchemy Share  Stock Brokers. The Middle East accounts
for about half of the new global capacity while China may
contribute about 28 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. apologized after
James Glassman, a senior economist at the bank, said members of
the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations showed
ignorance of market economics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The report is from a single economist and does not
reflect the views of our firm,&#8221; JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman
Jennifer Zuccarelli said in a May 4 statement. &#8220;We disagree
with his characterizations, and we&#8217;re sorry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glassman, according to a copy of his May 3 note on the
Huffington Post&#8217;s website, criticized the &#8220;low level of
economic literacy&#8221; shown as the panel, led by Senator Carl Levin, grilled current and former executives from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. on April 27. The panel examined the bank&#8217;s duty to
clients and the ethics of betting against the housing market
while selling mortgage-linked securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The hearings exposed an unnerving ignorance of
fundamental principles of market economics by folks who have a
hand in remapping rules of finance that will be with us for a
while,&#8221; Glassman wrote, according to the note. &#8220;Now that the
financial reform debate is in the final innings, it&#8217;s time for
the grownups to step in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the note, Glassman discussed the economic troubles
facing the state of Michigan. The note included a graph
depicting the state&#8217;s employment decline since 2000 compared
with that of other states, which was titled &#8220;People who live in
glass houses shouldn&#8217;t throw stones.&#8221; Levin, a Democrat who was
not named in the note, is the senior senator from Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tara Andringa, a spokeswoman for Levin, said the lawmaker
didn&#8217;t plan to issue a statement. Glassman didn&#8217;t return a call
seeking comment after normal business hours. Joe Evangelisti, a
spokesman for JPMorgan, had no further comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate is debating a sweeping rewrite of rules
governing Wall Street, intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008
financial crisis that led the U.S. to extend $700 billion in
taxpayer funds to firms including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.
Several senators said evidence presented at the April 27 hearing
supported the case for Congress to pass the legislation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was late in
notifying the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority that
trader Fabrice Tourre might be sued for fraud by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar
with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t update Finra on Tourre&#8217;s status until
this week, more than two weeks after the SEC filed a lawsuit
against him and the firm for allegedly misleading investors
about a mortgage-linked security, the people said. Under Finra&#8217;s
rules, Goldman Sachs should have updated Tourre&#8217;s file within 30
days of his receiving a so-called Wells notice from the SEC last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penalties for failing to update Finra can include censure,
fines, suspension or expulsion from the brokerage industry. In
2004, Finra&#8217;s predecessor organization, the National Association
of Securities Dealers, fined 29 firms more than $9.2 million for
more than 8,000 late disclosures of reportable information about
their brokers and prohibited two firms, Morgan Stanley and
Wachovia, from registering new brokers for five business days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Tourre are contesting the SEC&#8217;s suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported the lapse on its website
earlier today. Spokesmen for Finra and Goldman Sachs both
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. named Microsoft
Corp.&#8217;s former Windows marketing executive Bill Veghte to lead
its $3.6 billion software division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veghte, who left Microsoft in January, takes over from Tom Hogan, who was tapped last month to oversee sales, marketing and
strategy for Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s enterprise business group, the
company said today. Veghte, 42, starts May 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 20-year Microsoft veteran, Veghte had overseen marketing
for the Windows operating system. He played a key role in
convincing Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer to challenge
Apple Inc.&#8217;s Mac-versus-PC television ads in 2008, as Microsoft
prepared to revive its flagship brand with Windows 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Hewlett-Packard, the world&#8217;s largest maker of personal
computers and printers, Veghte will oversee a business that had
the highest profit margin -- 19 percent -- of any division last
quarter. Hogan, who was hired by CEO Mark Hurd in 2006 to expand
software sales, helped with six software acquisitions that
totaled more than $6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m a software guy,&#8221; Veghte said today in an interview.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time with customers. They&#8217;d like to see H-P
do more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veghte, who lives in Washington state, said he will move to
California, where he will report to Ann Livermore, executive
vice president of the company&#8217;s enterprise business division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, California, rose 29

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. will start selling its
Kin mobile phones online tomorrow with Verizon Wireless, the
biggest U.S. mobile-phone carrier, as the software company tries
to take back ground in the fast-growing smartphone market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kin One will sell for $49.99 after a $100 rebate and a
two-year service contract, the companies said in a statement.
The Kin Two, with a larger screen and higher-resolution camera,
will cost $99.99. Both phones go on sale in stores on May 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is aiming to use the phones to regain momentum
against Google Inc. and Apple Inc. in the smartphone market.
Devices running Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system fell to 7.9
percent of the worldwide smartphone market in the fourth
quarter, down from 12.5 percent a year earlier, according to ABI
Research. Apple&#8217;s iPhone and phones using Google&#8217;s Android
software gained, passing Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kin phones are aimed at young mobile-phone users who
like to stay in touch with social networks. Customers will
listen to music through Microsoft&#8217;s Zune system and must sign up
for a Windows Live account to set up the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stage of life and who these people are, they&#8217;re
exploring, sharing and trying to define themselves,&#8221; said Eric

&lt;p&gt;The company is working on improvements to its Windows Live
products, such as high-definition video chat services that
display social network updates, Brian Hall, general manager for
Microsoft Windows Live, said in an interview last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phones will be available in Germany, Italy, Spain and
the U.K. in the fall from Vodafone Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Attractive&#8217; Pricing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of the Kin phones may help draw customers, said
Michael Gartenberg, a partner at Altimeter Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The pricing of the devices is very attractive,&#8221; said
Gartenberg. &#8220;They&#8217;re competitive with feature phones that do an
awful lot less. The service fee might be much more palatable,
given the initial cost of acquisition is attractive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon is relying on data plan sales to maintain growth as
the market for mobile customers becomes saturated. There are
more than nine wireless devices for every 10 people in the U.S.,
according to the CTIA wireless industry association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, average monthly bills for customers last quarter
were little changed from a year earlier, while data charges grew

&lt;p&gt;The Ontario Securities Commission,
Canada&#8217;s main stock market regulator, is &#8220;aware&#8221; of fraud
allegations against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in the U.S. and
taking undisclosed steps, spokeswoman Wendy Dey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are aware of the matter and taking the steps we feel
are appropriate in the public interest,&#8221; Dey said today in an
e-mail. &#8220;The OSC does not comment on whether it is
investigating a matter or not.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings of $13.4
billion last year, was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for fraud last month. The New York-based bank was
subjected to a Senate subcommittee hearing last week that
questioned its practices in underwriting and selling mortgage-
linked securities. Federal prosecutors are also investigating
the company, people familiar with the situation said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman in New York,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said the federal
government isn&#8217;t probing Goldman Sachs because such
investigations fall under provincial jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would be very surprised if they, particularly the
Ontario Securities Commission, were not engaged on it,&#8221;
Flaherty told reporters May 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority in the U.K. announced
April 20 it would begin a formal investigation of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s London units. Goldman Sachs said it would cooperate with
the U.K probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada is the only Group of Seven country that doesn&#8217;t have
a national watchdog and Flaherty has argued that it deters
foreign investors. Flaherty said the government has almost
completed the legislation creating the national regulator and
will introduce it in Parliament within weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s credit
rating outlook was cut to &#8220;negative&#8221; from &#8220;stable&#8221; by Fitch
Ratings, which said legal actions and regulatory changes could
hurt the firm&#8217;s reputation and ability to earn money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long- and short-term issuer default ratings on New
York-based Goldman Sachs were affirmed at A+ and F+, Fitch said
today in a statement. Fitch said it&#8217;s unlikely that the long-
term rating would be cut below the A category. A+ is the fifth-
highest rating given by Fitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings last year,
was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for
fraud last month and was subjected to a Senate subcommittee
hearing last week that questioned its practices in underwriting
and selling mortgage-linked securities. Federal prosecutors are
also investigating the company, people familiar with the
situation said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rating outlook revision to negative incorporates
recent legal developments and ongoing regulatory challenges that
could adversely impact Goldman&#8217;s reputation and revenue
generating capacity,&#8221; Fitch wrote in today&#8217;s statement. &#8220;For
financial services companies, particularly those dependent on
the capital markets, reputation is critically important.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch also pointed to regulatory changes under
consideration, including higher capital requirements, central
clearing of derivatives, restricted proprietary trading and
investments, that could &#8220;challenge Goldman&#8217;s current business
model.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Absent serious negative legal results, Fitch does not
envision any adverse outcome that would precipitate a downgrade
to Goldman&#8217;s IDR below the &#8216;A&#8217; rating category,&#8221; the statement
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings is one of the three biggest credit rating
companies. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service rates Goldman Sachs at A1
-- the fifth highest rating -- with a negative outlook, while
Standard  Poor&#8217;s rates Goldman Sachs A -- the sixth-highest
level -- with a negative outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs rose 60 cents to $150.05 as of
11:30 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock is down about 18 percent since April 15, the day before
the SEC filed suit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libya plans to ease visa restrictions
for many countries as it seeks to attract tourists and diversify
its economy away from oil, said Saif al-Islam al-Qaddafi, the
son of Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Right now it is very difficult to get a visa,&#8221; Qaddafi
said in an address at the American University in Cairo today.
&#8220;But soon, very, very soon, it will be very easy for many
people around the world to visit Libya.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North African state in March lifted a temporary visa
ban on visitors from 25 European countries that was imposed
during a dispute with Switzerland, sparked by the July 2008
arrest of Qaddafi&#8217;s other son Hannibal on charges he mistreated
two servants. He was released on bail, though Libya detained two
Swiss businessmen. In February, one of the businessmen was
freed, while Max Goeldi of ABB Ltd., the world&#8217;s biggest builder
of power grids, remains in custody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saif al-Islam said that attracting more tourists was a way
to improve the image of his country, tarnished in the 1980s and
1990s by accusations from the U.S. that it sponsored terrorism
and was attempting to develop nuclear weapons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we get millions of tourists to go to Libya they can
see with their own eyes, so they can be good witnesses for you
and for us,&#8221; Saif al-Islam said. Libya has numerous Greek and
Roman ruins at sites such as Leptis Magna and Sabratha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country began to emerge from decades of international
isolation in 2002 when the elder Qaddafi abandoned a nuclear-
arms development effort, pledged to destroy stockpiles of
chemical weapons and renounced terrorism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International oil companies were drawn to Libya after
international sanctions were lifted. The country must now reduce
its dependence on the oil industry, enabling Libya to move from
an &#8220;artificial economy&#8221; to a real one, Saif al-Islam said. Oil
revenue makes up more than 70 percent of gross domestic product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rising number of foreign investors have been attracted to
Libya&#8217;s non-oil industries in recent years. BNP Paribas of
France owns 19 percent of Sahara Bank in Libya and the Arab Bank
of Jordan has a similar stake in Wahda Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six lenders including HSBC Holding PLC and Standard
Chartered PLC were short-listed for two banking licenses in
Libya. The central bank has said that it will announce the
winners in July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Jefferson
County, Alabama, were sued by insurer Syncora Guarantee Inc. in
an attempt to recover more than $400 million tied to billions of
dollars in sewer-bond debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syncora claimed in the lawsuit, filed April 29 in New York
State Supreme Court in Manhattan, that JPMorgan and Jefferson
County fraudulently obtained more than $1 billion in insurance
coverage for the municipal debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jefferson County is absolutely not responsible for what
they are alleging,&#8221; Bettye Fine Collins, president of the
county commission, said at a press briefing yesterday in
Birmingham, Alabama. &#8220;The people that collapsed and caused us
to collapse are suing us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $3 billion sewer bond refinancing that used interest-rate
swaps arranged by JPMorgan in 2002 and 2003 almost bankrupted
Jefferson County. The financing fell apart in 2008 when the
companies guaranteeing the debt, including Syncora, lost their
top credit ratings because of losses on unrelated mortgage-
backed securities. As a result, Jefferson County&#8217;s interest
rates on the sewer debt more than tripled in a month to 10
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the suit, Syncora claims the county and New York-based
JPMorgan purposefully misrepresented and concealed information
about the county&#8217;s finances and bribes that were paid to county
officials to win their business. The $400 million is the amount
Syncora has paid or expects to be asked to pay under the
insurance policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20 criminal convictions and multiple U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions resulted
from corruption tied to the refinancing, according to the
lawsuit. Larry Langford, Birmingham&#8217;s former mayor, was
sentenced in March to 15 years in prison for taking $241,000 in
bribes in exchange for giving sewer-bond and derivatives
business to a friend who was brought into the JPMorgan deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearing is scheduled for May 6 in state court in
Birmingham in a separate suit by Jefferson County against
JPMorgan. The bank has asked the judge to dismiss the case and
the two sides have been in settlement talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment on the Syncora suit. It names the JPMorgan Chase Bank NA
and JPMorgan Securities Inc. units as defendants, as well as the
county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Syncora Guarantee Inc. v. Jefferson County,
601100, New York Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galleon Probers Searched for Bear, Deutsche Bank Names &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators in the Galleon Group LLC insider trading case
searched the computer of a key government witness for the names
of institutional brokers from Bear Stearns Cos. and Deutsche
Bank AG, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission searched the
computer of witness Roomy Khan for the names of Jay Casey and
Jeffrey Turnbaugh, according to a Feb. 5 letter to a Manhattan
federal judge from Khan&#8217;s lawyer, David Wikstrom. Turnbaugh, who
worked at Bear Stearns in San Francisco, said by phone yesterday
that he knew Khan and declined to comment further. Casey, who
works at Deutsche Bank in the same city, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC has performed a comprehensive keyword search of
the hard drives in order to identify computer documents or
computer files of conceivable relevance to the action,&#8221;
Wikstrom wrote in his letter. Among the search terms were the
names of Turnbaugh and Casey, the letter said, without
explaining why the SEC was looking for those names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khan, a former executive at Intel Corp., pleaded guilty in
December to insider trading and is cooperating with prosecutors
in the Galleon insider trading case. Wikstrom didn&#8217;t return a
call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikstrom wrote the letter to U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff
in February objecting to requests by Galleon Group founder Raj
Rajaratnam for full images of Khan&#8217;s computers, saying any
relevant discovery is available from the SEC&#8217;s searches and
anything more would be an invasion of Khan&#8217;s privacy. Rajaratnam
faces civil and criminal insider-trading charges and has denied
wrongdoing. Khan has also been sued by the SEC in a case over
which Rakoff is presiding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesman Ted Meyer of Deutsche Bank, which acquired Bear
Stearns, didn&#8217;t have an immediate comment. A spokesman for
JPMorgan, which has acquired Bear Stearns, didn&#8217;t return a call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Khan, 09-cv-8811, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calpers Suit Against Ratings Services Can Proceed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Fitch
Ratings must face the California Public Employees Retirement
System&#8217;s lawsuit claiming their faulty risk assessments on
structured investment vehicles caused $1 billion in losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state court judge in San Francisco rejected the
companies&#8217; requests to dismiss Calpers&#8217;s claims of negligent
misrepresentation, Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for Calpers, the
largest U.S. pension fund, said yesterday in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Richard Kramer, in an April 30 ruling, tossed out a
claim of negligent interference and said Calpers could renew
that claim later, Pacheco said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calpers sued the three major bond-rating companies for $1
billion in losses it said were caused by &#8220;wildly inaccurate&#8221;
risk assessments. They used methods to analyze medium-term notes
and commercial paper that were &#8220;seriously flawed in conception
and incompetently applied,&#8221; Calpers said in its lawsuit filed
July 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies all gave their highest ratings to Cheyne
Finance Ltd., Stanfield Victoria Funding LLC and Sigma Finance
Inc., prompting Calpers to invest in them in 2006, the fund said
in its complaint. The structured investment vehicles collapsed
in 2007 and 2008, defaulting on payments to Calpers, the pension
fund said. The underlying assets of the three firms, Calpers
said, consisted primarily of risky subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s, SP and Fitch face similar lawsuits by
institutional investors in federal court in Manhattan. The
companies have denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that the judge granted our motion to
dismiss the claim of negligent interference with prospective
economic advantage,&#8221; Frank Briamonte, a spokesman at McGraw-
Hill Cos., the parent company of Standard  Poor&#8217;s, said in an
e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are confident that when the court considers more than
the plaintiff&#8217;s baseless allegations -- which it was required to
accept as true at this preliminary stage of the case -- it will
be apparent that the facts and applicable law do not support the
claim and we will prevail,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Weinfurter, a spokesman at Fitch, said in an e-mail
that the company believes &#8220;the Calpers claim is fully without
merit and we will continue to defend it to the fullest extent.&#8221;
Fitch plans to appeal the judge&#8217;s decision, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Adler, a Moody&#8217;s Corp. spokesman, said in an e-mail
that the company &#8220;continue to believe the case is without
merit, and we are confident that the remaining claim will be
dismissed once the court is presented with the facts in the
case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement Systems
v. Moody&#8217;s Corp., 09-490241, Superior Court of California,

&lt;p&gt;Commerzbank Asks U.K. Judge to Throw Out Dresdner Bonus Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commerzbank AG asked a judge in London yesterday to dismiss
the claims from more than 100 current and former bankers at its
Dresdner Kleinwort unit in the largest bonus dispute in the U.K.
stemming from the financial crisis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and its affect
on the financial markets made it impractical for the bank to pay
what it considered discretionary bonuses, said Jonathan
Sumption, a lawyer for Commerzbank. The bankers say they were
paid a 10th of what they were owed in a contract with Dresdner
Kleinwort before it was acquired by Commerzbank last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allianz SE, the insurer that sold Dresdner Bank to
Commerzbank, had earmarked about 400 million euros ($523
million) for Dresdner bonuses, including retention payments.
Later, Dresdner&#8217;s investment-banking operations posted a 6.3
billion-euro loss for 2008 amid the global financial crisis. The
losses, plus Commerzbank&#8217;s need to tap the German government for
18.2 billion euros of capital, created a material change to the
contracts, Sumption said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was a hope, and no doubt an expectation, but it was
not an obligation,&#8221; Sumption said of the bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commerzbank is asking the court to dismiss the two lawsuits
filed by the workers instead of going to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louise Beeson, a spokeswoman for some of the bankers, said
that the bonuses were retention bonuses, not discretionary
payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our clients argue the decision, by new owner Commerzbank,
to renege on the repeatedly promised payment was a breach of
contract that should be determined at full trial,&#8221; Beeson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is The parties named in Schedule A v. Dresdner
Kleinwort Ltd.  ors, High Court, IHQ/10/0062  IHQ/10/0063 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Qwest Chief Nacchio Will Skip Sentencing Hearing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Qwest Communications International Inc. chief Joseph
Nacchio, serving a six-year prison term for insider trading,
need not attend court hearings on his bid for a shorter
sentence, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Marcia S. Krieger in Denver yesterday
granted his request to skip the hearings next month after he
traveled to her courtroom from his prison in Pennsylvania. The
judge said she wanted to see Nacchio to be assured he
understands his rights and is satisfied with his lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nacchio, 60, said he doesn&#8217;t want to come to the hearings
because he serves as a Catholic minister in prison and teaches
Sunday services that don&#8217;t happen when he isn&#8217;t there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nacchio, bald and wearing a prison uniform, goatee and
moustache, also told the judge that traveling round-trip from
prison to Denver with a government escort requires four to eight
weeks. He said that for eight of the last nine days of travel,
he was kept in solitary confinement. The trips also may force
him to miss prison visits from his family, including his 92-
year-old mother who is ill, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Berkowitz, Nacchio&#8217;s lawyer, was unavailable for
comment and didn&#8217;t return a phone call or e-mail message seeking
comment after yesterday&#8217;s hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nacchio, of Rumson, New Jersey, was convicted in 2007 on
charges he sold $52 million of stock in Denver-based Qwest in
2001 based on inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was sent last year to a federal prison in Minersville,
Pennsylvania. He seeks to have his sentence reduced after
persuading a federal appeals court that the judge who presided
over his 2007 trial incorrectly calculated his gains from stock
sales. The appeals court sent the case back to the district
court to determine a new prison term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Nacchio, 1:05-cr-00545, U.S. District
Court, District of Colorado (Denver). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Got No &#8216;Secret&#8217; Discount on Lehman Deal, Seery Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc took no &#8220;secret&#8221; $5 billion discount on a
portfolio of securities it acquired when it bought bankrupt
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s brokerage, according to a former
executive of the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays could have made or lost money on the securities,
James Seery, a New York lawyer with Sidley Austin LLP who used
to head Lehman&#8217;s fixed income loan business, told a bankruptcy
judge in New York yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These were incredibly volatile markets,&#8221; Seery said,
referring to the days after Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy on Sept. 15,
2008. &#8220;The markets were in free fall.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seery testified for a second day in a trial of Lehman&#8217;s
claim that Barclays should pay Lehman as much as $11 billion for
an alleged &#8220;windfall&#8221; it got on the brokerage, including $5
billion on the securities. The deal closed within days of
Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy, the biggest in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan before
Judge James Peck pits the U.K.&#8217;s third-biggest bank against
Lehman, which wants money to pay off creditors and brokerage
customers. The brokerage&#8217;s trustee, James Giddens, seeks $6.7
billion from Barclays to pay brokerage clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, its creditors and the trustee have said they
weren&#8217;t told at the time about Barclays&#8217;s potential $5 billion
gain on the securities, or other assets it took. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seery indicated they all knew about the disputed sums
before the deal closed. In a phone call with creditors&#8217; advisers
on Sept. 19, 2008, before a court hearing on the sale, he said
they discussed the difference between the $50 billion the
securities were valued at, and the $45 billion that Barclays
paid for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nomos Capital&#8217;s Lowe Wins Bias Case Over Blonde Jokes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomos Capital Partners Ltd. founder Mark Lowe won a sexual
discrimination case brought by a former employee who alleged he
took her to strip clubs and subjected her to insults and blonde
jokes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan Wimmer, who was earning 577,000 pounds ($931,000) a
year as an executive at the fund, sued Lowe and Nomos Capital
for 4 million pounds last year for sexual discrimination. She
testified that Lowe regularly took escorts on business trips and
may have hired a hit man to kill her after she left the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employment court that decided the case said they
trusted the evidence provided by another Nomos executive more
than Wimmer&#8217;s testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Her evidence was exaggerated in relation to the quantity
of jokes,&#8221; Lowe sent her and claims that Lowe brought escorts
to business events were &#8220;wholly unsupported,&#8221; the panel wrote
in a 34-page ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe testified he didn&#8217;t think the jokes he e-mailed to
staff were offensive and denied the other claims. He said Wimmer
&#8220;was always treated in a gentlemanly way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives at Addleshaw Goddard, the firm that
represented Wimmer in the case, didn&#8217;t return a call for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tribunal&#8217;s ruling said Wimmer&#8217;s contact with Lowe in
the 18 months before she left the firm &#8220;was minimal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wimmer v. Nomos Capital, London Central
Employment Tribunal, 2202507/2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Pays $450,000 to Settle NYSE Finding &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s execution and clearing unit
agreed to pay NYSE Euronext and the Securities and Exchange
Commission $450,000 to settle allegations it broke rules
governing short sales on U.S. stocks because of a bookkeeping
error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was censured for violating the SEC&#8217;s
Regulation SHO, which sets rules for handling bearish trades in
equities. The infractions, which are unrelated to the SEC&#8217;s
April 16 mortgage-related fraud suit against the world&#8217;s most
profitable investment bank, involved requirements implemented in
September 2008 to reduce naked short selling, in which firms
sell stock short without intending to borrow the shares required
to complete their obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An emergency SEC rule implemented after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s collapse in September 2008 forced brokers to
close short sales that didn&#8217;t settle by the morning of the
fourth day after the trade. That regulation, called Rule 204T,
also imposed stricter requirements on subsequent short sales
when failures to deliver shares occurred. The rule was made
permanent in July 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP &#8220;initially responded
to the rule by implementing procedures that were inadequate in
that they relied too heavily on individuals to perform manual
tasks and calculations, without sufficient oversight or
verification of accuracy,&#8221; the SEC said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was the result of a manual processing error
following the changes in Rule 204T closeout requirements in
October 2008,&#8221; Goldman Sachs spokesman Ed Canaday said in a
statement. &#8220;There was no financial impact on our clients. We
now have improved, automated processes in place to avoid future
errors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Jersey&#8217;s Top Court May Get Temporary Judge Amid Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Chris Christie&#8217;s decision not to reappoint New
Jersey Supreme Court Justice John Wallace may force the state&#8217;s
highest court to assign a temporary judge to fill a vacancy for
the first time since the 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic Senate President Stephen Sweeney said yesterday
he would block the nomination of Republican attorney Anne Murray
Patterson to replace Wallace, the first sitting member of the
panel to be denied tenure. Neither Wallace nor Patterson can be
seated during any impasse, said Winnie Comfort, a spokeswoman
for the state judiciary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That becomes a vacancy by both the constitution and our
court rules,&#8221; Comfort said in an interview. &#8220;The chief justice
has the authority to make a temporary assignment to fill any
vacancy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice Stuart Rabner may appoint a stand-in from the
ranks of retired Supreme Court justices or from the Appellate
Division of Superior Court, Comfort said. Rabner, who was
nominated to the panel in 2007 by former Democratic Governor Jon
Corzine, said May 3 in a statement he was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; by
Christie&#8217;s announcement he wouldn&#8217;t reappoint Wallace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christie, 47, a Republican who took office Jan. 19, angered
Democratic lawmakers with the move to replace Wallace, a
Democrat whose initial seven-year term ends May 20. Under New
Jersey&#8217;s constitution, a justice who is reappointed after their
first term remains until the court&#8217;s mandatory retirement age of
70. Wallace, the panel&#8217;s only black member, is 68. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christie, the first Republican elected New Jersey governor
since 1997, said he believes the panel has a history of
&#8220;legislating from the bench,&#8221; without naming any of Wallace&#8217;s
decisions with which he disagreed. The governor said he made the
move to begin reshaping the seven-member court, which is
currently made up of four Democrats, two Republicans and an
Independent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patterson, 51, is a partner with the law firm Riker,
Danzig, Scherer, Hyland  Perretti LLP in Morristown, New
Jersey, specializing in state and federal product-liability and
commercial litigation. She is a registered Republican, Christie
told reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweeney, 50, of West Deptford, said yesterday he wouldn&#8217;t
authorize confirmation hearings on the nomination of Patterson.
The senate president controls the chamber&#8217;s agenda, including
nomination hearings. Democrats control the Legislature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj and Microsoft Corp. released
the first software component from their partnership, seeking to
challenge Research In Motion Ltd., the Canadian maker of
BlackBerry handsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Office Communicator Mobile, a component that
shows smartphone users the availability of workplace colleagues
and offers communications with them via e-mail, instant
messaging or voice, is now available in Nokia&#8217;s online Ovi
store, the companies said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia and Microsoft announced last August that they would
integrate their products to combine the reach of the world&#8217;s
biggest handset maker and the world&#8217;s biggest software company.
Both Nokia and Microsoft want to regain momentum in the fast-
growing smartphones market against RIM, Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and
phones using Google Inc.&#8217;s Android software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is about giving companies like RIM, or specifically
RIM, a run for their money,&#8221; Robert Andersson, Nokia&#8217;s executive
vice president for devices, said in an interview in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also working on a re-introduction of its
Windows Mobile software for handsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This evens out the competitive landscape between Windows
Mobile and Nokia, and gives them both equal access to the
Microsoft back-end,&#8221; said Leif-Olof Wallin, a Gothenburg,
Sweden-based analyst for Gartner Inc. &#8220;Microsoft hasn&#8217;t been
pleased with progress on Windows Mobile and it&#8217;s tactical to
line up with the top smartphone maker.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. is finding some
software pirates remain &#8220;one step ahead&#8221; of its efforts to
clamp down on fake or corrupted programs, the company&#8217;s anti-
piracy enforcement chief said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software producer&#8217;s anti-piracy efforts
are hampered by programs that are difficult to distinguish from
genuine products, David Finn, associate general counsel for
anti-piracy, said by phone. That problem may be exacerbated by
the spread of cloud computing, whereby programs are hosted on
the Web rather than on users&#8217; hard drives, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monetary value of unlicensed software worldwide grew by
5 percent to $50.2 billion in 2008, with the most widespread
piracy in countries including Armenia, Bangladesh, and Georgia,
according to data from Interactive Data Corp. and the Business
Software Alliance. Increases in theft are being driven by faster
growth of software in high-piracy emerging markets, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has succeeded in
combating some groups, &#8220;unfortunately some of the other gangs
are one step ahead of us,&#8221; Finn said. &#8220;As they get smarter and
as the ways of avoiding detection get more elaborate, we have to
raise our game.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Microsoft joined software companies including
Symantec Corp. in asking the U.S. government to demand that
China curb software piracy. In 2006, the Chinese government
pledged to ensure that all government computers used only
genuine software, a promise the companies said had not yielded
many results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising popularity of cloud services will &#8220;make our job
tougher&#8221; as more programs are hosted and used exclusively
online, Finn said. Microsoft is competing with rivals including
Google Inc. to offer Internet-based email, word processing and
calendar software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley are among 20 financial companies competing to manage
Coal India Ltd.&#8217;s initial public offering, in what may be the
nation&#8217;s largest first-time stock sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and
Citigroup Inc. are also seeking the mandate, according to a
statement on the department of disinvestment&#8217;s website. Coal
India, the nation&#8217;s state-owned monopoly producer, may raise as
much as 130 billion rupees ($2.9 billion) in July, two
government officials said April 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s second-biggest share sale
arranger, is competing for its first assignment managing a state
offering in India after the government said it will pay higher
fees. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s government aims to raise
$9 billion in the year ending March 31 selling stock in one
company almost every month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This deal is the one to be on if you want to make a
statement in Indian investment banking circles,&#8221; said
Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of equity at SMC Capitals Ltd. in
New Delhi. The amount Coal India aims to raise is &#8220;large and it
is expected to be a historic public issue for India.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal India&#8217;s IPO would surpass Reliance Power Ltd.&#8217;s 115.6
billion rupee offering in January 2008 as India&#8217;s biggest,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensex Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government said in January it may sell shares in 60
companies to shrink its budget deficit, after the key Sensitive
Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange jumped 81 percent in 2009,
the most in 18 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, DSP Merrill Lynch
 Co, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS Securities India Pvt. are
also scheduled to make presentations to the department today and
tomorrow, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enam Securities Pvt., India Infoline Ltd., IDFC Capital
Ltd., JM Financial Ltd., ICICI Securities Ltd., Kotak Mahindra
Capital Co. Ltd., Avendus Capital Pvt., SBI Capital Markets Ltd.
and IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd. are also competing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SJVN Ltd., the operator of India&#8217;s largest hydropower plant,
was the first IPO this fiscal year for the government. SJVN&#8217;s
sale was nine times oversubscribed in the institutional part and
three times in the retail portion, bringing &#8220;life back to
public sector issuances,&#8221; Thunuguntla said. It closed May 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government plans to appoint as many as six book-running
lead managers for Coal India&#8217;s IPO, it said in the release. Iron
ore miner NMDC Ltd., which raised 99.6 billion rupees in the
largest state share sale in 2010 so far, had six book runners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s fraud lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may
change the way Wall Street deals with some institutions and
governments, according to Dino Kos at Portales Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under current rules, institutional investors ranging from
hedge funds to municipal treasurers are all lumped into a
category of &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; investors that get a minimal duty
of care from Wall Street because they&#8217;re expected to know what&#8217;s
best for them, Kos explained in a May 5 note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One real possibility is that the SEC redefines
&#8216;sophisticated,&#8217;&#8221; wrote Kos, former head of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York&#8217;s open market operations. &#8220;Any change would
reclassify some clients and presumably increase the level of
duty dealers have to such clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, alleging that the
company and one of its employees, Fabrice Tourre, misled
investors in a collateralized debt obligation.  Goldman didn&#8217;t
inform them that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
derivatives underlying the securities and planned to bet against
the deal, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the arguments made by Goldman Sachs and Tourre in
contesting the SEC&#8217;s claims is that both ACA Management LLC,
which acted as collateral manager and invested in the deal, and
IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, an investor in the deal, were
sophisticated investors who had experience in the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the company&#8217;s executives have said they plan to
review business practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Potential Risks&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When we help clients structure transactions, we need to
be even more focused on ensuring that they understand the
potential risks and the potential consequences of subsequent
events,&#8221; Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman, said earlier
this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the SEC agrees to settle the suit with Goldman, it may
request changes to how the firm manages &#8220;conflicts&#8221; and expand
the situations in which the firm owes a fiduciary duty to
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs will resist and will try to minimize those
instances,&#8221; Kos wrote. An expansion of the fiduciary duty
requirement &#8220;would broaden transparency, narrow spreads and
lower revenue in these businesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. may be
undervalued as U.S. Senate Democrats struggle to muster votes
for legislation to help merchants cut credit-card fees, Morgan
Stanley analyst Adam Frisch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The severity of the language in the proposed amendments,
in their current form, increases the potential for a 60-vote
approval requirement,&#8221; Frisch wrote today in a note to clients
before the companies&#8217; shares fell the most since October 2008.
&#8220;We would be buyers on weakness.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three proposals by Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of
Illinois could threaten more than $40 billion a year in
interchange or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees collected by card-issuing banks
including Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. MasterCard and
San Francisco-based Visa set the rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and Purchase, New York-based MasterCard fell yesterday
and today after Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, backed an amendment to the
financial industry overhaul bill that would let merchants offer
discounts for cash or a particular card brand, and allow
retailers to set maximum or minimum transaction amounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard fell 3.2 percent to $230.30 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares tumbled as
much as 11 percent today when the Dow Jones Industrial Average
plunged the most since 1987, before paring losses. Visa declined
4.1 percent to $82.92 after dropping as much as 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard also declined as the euro slumped against the
dollar. Europe is MasterCard&#8217;s biggest market outside the U.S.
and the firm may face more competition there as banks plan to
create a rival payments network. Visa doesn&#8217;t process European
card transactions as that role is filled by London-based Visa
Europe Ltd., a separate company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past week, Visa Inc. and MasterCard said net income
surged in the quarter ended March 31 amid a rebound in card
spending and as more consumers worldwide switch from cash and
checks to plastic. Net income at MasterCard climbed 24 percent
to $455 million, while Visa&#8217;s increased 33 percent to $713
million. Both companies&#8217; results exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has been very little, if anything, in Visa&#8217;s and
MasterCard&#8217;s results to justify the selloff,&#8221; Frisch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other amendments from Durbin would limit the amount
payment networks can charge for debit-card transactions and
mandate that the government receive the lowest interchange
rates, which average about 2 percent per transaction. Durbin has
said the U.S. is &#8220;a major user&#8221; of credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letter to Senators &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There should be a fee associated with the use of credit
cards, but it has reached a point now of unreasonableness,&#8221;
Durbin said yesterday during debate on the overhaul bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchants including convenience-store chain 7-Eleven Inc.
have complained to Congress that they are powerless to bargain
with Visa and MasterCard, calling them a duopoly. Finance-
industry groups including the Electronic Payments Coalition and
the American Bankers Association oppose Durbin&#8217;s proposals,
saying the measures would harm consumers, small businesses and
the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Such amendments amount to express government price
setting of business-to-business transactions and would hurt the
ability of local banks to serve their communities,&#8221; the Bankers
Association said today in a letter to senators. &#8220;These
amendments would harm consumers by driving up the cost of credit
and by limiting the benefits consumers have come to expect.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some state governments have crafted their own rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vermont&#8217;s senate unanimously approved a bill May 4 to let
merchants decline credit cards for purchases under $10 and offer
discounts for cash or other card brands. Republican Governor Jim Douglas hasn&#8217;t decided whether to veto the legislation, said his
spokesman, David Coriell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He does have some concerns,&#8221; Coriell said yesterday.
&#8220;You certainly don&#8217;t want to discourage people in any way from
coming to the Green Mountains and going on a ski vacation
because we&#8217;ve passed some regulation that makes it harder for
them to spend their money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta, the Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. director who is being investigated by U.S. authorities over
his links to Galleon Group LLC founder Raj Rajaratnam, had a
long-standing business relationship with the billionaire hedge
fund manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviews, public records, lawsuits and regulatory filings
show a 13-year history of co-investing and other business
collaborations between Gupta, 61, the former worldwide head of
consulting firm McKinsey  Co., and Rajaratnam, 52, the central
figure in the Galleon insider trading probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam has a stake in a fund managed by New Silk Route
NSR Partners LLC, founded by Gupta and three others in 2006 to
invest in South Asian companies, according to a New Silk Route
spokeswoman. The fund owns stakes in at least 11 Indian
companies, including cell phone tower operator Reliance Infratel
Ltd. and the Cafe Coffee Day chain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Rajaratnam has had a well-known relationship with Mr.
Gupta for many years, and it is one that he is both proud and
fond of,&#8221; Rajaratnam&#8217;s spokesman, Jim McCarthy, said yesterday
in a statement. &#8220;Their association as investors has led to many
successful ventures around the world and made a large and
positive impact for a long list of worthy businesses and

those efforts with integrity and diligent attention to sound,
ethical practices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Moore and Dawn Kopecki" date="May 06, 2010  1:51 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-06/jpmorgan-top-economist-glassman-says-he-was-stupid-to-criticize-senators.html"><headline>JPMorgan Top Economist Glassman Says He Was `Stupid' to Criticize Senators</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;James Glassman, a senior economist at
JPMorgan Chase  Co., said it was a mistake for him to call
members of a Senate panel ignorant and to call for &#8220;grownups to
step in&#8221; to the financial reform debate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a stupid thing to do,&#8221; Glassman said today in an
interview after the New York-based bank apologized for his
remarks yesterday. &#8220;I fell into the same trap of getting
emotional about these issues, when what I meant by saying &#8216;the
grownups need to step in&#8217; was that we all need to cool down and
find some common ground.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glassman, in a May 3 note to clients, criticized the &#8220;low
level of economic literacy&#8221; shown as the Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations, led by Senator Carl Levin, grilled current
and former executives from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on April 27.
The Senate is debating legislation aimed at restructuring
financial-system oversight to head off a future crisis,
including regulation of derivatives that could eliminate
billions of dollars of revenue from Wall Street firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are political pressures on the bank that limit what
it can say about Congress,&#8221; said Richard Bove, a bank analyst
with Rochdale Securities who left Ladenburg Thalmann Financial
Services Inc. last year after a disagreement over settling a
defamation lawsuit against him. &#8220;There are significant
limitations on the freedom given to analysts to express their
opinions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOP Amendment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans filed an amendment today to remove language
from the bill that would require banks such as JPMorgan to wall
off their swaps-trading operations. Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon told analysts last month that the bill would cost
the firm anywhere from &#8220;several hundred million to a couple
billion dollars.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama&#8217;s senior adviser, David Axelrod, and
National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers met with
Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Dimon, and about 13 other
executives on April 6 in Washington and pressed them to stop
lobbying against the financial reform bill, people who attended
the meeting said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli said in a May 4
statement that Glassman&#8217;s report &#8220;is from a single economist
and does not reflect the views of our firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We disagree with his characterizations, and we&#8217;re
sorry,&#8221; Zuccarelli said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Public Face&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glassman, 63, said economists are often &#8220;the public face
of a company,&#8221; even though he doesn&#8217;t speak for the bank.
&#8220;They were right to distance from this and to issue an
apology,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts&#8217; controversial views have created problems for
their employers in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bove was sued in July 2008 by BankAtlantic Bancorp, which
said he defamed the company by saying it might fail in a report
titled &#8220;Who is Next?&#8221; Bove said at the time that he left
Ladenburg because it was moving to settle the suit while Bove
thought it had no merit. The case is still outstanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990, analyst Marvin Roffman was fired by Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. after he expressed doubts about the future
of Donald Trump&#8217;s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, prompting
Trump to threaten a lawsuit. The Taj Mahal project was forced
into bankruptcy months after Roffman&#8217;s comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glassman said he has received positive responses from
colleagues in the financial industry to his note, which he said
reflects the frustration felt as Wall Street is criticized by
politicians and pundits for the housing collapse and financial
crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Singled Out&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I understand the outrage and I understand why many people
in the industry feel we&#8217;re being unfairly singled out when there
is plenty of blame to go around,&#8221; Glassman said. &#8220;But Wall
Street was a part of the problem and bears some blame, and there
are things that need to be fixed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glassman said in the research note that the &#8220;ignorance&#8221;
shown by senators in the Goldman Sachs hearing is also plaguing
reform efforts. The present form of the legislation does little
to resolve the issue of banks being &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; and
rather focuses on issues that didn&#8217;t cause the crisis, he said
in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The hearings exposed an unnerving ignorance of
fundamental principles of market economics by folks who have a
hand in remapping rules of finance that will be with us for a
while,&#8221; Glassman wrote in the note. &#8220;Now that the financial
reform debate is in the final innings, it&#8217;s time for the
grownups to step in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munger Impressed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone shared Glassman&#8217;s view of the proceedings.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Vice Chairman Charles Munger said in an
interview on May 3 that he was impressed with the senators&#8217;
understanding of the issues involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I thought they were the best I&#8217;d ever seen under such
circumstances in my history of watching senators,&#8221; Munger said.
&#8220;I thought it was an unusually intelligent and aggressive bunch
of people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the note, Glassman discussed the economic troubles
facing the state of Michigan and included a graph depicting the
state&#8217;s employment decline since 2000 compared with that of
other states, which was titled &#8220;People who live in glass houses
shouldn&#8217;t throw stones.&#8221; Levin, a Democrat who was not named in
the note, is the senior senator from Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glassman said today the note was &#8220;unfair&#8221; to the senators
and said his main concern is the unintended consequences that
could arise from quickly pushing a financial reform bill through
Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tara Andringa, a spokeswoman for Levin, said yesterday the
lawmaker didn&#8217;t plan to issue a statement. Joe Evangelisti, a
spokesman for JPMorgan, had no further comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Pfizer Inc. unit won a re-trial of a
Pennsylvania lawsuit over its menopause drugs that ended in a
first jury&#8217;s award of $1.5 million in damages, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Philadelphia judge yesterday ruled lawyers for the
plaintiff, Merle Simon, must ask another jury to consider
whether Pfizer&#8217;s Pharmacia  Upjohn subsidiary hid the health
risks of its Provera hormone-replacement drug. In December, an
appeals court reinstated Simon&#8217;s original verdict after it was
thrown out by the trial court, giving the judge the option of
ordering a new trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We anticipate we have a good opportunity to win another
verdict on behalf of Mrs. Simon,&#8221; Jim Morris, one of the
woman&#8217;s lawyers, said in a telephone interview today. &#8220;We
intend to push forward with this case until justice is served.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women have taken hormone-replacement
medicines to treat menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, night
sweats, and mood swings. Until 1995, many patients combined
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug made by Wyeth, with progestin-
laden Provera, made by Upjohn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth later combined the two hormones in Prempro. The drugs
are still on the market. New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
largest drugmaker, completed its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth
in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Appropriate&#8217; New Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &#8220;We are pleased with the judge&#8217;s ruling as we believe a new
trial is appropriate given the facts of this case,&#8221; Chris Loder, Pfizer&#8217;s spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-judge Superior Court panel on Dec. 31 found state
Judge Nitza Quinones Alejandro erred in finding Simon&#8217;s claims
were barred by Pennsylvania&#8217;s statute of limitations on
lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel noted it was &#8220;entirely unreasonable&#8221; to assume
women knew the links between hormone-replacement drugs and
breast cancer until the 2002 Women&#8217;s Health Initiative study,
sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, made it
clear. The study found that women using menopause medicines have
a higher risk of breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel sent the case back to Alejandro so she could
decide whether Pfizer was entitled to a new trial, and in the
meantime, ordered the jury verdict reinstated, according to the
38-page ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court still must rule on whether to accept
Alejandro&#8217;s decision on the new trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris said a new trial would reinstate Wyeth as a
defendant in the case. Jurors in the original case rejected
Simon&#8217;s claims that Wyeth&#8217;s menopause medicine was also a cause
of her breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Simon v. Wyeth, 040604229, Court of Common
Pleas (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors underestimate the threat
inflation poses to U.K. gilt returns, and should seek protection
from higher consumer prices no matter who wins today&#8217;s election,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain&#8217;s record budget deficit means the next government
will be left with few options besides raising levies including
the sales tax, which will push consumer prices higher, Jasper Falk, the bank&#8217;s global head of inflation trading, said in an
interview. Investors should still &#8220;keep buying protection&#8221;
such as index-linked bonds or swaps because the Bank of England
will likely be forced to keep its benchmark interest rate at a
record low to foster the economic recovery, Falk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is potentially going to be a knee-jerk reaction in
the bond market after the election, but beyond that I see a
major move in inflation,&#8221; Falk said. &#8220;All three parties are
being criticised for not addressing the deficit more explicitly.
But one thing they are likely to do if they become the next
government is to raise taxes. You are likely to see a spike in
short-term inflation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s latest survey in March showed more respondents
expect British inflation to be above the central bank&#8217;s target
of 2 percent in two to five years. In the euro region, an
increased number of investors expected below-average inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his rivals, Conservative
leader David Cameron and Liberal Democrat chief Nick Clegg, have
been trying to persuade voters their policies are best to tackle
a budget gap that widened to 11.5 percent of gross domestic
product last year, the biggest among the Group of Seven nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer Price Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. annual consumer-price growth accelerated to 3.4
percent in March, data released on April 20 showed, near the 14-
month high of 3.5 percent reached in January. Inflation
expectations, as measured by the 10-year yield difference
between regular and index-linked bonds, were little changed from
the level at the start of the year, standing at 295 basis points
as of 2:15 p.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the euro region, the crisis engulfing Greece and the risk
that it might spread to other indebted nations, such as Portugal
and Spain, may lead to a decline in inflation, Falk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan survey, which the bank said is monitored by
central banks including the Federal Reserve, the European
Central Bank and the Bank of England, showed 66 percent of
respondents expect U.K. inflation to be above target, compared
with 57 percent in the previous report in November. Of the
total, 17 percent expect consumer price growth to be
&#8220;significantly&#8221; above 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Tale of Two Cities&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, 17 percent of respondents said inflation in
the 16-nation euro region will fall &#8220;below average&#8221; in the
medium term, compared with 12 percent in the previous survey.
Some 52 percent of investors in the survey expect inflation in
the region to be close to target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The inflation story in the U.K. and the euro zone is a
tale of two cities,&#8221; said Falk. &#8220;The shift we&#8217;ve seen in our
latest survey is the softening of expectations in the euro area
and the hardening of expectations in the U.K. What might have
prevented a sell-off in the euro-zone inflation market is
probably concern over potential tax increases in the near
term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British index-linked bonds underperformed both U.S. Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and German inflation debt,
returning 2.5 percent compared with 3.1 percent from TIPS and
3.3 percent from German securities, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch&#8217;s indexes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Gulf of Mexico oil spill
started in April, BP Plc&#8217;s shares have dropped more than three
times as fast as Exxon Corp.&#8217;s after the larger Valdez disaster
in 1989. The difference may mean the London-based company is
poised to rebound, JPMorgan Cazenove said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CHART OF THE DAY compares the performance of BP and
Exxon after the two accidents. Shares in the London-based
company have plunged about 14 percent in the 10 trading days
since the April 20 explosion of the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon
rig. The rig sank two days later and the Macondo well is now
gushing out about 5,000 barrels a day of crude, according to
U.S. government estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground on March 24, 1989
spilling more than 250,000 barrels of oil in Alaska&#8217;s Prince
William Sound. Exxon shares fell about 4 percent in 10 trading
days after the accident. At the 5,000 barrel-a-day rate, the
volume of BP&#8217;s spill would exceed Alaska&#8217;s Exxon Valdez accident
by the third week of June. The fall may have been cushioned by a
rising oil price, JP Morgan Cazenove said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The share prices of the two companies that experienced
similarly open-ended events recovered once the scale of their
spills was capped,&#8221; Fred Lucas, a London-based analyst at
JPMorgan Cazenove, wrote yesterday in a report. &#8220;The market has
over-reacted during this period of uncertainty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which in 1999 became Exxon Mobil Corp., spent more
than $3.8 billion for cleaning up, to pay fines and settlements,
according to its Web site. As of yesterday, the rig accident had
wiped about 16.8 billion pounds ($25.3 billion) off BP&#8217;s value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling of the relief well to block off the flow of oil
from the reservoir was begun on May 2 and is expected to take
about three months to complete, BP said today in a statement. It
plans to lower a 100 metric-ton containment dome onto the seabed
today to collect crude spewing from the damaged well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ruble will recoup losses triggered
by the Greek financial crisis that has undermined investor
confidence in emerging markets, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency may gain more than 9 percent to 27.5 per
dollar in the next 12 months as higher oil prices bolster
government finances and the country&#8217;s low debt level lures
investors, Anna Zadornova, a London-based economist at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., said by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble rose 2.8 percent against the dollar in the first
quarter for the longest stretch of gains in almost four years
before investor jitters about the risks inherent in emerging
market assets set in. The currency is now headed for its
biggest-three day decline in almost five months, though the
weakening may be short-lived as Russia&#8217;s economic outlook and
higher oil prices outweigh contagion concern, Zadornova
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With public debt low, and based on our forecast for the
federal budget to return into balance by 2011 due to higher oil
prices, we remain comfortable with our view that the ruble
should return to an appreciation trend once the current market
volatility subsides,&#8221; Zadornova wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble fell 0.9 percent to 30.2520 per dollar, the
lowest since Feb. 10, at 3:05 p.m. in Moscow and weakened 0.1
percent to 38.6250 per euro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget deficit may reach between 6 percent and 6.8
percent of gross domestic product this year, compared with last
year&#8217;s 5.9 percent of GDP shortfall, the first in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total sovereign debt was at 9.8 percent of gross domestic
product at the end of 2009 and may reach 12.8 percent at the end
of this year, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin told President
Dmitry Medvedev on Dec. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble&#8217;s decline this week against the central bank&#8217;s
target currency basket is a result of &#8220;the recent bout of risk
aversion,&#8221; Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net private capital flows reached $2 billion last week and
totaled $5.1 billion in April, Goldman estimates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The well, which is in an area known as the Orphan Basin,
would be almost one kilometer (0.6 miles) deeper than the one
that ruptured in the U.S., the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trustee for Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s brokerage charged $12,600 to review documents
outlining terms of its purchase by Barclays Plc, and now says he
didn&#8217;t know what he was signing, according to a Barclays lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One document was a so-called clarification letter detailing
assets Barclays would get when it bought the defunct brokerage
in September 2008, said David Boies, of New York-based Boies
Schiller  Flexner LLP. Boies is defending Barclays against the
claim that the U.K. bank should pay Lehman as much as $11
billion for an alleged &#8220;windfall&#8221; it got on the brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustee James Giddens of Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP signed
the letter and charged $787.50 an hour for 16 hours of work on
Saturday, Sept. 20, 2008, Boies said, showing a slide of
Giddens&#8217;s fee application. The work included &#8220;review of
continuing revisions to APA, clarification letter and numerous
rounds of negotiations with Weil, Cleary, and other
professionals re changing terms to sale,&#8221; Boies said, reading
from the fee request. APA is short for asset purchase agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan before
Judge James Peck pits the U.K.&#8217;s third-biggest bank against
Lehman, which wants money to pay creditors and brokerage
customers. Giddens seeks $6.7 billion from Barclays to pay
brokerage clients, including a $4 billion margin account that is
due to Barclays, according to the clarification letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trustee read this document, correct?&#8221; Boies asked
Giddens&#8217;s lawyer on the deal, James Kobak of Hughes Hubbard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We read it, yes,&#8221; Kobak said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trustee saw and knew&#8221; there was a specific provision
entitling Barclays to the $4 billion? Boies asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if we knew it was in there when we signed
it,&#8221; Kobak said. The provision wasn&#8217;t in earlier drafts of the
document, and &#8220;we had no reason to think someone would
include&#8221; it in the final document, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Did you ask anyone if there was any change?&#8221; Boies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No,&#8221; Kobak said. &#8220;We expected somebody to tell us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Did you tell anyone&#8221; that was your expectation? Boies
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kobak said no. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil, mentioned in the fee request, refers to Lehman&#8217;s
bankruptcy law firm, Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP, which drafted
the clarification letter, Boies said. Cleary is Barclays&#8217;s
lawyer for the deal, Cleary Gottlieb Steen  Hamilton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee has $35 billion in outstanding customer claims,
and may have a shortfall if Barclays succeeds in taking any
money from him, Kobak said earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent Jarrell, a Giddens&#8217;s spokesman with the public
relations firm APCO Worldwide, said in an e-mailed statement,
&#8220;Citing fee records is a complete sideshow to the merits. The
focus of the trustee and his team that weekend was to do as much
as possible as fast as possible to protect customers, and the
transfer of more than 110,000 accounts and $92.2 billion was
already under way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-
13555, and James W. Giddens v. Barclays Capital Inc., 09-01732,

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CyberSource Sued by Fund Over $2 Billion Visa Offer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CyberSource Corp., the online payment provider that Visa
Inc. is buying, was sued by a pension fund that contends the $2
billion takeover will shortchange investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CyberSource directors are obligated to get the highest
price for the stock, lawyers for the Inter-Local Pension Fund of
the Graphic Communications Conference of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters said in a lawsuit filed May 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa&#8217;s bid &#8220;undervalues the company&#8217;s true worth,&#8221;
according to the Delaware Chancery Court complaint. &#8220;There is
no indication&#8221; that directors &#8220;took reasonable steps to obtain
the best value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, the world&#8217;s biggest payments network, said April 21
it would buy CyberSource, of Mountain View, California, for $26
a share, a 34 percent premium at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Frymire, a CyberSource spokesman, didn&#8217;t return voice
and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit. A Visa
spokesman, Will Valentine, declined to comment, citing a company
policy not to discuss pending litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Inter-Local Pension Fund v. CyberSource Corp.,
CA5454, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar Thrifty Shareholder Sues to Block Hertz Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. shareholder sued to
block the car-rental company&#8217;s sale to Hertz Global Holdings
Inc., claiming the price of $1.2 billion in cash and stock is
too low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Acceptance of Hertz&#8217;s offer without adequately exploring
alternative potential proposals&#8221; would constitute a breach of
fiduciary duties by Dollar Thrifty&#8217;s directors, lawyers for
shareholder Cynthia Sinclair said in the complaint filed
yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertz, based in Park Ridge, New Jersey, said April 26 that
it would buy Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Dollar Thrifty in a deal
valued at the time at $41 a share. The acquisition would add
Dollar and Thrifty to Hertz&#8217;s namesake and Advantage brands as a
rebounding economy spurs travel demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avis Budget Group Inc. said in a May 3 letter to Dollar
Thrifty that it is interested in bidding. Dollar Thrifty said
May 4 in a statement that it is ready to consider a
&#8220;substantially higher offer&#8221; from Avis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Pillersdorf, an outside spokeswoman for Dollar,
and plaintiff attorney Carmella Keener didn&#8217;t return phone calls
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sinclair v. Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group
Inc., CA5456, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpongeBob Bath Toymaker&#8217;s Officers Accused of Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two top officers of the company that makes the SpongeBob
SquarePants soap-filled bath sponges for children were arrested
and charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Metter, chief executive officer of New York-based
SpongeTech Delivery Systems Inc., and Steven Moskowitz, its
finance chief, were arrested yesterday and charged by the U.S.
Attorney&#8217;s Office in Brooklyn, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Between January 2007 and May 2010, the defendants Michael
Metter and Steven Moskowitz, along with others, executed a
scheme to defraud SpongeTech&#8217;s existing and potential investors
by publicly reporting false and grossly overstated sales
figures,&#8221; according to a criminal complaint unsealed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men were also charged with obstruction of justice and
were sued separately by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The shares plunged in over-the-counter trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metter, 58, of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Moskowitz, 45,
of Flushing, New York, were each released on $2 million bail
after an appearance yesterday in federal court in Brooklyn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moskowitz&#8217;s lawyer, Mark M. Baker of Brafman  Associates
PC in New York, declined to comment after the hearing. Metter&#8217;s
lawyer, Jeffrey B. Sklaroff of Greenberg Traurig LLP in New
York, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. The company didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a voice-mail message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpongeTech reported the fraudulent information in filings
with the SEC and in press releases, according to the criminal
complaint. Metter and Moskowitz are accused of reporting that
SpongeTech got purchase orders from or made sales to five
customers that didn&#8217;t exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Metter, M10-507, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Spill Suits Might Be Combined, Quickly Resolved, Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 200 attorneys suing BP Plc over the Gulf of Mexico
oil spill are meeting in a New Orleans hotel to devise a
strategy for resolving virtually all spill litigation within
three months, a lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Becnel, the lawyer who called the meeting, has asked
a federal judicial panel in Washington to combine thousands of
claims by commercial fishermen, shrimpers, property owners,
seafood processors and tourism-related businesses into a single
multidistrict case before one judge in New Orleans. That could
keep the lawsuits from dragging on for years and would get badly
needed cash into victims&#8217; hands, Becnel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to have a long march to trial,&#8221; Becnel
said yesterday in an interview before the meeting. &#8220;This could
all be over in 90 days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becnel represents hundreds of individuals and businesses
claiming damages from the oil slick created by the April 20
explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, which burned
and sank about 40 miles off the Louisiana cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 70 lawsuits, almost all class actions potentially
involving thousands of claims, have been filed against BP, which
owned the offshore lease where the damaged well is now gushing
at least 5,000 barrels of oil a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also named as defendants in most of the suits are:
Transocean Ltd., which owned the rig; Cameron International
Corp., which supplied the blowout prevention equipment on the
well; and Halliburton Energy Services Inc., which was providing
cementing services to the well. None of the companies has
accepted liability for the accident. BP Chief Executive Officer
Tony Hayward has said the company will clean up the oil and pay
&#8220;all legitimate claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daren Beaudo, a BP spokesman, didn&#8217;t return a call and e-
mail seeking comment after regular business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becnel asked the judicial panel to expedite his request to
combine the cases before one of three New Orleans judges, all of
whom have experience with multidistrict litigation. Becnel
previously advocated combining lawsuits over Merck  Co.&#8217;s Vioxx
painkiller as well suits by homeowners over toxic drywall made
in China. Both of those combined cases are being handled by
federal judges in Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the spill cases are combined, Becnel said he will
immediately ask the judge for summary judgment in favor of
damaged businesses and property owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MDL request was made in Acy J. Cooper Jr. v. BP Plc,
2:10-cv-01229, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB Must Face Suit Over Failed Rhinebridge Investment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, a German lender, must face a
fraud lawsuit filed by King County, Washington, over the bank&#8217;s
failed Rhinebridge structured investment vehicle, a U.S. judge
ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county, which includes Seattle, sued in October, saying
it and other investors were deceived by allegedly sham ratings
on the investment vehicle and lost millions of dollars. U.S.
District Judge Shira Scheindlin in New York rejected May 4 the
Dusseldorf, Germany-based defendant&#8217;s argument that her court
didn&#8217;t have jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs contend that the primary means to carry out
that fraud involved forming Rhinebridge and launching it in New
York,&#8221; Scheindlin wrote. The judge&#8217;s 29-page decision didn&#8217;t
address the merits of the underlying lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joerg Chittka, a spokesman for IKB, had no comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB almost collapsed before being bailed out in 2007 by KfW
Group and banking associations. It has received guarantees of as
much as 12 billion euros ($15.5 billion) from the German
government&#8217;s Soffin bank-rescue fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank was an investor in the collateralized debt
obligation known as Abacus, which is at the center of a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. filed last month. The German lender lost almost all
of the $150 million it invested in the CDO, according to the
SEC. Goldman Sachs has denied any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheindlin last month denied dismissal requests filed by
IKB co-defendants Moody&#8217;s Corp. and McGraw-Hill Cos.&#8217; Standard 
Poor&#8217;s unit, alleging they had misled investors about
Rhinebridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is King County, Washington v. IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG, 09-8387, in the Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwab Agrees to Pay Extra $35 Million in Bond-Fund Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Schwab Corp. said it agreed to pay an additional
$35 million to settle claims that the online brokerage misled
investors who owned it Schwab YieldPlus Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement covers claims in California, which weren&#8217;t
included in the $200 million that San Francisco-based Schwab
agreed to pay on April 20, according to a statement yesterday.
Schwab said yesterday&#8217;s announcement boosts its litigation
reverse by $14 million pretax. Combined with the settlement two
weeks ago, Schwab&#8217;s first-quarter results are reduced to a loss
of $1 million, or breakeven on a per-share basis, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claims, filed in 2008, said Schwab incorrectly
described the fund, once the world&#8217;s largest short-term bond
fund, as &#8220;safe&#8221; and misled investors on the amount of
mortgage-backed securities held. Schwab, which didn&#8217;t admit
liability as part of the settlement, blamed the fund&#8217;s losses on
the collapse of financial markets due to the subprime crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Charles Schwab Corp. Securities
Litigation, 08-cv-01510, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck Wins Second Fosamax Trial on Jaw Death Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co. won the second case to go to trial over claims
its osteoporosis drug Fosamax causes so-called jaw death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louise Maley of Muncie, Indiana, said she developed
osteonecrosis of the jaw, or ONJ, by taking Fosamax, in a
complaint filed in May 2006. A federal jury in Manhattan ruled
yesterday that Maley didn&#8217;t have ONJ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unfortunately, the plaintiff had multiple medical
conditions that cause people to develop the jaw and dental
problems she claims she has, regardless of whether they were
taking Fosamax,&#8221; Christy D. Jones, a lawyer for the drugmaker
at Butler, Snow, O&#8217;Mara, Stevens  Cannada PLLC in Jackson,
Mississippi, said in a statement after the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial, overseen by U.S. District Judge John Keenan,
began April 19. In September, Keenan declared a mistrial in the
first Fosamax case to go to a jury over claims that the drug
might hamper blood flow to the jaw, causing jawbone-tissue
death. That jury couldn&#8217;t reach a unanimous verdict. The case is
to be retried in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We asked for $100,000,&#8221; said O&#8217;Brien, Maley&#8217;s lawyer.
&#8220;Merck spent over $2 million trying the case. The shareholders
really need to wonder when is this going to end. Why has Merck
spent more than $100 million defending a little over 1,000
cases?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Brien is with Levin Papantonio Thomas Mitchell Echsner 
Proctor PA in Pensacola, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Maley v. Merck  Co., 06-cv-4110, and the
lawsuits are combined in In Re Fosamax Products Liability
Litigation, MDL 1789, U.S. District Court, Southern District of

&lt;p&gt;MF Global Loses Bid to Have $30 Million U.K. Fraud Ruling Cut &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Ltd.&#8217;s London brokerage unit failed in a
bid to reduce the approximately 20 million pounds ($30 million)
it was ordered to pay a day trader who was deceived about the
amount of his trading losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeal in London yesterday ruled in favor of
former client Raj Gill, saying the lower court&#8217;s decision was
&#8220;impressive.&#8221; MF Global was contesting the size of the award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A London court ruled last year that a former account
manager at MF Global misled Gill about the scale of his losses
which led him to follow a flawed trading strategy with mistakes
worth millions of pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While this decision has no financial implications for MF
Global, we are nevertheless disappointed,&#8221; MF Global
spokeswoman Diana DeSocio said in a telephone interview. She
said the company was &#8220;considering its options&#8221; with regards to
an appeal to the U.K. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gill had sought at least 9.3 million pounds over claims
that in 2001 and 2002 an MF Global account manager, who has
since left the firm, told him he had trading gains when he was
losing money. Gill claimed he would have changed his strategy if
correct information had been provided. Instead, he wiped out a
trading account with almost 10 million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MF Global&#8217;s conduct today, in again refusing to accept
the consequences of fraud by one of its brokers, mirrors its
whole approach to this litigation over the past eight years,&#8221;
Gill said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;It seems they&#8217;re just
desperately prolonging the inevitable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Parabola Investments Ltd. v. Browallia Cal
Ltd., 2006-855. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG and JPMorgan Chase  Co. are
leading an exodus of finance companies from Mumbai&#8217;s Nariman
Point financial district as they balk at paying double midtown-
Manhattan rents for crumbling four-decade-old buildings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, moved to a new complex on
the site of a drive-in cinema about nine miles north. JPMorgan,
the second-biggest U.S. lender, shifted to an adjacent suburb,
while private-equity firm KKR  Co. went about three miles north
of Nariman Point. Local lender Axis Bank Ltd. and broker Motilal
Oswal Financial Services Ltd. are moving in the next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are departing a district reclaimed from the Arabian
Sea in 1940 that is marred by traffic jams and poor sanitation,
and constrained by a 46-year-old law that limits building height.
The city&#8217;s shortcomings and fragmentation may hinder Mumbai,
with the fourth-most-expensive office space in the world, from
establishing a financial center to rival Shanghai and Dubai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Transforming Mumbai into a world class financial center
is very distant,&#8221; said Sunil Saberwal, chief executive officer
of Bombay First, an organization modeled on London First to work
towards the regeneration of Mumbai. &#8220;We are at least 15 to 20
years away from something like that. Even then, Mumbai will not
be as beautiful as Dubai, but it will be functional.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Mumbai doesn&#8217;t get its act together by 2030 by improving
transportation, housing and water systems, and reducing costs,
the city may lose out to places such as Dubai as Western
companies seek a base in the time zone, Saberwal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai Showcase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pritzker Prize winners Norman Foster and Zaha Hadid have
helped turn Dubai into an architectural showcase as much as a
financial hub. The Dubai International Financial Centre, an 110-
acre, tax-free business park that opened in 2004, is home to the
regional offices of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and
HSBC Holdings Plc. The 200-story Burj Khalifa, the world&#8217;s
tallest tower, opened in Dubai in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mumbai, which contributes to a third of the nation&#8217;s tax
collections, was ranked 49 in the Global Financial Centre Index,
according to a survey by consultants Z/Yen Group Ltd. and
published by the City of London. The index uses external sources
to determine property and occupancy costs to judge
competitiveness, and an online questionnaire from 1,455
respondents. Dubai is ranked 23rd and Shanghai 35th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formerly, bankers at Nariman Point were within walking
distance of each other; today, no single location represents the
business district which now stretches in clusters over 20 miles.
Today, a Blackstone Group LP banker, still based in Nariman
Point, would spend at least 45 minutes in a taxi to attend a
meeting at JPMorgan&#8217;s or UBS&#8217;s new office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As long as connectivity is sub-optimal, you will find
clusters developing,&#8221; said Pranay Vakil, India chairman of
Knight Frank LLP. &#8220;The day the government does something about
connectivity, the need to develop clusters will decline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks Expand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks, brokerages and financial service companies are
expanding in India, the world&#8217;s second-fastest growing major
economy after China. The benchmark Sensitive Index has risen 41
percent in the past year, bolstering overseas investors&#8217;
appetites for the nation&#8217;s stocks, and investment banking fees
are set to rise in 2010 as the government sells a record 400
billion rupees ($9 billion) of assets and takeovers accelerate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks&#8217; increasing reliance on computer systems
has forced them to upgrade data centers in India and seek
buildings that have efficient cooling systems and plenty of
access to electricity, said Anusha Bhagat, chief operating
officer at UBS&#8217;s Indian unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Buildings in Nariman Point were incapable of providing
this kind of infrastructure,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Nariman Point was
never planned for the world we live in today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zurich-based UBS a year ago moved its 115 employees into
50,000 square feet (4,645 square meters), more than four times
the space it had in Nariman Point, in Bandra Kurla, a planned
commercial complex that was created to decongest south Mumbai.
The complex, spread over 370 hectares, is built on low-lying
marshy land on either side of the Mithi River. Its occupants
include India&#8217;s largest bourse, the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd., and the stock market regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower costs along with synergies in having all employees in
the same building were considered in the move, Bhagat said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan cited the same reasons behind its
decision to move in September 500 employees to an eight-story
building in North Mumbai with twice the space it occupied before.
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Location and ease of access for employees was a critical
factor in selecting new headquarters for the firm in Mumbai,&#8221;
said Mahesh Aras, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief operating officer for India.
&#8220;We are able to provide employees with ample parking, spacious
dining facilities. A gymnasium is also being planned on the
premises.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Swanky, Clean&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Mumbai developed as rising real estate prices in the
south extended the city&#8217;s reach north. Today, the suburbs boast
sprawling residential colonies, high-tech corporate parks, hip
nightclubs and restaurants, multiplexes, malls and world-class
hotels, and the domestic and international airports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Here we are in swanky, clean buildings,&#8221; said UBS&#8217;s
Bhagat. The old business district was plagued with problems
ranging from the quality of the building, the condition of
elevators, attitude of the owners and lack of professional
management, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based KKR moved into the Peninsular Corporate Park
in midtown in March. The complex of five buildings includes a
restaurant, library, siesta lounge, convenience store and
fitness facilities, as well as a spa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geographic Challenge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mumbai, a city of 18 million people, is the fourth-most-
expensive office location in the world with an average rent of
$125.76 per square foot, according to a survey by Los Angeles-
based commercial property broker CB Richard Ellis Group Inc.
Rents in New York&#8217;s office district rank 26th at $64.51 per
square foot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nariman Point is located on the tip of Mumbai Island. That
in itself is providing a challenge for the improvement of the
area as a law passed in 1991 restricts development on land
affected by the tide, prohibiting construction within 500 meters
of the coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nariman Point could have burgeoned further if it had not
been flanked by water on all three sides,&#8221; said Anuj Puri,
chairman of Jones Lang Lasalle Meghraj, a property consultant in
Mumbai. Additionally, new commercial hubs in Mumbai started
offering state-of-the-art buildings with modern amenities, Puri
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mumbai&#8217;s Floor Space Index&#160;regulations that stipulate the
maximum building space for every square meter on a plot of land
were introduced in 1964 and set at 4.5 times. The standard in
cities with limited land is to raise the permitted FSI over time
to accommodate urban growth, as in Manhattan, Singapore, Hong
Kong and China, according to a World Bank report last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai went
the other way, lowering the permitted FSI to 1.33 in 1991. The
result: almost all Mumbai&#8217;s buildings with an FSI exceeding 4.5
were built before 1964, and space consumption in the city
averages 4 times, a third the 12 times in Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Infrastructure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mumbai&#8217;s transformation into a &#8220;world class city&#8221; would
require radical changes to transport, housing and sanitation, as
well as a reduction in the slum population, consulting firm
McKinsey  Co. said in a 2003 report. Mumbai occupies an area of
440 square kilometers (167 square miles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An eight-lane sea-bridge connecting the northern suburbs
with midtown was opened in July, a decade after the project was
initiated with the costs overshooting more than five times the
original budget. The 4.7-kilometer (2.9-mile) structure, more
than twice as long as San Francisco&#8217;s Golden Gate Bridge, is
intended to cut travel time by a sixth for commuters heading
toward India&#8217;s financial hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, which
is responsible for the development of the city, has bought 700
buses, built five flyovers, installed modern traffic signals at
77 junctions, and added pedestrian bridges and underpasses at
important junctions among initiatives, according to its Web site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;War Room&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;India has no choice but to make Mumbai into a global
financial hub,&#8221; Ratnakar Gaikwad, metropolitan commissioner at
the authority, said. &#8220;It has huge advantages over a Dubai or a
Singapore as it has a robust securities and stock market and
huge human capital. All we need is good infrastructure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authority will complete a 146 kilometer metro rail
project and build a 100 kilometer monorail in the city by 2014,
Gaikwad said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development authority has set up a &#8220;war room&#8221; where
it meets with other agencies including the Bombay Municipal Corp.
to coordinate infrastructure projects and garner government

&lt;p&gt;Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceutical Co.,
the drugmaker controlled by China&#8217;s wealthiest couple, jumped in
its trading debut, giving Goldman Sachs Group Inc. a 235-fold
paper return on its investment in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepalink, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of the blood-thinner
heparin, climbed to 175.17 yuan on the Shenzhen stock exchange
from its initial public offer price of 148 yuan. Today&#8217;s 18
percent gain values Goldman&#8217;s stake, bought for $4.9 million in
2007, at more than $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPO price was the highest by any company in China,
helping Hepalink raise 5.9 billion yuan ($864 million) to expand
production capacity to supply clients including Paris-based
Sanofi-Aventis SA. The stock was one of three that started
trading in China today, with Shanghai Communications Technology
Development Co. surging 70 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepalink&#8217;s &#8220;IPO price is too high and its performance won&#8217;t
be good after the debut,&#8221; said Zhang Kun, a strategist at
Guotai Junan Securities Co. in Shanghai. &#8220;The IPO shares were
priced at a time when investors ramped up small-cap stocks on
the secondary market. The madness has been receding.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China&#8217;s stock exchanges, fell 4.1 percent and the CSI 300 Index
declined 3.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economic growth will withstand
a slowdown in the nation&#8217;s property market because households
borrowed less to purchase their homes than in developed nations,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The housing slowdown is unlikely to cause a much broader
significant slowdown in activity due to low leverage,&#8221; Goldman
economists, led by Michael Buchanan in Hong Kong, wrote in a
report today. &#8220;It seems unlikely that even a fairly large fall
in prices would create the kind of negative equity we saw in the
U.S.&#8221; housing market, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efforts by Premier Wen Jiabao&#8217;s government to rein in
property prices fuelled by last year&#8217;s record credit binge have
spurred concern tighter policies will undermine the world&#8217;s
fastest-growing major economy. China&#8217;s benchmark Shanghai
Composite index of shares has tumbled 16 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers&#8217; efforts are starting to have an impact on
China&#8217;s real-estate market, according to Goldman, the New York-
based investment bank. Property sales have &#8220;plummeted in the
last two weeks&#8221; and there are &#8220;clear signs of price falls in
some of the hottest projects,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials will probably take further steps to tighten
credit in order to avoid overheating in the economy, relying
mainly on &#8220;guidance&#8221; to banks on lending amounts, the
economists wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional Measures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&#8217;s Bank of China has boosted banks&#8217; minimum
reserve requirement three times this year, while it has yet to
raise benchmark interest rates from crisis levels. The
government has also refrained from ending the currency&#8217;s peg to
the dollar, adopted in mid-2008 to help shield exporters during
the global recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese policy makers will &#8220;repeatedly&#8221; use the tool of
reserve requirements, Goldman economists said. Consumer-price
inflation exceeding 3 percent to 4 percent would make the case
of raising interest rate more likely, the report also said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also expects a 5 percent appreciation in the yuan
against the dollar by year-end, while the move won&#8217;t be an &#8220;up-
front sharp revaluation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures to cool the real-estate market have included a ban
on loans for third-home purchases, raising mortgage rates and
tightening down-payment requirements for second-home purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has a &#8220;relatively under-leveraged household
sector,&#8221; as the minimum deposit for buying first homes is at
least 20 percent, while second-home purchases need 40 percent,
Buchanan said. China&#8217;s household debt is only 22 percent of the
nation&#8217;s gross domestic product, while mortgage debt is 14
percent, he wrote. By contrast, Federal Reserve figures show
$10.3 trillion of U.S. mortgage debt outstanding at the end of
2009, the equivalent of 70 percent of GDP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, property prices rose 11.7 percent across 70
cities from a year earlier, the most since data began in 2005.
The inflation rate was 2.4 percent, compared with a government
target for the year of about 3 percent. April figures are due
next week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s inflation rate may have
accelerated to between 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent in April,
putting pressure on the central bank to raise interest rates
this quarter, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Jing Ulrich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s CPI for April is scheduled to be released May 11.
Economists forecast a 2.7 percent year-on-year gain, up from 2.4
percent in the previous month. The inflation rate may average 4
percent in 2010, Reuters reported today, citing Pan Jiancheng, a
statistics bureau official. That&#8217;s higher than the government&#8217;s
target of about 3 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index extended
losses in the afternoon, falling 3.5 percent to 2,756.06 at 2:45
p.m., led by losses for banks and property stocks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s equity investors must wait for
a 40 percent tumble in commodities prices as a signal to reenter
Asia&#8217;s worst-performing market of the year, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plunge in raw material prices will show that tightening
measures by the government to avoid &#8220;the risk of developing an
inflation problem&#8221; have worked, said Adrian Mowat, the chief
Asian and emerging-market strategist at JPMorgan Chase, which
has an &#8220;underweight&#8221; rating on China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So what we will like to see in China is further
tightening measures in order to reduce fixed asset investment
growth,&#8221; curbing real estate and infrastructure construction
and commodities, Mowat said in a Bloomberg Television interview
today. &#8220;Once we see that slowdown, I think the Chinese equities
market will be a buy again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index slumped to a eight-
month low on concern a European debt crisis and Chinese
government curbs on property will hurt economic growth. The
gauge has lost 16 percent this year as the government introduced
measures to prevent a housing bubble inflated by record lending
in 2009, when the gauge surged 80 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government last month imposed a ban on loans for third-
home purchases and raised mortgage rates and down-payment
requirements for second-home purchases to curb housing prices,
which rose at a record pace in March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Shanghai Composite Index may

commodities, said in Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forecast represents a 35 percent gain from the current

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. had a smaller shareholding of Procter  Gamble Co. at the
end of March than three months earlier, a company filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market value of Berkshire&#8217;s investment in the world&#8217;s
largest consumer-products company fell to $4.73 billion on March

&lt;p&gt;The investment&#8217;s cost basis, a measure of how much was paid

for American Express Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Wells Fargo  Co.,
the other three top holdings listed in Berkshire&#8217;s filing, were
unchanged in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. shareholders
re-elected Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein as chairman
and voted against splitting the two roles after Blankfein said
he has &#8220;no current plans&#8221; to step down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All directors up for re-election, including Blankfein,
received more than 95 percent support in preliminary results,
Goldman Sachs co-general counsel Greg Palm said at the annual
shareholders&#8217; meeting in New York. A proposal that would have
required the company to split the chairman and CEO roles was
supported by 19 percent of the votes, Palm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs for fraud last month in connection with the sale of
securities linked to mortgages, and Blankfein and other company
executives were interrogated at a Senate subcommittee hearing
probing the matter. Federal prosecutors are also investigating
Goldman Sachs, which reported record profit last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I recognize that this is an important moment in the life
of this institution,&#8221; Blankfein, 55, said at the meeting. &#8220;Our
success has been and will continue to be dependent on the trust
and confidence of our clients and our shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, addressing the audience of more than 200,
received applause after a shareholder said he is &#8220;doing a very
good job&#8221; and shouldn&#8217;t have to step down. He said clients have
stood by the firm throughout the public scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our business has held up quite well,&#8221; Blankfein said.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t hear a call you don&#8217;t get. But it feels like we are
getting the kind of support we would hope and maybe in excess of
that. At the same I don&#8217;t take it for granted, and I realize we
are putting strains on our stakeholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Clients&#8217; Interests&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said the firm created a committee to examine
business practices and whether Goldman Sachs is adhering to its
&#8220;core&#8221; value that &#8220;our clients&#8217; interests always come
first.&#8221; It will make recommendations to the board and to
management to bolster training and professional development, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm has said the SEC&#8217;s case is &#8220;completely
unfounded.&#8221; The stock dropped 23 percent since the SEC lawsuit
was filed on April 16 through yesterday, making it the worst
performer among the six largest U.S. banks by assets in 2010.
First-quarter earnings were the second-highest for any quarter
in the firm&#8217;s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We understand that there is a disconnect between how we
as a firm view ourselves and how the broader public perceives
our role and activities in the market,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;To
address this, we need a rigorous self-examination.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share Performance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rose 67 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $142.99 at
4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Brothers Investment Services Inc. and the Needmor
Fund, two investors who submitted the proposal on splitting the
chairman and CEO roles, said in the proxy that separating the
two jobs won an average 36.7 percent of the vote at 30 companies
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board had unanimously opposed the idea,
saying in the proxy that the current structure provides
&#8220;clarity regarding leadership of the firm, allows the firm to
speak with one voice and allows for efficient coordination of
board action, particularly in times of market turmoil or
crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s largest competitors -- Bank of
America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley -- have split
the chairman and CEO roles in the past three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No investor owns more of the company&#8217;s stock than Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s partners, who as a group had 7.4 percent of the shares
as of March 8, according to the proxy. Warren Buffett&#8217;s
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. holds warrants that entitle the
insurance and holding company to buy 7.6 percent of the
company&#8217;s stock, while BlackRock Inc. had a 6.1 percent stake as
of March 8, the proxy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, speaking before Berkshire&#8217;s annual meeting on May
1, praised Blankfein and said he hopes he keeps running Goldman
Sachs &#8220;this year, next year and 10 years from now.&#8221; Berkshire,
based in Omaha, Nebraska, also holds $5 billion in preferred
stock that pays a 10 percent dividend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC suit accuses Goldman Sachs and a company executive
director, Fabrice Tourre, of misleading investors in a mortgage-
linked security about the role that a hedge fund, Paulson  Co.,
played in both selecting and betting against the obligation. New
York-based Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a myriad of opportunities out there in the way
we handle the case, and I wouldn&#8217;t rule any of them out,&#8221; Chief
Operating Officer Gary Cohn said today after the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven days after the case was filed, current and former
Goldman Sachs executives, including Blankfein and Tourre,
endured almost 11 hours of questioning by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. The committee released e-mails
that showed Goldman Sachs employees disparaging securities
created by the firm with an expletive and referring to them as
&#8220;junk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
buying the Mexican peso against the dollar, saying strengthening
growth in the Latin American country&#8217;s economy will help the
currency recover after an &#8220;irrational&#8221; sell-off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso added 0.7 percent to 12.9002 at 3:40 p.m. New York
time today and will advance 5.7 percent to 12.2 per dollar,
Fiona Lake, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note today.
The peso has dropped 4.6 percent versus the dollar this week,
its biggest decline since November 2008, on concern the European
debt crisis will derail the global economic rebound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The global macro picture remains extremely supportive of
a clear pro-cyclical stance,&#8221; Lake said. &#8220;Markets have
displayed a certain degree of irrational behavior in recent
days, which suggests the related price action may have overshot.
The peso outlook has improved very significantly as growth has
strengthened rapidly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this week&#8217;s decline, the peso had risen 6.3 percent
this year against the dollar, the best performance among 16
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, as the recovery in the
U.S., Mexico&#8217;s largest trading partner, boosted its exports.
Reports showed today that U.S. payrolls surged by the most in
four years in April, while German industrial production rose
more than economists forecast in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mexico is well placed to benefit from the improving
growth outlook in the U.S.,&#8221; Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central banks have more tools to provide &#8220;liquidity&#8221; to
financial institutions than in 2008 and some reports of
&#8220;sovereign contagion risks&#8221; in Europe have been overstated,
Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should exit the trade if the peso declines to
13.2 per dollar, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221; may top $400 million in
domestic ticket sales, kicking off what is likely to be a record
summer for Hollywood studios, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film, made by Walt Disney Co&#8217;s Marvel Entertainment and
distributed by Viacom Inc.&#8217;s Paramount Pictures, opens in
theaters today and is projected to take in as much as $155
million this weekend in the U.S. and Canada, according to
Jeffrey Hartke, an analyst with Hollywood Stock Exchange.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher ticket prices and demand for 3-D movies will likely
push box-office sales beyond last summer&#8217;s record $4.25 billion,
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com&#8217;s box-office
tracking unit. Screenings in 3-D have accounted for $851
million, or 25 percent, of all box-office revenue this year,
according to Hollywood.com. Theaters typically charge about $3
more per ticket for a 3-D movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re definitely going to have a record,&#8221; Dergarabedian
said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 3, year-to-date receipts totaled $3.36 billion in
U.S. and Canadian theaters, up 6.3 percent from $3.25 billion a
year ago, according to Hollywood.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studios are scheduled to release seven three-dimensional
films this summer, including Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; on June 18
and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc&#8217;s &#8220;Shrek Forever After&#8221; on
May 21. The average ticket price for 3-D and 2-D movies combined
in the U.S. and Canada is about $7.95, up from $7.45 last
summer, according to Hollywood.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; which was not filmed in 3-D, features
Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, who dons an armored, jet-
powered suit. Mickey Rourke and Scarlett Johansson co-star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Twilight: Eclipse&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original film, released in 2008, generated worldwide
ticket sales of $585 million, according to researcher Box Office
Mojo. &#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221; has taken in $132.9 million since its
release last week outside the U.S. The movie may reach $400
million in domestic sales, Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with
Wunderlich Securities in Denver, said in a May 3 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other films likely to generate significant sales this
summer include Summit Entertainment LLC&#8217;s &#8220;The Twilight Saga:
Eclipse,&#8221; the third film in the series based on the novels by
Stephenie Meyer, Dergarabedian said. The first two movies,
starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, have had
worldwide sales of $1.1 billion, according to Box Office Mojo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks in emerging Europe, the Middle
East and Africa offer &#8220;great buying opportunities,&#8221; especially
Russia, after a selloff that overlooks the region&#8217;s economic
growth prospects, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns Europe&#8217;s debt crisis and Chinese curbs on lending
will slow the global recovery have led to a plunge in
developing-nation assets, creating &#8220;attractive entry points&#8221;
for investors in a region bound to benefit from accelerating
economic growth, analysts Sergei Arsenyev and Victor Baybekov
wrote in a report dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI EM Eastern Europe Index plunged 4.6 percent today,
the most since October, and is down 20.3 percent from its April
15 peak, marking a so-called bear market. Russia&#8217;s Micex Index
tumbled 5.6 percent. The gauge closed down 11 percent from an
April 15 peak yesterday, entering a so-called correction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sentiment will likely continue having a negative impact&#8221;
on the region, especially on Russia and Turkey, the analysts
wrote. &#8220;However we believe that they are currently in the sweet
spot of accelerating gross domestic product growth and
attractive valuations,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Czech PX Index also entered a correction yesterday and
Turkey&#8217;s ISE National 100 Index and Hungary&#8217;s BUX Index today
fell more than 10 percent from recent peaks. Equity benchmarks
in Kazakhstan and Romania have lost 19.9 and 19.97 percent
respectively from 2010 highs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian Stocks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The best way to take advantage of the market selloff is
through increasing exposure to the domestic demand theme across
sector,&#8221; Goldman&#8217;s analysts wrote in the report, adding
retailer X5 Retail Group NV, property developer LSR Group and
telecommunications provider AFK Sistema to its CEEMEA Focus
List. OAO Sberbank, the nation&#8217;s biggest lender, &#8220;provides the
best exposure to the domestic recovery,&#8221; according to Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Russia has sold off sharply in the last two weeks&#8221; and
investors should use &#8220;the current weakness to gain or increase
exposure to what we believe are some of the most fundamentally
attractive companies in Russia,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said a
preliminary tally shows shareholders rejected a resolution to
split the roles of chairman and chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal won about 19 percent of the vote, investors
were told at today&#8217;s annual meeting in New York. All directors
standing for election received more than 95 percent of the vote,
according to General Counsel Gregory Palm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $3.1 billion merger of UAL Corp.&#8217;s
United Airlines and Continental Airlines Inc. was only the
year&#8217;s 38th-largest deal. That didn&#8217;t keep some of Wall Street&#8217;s
top rainmakers from getting involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James B. Lee Jr., a vice chairman and veteran merger
adviser at JPMorgan Chase  Co., and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s
Michael Carr, a senior member of the firm&#8217;s merger leadership
group, advised UAL Chief Executive Officer Glenn Tilton. Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s Robert Kindler, head of global mergers and
acquisitions, worked with Continental, alongside Lazard Ltd.&#8217;s
Harry Pinson, a banker in the carrier&#8217;s home city of Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merger, which creates the world&#8217;s biggest airline with
almost 86,000 employees, was the second effort in two years to
bring United and Continental to the altar. In April 2008, the
airlines were hours away from approving a deal when Continental
pulled out of talks and resolved to remain independent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The deal executed last Sunday night was virtually the same
transaction we negotiated two years ago,&#8221; Lee said in an
interview with Charlie Rose published in Bloomberg
Businessweek&#8217;s May 10 issue. &#8220;The seeds were planted quite some
time ago.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United and Continental announced the merger on May 3 after
signing the deal the night before at the offices of Cravath,
Swaine  Moore LLP, United&#8217;s legal counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE, PepsiCo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s team included Thomas Miles, Christopher Ventresca, co-head of North American mergers and acquisitions,
and David Fox, head of Midwest investment banking. Goldman&#8217;s
Patrick McClymont also advised Chicago-based United. Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s Nelson Walsh and Josh Connor were part of the group
advising Continental. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is the latest in a series of high-profile mandates
for Lee and Kindler. Lee, 57, a longtime adviser to UAL&#8217;s
Tilton, helped General Electric Co. sell a majority stake in NBC
Universal to Comcast Corp. last year and led negotiations with
the U.S. Treasury on behalf of Chrysler LLC bank-debt holders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler, 56, advised PepsiCo Inc.&#8217;s biggest bottler on its
sale to the soda and snack maker last year, and helped CF
Industries Holdings Inc. win a year-long battle to buy Terra
Industries Inc. Carr has been helping Airgas Inc. defend against
a hostile takeover bid from Air Products  Chemicals Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For legal advice, United is using Cravath&#8217;s Scott Barshay
and George Zobitz. Continental&#8217;s CEO Jeff Smisek is using the
law firm where he once worked, Vinson  Elkins, where Kevin Lewis is working on the deal. Jones Day&#8217;s Robert Profusek and
Mark Metts and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP are also
advising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been 32 airline deals so far this year, with a
total value of $7.7 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The largest was the $3.3 billion takeover of Japan
Airlines Corp. by Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp. of
Japan, the state-affiliated fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the biggest merger adviser this year,
Bloomberg data show. JPMorgan is third, and Morgan Stanley and
Lazard are fifth and sixth respectively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The California Public Employees
Retirement System, the largest U.S. public pension fund, voted
to split the roles of chairman and chief executive officer
currently held by Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calpers voted for a shareholder proposal that would require
the company to separate the positions the next time it names a
CEO, the fund announced yesterday on its website. Goldman&#8217;s
board unanimously opposed dividing the roles, arguing that the
current structure provides clarity and efficiency. Calpers said
it voted 1.81 million Goldman shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who has led the company for almost four years,
will face shareholders at the annual meeting today in New York,
three weeks after the firm was sued for fraud by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC claims Goldman, the
most profitable firm in Wall Street history, misled clients who
purchased mortgage-backed securities. Goldman contests the
claims and said it will cooperate with investigators.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Calpers believes if the chair is not the CEO, the board
may be able to exercise stronger oversight of management,&#8221; the
pension fund said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calpers withheld support for Goldman director Lakshmi Mittal, CEO of the world&#8217;s biggest steelmaker ArcelorMittal, for
sitting on too many corporate boards. Mittal has been a director
since June 2008, according to Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; a sequel based on the
Marvel superhero comics, opened as the top movie in U.S. and
Canadian theaters, kicking off the summer film season with
$133.6 million for Walt Disney Co. and distributor Paramount
Pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film posted the fifth-highest opening weekend gross
ever, Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie marks what is likely to be a record summer box-
office season for Hollywood, Hollywood.com said. The original
&#8220;Iron Man,&#8221; released in 2008, generated total worldwide ticket
sales of $585 million, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It delivered on what it promised,&#8221; said Jeff Bock,
senior box-office analyst at Los Angeles-based Exhibitor
Relations Co. &#8220;The original film set the bar so high, but this
was on target with all expectations in what it offered.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the sequel, Robert Downey Jr. returns as Tony Stark, an
industrialist who dons a jet-powered, armored suit to fight
villains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie had $10.2 million in sales at Imax Corp.
theaters, a record for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s &#8220;The Dark Knight&#8221; holds the record for
the highest grossing film with $158.4 million in its opening
weekend in July 2008. It went on to earn $533.3 million at the
domestic box office, Hollywood.com said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Nightmare on Elm Street&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher ticket prices and demand for 3-D movies will likely
push box-office sales beyond last summer&#8217;s record $4.25 billion,
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com&#8217;s box-office
tracking unit. Screenings in 3-D have accounted for $851
million, or 25 percent, of all box-office revenue this year,
according to Hollywood.com. Theaters typically charge about $3
more per ticket for a 3-D movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A Nightmare on Elm Street&#8221; dropped to second place with
$9.2 million for Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s New Line studio. The film,
which features Jackie Earle Haley as serial-killer Freddy
Krueger, has taken in $48.5 million in two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;How to Train Your Dragon,&#8221; from DreamWorks Animation SKG
Inc., dropped to third place from second with sales of $6.8
million. The film has made $201 million in six weeks of release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Date Night,&#8221; a comedy starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell, fell to fourth place from third, taking in $5.3 million
for News Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Robin Hood&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Back-Up Plan,&#8221; from CBS Corp.&#8217;s film division,
dropped to fifth place from fourth with sales of $4.3 million.
The romantic comedy starring Jennifer Lopez, has made $29.4
million in three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Robin Hood&#8221; will debut next weekend and likely won&#8217;t
take the No. 1 spot from &#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; Bock said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will be tough to beat &#8216;Iron Man,&#8217;&#8221; he said. &#8220;Only
&#8216;Shrek Forever After&#8217; and &#8216;Toy Story 3&#8217; may have a chance. Those
are probably the top three movies of the summer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales for the top 12 films rose 21.9 percent to $173.9
million from $142.8 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com said.
Year-to-date receipts total $3.66 billion, up 6.5 percent from
$3.43 billion. Attendance has fallen 0.08 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following table has figures provided by studios to Los
Angeles-based Hollywood.com. The amounts are based on actual

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank, said a new tax on executive bonuses in the
U.K. will be &#8220;material,&#8221; without specifying how much it will
cost the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The impact of this legislation is in the process of being
quantified, and is expected to be material,&#8221; JPMorgan said in a
regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said the charge will appear in the second quarter,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., ranked
first and third in the U.S. by assets, said in separate filings
last week that they expect to pay $465 million and $400 million,
respectively. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has estimated the tax may
cost more than $600 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. officials, seeking to assuage public outrage over
bailout programs, imposed a one-time tax on bonuses of more than
25,000 pounds, or about $37,000 at current exchange rates. The
levy covers bonuses awarded between Dec. 9, 2009, and April 5.
George Osborne, the U.K. Conservative lawmaker in charge of the
party&#8217;s Treasury policy, said in January large cash bank bonuses
are unacceptable at a time when ordinary workers are struggling
to cope with the recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank, said in a
filing last week that it will recognize a charge without saying
how much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Treasury, which initially said the tax would raise
550 million pounds, has estimated it may net as much as 2
billion pounds, according to a government official who declined
to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which repaid $25 billion in U.S. aid last year,
remained profitable throughout the financial crisis, relying on
fee income to counter loan losses in mortgage lending and credit
cards. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Jonathan Keehner and Sarah Mulholland" date="May 10, 2010  5:02 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-10/jpmorgan-deutsche-bank-said-to-weigh-financing-group-s-extended-stay-bid.html"><headline>JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank Said to Weigh Financing Group's Extended Stay Bid</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche
Bank AG are in talks to provide about $2 billion of financing to
a group led by Centerbridge Partners LP and Paulson  Co. that
is bidding for bankrupt U.S. hotel chain Extended Stay Inc., two
people familiar with the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centerbridge-Paulson led group, which also includes
Blackstone Group LP, has committed to invest up to $905.4
million into Extended Stay, trumping an early offer from a group
lead by Starwood Capital. A deal with the banks, which would be
backed by Extended Stay&#8217;s real estate, hasn&#8217;t been completed,
said the people, who declined to be named because the
negotiations are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extended Stay, which filed the largest bankruptcy case by a
U.S. hotel owner in June, withdrew its request for approval of
the Starwood proposal last month. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. are in talks to provide the Starwood-led group
with about $2.2 billion of financing, a person familiar with the
situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an April 8 hearing, Marcia Goldstein, a lawyer for
Extended Stay at Weil, Gotshal  Manges LLP in New York, said
the company favored the Centerbridge-Paulson offer over
Starwood&#8217;s. Under the terms, the hotelier can seek better deals,
and an auction is planned for May 27, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bundling Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks plan on bundling the debt to be sold as bonds,
said the people. Sales of commercial mortgage-backed securities
plummeted to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record $232.4 billion
in 2007 as credit markets seized up, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Even with U.S. government aid, only $3.04 billion
of the bonds were sold last year, and a $309.7 million issue was
the only offering this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Lichtenstein&#8217;s Lightstone Group LLC bought Extended
Stay in 2007, relying on more than $7 billion in debt financing
to complete the $8 billion deal just weeks before the leveraged-
buyout market imploded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup
declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Starwood.
Representatives of Centerbridge, Paulson and Goldman Sachs
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centerbridge-Paulson offer includes $450 million in
cash, $200 million to backstop a rights offering and as much as
$255.4 million to creditors who elect to take cash at a 30
percent discount to the value of the stock the reorganization
plan otherwise would give them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 17 Deadline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $450 million equity injection is for 43 percent of the
new company and the backstop represents another 19 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline for proposals for investing in Extended Stay
is May 17. Starwood plans to bid for the hotel chain, Bruce Zirinsky, a lawyer for Starwood at Greenberg Traurig LLP in New
York, said at an April 22 court hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five Mile Capital Partners LLC, an alternative-investment
firm in Stamford, Connecticut, and TPG, a private-equity firm in
Fort Worth, Texas, are part of Starwood&#8217;s investment group. The
talks with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup were previously reported
by the Wall Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Extended Stay Inc. 09-13764, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s traders
made money every single day of the first quarter, a feat the
firm has never accomplished before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily trading net revenue was $25 million or higher in all
of the first quarter&#8217;s 63 trading days, New York-based Goldman
Sachs reported in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission today. The firm reaped more than $100 million on 35
of the days, or more than half the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which is facing a fraud lawsuit from the SEC
related to the sale of a mortgage-linked security in 2007,
generated $9.74 billion in trading revenue in the first quarter,
exceeding all of its Wall Street competitors. Trading accounted
for 76 percent of first-quarter revenue. The lack of trading
losses could add to the perception that Goldman Sachs has an
unfair advantage in the markets, said one shareholder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will reinforce the heads we win, tails you lose
mentality that people think actually exists and promotes the
concept of an unfair advantage,&#8221; said Douglas Ciocca, a
managing director at Renaissance Financial Corp. in Leawood,
Kansas, which oversees about $2 billion in assets including
Goldman Sachs shares. &#8220;It&#8217;s too politically charged not to, how
is that possible that they only make money?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Earnings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, which reported record earnings last year, is
contesting the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit and the firm&#8217;s executives were
interrogated at a Senate subcommittee hearing last month.
Goldman Sachs, which maintains that it did nothing wrong, is
also being investigated by federal prosecutors, said people
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the first time we have reported zero trading loss
days in a quarter,&#8221; Samuel Robinson, a Goldman Sachs spokesman,
said in an e-mail. &#8220;We believe it shows the strength of our
customer franchise and risk management.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ciocca echoed that view, saying he thinks the performance
proves the strength of the firm&#8217;s risk-management models and its
ability to make money even in markets with low volatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The statistical probability of going through what we did
would never favor them making money every day,&#8221; Ciocca said.
&#8220;It actually speaks very well of their capability to manage
through different types of markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching Out &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ciocca said he&#8217;s had first-hand experience of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s efforts to reach out to clients in the wake of the SEC
lawsuit to answer questions about the matter. He said
representatives from Goldman Sachs&#8217;s asset-management division
contacted his firm during the last week of April even though
they hadn&#8217;t been in touch for a year before that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was tactical, it was appropriate, it wasn&#8217;t
patronizing, it was very sincere,&#8221; Ciocca said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its SEC filing today, Goldman Sachs said it is expecting
further litigation related to sales of collateralized debt
obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We anticipate that additional putative shareholder
derivative actions and other litigation may be filed, and
regulatory and other investigations and actions commenced
against us with respect to offering of CDOs,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also laid out in the filing a worst-case
scenario of what could happen if the firm doesn&#8217;t resolve the
SEC case and can&#8217;t obtain appropriate waivers from relevant

&lt;p&gt;Imposing Restrictions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results could include &#8220;an inability to act as a
registered broker-dealer or provide certain advisory and other
services to U.S. registered mutual funds,&#8221; the filing said.
&#8220;In addition, regulators could impose restrictions on the
activities of our banking, commodities, investment advisory or
other regulated businesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s first-quarter earnings were the second-
highest in the company&#8217;s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s stock dropped 22 percent from before the SEC
lawsuit was filed on April 16 through May 7, making it the worst
performer among the six largest U.S. banks so far in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 84 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $143.83 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, as global
stocks soared with the European loan program to end the
sovereign-debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez&#8217;s
threats to stem currency speculation will likely deepen an
economic slump and force the government to spend more dollars in
the foreign-exchange market to slow a rout in the bolivar,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chavez continues to misdiagnose the problem and feels the
solution is more socialism and less speculation,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
economist Alberto Ramos said in a telephone interview from New
York. &#8220;They know the market performs a useful function in the
economy and may look to punish someone to set an example like
we&#8217;ve seen in the past.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez, who devalued the bolivar in January and seized
assets of France&#8217;s Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA for alleged
price violations, threatened to expropriate businesses on May 8
for selling above regulated prices and blamed private industry
for the 5.2 percent increase in consumer prices last month.
Chavez also called for a &#8220;strong hand&#8221; against currency
speculators that he blamed for the 26 percent drop in the
bolivar this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela&#8217;s economy contracted 3.3 percent last year, and
fell into recession for the first time since 2003 after oil
production and exports plunged. The economy will likely shrink a
second consecutive year in 2010, Chavez said on April 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government may seek to implement measures including
&#8220;financial repression, moral suasion over businesses&#8221; and
additional expropriations, Ramos said today in a research note.
The government will eventually have to either increase dollar
sales to the unregulated market or sell more dollar-denominated
debt to lift the currency, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela and state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA
sold $11.3 billion of bonds last year in part to supply dollars
to investors in the local market who sold the securities abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Chavez, monthly inflation has quickened to a seven-
year high and the bolivar has reached a record low. Venezuelans
turn to the parallel market when they can&#8217;t get government
approval to buy dollars at the official rates of 2.6 and 4.3
bolivars per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bolivar fell 1.2 percent today in the unregulated
market to a low of 8.05 per dollar, traders said. Central bank
dollar auctions of $523 million of 90-day notes this year have
failed to meet demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Burn&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez said that the central bank could &#8220;burn&#8221; all of its
reserves selling to the unregulated market without any effect
due to &#8220;speculation&#8221; and &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; against his
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The central bank has been burning reserves and
intervening in the market but the bolivar keeps rising. We need
to attack speculation; there&#8217;s no other reason, it&#8217;s
capitalism,&#8221; Chavez said on May 8 in comments on state
television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has been auditing exchange operations at
brokerages and may fine institutions to regulate the currency
market, Asdrubal Oliveros, a director at Ecoanalitica said today
in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s possible that the government will sanction some
brokerages because the foreign exchange law is very ambiguous
and the market has lacked transparency,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela&#8217;s securities regulator closed three brokerages
today and assigned a government receiver for the institutions,
according to a statement posted on the regulator&#8217;s website today
and dated May 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halted Operations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italbursatil Casa de Bolsa CA, Banvalor Casa de Bolsa CA
and Positiva Sociedad de Corretaje de Titulos Valores CA were
ordered to halt operations, the statement said, without
providing details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman at Positiva confirmed the halting of
operations and said she wasn&#8217;t authorized to provide additional
information. Phone calls to Italbursatil and Banvalor seeking
comment weren&#8217;t answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at the finance ministry and central bank declined
to comment on possible government measures in the currency
market when contacted today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will need to present a &#8220;clear policy&#8221; to
deal with the rising dollar demand for importers and companies
that haven&#8217;t had access to dollars at the official rates, Miguel Octavio and Russell Dallen of BBO Financial Services Inc. in
Caracas said today in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserves Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank will create a &#8220;Strategic Financial and
Exchange System&#8221; in order to oversee the flow of monetary and
financial information to guarantee the proper functioning of the
system, according to a central bank law published today in the
Official Gazette. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank is unable to meet demand for dollars in
the market after transferring $5.5 billion to an off-budget
development fund this year as reserves have plunged 22 percent
to $27.2 billion, Oliveros said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the large wedge between the official and non-
official rates, driving the black market rate to the desired 4.3
level would require the central bank to sell a non-trivial
amount of reserves,&#8221; Ramos said today. &#8220;Since the measures are
likely to address symptoms but not the root causes of inflation
and bolivar depreciation, they are likely to be ineffective and
to create additional distortions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genworth Financial Corp. led the
rally in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index after JPMorgan Chase 
Co. included the company on a list of stocks due to rebound from
being &#8220;clobbered&#8221; amid European sovereign debt concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., Office Depot Inc. and U.S.
Steel Corp. were also among the 29 companies picked by
JPMorgan&#8217;s Chief Equity Strategist Thomas Lee. All but one of
the selected shares gained today as the SP 500 jumped 4.3
percent at 12:11 p.m. in New York after European policy makers
announced a loan package valued at almost $1 trillion to contain
the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We wanted to focus on stocks that are leaders in this
bull market that have basically gotten clobbered,&#8221; Lee said in
a telephone interview. &#8220;These are the names investors are going
to gravitate toward when you take the tail risk of European
sovereign solvency and concern of E.U. dissolution off the
table.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. equity benchmark had fallen 8.7 percent between
April 23 and May 7 on concern that the debt crisis in Greece
would extend to other European countries. That decline followed
a 79 percent rally from the depths of the financial crisis in
March 2009 through the middle of last month, which partially
mirrors the market&#8217;s 17-month drop from its October 2007 peak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks had to be in the SP 500 Index, be down at least 20
percent from two-month highs and rated &#8220;neutral&#8221; or
&#8220;overweight&#8221; by JPMorgan to be eligible for the list,
according to a May 6 note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genworth rose 13 percent to $16.45, after climbing 25
percent, the most intraday since May 2009. Cleveland-based
Cliffs rose 7.7 percent to $60.46. The shares lost 4.8 percent
last week, and had gained 22 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other stocks on the list, Office Depot, the second-
largest U.S. office-supply retailer, rose 4.4 percent to $6.45
after climbing 10 percent, the most intraday since October 2009.
U.S. Steel, the nation&#8217;s second-largest domestic steelmaker by
sales, gained 5.5 percent to $55.02 after earlier increasing 7.6
percent, the most since Jan. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall  Ilsley Corp. surged 9.7 percent to $8.85.
Abercrombie  Fitch Co. gained 7 percent to $41.88, the most
since March 2. Consol Energy Inc. added 7.1 percent to $41.08
after earlier rising 8 percent, the most since May 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only stock on the list to decline was Moody&#8217;s Corp. The
credit rating company slid 7.5 percent to $21.62 after
disclosing that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is
considering cease-and-desist proceedings against it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. lost a bid to
dismiss a lawsuit filed by Jefferson County, Alabama, that
claims the bank enticed it into a risky refinancing of about $3
billion of sewer debt by making $8 million in payments to
friends of county officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circuit Judge Caryl Penney Privett in Birmingham rejected
the New York-based bank&#8217;s arguments that the county is barred by
the statue of limitations, a time limit for bringing action, and
its contention that the county failed to show that JPMorgan was
involved in a conspiracy, in a ruling issued May 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County, in the suit filed in November, alleged
fraud, conspiracy and &#8220;unjust enrichment against those who have
brought the county and its citizens to the brink of financial
disaster while lining their own pockets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, advised
the state&#8217;s most populous county in 2002 and 2003 to enter into
a series of floating-rate bond and interest-rate swaps that
created an &#8220;inherently flawed financial structure that imploded
within just a few years,&#8221; according to the county&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles LeCroy and Douglas MacFaddin, also named in the
suit, were the managing directors at New York-based JPMorgan who
oversaw the sewer-debt transactions. LeCroy and MacFaddin are
accused of arranging $8.2 million in illegal payments to local
broker-dealers who were friends of county commissioners, in
exchange for the county&#8217;s business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Langford, former mayor of Birmingham and president of
the county commission at the time of the debt refinancing, is
serving a 15-year sentence in a federal prison in Kentucky for
accepting $241,000 in bribes from William Blount, of Montgomery
investment firm Blount Parrish  Co. Blount was paid $2.8
million by JPMorgan during the bond transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankruptcy Brink &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County, home to Birmingham, has teetered on the
brink of bankruptcy after interest rates on $3.2 billion in
bonds soared in 2008, when companies that insured them lost
their credit ratings because of losses on unrelated mortgage-
backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million settlement
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end a probe
into derivative sales to the county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank paid $50 million outright to the county, and
agreed to cancel $647 million in fees the county faced to unwind
the transactions. JPMorgan, which also paid $25 million to be
placed in a fund to compensate affected investors, neither
admitted nor denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BMFBovespa SA, the operator of
Brazil&#8217;s biggest securities exchange, gained the most in a year
in Sao Paulo trading after JPMorgan Chase  Co. said the stock
price doesn&#8217;t reflect the company&#8217;s growth prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 7.4 percent to 11.09 reais at 9:29 a.m. New
York time, after earlier rising 8 percent, the most since May
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMFBovespa will see &#8220;higher than expected&#8221; profit as
increased volatility spurs trading volumes that have already
gained to levels not seen since before the country imposed a tax
on purchases of equities by overseas investors, JPMorgan said in
a note to clients today. The stock is down 16 percent this year
through May 7, compared with an 8.3 percent drop for the
benchmark Bovespa index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite the stock performing poorly, the fundamentals
have been quite good recently and have been accelerating,&#8221; said
analysts Kenneth B. Worthington and Funda Akarsu, who have an
&#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on the shares. &#8220;We believe BMF
Bovespa has the potential for much faster growth than other
exchanges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further gain in Brazil&#8217;s currency remains one risk for
the stock, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We fear that any material appreciation in the real would
be met with investor fear or government action to limit further
increases in the value of the real,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on May 7 raised its rating on the
stock to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slump in commodity prices last
week created a &#8220;buying opportunity&#8221; because economies are
improving, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said it favors copper, crude oil and precious
metals, in a report today. Commodities, as measured by the SP
GSCI Enhanced Total Return Index, should advance 17.6 percent in
12 months, Goldman analysts including Allison Nathan, Jeffrey Currie and David Greely said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI gauge slumped 7.4 percent last week, the
steepest drop since December 2008, on speculation that Greece&#8217;s
debt crisis would spread to other European nations and threaten
the region&#8217;s economic growth. Europe consumes about a quarter of
the world&#8217;s crude oil, 20 percent of copper output and 15
percent to 25 percent of metals including aluminum, zinc and
nickel, according to estimates from BP Plc and Barclays Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although we believe that policy concerns should not be
dismissed, we believe that risk/reward is now strongly in favor
of long positions, particularly in the context of the improving
macro environment,&#8221; the Goldman analysts said in their report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities rebounded today after European policy makers
unveiled a 750 billion-euro ($962 billion) loan plan to ease the
region&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index
of 19 commodities added 1.6 percent as of 1:30 p.m. in London,
led by a 3.5 percent jump in crude. The SP GSCI Enhanced index
had yet to price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil traded in New York will reach $102 a barrel in 12
months, compared with $77.76 today, Goldman forecast. Copper
will advance to $7,850 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
over the same period, from $7,128.50 now, the bank said. Gold
will reach a record $1,335 an ounce in a year, compared with
$1,195.05 today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
facing a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, is expecting further litigation related to sales of
collateralized debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We anticipate that additional putative shareholder
derivative actions and other litigation may be filed, and
regulatory and other investigations and actions commenced
against us with respect to offering of CDOs,&#8221; the New York-
based company said in a quarterly filing with the SEC today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, which reported record earnings last year, was hit
by a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission last month and the bank&#8217;s executives were
interrogated at a Senate subcommittee hearing. Goldman Sachs,
which maintains that it did nothing wrong, is also being
investigated by federal prosecutors, said people familiar with
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company received letters from shareholders &#8220;demanding
the board take action to address alleged misconduct&#8221; by Goldman
Sachs and certain officers and employees, it said in the filing.
The demands are in connection with the 2007 CDO transaction at
the heart of the SEC case, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which makes more money from trading than any
other Wall Street firm, also disclosed that its traders
generated $100 million or more on 35 days during the first
quarter and lost money on no days. The firm set a record when it
made $100 million or more on 46 days in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj, the world&#8217;s biggest maker
of mobile phones, filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against
Apple Inc. in its latest salvo over the iPhone and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, the fifth patent complaint between the two
companies in the past year over smartphone technology, broadens
the fight to include Apple&#8217;s iPad touch-screen computer tablet.
Nokia&#8217;s filing May 7 in federal court in Madison, Wisconsin,
helped push Apple shares down as much as 8.5 percent in New York
trading, their steepest drop since October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the three years since the iPhone was introduced, Apple
has seized Nokia&#8217;s position as the company that defines the
high-end smartphone market. Nokia, which took mobile phones to
the Internet more than 10 years ago with its keyboard-based
Communicator, was slow to move to the touch screens featured on
the bestselling iPhone and on the iPad, introduced this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nokia has been the leading developer of many key
technologies in mobile devices,&#8221; said Paul Melin, general
manager of patent licensing at Nokia. &#8220;We have taken this step
to protect the results of our pioneering development and to put
an end to continued unlawful use of Nokia&#8217;s innovation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal battle began in October, when Espoo, Finland-
based Nokia filed a lawsuit accusing Apple of infringing 10
patents. It demanded royalties on the more than 51 million
iPhones sold since Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs, 55,
introduced the device in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five patents in the newest complaint relate to enhanced
speech and data transmission, and antenna configurations that
improve performance and save space, Nokia said in a statement.
The patents aren&#8217;t the same ones at issue in cases in a federal
court in Delaware, and before the U.S. International Trade
Commission, according to Laurie Armstrong, a Nokia spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This suit shows Nokia is serious,&#8221; said Tero Kuittinen,
an analyst at Greenwich, Connecticut-based MKM Partners who
advises investors to sell Nokia shares. &#8220;Even in the last suit,
they brought out everything but the kitchen sink, covering user
interface, power consumption, speaker, camera. This is one of
the broadest clusters of patent litigation in the sector over
the past 10 years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia is believed to be planning a range of &#8220;jumbo
smartphones and tablets,&#8221; which could compete with the iPad, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint in the new case seeks an unspecified amount
of cash compensation and an order that would halt Apple&#8217;s use of
Nokia inventions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Cupertino, California-based
Apple, would only refer to the company&#8217;s court filings in
Delaware when asked for comment May 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a December filing, the company described Nokia as being
&#8220;focused on traditional mobile wireless handsets with
conventional user interfaces,&#8221; while Apple, is &#8220;long a leader
in computer technology&#8221; that &#8220;foresaw the importance of
converged user-friendly mobile devices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has risen about 83 percent in the past year, while
Nokia&#8217;s ADRs have dropped 26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia, which last month posted lower-than-estimated profit
on competition from the iPhone, is still working on a touch-
optimized version of the Symbian operating system that is
supposed to make its phones as easy to use as Apple&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court filings in December and February, Apple claimed
Nokia was trying to strong-arm Apple into surrendering access to
proprietary technology that differentiates the iPhone from other
smartphones. Apple said it doesn&#8217;t want to license its iPhone-
related patents to competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple also accused Nokia of purposefully withholding
information on patent holdings while helping to establish an
industry standard and then demanding unreasonable royalties on
those standards for Wi-Fi and wireless transmissions, among
other technologies. The allegations are part of a dispute in
federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, with the earliest trial
scheduled for 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each company has filed complaints with the U.S.
International Trade Commission in Washington in cases that could
result in a ban on imports of the other company&#8217;s phones.
Apple&#8217;s ITC complaint against Nokia is scheduled to be heard
beginning in October, while proceedings on Nokia&#8217;s complaint are
scheduled for January, according to the agency&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Durrant, a Nokia spokesman, said the company expects
the lawsuit filed May 7 in Wisconsin to be resolved in 12 to 18
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Madison court is known for holding patent trials more
quickly than many other courts. It takes, on average, about 12
months for a patent case to go trial in Madison, compared with a
nationwide average of 26.6 months, said Greg Upchurch, director
of research for St. Louis-based LegalMetric Inc., which compiles
litigation data for law firms and companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents in the Delaware case are considered essential
to follow industry standards, so Nokia is required to license
them on fair terms as it does to more than 40 companies, Durrant
said in an interview. The patents in the Wisconsin case aren&#8217;t
essential to any standard, so Nokia can refuse to license them
and just ask a judge to block use by Apple, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Nokia Corp. v. Apple Inc., 10cv249, U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin (Madison). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford Fusion Hybrid Targeted in Paice Patent Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford Motor Co.&#8217;s Fusion hybrid sedan is using patented
technology for its gasoline-electric engines without permission,
according to a lawsuit by a Florida company that won a similar
claim against Toyota Motor Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paice LLC sued Ford May 7, seeking unspecified cash
compensation. It stopped short of asking the court to halt sales
of the Fusion hybrid, a version of Ford&#8217;s best-selling car.
Marcey Evans, a spokeswoman for Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford,
said May 7 the automaker hadn&#8217;t reviewed the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota was ordered to pay $4.23 million to closely held
Paice in 2005 for infringing patents for engines in hybrid
Prius, Highlander and Lexus vehicles. The amount was based on a
royalty for each car sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford said May 3 it sold 2,726 of its four hybrid models in
April, which include versions of the Ford Escape, Mercury Milan,
Mercury Mariner and the Fusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paice&#8217;s patent 5,343,970 covers a method of supplying
torque, or force, to a car&#8217;s wheels from both an electric motor
and an internal combustion engine. Ford sued Paice in 2005,
seeking to invalidate this patent and others after licensing
talks broke down. The case was later dismissed because the judge
said Ford had no fear of infringement claims at that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new lawsuit filed by Paice in U.S. District Court in
Texarkana, Texas, would be before the same judge, David Folsom,
who presided over the Toyota case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota, the world&#8217;s largest automaker, lost a verdict that
was upheld in 2007 by an appeals court. Paice has since filed
another suit in Marshall, demanding royalties on newer models of
Toyota vehicles and has a pending case before the U.S.
International Trade Commission in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it loses the ITC case, scheduled for a hearing in July,
the Toyota City, Japan-based company could face a halt of
imports of its newest hybrid vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paice is represented by Samuel F. Baxter of McKool Smith
PC, and Ruffin B. Cordell, Linda Liu Kordziel,  Ahmed J. Davis,
Jonathan R. Putman, John S. Goetz and Robert E. Hillman of
Boston&#8217;s Fish  Richardson PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ford case is Paice v. Ford Motor Co., 10cv92, U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Texarkana). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Sues Florida Soft-Drink Company for Infringing Marks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest soft-drink maker,
sued a Florida company for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County Soda Systems Inc. of Pompano Beach, Florida, is
accused of selling soft-drink syrup and fountain-dispensing
equipment to costumers to enable them to pass off counterfeit
products and Coca-Cola&#8217;s sodas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola objected to the labels on County Soda&#8217;s
dispensing machines, which use the same distinctive Spenserian
script  employed on the Coca-Cola labels, and also to the
Florida company&#8217;s use of the word &#8220;classic.&#8221; The Atlanta-based
soft-drink company registered the phrase &#8220;Coca-Cola Classic&#8221;
in 1994, according to the database of the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in the complaint, filed May 6 in federal court in
Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is an article from the Miami New Times
newspaper in which the proprietor of County Soda acknowledged
making an &#8220;offbrand knockoff&#8221; and claimed it &#8220;tastes just
like what you&#8217;re looking for but costs the business owner
significantly less.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola sent County Soda a cease-and-desist letter April
1, 2009, and received a response from counsel for the Florida
company April 8. Frank Herrara of Rothstein, Rosenfeldt Adler
said his client County Soda &#8220;has limited knowledge of the
intricacies of intellectual property.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter, which is included in the court filing, promised
that new labels would be created for the client&#8217;s products, and
that County Soda would make no further use of the Spenserian
script or refer to their products as &#8220;Classic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these assurances, County Soda is still infringing,
according to court papers. The company is accused of continuing
to provide fountain dispensing equipment bearing Coca-Cola&#8217;s
trademarks to be used with the County Soda syrups &#8220;so as to
cause consumers to believe that the County Soda&#8217;s products&#8221;
were actually Coca-Cola&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Georgia soft-drink company asked the court to order
County Soda to halt its infringement, and for an award of all
the company&#8217;s profits derived from its alleged infringement. The
company also asked for attorney fees, litigation costs and money
damages, requesting that the damages be tripled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola is represented  by Isaac. J. Mitrani and Pamela
A. Chamberlin of Miami Beach, Florida-based Mitrani, Rynor,
Adamsky  Toland PA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is The Coca-Cola Co. v. County Soda Systems Inc.,

Florida (Fort Lauderdale) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthrex Trade Secret Suit Unjustified, Parcus Tells Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parcus Medical LLC, a maker of medical devices, denied
allegations it&#8217;s using trade secrets misappropriated from
competitor Arthrex Inc. of Naples, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Florida company sued Parcus in federal court in Fort
Myers, Florida, in March, claiming some of its former employees
violated non-compete agreements and brought proprietary
information to Parcus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the accused former employees is Mark Brunsvold,
founder of Parcus, which is based in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court papers, Brunsvold previously was
president of Machine Metals, an Arthrex supplier, which was
acquired by Arthrex in February 2002. After the acquisition
Brunsvold worked for Arthrex until May 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Parcus response, the Wisconsin company rejects
allegations of misappropriation, and says Arthrex failed to
identify any trade secrets that were allegedly misappropriated.
Instead, Parcus says, the case is a bad-faith attempt to use the
threat of expensive litigation &#8220;for the improper purpose of
suppressing lawful, fair competition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company noted that Arthrex didn&#8217;t file suit until seven
years after Brunsvold left, and said that &#8220;in an industry where
technological innovation is critical to commercial success,
whatever distant memories Brunsvold might have retained from
seven years ago would certainly be stale, outdated, not highly
confidential, not proprietary and commercially and
technologically valueless today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parcus also noted that the non-compete agreement Brunsvold
signed expired in June 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthrex is represented by Andrew H. Reiss of Naples,
Florida-based Cheffy Passidomo PA, and Anthony Cho and Todd W.
Barrett of Birmingham, Michigan&#8217;s Carlson, Gaskey  Olds PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parcus is represented by Alan M. Spiro and Simeon D. Brier
of Boston&#8217;s Edwards Angell Palmer  Dodge LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Anthrex Inc., v. Parcus Medical LLC, 2:10-cv-
00151-CEH-DNG, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida
(Ft. Myers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firelight Media Sued Over Use of &#8216;Wounded Knee&#8217; Photographs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firelight Media Inc., a New York-based independent film
producer, was sued for copyright infringement by a photographer
who shot images of the 1973 siege of the American Indian
Movement at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anne Pearse-Hocker is a photojournalist who was present in
the village of Wounded Knee during the siege and shot several
hundred still photos during that time. In 1996, she was asked to
donate her photos from Wounded Knee to the Smithsonian
Institution&#8217;s National Museum of the American Indian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she donated the photos, she specifically retained the
copyright, she said in the complaint she filed May 5 in federal
court in Alexandria, Virginia. She said the language regarding
conditions with respect to the copyright in her deed of gift was
drafted by the Smithsonian&#8217;s Office of General Counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firelight asked the Smithsonian for permission to use some
of her photos for a five-part miniseries that ran on public
broadcast stations beginning in May 2009. The credit line
accompanying the photos didn&#8217;t mention the photographer&#8217;s name,
and her permission wasn&#8217;t obtained for their use, she said in
her court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film, which was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in
Utah in 2009, has since been sold to the general public through
the Public Broadcasting System website and by retailers
including Amazon.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said as a result, &#8220;thousands of copies of her
photographs have been sold for commercial gain and profit
through sales of the film.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photographer said a Smithsonian official has
acknowledged that her images were used without her permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is suing the Smithsonian in a separate action in the
U.S. Court of Federal Claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her case against Firelight, she asked the court to order
Firelight to quit distributing her photos without permission,
and for the return of all of her photos that may be in the
production company&#8217;s possession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, she asked for money damages, litigation costs
and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is represented by Eric N. Heyer of Cleveland&#8217;s Thompson
Hine LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pearse-Hocker v. Firelight Media Inc., 1:10-cv-
00458-CMH,TRJ, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia
(Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper is looking &#8220;attractive&#8221;
after the recent selloff, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Copper fundamentals, which have begun to tighten, will
likely continue to do so as developed markets demand continues
to improve against slowing but still robust emerging markets
demand,&#8221; the bank said in an e-mailed report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper will be the first of the metals to hit supply
constraints on a sustained basis, the bank&#8217;s analysts including
Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal had its worst week in three months last week on
concern that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis may derail the global economic
recovery. Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 2.2 percent to $7,100.75 a metric ton
today, after tumbling 6.5 percent last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper prices more than doubled last year as government
stimulus packages, including China&#8217;s $586 billion program, drove
demand. Copper has fallen 4.1 percent this year on concern that
China&#8217;s measures to rein in lending and curb property
speculation will curb demand for the metal used in construction
and automobiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamentals for zinc are expected to &#8220;tighten
meaningfully&#8221; in the next 12 to 24 months, &#8220;hastened by mine
retirements,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These fundamental views suggest that price risk is skewed
to the upside for copper in the near-to-medium term and for zinc
in the medium-to-longer term, especially given the magnitude of
the recent pullback,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;Consumers should view price
dips in these metals as buying opportunities, with recent price
action providing a compelling opportunity for copper in
particular.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
buying a basket of Asian currencies against the yen, saying
there is &#8220;little obvious contagion&#8221; risk from Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank especially recommended the Malaysian ringgit,
Philippine peso and Indonesian rupiah because of &#8220;strong growth,
solid external balances and declining risk aversion,&#8221; according
to a research note today written by analysts including Fiona
Lake and Mark Tan. All 10 Asian emerging-market currencies
gained today versus the yen after the European Union unveiled an
unprecedented loan package to stop Greece&#8217;s fiscal woes from
spreading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given that European policy makers have now announced a
credible package to shore up the system in euroland, we expect
the market to turn its attention to trading the macro data,&#8221;
the report said. &#8220;The macro backdrop in Malaysia, Philippines
and Indonesia remains strong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ringgit led gains in Asian currencies versus the yen
this year, climbing 7.1 percent, followed by the rupiah with a
3.6 percent advance. The peso has climbed 2.2 percent against
the yen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs targets a basket of currencies including the
ringgit, peso and the rupiah to rise 6 percent against the yen,
without specifying a time frame. It recommended limiting losses
on the trade after a 2 percent decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia&#8217;s economy grew at the fastest pace in more than a
year last quarter, expanding 5.7 percent from a year earlier,
the Central Statistics Office said today. Malaysia&#8217;s gross
domestic product probably expanded 9.3 percent in the first
three months from a year earlier, after growing 4.5 percent the
previous quarter, a government report on May 13 may show,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen fell against all 10 Asian major currencies today as
demand for high-yielding assets surged after the Bank of Japan
said central banks from the U.S., Japan and Europe will
participate in temporary U.S. dollar swap agreements to contain
the debt crisis. European Union finance ministers announced an
aid package worth as much as 750 billion euros ($962 billion),
according to Spanish Economy Minister Elena Salgado. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen is a favorite currency for funding carry trades, in
which money borrowed in a nation with low interest rates is
invested in a country offering higher returns. The risk is that
currency moves erase those gains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union&#8217;s loan package
will halve the extra yield demanded to hold Portuguese, Spanish
and Italian two-year notes and send the euro toward $1.35, 
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc[bn:WBTKR=GS:US] .  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7 []50 billion-euro ($962 billion) agreement will reduce
the extra yield that investors demand to hold Portuguese two-
year securities over comparable German notes to about 250 basis
points, to about 118 points for Spanish notes and to about 90
points for Italian notes, Francesco Garzarelli, a London-based 
analyst, wrote in an e-mailed note today. The euro will &#8220;return
towards&#8221; Goldman Sachs&#8217;s three-month forecast of $1.35, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Short of fiscal federalism, the mutual support plan
launched tonight goes to the heart of the matter, and fortifies
euro-zone institutions, endowing them more flexibility tools to
deal with future crises,&#8221; Garzarelli wrote. &#8220;But the true
&#8216;circuit-breaker&#8217; will no doubt be the ECB&#8217;s unprecedented
involvement in the secondary markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four of the largest U.S. banks,
including Citigroup Inc., racked up perfect quarters in their
trading businesses between January and March, underscoring how
government support and less competition is fueling Wall Street&#8217;s
revival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., the first, second and fifth-biggest U.S. banks
by assets, all said in regulatory filings that they had zero
days of trading losses in the first quarter. Citigroup Inc., the
third-largest, doesn&#8217;t break out its daily trading revenue by
quarter. It recorded a profit on each trading day, two people
with knowledge of the results said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trading profits of the Street is just another way of
measuring the subsidy the Fed is giving to the banks,&#8221; said
Christopher Whalen, managing director of Torrance, California-
based Institutional Risk Analytics. &#8220;It&#8217;s a transfer from
savers to banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trading results, which helped the banks report higher
quarterly profit than analysts estimated even as unemployment
stagnated at a 27-year high, came with a big assist from the
Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank helped lenders by holding
short-term borrowing costs near zero, giving them a chance to
profit by carrying even 10-year government notes that yielded an
average of 3.70 percent last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s largest
media company, said fiscal second-quarter profit climbed 55
percent on a rebound at the film studio. The shares fell after
the television units&#8217; profit missed some analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming costs rose at ESPN, which had a &#8220;mid-single-
digits&#8221; percentage increase in advertising sales, Burbank,
California-based Disney said today. The ABC broadcast network
was hampered by lower prime-time ratings and higher expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cable network margins were a little bit light of what
people were expecting,&#8221; said Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen 
Co. in San Francisco. &#8220;Disney had talked about how they were
going to have sports programming-rights expenses, but I think
the magnitude of that caught some people by surprise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell $1.20, or 3.4 percent, to $34.56 in extended
trading after the results were announced. The shares gained 47
cents to $35.76 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading and have increased 11 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to $953 million, or 48 cents a share, from
$613 million, or 33 cents, a year earlier, Disney said in a
statement. That beat the 46-cent average of 22 analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in the period ended April
3 gained 6.1 percent to $8.58 billion after the January takeover
of Marvel Entertainment. Analysts expected $8.42 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookings Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hotel reservations at the theme parks are pacing down 10
percent in the current quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a conference call after the results. The company
is using fewer discounts to lure visitors to parks near Orlando,
Florida, and in Anaheim, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To the extent that they had a beat in the quarter it was
driven by film. I think people would rather have seen it
driven by cable and parks,&#8221; Creutz, who rates the shares
&#8220;neutral,&#8221; said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit in the cable division led by ESPN totaled $1.18
billion, short of the $1.21 billion estimate of Imran Khan, an
analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. who has a neutral rating on the
stock. Revenue in the division, including the Disney Channel,
gained 9.4 percent to $2.41 billion, led by increases in
affiliate fees, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad Revenue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN&#8217;s ad revenue was up by a &#8220;mid-single-digits&#8221;
percentage in the quarter, Rasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovery Communications Inc., the owner of Animal Planet,
reported a 9 percent gain in U.S. cable ad revenue last week.
Time Warner Inc., the owner of CNN and TBS, said cable ad sales
gained 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sometimes some of the numbers we see out there are not
apples-to-apples across different companies,&#8221; Rasulo said. He
said Disney reports ad revenue that includes cash sales and
make-goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit in Disney&#8217;s broadcast division, including ABC, fell
24 percent to $123 million, while revenue gained 1.1 percent to
$1.43 billion. Khan had expected profit of $170.1 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current quarter, prices for commercials on ABC sold
close to air date are up 30 percent from spots sold last year in
advance of the current TV season, Disney said. Ad sales at ESPN
and the TV stations are pacing up by &#8220;double digits&#8221; compared
with a year ago, Rasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN Ad Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide ticket sales of $960.4 million for the 3-D
&#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; revived Disney&#8217;s film profit. Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger named Rich Ross, former head of
the Disney Channel, to lead the studio in October and completed
the $4.2 billion purchase of Marvel, maker of &#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; in
January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by &#8220;Alice,&#8221; which was shown in three-dimensional and
standard format, the studio reported a profit of $223 million,
compared with $13 million a year earlier. Revenue increased 7
percent to $1.54 billion from $1.44 billion a year earlier, when
Disney&#8217;s films included &#8220;Race to Witch Mountain&#8221; and
&#8220;Confessions of a Shopaholic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; distributed by Viacom Inc.&#8217;s Paramount, has
collected $323.4 million in global ticket sales as of May 9,
according to Box Office Mojo, a unit of Seattle-based Amazon.com
Inc. &#8220;Toy Story 3,&#8221; from Disney&#8217;s Pixar studio, will be in
theaters on June 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit from theme parks fell 12 percent to $150 million,
while revenue gained 1.7 percent to $2.45 billion as higher
guest spending countered a drop in attendance. Pension and
retiree medical costs rose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Pakistani man detained by Chilean
police after entering the U.S. Embassy in Santiago yesterday
with explosive residues on his documents was having his U.S.
visa revoked, State Department officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Saif-Ur-Rehman Khan, 28, was called to the embassy
after it decided to revoke his visa to the U.S., State
Department spokesman Philip Crowley told reporters in Washington
today. Khan triggered security detectors searching for explosive
residues among his belongings, U.S. Ambassador Paul Simons said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;During the routine visitor screening process, we
uncovered evidence of explosives and as a result we contacted
Chilean authorities and they escorted him off the premises,&#8221;
Simons said in a telephone interview from Santiago. He said the
residue was detected on documents, without giving more details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khan will be charged with breaking Chile&#8217;s laws on the
controls of weapons and explosives, Chilean police spokesman
Jose Mora said in a phone interview. Khan had entered Chile from
the U.S. on a 90-day tourist visa, Mora said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls to the office of Helmuth Vargas, the public defender
assigned to the case, weren&#8217;t answered. Calls to reach Khan via
Pakistan&#8217;s embassy in Santiago weren&#8217;t answered.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The episode illustrated that embassy security was
effective, Crowley said. The U.S. will cooperate fully in the
Chilean investigation, he said, and conduct its own probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events at the Santiago embassy come after Faisal Shahzad was arrested in connection with a failed May 1 attempt
to detonate a bomb in New York City&#8217;s Times Square. The Obama
administration has said that Shazad, a naturalized U.S. citizen
born in Pakistan, received training and funding from the
Pakistani Taliban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crowley said he isn&#8217;t aware of any connection between the
incident at the embassy and the attempted attack on Times
Square. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase
 Co. and Wells Fargo  Co. would face new limits on debit-card
fees under a proposal from U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Democrat wants to amend the financial overhaul
bill by directing the Federal Reserve to ensure that debit-card
&#8220;swipe&#8221; fees charged to merchants &#8220;are reasonable and
proportional to the processing costs,&#8221; said a fact sheet
distributed by Durbin today. Lenders with assets of less than
$1 billion, or 91 percent of U.S. banks, would be exempt, said
the fact sheet provided by spokesman Max Gleischman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amendment would let retailers offer discounts for cash,
checks or debit cards, or for a particular card brand, and allow
them to decline credit cards for &#8220;small-dollar&#8221; purchases.
Durbin, the Senate&#8217;s No. 2 Democrat, agreed last week to file
one amendment instead of six. Analysts have cast doubt on
whether Durbin&#8217;s proposals can muster enough votes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to believe these amendments lack broad
political support, but can&#8217;t rule out the possibility of some
minor legislation being enacted amid anti-bank furor in D.C.,&#8221;
Jason Kupferberg, an analyst with UBS Securities LLC, said today
in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers and regulators have been seeking new curbs on
card fees after the recession made it harder to keep up with
payments and spurred complaints about excessive charges. U.S.
merchants paid fees of $19.7 billion last year tied to Visa and
MasterCard debit transactions, according to the Nilson Report,
an industry newsletter based in Carpinteria, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fees averaged 1.63 percent of each transaction, Nilson
reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hired
Christopher Cowen, who advised Harvard University on its debt,
to be co-head of its higher-education investment-banking group,
according to an internal e-mail obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He joins from San Francisco-based investment bank Prager,
Sealy  Co., where he worked for about 18 years, and will run
the group with R. Thornton Lurie, according to the e-mail,
confirmed by Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cowen, who didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking
comment, advised Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Harvard when it
agreed to pay $922 million to unwind $1.9 billion of interest-
rate swaps amid the credit crisis in December 2008, according to
documents filed with a state bond authority obtained by
Bloomberg News. Some of the termination payments were made to
Goldman Sachs, according to the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest-rate swaps are a type of derivative linked to debt
where two parties exchange payments, typically a fixed annual
amount for one that changes weekly or monthly. Harvard unwound
its swaps after deciding to delay capital projects and cut
borrowing plans and because the agreements forced the university
to post hundreds of millions of dollars of collateral to its
banks as interest rates fell, school officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Prager in 1992, Cowen worked for the
municipal-derivative products department at Merrill Lynch,
according to the company&#8217;s website. He will be a managing
director for Goldman Sachs in San Francisco, according to the
memo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial markets are likely to
remain volatile as investors weigh the consequences of Europe&#8217;s
rescue package, said Gary Cohn, president and chief operating
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will continue to have relatively volatile markets
until we get a better understanding,&#8221; Cohn said today at a
conference in New York hosted by UBS AG. &#8220;To the extent that
the understanding is that it is a socialization of the risk into
many of the other European economies, we may have continued
negative fallout from that because there is an overall view that
some of those other European economies are not strong enough
themselves to be part of a global bailout.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European policy makers yesterday unveiled a loan package
worth almost $1 trillion and a program of bond purchases in an
effort to stop a sovereign-debt crisis that could jeopardize the
euro. The euro and stocks surged around the world yesterday,
then reversed course earlier today. New York-based Goldman Sachs
generates more revenue from sales and trading than any Wall
Street bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think 24 hours after the realization that there&#8217;s a
solution in Europe, people are more reflective right now on what
does that solution mean longer term?&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;Are we
socializing the risk throughout Europe? What does it mean to
other weaker European countries?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s infrequent
sales and trading losses are evidence that the division doesn&#8217;t
depend on proprietary trading to generate revenue, President and
Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is often speculation that proprietary trading
revenues drive our outperformance in these businesses,&#8221; Cohn
said today at a financial services conference hosted by UBS AG
in New York. &#8220;Over the last 12 months we have only recorded 11
loss days. It is implausible that a proprietary-driven business
model could be right 96 percent of the time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which makes more money from sales and
trading than any Wall Street firm, reported yesterday that it
made at least $25 million trading every single day of the first
quarter, the first perfect quarter in the company&#8217;s history. The
company&#8217;s fixed-income, currencies and commodities business,
known as FICC, and equities unit generate those returns by
making markets for clients rather than betting the firm&#8217;s own
money, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The simple answer is that our FICC and equities
businesses are largely global market-making businesses where we
intermediate flows and commit capital and liquidity and in the
process generate revenue including bid-offer spreads,&#8221; Cohn
said. &#8220;These franchises create numerous opportunities for the
firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South African food retailers
including Shoprite Holdings Ltd. and Spar Group Ltd. are favored
over local clothing and furniture retailers as food inflation
accelerates, according to JPMorgan Cazenove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors should be overweight the food retailers, as we
believe that the sector could re-rate and outperform the
discretionary counters as food inflation picks up,&#8221;
Johannesburg-based analyst Sean Holmes wrote in a note to
investors today. Higher electricity costs and fuel prices &#8220;will
add impetus to food prices over the next six months,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eskom Holdings Ltd., which supplies about 95 percent of
South Africa&#8217;s electricity, on Feb. 24 won permission to raise
fees by 24.8 percent this year. The price of gasoline, which is
regulated by the Department of Energy, has risen for four
consecutive months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank of Africa&#8217;s biggest economy has cut its
benchmark interest rate seven times to 6.5 percent since
December 2008 to help pull the economy out of its first
recession in 17 years. Consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of expenditure, has been slow to respond to the
recovery after 870,000 jobs were lost last year and bad debts
increased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoprite, South Africa&#8217;s biggest food retailer, had its
price estimate raised 2.8 percent to 98.02 rand at JPMorgan,
while Spar, the grocery and liquor retailer, was increased by 17
percent to 93.82 rand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woolworths Holdings Ltd., a food and clothing retailer,
Shoprite and JD Group Ltd., which sells furniture, are
JPMorgan&#8217;s top picks in the South African retail industry,
Holmes said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JD Group has dropped 21 percent this year, matching the
decline in the FTSE/JSE Africa General Retailers Index. The
retreat in JD Group&#8217;s share price has been &#8220;overdone&#8221; and the
stock &#8220;still offers good value to longer-term investors,&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc., a southern
Appalachia coal producer, led miners lower amid skepticism on
whether the European bailout will help global economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter fell $5.47, or 6.9 percent, to $73.83 as of 10:34
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Alpha Natural
Resources Inc., the third-largest U.S. coal company, lost $2.37,
or 5.3 percent, to $42.15. Consol Energy Inc., a coal and
natural gas producer, slid $2.06, or 4.9 percent, to $39.64. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities declined amid concern that the plan by European
policy makers to lend almost $1 trillion to the most-indebted
countries won&#8217;t solve the region&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The higher beta names are down a little bit today after
the euphoria of yesterday,&#8221; said Mike Dudas, an analyst at
Jefferies  Co. Inc. in New York. &#8220;Coal equities tend to be
volatile and subject to rapid money flows. The fear trade is in
the commodities. More general nervousness about global growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patriot Coal Corp., the fourth-largest eastern U.S. coal
company, slumped 91 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $18.57. Arch Coal
Inc., the second-biggest U.S. coal producer, fell 75 cents, or
2.9 percent, to $24.61. Peabody Energy Corp., the biggest U.S.
coal company, lost $1.48, or 3.3 percent, to $43.12. Massey
Energy Co., the sixth-biggest, dropped $1.06, or 2.9 percent, to
$34.71. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beta is a measurement of volatility. High-beta stocks are
more volatile. Coal is a measure of the economy as it is used to
generate electricity and to make steel. Metallurgical forms of
the fuel are needed by steelmakers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuwait Oil Co., the state-owned
exploration and production company, is holding talks with Royal
Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and Exxon Mobil Corp. to develop
heavy-crude deposits to boost output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need the heavy oil to help us reach 4 million barrels
a day by 2020,&#8221; Chairman Sami al-Rushaid said in Doha today.
&#8220;The first step is to produce 60,000 barrels a day by 2015 or
2016, and reach 270,000 barrels by 2020.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current oil production capacity will reach 3.3 million
barrels a day this year, including output from the Neutral Zone
that Kuwait shares with Saudi Arabia, al-Rushaid said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuwait has yet to start developing heavy oil after signing
a memorandum of understanding in 2007 with Exxon Mobil, and has
now started discussions with other companies over the Lower
Fares field. The country needs the advanced technology of
international oil companies to raise production from existing
fields. Since Kuwait&#8217;s Parliament is opposed to allowing foreign
oil companies to develop the nation&#8217;s hydrocarbon resources, the
nation is only seeking technical help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Discussions are going on,&#8221; al-Rushaid said. &#8220;There is
some progress but still we haven&#8217;t reached an agreement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from heavy oil, Kuwait will reach its 2020 output
target by enhancing capacity from existing fields. Last year,
capacity increases came from the Burgan field, and this year the
increase is coming from the northern fields, al-Rushaid said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending Plans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuwait Oil is spending 5 billion dinars to 7 billion dinars
($17 billion to $24 billion) in the next five years on projects
as it seeks to boost oil and gas output, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the country is not exploring for new oilfields, &#8220;we
have an aggressive exploration program for gas,&#8221; al-Rushaid
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, Shell signed an enhanced technical services
contract to help boost output from Kuwait&#8217;s Jurassic natural-gas
reserves. The country plans to produce 600 million cubic feet a
day of non-associated gas, or gas that does not accompany oil
production, from these reserves by 2013, and 1 billion cubic
feet a day by 2015 or 2016, al-Rushaid said. Target output is
2.5 billion cubic feet a day of this deep gas by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc are considering a sale of natural-gas storage capacity
in Germany as they focus on exploration, according to three
people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies may begin the process next month after
deciding what assets to sell from their BEB Erdgas und Erdoel
GmbH unit, said one of the people, who declined to be identified
because the plans are private. The price would depend on what
parts are sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell and Exxon hold equal stakes in the Hanover, Germany-
based gas-storage operator, which has about 2 billion cubic
meters of working storage spread over three facilities in the
north of the country, according to its Web site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy companies are selling filling stations, pipelines
and refineries as they boost spending on oil and gas production
to take advantage of rising prices. Shell is divesting two
German refineries to curb costs and spending, while Exxon sold a
stake in a Norwegian pipe network in April as it reviews assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BEB storage assets may attract energy suppliers seeking
to stockpile gas to lessen the impact of price fluctuations. Gas
futures in the U.K., Europe&#8217;s largest market for the fuel,
slumped 43 percent in 2009 and are up 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas-Price Volatility &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The attraction of this kind of asset has risen because of
volatility on the gas market,&#8221; said Christian Kleindienst, an
analyst at UniCredit SpA&#8217;s Munich unit with a &#8220;market weight&#8221;
rating on Shell bonds and no coverage of Exxon notes. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t want to be just a middleman -- utilities will be looking
to bolster their margins by securing gas they can use to counter
price fluctuations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Williams, a spokesman for Shell, declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News today. Gabriele Radke, a
spokeswoman for ExxonMobil Central Europe Holding GmbH, didn&#8217;t
immediately answer an e-mail seeking comment and a call to her
office went unanswered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, sold its 9.43 percent
stake in Norwegian gas-pipeline network Gassled to Njord Gas
Infrastructure AS last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell said May 6 that it&#8217;s in talks with potential buyers
for some of its liquefied petroleum gas assets. The company is
also in discussions with India&#8217;s Essar Oil Ltd. and other
interested parties on the sale of three refineries in Germany
and the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Shell sold about 3,100 kilometers (1,925 miles)
of gas pipelines in Germany to Dutch grid operator Nederlandse
Gasunie NV in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Germany&#8217;s gas storage is located in the north of
the country, where rock formations are suited to holding the
fuel. BEB also sells crude oil and sulfur, according to its Web
site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should expect higher
commodity prices because stronger manufacturing is bolstering
demand, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said it favors crude oil and industrial and
precious metals. JPMorgan&#8217;s global manufacturing indicator rose
to 57.8 last month, close to a record, analysts including Ruy Ribeiro wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Conditions for future commodity demand growth are more
supportive now than a month ago and will continue to improve,&#8221;
global commodity strategist Ribeiro wrote. &#8220;We remain positive
on improving fundamentals, but prices are likely to remain under
pressure near term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan joined Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays
Capital in saying demand for commodities is improving. A decline
in prices this month created a &#8220;buying opportunity,&#8221; Goldman
analysts including Jeffrey Currie said in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials slumped
5.9 percent last week, the worst performance since December
2008, on concern that Greece&#8217;s debt crisis would spread and curb
economic growth in Europe. Stock markets and commodities
rebounded yesterday after European policy makers unveiled an
almost $1 trillion bailout plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial metals and crude oil fell today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Downside risks to prices are increasing and will continue
to do so if the sovereign crisis last a lot longer and starts
hurting growth prospects,&#8221; the JPMorgan analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World oil demand will rise by 1.7 million barrels a day
this year, with China accounting for about a third of that, the
bank said. New York-traded crude will average $94 a barrel in
the next quarter, then $93 in the final three months, the
analysts said. It was at $75.73 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold will average $1,250 an ounce in the third quarter,
then $1,200 in the last three months of the year, according to
the bank. The metal was at $1,209.98 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange will average
$8,000 a ton this quarter, and will start declining in the
second half, averaging $7,150 a ton in the third quarter, then
$6,750 a ton. The contract was at $6,955 today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A BP Plc investor has sued the
company&#8217;s board of directors on claims its pursuit of profits at
the expense of safety led to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill that
could cost the company billions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit claims Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward and
other directors who sit on internal environmental and ethics
panels failed to improve safety practices as promised by a
settlement in an earlier shareholder lawsuit over a fatal
explosion at BP&#8217;s Texas City refinery and oil leaks at company
pipelines in Alaska. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even after a 2006 shareholder derivative proceeding
brought as a last resort to require BP to address safety
concerns was voluntarily settled out of court, these defendants
continued to ignore and disregard safety issues concerning the
company&#8217;s deepwater operations,&#8221; Lewis Kahn, of Kahn, Swick 
Foti LLP, said in papers filed May 7 in New Orleans federal
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directors made &#8220;purely cosmetic changes at the
corporate level while ignoring the substance of the safety
violations and the threat they posed to the entirety of the
Gulf, commercial and private property, and the company&#8217;s own
survival as a going concern,&#8221; Kahn said in the filing on behalf
of Katherine Firpo, a shareholder since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP spokesman Scott Dean declined to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP directors &#8220;elected to cut costs, including safety and
maintenance expenditures, in pursuit of profitable results to
report to Wall Street,&#8221; Kahn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 5,000 barrels of oil a day have been leaking from
a damaged subsea well 40 miles off the Louisiana coast,
following last month&#8217;s explosion and sinking of the Deepwater
Horizon, which was under hire to BP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Firpo v. Hayward et al, 2:10-cv-01430, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Loses Motion to Dismiss Alabama Sewer Bond Fraud Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. lost a bid to dismiss a lawsuit filed
by Jefferson County, Alabama, that claims the bank enticed it
into a risky refinancing of about $3 billion of sewer debt by
making $8 million in payments to friends of county officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circuit Judge Caryl Penney Privett in Birmingham rejected
the New York-based bank&#8217;s arguments that the county is barred by
the statue of limitations, a time limit for bringing action, and
its contention that the county failed to show that JPMorgan was
involved in a conspiracy, in a ruling issued May 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County, in the suit filed in November, alleged
fraud, conspiracy and &#8220;unjust enrichment against those who have
brought the county and its citizens to the brink of financial
disaster while lining their own pockets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, advised
the state&#8217;s most populous county in 2002 and 2003 to enter into
a series of floating-rate bond and interest-rate swaps that
created an &#8220;inherently flawed financial structure that imploded
within just a few years,&#8221; according to the county&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles LeCroy and Douglas MacFaddin, also named in the
suit, were the managing directors at New York-based JPMorgan who
oversaw the sewer-debt transactions. LeCroy and MacFaddin are
accused of arranging $8.2 million in illegal payments to local
broker-dealers who were friends of county commissioners, in
exchange for the county&#8217;s business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Langford, former mayor of Birmingham and president of
the county commission at the time of the debt refinancing, is
serving a 15-year sentence in a federal prison in Kentucky for
accepting $241,000 in bribes from William Blount, of Montgomery
investment firm Blount Parrish  Co. Blount was paid $2.8
million by JPMorgan during the bond transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million settlement
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end a probe
into derivative sales to the county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank paid $50 million outright to the county, and
agreed to cancel $647 million in fees the county faced to unwind
the transactions. JPMorgan, which also paid $25 million to be
placed in a fund to compensate affected investors, neither
admitted nor denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trafigura Asked to Pay $157 Million in Fees in Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trafigura Beheer BV was asked to pay as much as 105 million
pounds ($157 million) in legal costs by the law firm that
represented Ivory Coast residents who said they were made sick
by waste dumped from a ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trafigura, a closely held commodities trading company,
called the amount &#8220;staggering&#8221; and told a London court that
the fees sought by lawyers at Leigh Day  Co. is almost three
times what the company agreed to pay in a settlement last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am told that this is one of the largest, if not the
largest, costs case in legal history,&#8221; Sean Wilken, a lawyer
for Trafigura, said at a hearing yesterday. In comparison
Trafigura spent 14 million pounds on its defense, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trafigura last year settled the lawsuit filed by Leigh Day
on behalf of Ivory Coast residents who claimed to have fallen
ill from waste dumping in 2006. The company agreed to pay
thousands of residents about 1,000 pounds each, a lawyer for the
residents said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Alistair MacDuff said that the costs issue should
be decided by a specialist judge at a hearing later this year or
early next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste from a ship hired by Trafigura four years ago was
given to a local company, Compagnie Tommy, and was dumped near
Ivory Coast&#8217;s commercial capital, Abidjan. Residents claimed the
pollution caused deaths and widespread illness. An Ivory Coast
appeals court in 2008 dropped criminal charges against
Amsterdam-based Trafigura. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British Airways Executives Cleared in Cartel Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four current and former British Airways Plc executives were
acquitted of price-fixing charges at a London court after the
prosecution&#8217;s case collapsed amid problems with evidence,
including corrupted e-mails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of Fair Trading, the U.K.&#8217;s antitrust regulator,
asked jurors yesterday to give a not guilty verdict at the
criminal trial after saying it had overlooked thousands of e-
mails to or from a Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. employee related
to fuel surcharges and other issues related to the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The watchdog had accused the men of scheming with Virgin
Atlantic to fix fuel surcharges on trans-Atlantic flights from
July 2004 through April 2006. Virgin won immunity by admitting
its role in the scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There can be only one verdict, not guilty,&#8221; prosecutor
Richard Latham told the jury after saying the OFT wouldn&#8217;t offer
any evidence. He explained how e-mails were recovered from
Virgin computers too late and weren&#8217;t provided to the defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury cleared Andrew Crawley, British Airways&#8217; head of
sales; Martin George, a former board member; Iain Burns, ex-head
of communications; and Alan Burnett, former head of U.K. and
Ireland sales. They each faced as many as five years in prison
if found guilty of operating a cartel with Virgin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OFT said in a statement that it will review Virgin
Atlantic&#8217;s cooperation in the probe and whether it should lose
immunity from any civil penalties in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The OFT will also be reviewing the role played by Virgin
Atlantic and its advisers in light of the airline&#8217;s obligations
to provide the OFT with continuous and complete cooperation,&#8221;
the OFT said in the statement. &#8220; This may have potential
consequences for Virgin&#8217;s immunity from penalties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virgin said in a separate statement that it denies any
suggestion that it hasn&#8217;t fully co-operated with the OFT and
there is no reason to withdraw any immunity granted in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside court, George said he was relieved by the outcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve maintained my innocence since day one,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I want to get on with the rest of my life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense lawyer Ben Emmerson told the jury that the OFT is
&#8220;guilty of incompetence on a monumental scale,&#8221; and that the
regulator&#8217;s chief, John Fingleton, &#8220;must shoulder personal
responsibility for this fiasco.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OFT spokeswoman Kasia Reardon declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recovered e-mails showed that at least some of Virgin&#8217;s
surcharges were increased without any consultation with British
Airways, Emmerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors had said the carriers colluded from July 2004
through April 2006 to match fees to cover rising fuel costs. The
U.K. criminalized antitrust violations in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glaxo Said to Pay $60 Million in Avandia Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Plc agreed to pay about $60 million in the
first settlements of lawsuits alleging the company&#8217;s Avandia
diabetes drug causes heart attacks and strokes in some users,
people familiar with the accords say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo, the U.K.&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, agreed to resolve more
than 700 Avandia suits filed by three attorneys, including
Houston-based plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer Mark Lanier and Philadelphia-
based litigator Sol Weiss, the people said. The settlements come
as Glaxo is set to face its first Avandia trial in state court
in Philadelphia in July. The company faces about 4,000 lawsuits
that have been filed so far over the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Anne Rhyne, a U.S. spokeswoman for London-based Glaxo,
said she couldn&#8217;t immediately comment on the Avandia settlements
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators approved Avandia for sale in the U.S. in 1999
and the medicine tallied annual revenue of $3 billion by 2006,
including sales of a combination of Avandia and another drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avandia sales plunged after a May 2007 report in the New
England Journal of Medicine linked the drug to a 43 percent
increased risk of heart attacks, prompting U.S. and European
regulators to order Glaxo to strengthen its warnings. Avandia
was the world&#8217;s best-selling diabetes pill before safety
concerns emerged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Avandia Marketing, Sales Practices and
Products Liability Litigation, 07-1871, U.S. District Court for
Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Book Accord Violates Treaties, Opponent Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $125 million settlement that would allow Google Inc. to
create the world&#8217;s biggest digital-book library breaks
international laws and treaties, according to a memo written by
an opponent of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On its face&#8221; the agreement &#8220;eviscerates copyright
owners&#8217; exclusive rights&#8221; to approve the reproduction of their
books, wrote Cynthia Arato, a lawyer representing authors in New
Zealand, Italy, Austria and other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her memo was released by the Open Book Alliance, which is
leading the challenge to the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Denny Chin in New York is deciding
whether to approve the agreement. Google was sued in 2005 by
authors and publishers who said the company was infringing their
copyrights on a massive scale by digitizing books and allowing
&#8220;snippets&#8221; of them to be seen online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement would create a Book Rights Registry to
compensate copyright holders and public access to certain books
through Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp., which makes an e-book reader that competes with
Amazon.com&#8217;s Kindle and is a Google partner, has said the
agreement would promote competition in the electronic book
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement would give Google immunity from copyright
laws, allowing the company to distribute millions of books on
the Internet in exchange for sharing revenue it generates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If approved, Arato said the agreement would violate an
internationally respected copyright treaty from 1886 and allow
exceptions for copyright holders in Australia, Canada and the
U.K. that run counter to a World Trade Organization accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign copyright holders would have to tell Google it
didn&#8217;t want to be part of the settlement in an &#8220;opt-out&#8221;
process that is &#8220;burdensome,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement was reached with the Author&#8217;s Guild, Pearson
Plc&#8217;s Penguin and Education units, McGraw-Hill Cos., John Wiley
 Sons Inc. and CBS Corp.&#8217;s Simon  Schuster subsidiary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Authors Guild v. Google Inc., 05cv8136, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affiliated Computer Settles Case Over Xerox Takeover &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affiliated Computer Services Inc.&#8217;s shareholder lawsuit
over the company&#8217;s $6 billion takeover by Xerox Corp., set to
begin trial yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court, was
tentatively settled. Terms weren&#8217;t immediately released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement &#8220;all came together at the last minute,&#8221;
investors&#8217; lawyer Stephen Lowey of White Plains, New York, said
in a phone interview. He said terms of the settlement may be
released on May 13, after the paperwork is completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors alleged ACS directors wrongly agreed to allow
former Chairman Darwin Deason to collect a &#8220;massive incremental
premium&#8221; in the buyout, completed in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This premium put Deason&#8217;s overall payout over the $1
billion mark,&#8221; including $340 million in convertible stock,
$600 million in common stock and $200 million in &#8220;personal
benefits,&#8221; plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer Stuart M. Grant said May 4 in
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deason&#8217;s lawyer David C. McBride said in a May 7 brief to
Judge Donald Parsons Jr. in Wilmington, Delaware, that the
transaction was &#8220;demonstrably fair&#8221; and shareholders targeted
Deason &#8220;to extract further consideration for themselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McBride said founder Deason built ACS into a Fortune 500
company in 20 years, and investors &#8220;have been remarkably well
served by Darwin Deason&#8217;s stewardship.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACS said Sept. 28 that Xerox would buy each share for
$18.60 in cash plus 4.935 Xerox shares. ACS was sued by a union
and a pension fund. They claimed the price was too low and
Deason was getting an unfair windfall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Langsenkamp, a Xerox spokesman, had no immediate
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Sheet Metal Workers Local 28 v. Affiliated
Computer Services, CA4933, and New Orleans Employees&#8217; Retirement
System v. Deason CA4940 (Consolidated), Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elena Kagan Selected by Obama for U.S. Supreme Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama selected Elena Kagan, his top U.S.
Supreme Court lawyer and the former dean of Harvard Law School,
to fill a vacancy on the court and for the first time give it
three female members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan, 50, would succeed retiring Justice John Paul Stevens
and likely take his place in the court&#8217;s liberal wing on many
issues. She would be the youngest member of the nine-justice
court and the only one who hadn&#8217;t previously served as a lower
court judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama called Kagan a &#8220;trailblazing leader&#8221; who became the
first woman to lead Harvard Law School and then the first female
solicitor general. Pointing to her advocacy as solicitor general
in support of securities lawsuits, he said she &#8220;has repeatedly
defended the rights of shareholders and ordinary citizens
against unscrupulous corporations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York native and former Clinton administration
official, Kagan will face attacks from Republicans for opposing
military recruiting on the Harvard campus because of the
services&#8217; gay ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirmation is probable because Democrats and independents
hold 59 seats in the Senate and need help from only a single
Republican to ensure a floor vote on the nomination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan last year won confirmation as solicitor general on a
61-31 vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and
member of the Judiciary Committee, said he has &#8220;been generally
pleased&#8221; with Kagan&#8217;s performance as solicitor general,
especially on legal issues related to the war on terror. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy predicted
Kagan will be confirmed. He called her a &#8220;superb nominee&#8221; and
said he is pleased that Obama chose someone from &#8220;outside the
judicial monastery.&#8221; Leahy, a Vermont Democrat whose panel will
hold her confirmation hearings, predicted the process will be
completed in time for her to take the bench for the court&#8217;s next
term in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans began questioning her qualifications. Senate
Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said lawmakers
&#8220;will carefully review her brief litigation experience&#8221; and
weigh whether Kagan shows any ideological predisposition in
deciding cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan received a bachelor&#8217;s degree at Princeton University,
a master&#8217;s in philosophy at Oxford University&#8217;s Worcester
College and a law degree at Harvard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She clerked for Thurgood Marshall, whom she describes as
one of her heroes, and spent two years as a litigator at
Williams  Connolly LLP in Washington. She later took a teaching
job at the University of Chicago Law School, where she helped
recruit Obama to the faculty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan worked in the Clinton administration&#8217;s White House
counsel&#8217;s office and then as a domestic policy adviser, acting
as the administration&#8217;s lead negotiator on anti-tobacco
legislation. In 2003, she became the first female dean of
Harvard Law School. &lt;/p&gt;

Jeremy Gerard</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;British critics have been set
atwitter that the abundantly laureled stage satire &#8220;Enron&#8221;
expired on Broadway Sunday night after barely three weeks,
losing its entire $3.6 million capitalization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In London, the show has been a runaway hit since opening
last January in the West End after a sold-out run at the Royal
Court. Here in New York, &#8220;Enron&#8221; didn&#8217;t receive a single major
Tony nomination other than best score -- and it&#8217;s not even a
musical! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since 9/11 the insular Americans have become terribly
sensitive to criticism,&#8221; Jerry de Groot wrote in the Telegraph.
&#8220;They don&#8217;t mind when Jon Stewart dumps bucketloads of heavy-
handed political satire on the &#8216;Daily Show,&#8217; but they get tetchy
when the criticism is delivered with an English accent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Billington, the critic of the U.K.&#8217;s Guardian,
suggested Americans were just too stupid to appreciate a satire
requiring a sense of history and a modest understanding of
accounting legerdemain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If &#8216;Enron&#8217;s&#8217; melancholy saga proves anything,&#8221;
Billington wrote, &#8220;it is Broadway&#8217;s irrelevance to serious
theatre.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added this: &#8220;At heart, Broadway is a big, gaudy
commercial shop-window, where fortunes are won and lost.&#8221; Stop
the presses! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comic Strip &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the abrupt closing shocked me, too. &#8220;Enron&#8221; isn&#8217;t
a great play. But a big, gaudy commercial entertainment? It&#8217;s
that in spades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rupert Goold&#8217;s production of Lucy Prebble&#8217;s broad-stroke
comic strip was as gimcrack as any American idiot could want. It
had four whimsical LED-eyed Velocirapting humanoids devouring
debt. And hot office sex, starring doughy nerd turned master of
his universe Jeffrey Skilling and his in-house competitor
Claudia Roe, while the flashing stock price raced around them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not since Faye Dunaway moaned ratings numbers during a sex
scene in &#8220;Network&#8221; have lust and power been so entertainingly
entangled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called the show&#8217;s lead producer, Jeffrey Richards, whom
I&#8217;ve known since his first Broadway flop, &#8220;Rex,&#8221; in 1976. For
someone lighter by almost $4 million, he was pretty chipper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Race&#8217; Survived &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Look, I believe the straight play can be viable on
Broadway,&#8221; Richards, 61, said. He&#8217;s had a number of hits
recently, including David Mamet&#8217;s &#8220;Race,&#8221; which, unlike
&#8220;Enron,&#8221; survived mostly tepid reviews this season, recovering
its investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked what went wrong with &#8220;Enron,&#8221; Richards
blamed Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We opened with a sizable advance, but we ate into it
during previews,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then the Goldman Sachs hearings
began. Suddenly we were competing with reality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something of a stretch, though fatigue with
business malfeasance may indeed be one reason the show didn&#8217;t
catch on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richards also said that the play lacked a &#8220;wow factor.&#8221;
People weren&#8217;t leaving the Broadhurst Theatre bristling with the
need to tell anyone who would listen, &#8220;You must see this
show.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a different theory, one more typically applied to
musicals: Don&#8217;t confuse your audience. Tell them what to expect
and then give it to them. They&#8217;ll leave happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is famously what happened when Stephen Sondheim added
&#8220;Comedy Tonight&#8221; to the beginning of &#8220;A Funny Thing Happened
on the Way to the Forum.&#8221; It let even the dumbest folks in on
the joke, telling them that they were supposed to laugh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Addams Family&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s also what happened more recently, when composer-
lyricist Andrew Lippa rewrote the opening of &#8220;The Addams
Family,&#8221; turning a show critics hated into one that audiences
can&#8217;t get enough of (and the critics still hated). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Who do you think is gonna win in the end, the greedy or
the inept?&#8221; Norbert Leo Butz&#8217;s Skilling asked, after a
delicious screed about the inevitable showdown between
capitalists and bureaucrats. &#8220;We&#8217;re not perfect, but wait til
you see the other guys.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That prompted a collective gasp -- and nervous titters --
the night I saw the show. No one needed to tell these
theatergoers about the parallels between Enron 2001 and Goldman
Sachs 2010. Such bitter pith merely studded the cartoony script. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatal Mistake &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richards and his marketing team made a fatal mistake in
selling &#8220;Enron&#8221; as the story of Enron. I&#8217;d have put Skilling
in Devil&#8217;s p.j.s, with the Enron &#8220;E&#8221; as his pitchfork. Bring
in a carny barker hawking its Side Show wares. See the Scaly
Raptors! The Two-Faced Man! The Disappearing Cash! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, perhaps, the New York Times&#8217;s Ben Brantley might have
approached the show in a lighter mood, instead of treating it
like a kvetch, an annoying pain he had to endure. He called it
&#8220;a flashy but labored economics lesson...&#8221; Well, maybe for
him. But anyway, that rang the death knell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever the diplomat, Richards was having none of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is not fair to blame the New York Times for the
failure of the show. There are plays that make it without the
Times.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not this one. &#8220;Enron&#8221; promised a memory we&#8217;d rather
forget, instead of a thrill ride most of us could really use
just now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haim Saban acquired the &#8220;Power
Rangers&#8221; children&#8217;s show from Walt Disney Co. for an
undisclosed amount, reuniting the Los Angeles-based media
investor with the television brand that made him a billionaire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal includes worldwide rights to more than 700
episodes produced over 17 years, Los Angeles-based Saban Capital
Group said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saban, who developed and produced the series starting in
1993, is seeking to revive the &#8220;Power Rangers,&#8221; once the No. 1
boys&#8217; brand based on toy sales and television ratings, by
bringing new episodes to Viacom Inc.&#8217;s Nickelodeon. Disney,
which acquired the &#8220;Power Rangers&#8221; with Fox Family Worldwide
in 2001, stopped making new shows last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&#8216;Power Rangers&#8217; is one of the world&#8217;s leading children&#8217;s
entertainment properties and we are delighted to see its
return,&#8221; Saban said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saban is cooperating with the original Japanese creator of
the television show, Toei Co., and signed a toy and video-game
license with Bandai America, the Cypress, California-based
longtime &#8220;Power Rangers&#8221; manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney didn&#8217;t put its brand on &#8220;Power Rangers,&#8221; which
generated controversy over its violent content and drew the
attention of lawmakers and the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Owning the property no longer fits our long-term
programming strategy,&#8221; Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for
Burbank, California-based Disney, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show promotes teamwork, responsibility and the
importance of helping others, Saban said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney acquired the &#8220;Power Rangers&#8221; and Fox Family from
Saban and Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News Corp. for $5.2 billion. They
formed the venture in 1995. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saban Capital committed $500 million this month to acquire
entertainment properties through the creation of Los Angeles-
based Saban Brands, headed by Elie Dekel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. expects customers to
adopt the new version of Office at the fastest pace in the
software&#8217;s 20-year history, helping reverse a sales slump and
fend off competition from Google Inc.&#8217;s Web-based programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software has been tested by 8.6 million users,
Microsoft said, more than three times as many as any previous
version, signaling that adoption will be quick. Users also are
likely to upgrade to the new package of business software at the
same time they install Windows 7, released last year, said Chris Capossela, a senior vice president in the Office group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This version will be the best ever in terms of adoption
speed, both because of the interest we are seeing and the
Windows 7 adoption curve,&#8221; Capossela said in an interview last
week. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, held an event in New York today to mark the
official release of Office 2010 to businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s $19 billion business division, which gets most
of its revenue from Office, could use the boost. Its sales will
drop 3 percent in the fiscal year ending in June, UBS AG analyst
Brent Thill estimated. While the new software will spur orders
in the coming year, the comeback will hinge on whether
businesses recommit to technology spending -- something they&#8217;ve
been slow to do in the wake of the recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Precarious Recovery&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s still a precarious recovery,&#8221; said Sarah Friar, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in San Francisco, who
recommends buying Microsoft shares. &#8220;We&#8217;re in the camp of
expecting a more moderate migration. It&#8217;s kind of, &#8216;steady as
she goes.&#8217; It&#8217;s not a raging rush to upgrade.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said last month that a recovery in corporate
spending on personal computers and software was just beginning.
Multiyear contracts, which account for 60 percent of the Office
unit&#8217;s sales, are still taking longer to close because
businesses are keeping a lid on expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home-computer shoppers have fueled the PC industry&#8217;s
rebound so far, snapping up laptops and netbooks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wish I could predict what business PC adoption is going
to be,&#8221; Microsoft&#8217;s Capossela said. &#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful to see
consumers buying PCs in such numbers. That sets us up for a
great consumer uptake. The business uptake will also be
excellent, but businesses are certainly slower to start spending
money again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 56 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $29.44 at 4
p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have
declined 3.4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging Software &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of Office customers now use a version of the
program that&#8217;s at least seven years old, giving Microsoft an
opportunity to get them to upgrade, Thill said. For the year
starting July 1, the new Office will spur an increase of 12
percent in sales for the business division, he predicts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Electric Co. plans to switch about half of its
desktop computers, or about 175,000 machines, to Office 2010
this year, Capossela said today. Royal KPN NV and its subsidiary
Getronics NV already have put the program on some machines and
will roll it out to more than 45,000 this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, Office will include Web-based versions
of popular programs like Word and Excel. The company already has
40 million users of Internet-delivered versions of its Exchange
e-mail server and SharePoint server programs, which let
customers&#8217; employees create internal company websites and
collaborate on projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editing Functions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office 2010 also adds the ability to edit photos and videos
in PowerPoint presentations, and co-authoring features let
different people work on one file at the same time. Users can
select an option to save documents on the Internet, so they can
be retrieved when employees are away from the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers also can broadcast PowerPoint slide shows over
the Internet to any user with a Web browser. The Outlook Social
Connector turns the e-mail program into a central repository for
data from sites like Facebook, MySpace and LinkedIn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding Internet features gives Microsoft fresh ammunition
against Google, which has targeted Office customers with its
Internet-based Google Apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses that already have Office 2007 should just update
it with Google Apps to add Internet and collaboration features,
Google says. Many workers don&#8217;t need a new version of Office, or
any version at all, said Chris Vander Mey, a product manager at
Mountain View, California-based Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Office is a really good product and every company should
have two or three copies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But there&#8217;s a significant
number of employees that don&#8217;t need it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Apps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google says 3,000 businesses sign up each day for its apps.
The company lands a large corporate customer every few weeks,
mostly for the Gmail e-mail service, said Andrew Kovacs, a
Google spokesman. Recent new customers include packaging company
MeadWestvaco Corp. and Air France-KLM Group&#8217;s KLM unit, which
will have its 11,200 crew members use Gmail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capossela said Office programs like Outlook and Word are
used by the bulk of workers at Microsoft&#8217;s corporate customers.
Most employees don&#8217;t want to switch to Google, he said.
Uploading a file to Google Apps often doesn&#8217;t preserve details
and formatting, Capossela said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s push into Web-based programs is motivated more
by customer demand than competition with Google, said Friar at
Goldman Sachs. Growth in software delivered as an Internet
service is going to outpace standard programs by 5-to-1, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a must for them to have done it -- the world is
moving to software as service,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the biggest
shift in the software market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state-
owned oil company, signed final contracts worth at least $30
billion to develop crude reserves in the Carabobo blocks of the
Orinoco Belt with groups led by Chevron Corp. and Repsol YPF SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PDVSA, as the company based in Caracas is known, will hold
a 60 percent stake in the joint ventures and oversee the
production of as many as 880,000 barrels of oil a day in the two
blocks, Rafael Ramirez, Venezuela&#8217;s oil minister, said today in
comments on state television. The partners also plan to
construct upgraders that convert heavy tar-like crude into
lighter oil for export, said Ramirez, also president of PDVSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are important and elevated levels of investment and
will help Venezuela improve its competitiveness in the world,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;This ratifies the international recognition of our
oil policy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carabobo projects, along with similar ventures with Eni
SpA, China National Petroleum Corp. and a group of Russian
companies in the neighboring Junin field, are central to
Venezuela&#8217;s plans to boost waning oil output by 2.9 million
barrels a day by 2017. The foreign companies get the opportunity
to stake a claim in one of the world&#8217;s biggest oil deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramirez said that Venezuela&#8217;s oil production will rise to
4.15 million barrels a day in 2015 and to 6.85 million barrels a
day in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, Mitsubishi Corp., Inpex Corp. and Suelopetrol CA
will take a combined 40 percent stake in the Carabobo 3 area.
Output is scheduled to start in 2013 and increase to 400,000
barrels a day in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signing Bonuses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are required to pay a signing bonus of $500
million to access the reserves and provide a $1 billion loan to
PDVSA to begin operations, according to terms published in the
Official Gazette on May 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol Chief Executive Officer Antonio Brufau and Chevron&#8217;s
head of production and exploration for Africa and Latin
America, Ali Moshiri, attended the signing ceremony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol, Oil  Natural Gas Corp., Petroliam Nasional Bhd.,
Indian Oil Corp. and Oil India Ltd. will develop the second
project called Carabobo 1 with PDVSA to pump up to 480,000
barrels a day. They&#8217;re required to pay a $1.05 billion signing
bonus and provide the country with a $1.05 billion loan to begin
the development, according to the Official Gazette. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financing for the blocks will be covered 30 percent through
international loans, 40 percent from the minority partners and
the remaining 30 percent from initial production, PDVSA Vice
President Eulogio Del Pino told reporters today in Caracas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous Delays &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The awarding ended a selection process that began in 2008
and faced repeated delays. Of the 52 companies that Venezuela
invited to bid, 19 paid for field data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PDVSA will begin production of about 300,000 barrels a day
by 2013 at the six Orinoco Belt oil fields being developed with
joint venture partners in eastern Venezuela, Del Pino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The companies will have to invest in upgraders, a
production center and in oil pipelines, but that infrastructure
won&#8217;t be ready until 2016,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The heavy crude may be
refined in the Caribbean, or Dominican Republic or Curacao,
until the upgraders are finished instead of blending with
lighter oil here in Venezuela.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc.
attorneys are reviewing whether the company may recover funds
tied to transactions with Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
insurer&#8217;s chief executive officer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have fine lawyers, we are looking at all of the
activities that occurred,&#8221; CEO Robert Benmosche said today at
AIG&#8217;s annual meeting in New York after a shareholder asked about
transactions with Goldman Sachs. &#8220;To the extent we find
anything that was done wrong, or any harm to AIG that should not
have happened, our legal staff will take appropriate actions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benmosche, hired in August, is seeking to stabilize a firm
that reported almost $100 billion in net losses in 2008 after
bad bets on mortgage-related investments including
collateralized debt obligations. Collateral calls from Goldman
Sachs and other investment banks forced AIG to the brink of
collapse in September 2008. The insurer&#8217;s bailout that year
provided funds to help meet obligations to Wall Street firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs received about $12.9 billion related to
credit-default swaps and securities-lending contracts that the
insurer wound down after its rescue. The Securities and Exchange
Commission sued Goldman Sachs last month for misleading clients
including ABN Amro Bank NV in CDO trades. Benmosche, 65, didn&#8217;t
specify which trades AIG is reviewing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Herr, a spokesman for AIG, and Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Michael DuVally declined to comment. Goldman Sachs has said the SEC suit
is unfounded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;A Fine Firm&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman is a fine firm and does lots of things
extraordinarily well,&#8221; AIG Chairman Harvey Golub said today at
the meeting in response to a separate shareholder question about
the insurer&#8217;s current relationship with the bank. &#8220;Where
Goldman can serve the interests of AIG, we will work with
them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG dismissed Goldman Sachs from an advisory role and
appointed Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp., the New York
Times reported this month, citing unidentified people familiar
with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benmosche said the insurer&#8217;s net income of $1.45 billion in
the first three months of 2010 is a sign of progress at the
bailed-out company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employee Retention &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our operating companies are performing well, and you can
see that across the board,&#8221; Benmosche said. &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing
better retention of our business, better retention of our
employees, and you see our customers are coming back as our
sales are going up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG shares have gained about 43 percent this year through
yesterday as Benmosche struck deals to sell two divisions for
about $51 billion to help repay the bailout. Last week AIG
posted the first-quarter profit, which compares with a loss of
$4.35 billion in the year-earlier period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG slipped 57 cents to $42.32 at 12:37 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The company dropped 4.5
percent last year and 97 percent in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The key is to make sure we have shareholder value at the
end of the day,&#8221; Benmosche said. Shareholders are &#8220;the lowest
in the capital structure, so therefore if we have shareholder
value, all of our obligations will be met, and that is the
key.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG last week opted for the first time in four quarters
against extending the period in which it is committed to
supporting its plane-leasing and consumer-lending units.
Benmosche said the ability of the units to obtain funds from
private sources in the first quarter is a sign of AIG&#8217;s revival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government Stake &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government owns about 80 percent of AIG, a stake
it took after rescuing the firm in September 2008. Fairholme
Capital Management, the investment firm run by Bruce Berkowitz,
has the second-largest stake. Berkowitz raised his bet on AIG&#8217;s
recovery by increasing holdings to 25.5 million shares,
according to a filing this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benmosche is AIG&#8217;s fourth CEO since Maurice &#8220;Hank&#8221; Greenberg, who ran the insurer for almost four decades, left the
company in 2005. Martin Sullivan then held the top post for
three years, followed by Robert Willumstad, who was CEO for
about three months until the government appointed Edward Liddy
in 2008 as part of the rescue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG&#8217;s rescue includes a $60 billion Federal Reserve credit
line, a Treasury Department investment of as much as $69.8
billion and up to $52.5 billion to buy mortgage-linked assets
owned or backed by the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, seeking to boost earnings
by focusing on software and services, said he plans to spend $20
billion on acquisitions in the next five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating earnings will jump to at least $20 a share by
2015 from $11.35 or more this year, helped by cost savings and
software demand, Palmisano said in a meeting with investors in
New York today. The company also predicted sales growth that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates, sending the stock higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano is signaling his pace of acquisitions may be
accelerating. He spent more than $20 billion on 100 purchases in
the eight years since taking over in 2002, partly to focus on
the higher-margin businesses of services and software. He has
also bought back shares and cut jobs to make up for slowing
corporate spending amid the recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM will keep investing in markets that help customers be
more efficient, such as software that helps analyze or predict
trends and cloud computing, which lets them store and access
information on shared servers, Palmisano said. The company is
also developing services to monitor highways, electrical grids
and other infrastructure so they can be run more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest computer services provider, projected
operating profit will jump to $20 a share by 2015, helped by
cost savings and demand for its software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software will contribute almost half of the company&#8217;s
earnings, while new growth initiatives will add $20 billion to
sales, according to presentation slides on the company&#8217;s Web
site. IBM is meeting with investors in New York today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is investing the
higher-margin businesses of services and software to boost
profit. He has has spent more than $20 billion on 100 purchases
since taking over in 2002. He has also bought back shares and
cut jobs to help boost earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to save $8 billion through productivity
gains by 2015, while free cash flow should reach $100 billion.
IBM said it plans to give 70 percent of the cash flow to
shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also reiterated that earnings per share will grow more
than 10 percent this year, to at least $11.20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, climbed $1.90, or 1.5
percent, to $128.79 at 10:24 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares had fallen 3.1 percent this year
before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombian cocaine production fell to
an 11-year low in 2009, the Interior Ministry said, citing
preliminary findings by a study conducted by the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country produced 390 metric tons of the drug last year,
down 9 percent from 430 tons in 2008, the Interior Ministry said
in a statement. Land dedicated to production of coca, the base
ingredient of the drug, fell to 68,025 hectares last year, an
11-year low, according to the study based on satellite
monitoring of fields of coca. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia is the world&#8217;s largest producer of cocaine
responsible for the majority of the drug sold in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As International Business Machines
Corp. meets with investors in New York today, some shareholders
want the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider to go beyond
profit goals and pledge itself to more specific sales growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano used the shareholder
briefing three years ago to establish a target of $10 in
earnings per share by 2010, a goal he has already reached. Some
investors expect him to set a similar benchmark this year, and
they want him to lay out specific plans for boosting sales at
more than the current low-single digit rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I want to see revenue growth,&#8221; said Peter Sorrentino, a
Cincinnati-based portfolio manager at Huntington Asset
Management, who helps manage $13.3 billion, including more than
$100 million of IBM shares. &#8220;Sam Palmisano has come through the
storm, but where do we go from here? What&#8217;s next, Mr. Wizard?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though investors give IBM credit for reaching the $10-a-
share profit mark a year early, many have sold shares, saying
profit growth may suffer without higher revenue gains. IBM&#8217;s
sales have been little changed in the past five years, while
sales at rival Hewlett-Packard Co. have risen more than 7
percent annually on average, in part because of acquisitions.
IBM&#8217;s earnings per share have been bolstered by stock buybacks
and jobs cuts, which some investors say may not be sustainable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised
ending a bet the euro will fall versus the pound on speculation 
tighter fiscal policy will lower U.K. growth and that the Bank 
of England will postpone raising interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sterling positive factors are now being offset by the
latest Bank of England inflation report, which again sounds very
dovish and emphasizes the need for fiscal tightening and
downside growth risks,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts led by London-
based Thomas Stolper wrote in a note today. &#8220;The combination of
tighter fiscal policy and continued easy monetary policy likely
limits the upside for sterling in the foreseeable future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade was closed for a &#8220;potential&#8221; gain of 2.3
percent since it was initiated on April 21, according to 
the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro rose 0.3 percent to 84.94 U.K. pence as of 1:36

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, lost its challenge to a patent that led to a
change in its Word program and to damages of more than $290
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office affirmed a patent
owned by i4i LP of Toronto after a review requested by
Microsoft, closely held i4i said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Put simply: i4i&#8217;s patent is clearly and unequivocally
valid,&#8221; i4i Chairman Loudon Owen said in the statement. &#8220;Even
though Microsoft attacked i4i&#8217;s patent claims with its full
arsenal, the Patent Office agreed with i4i and confirmed the
validity&#8221; of the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I4i&#8217;s invention is related to customizing extensible markup
language, or XML, a way of encoding data to exchange information
among programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed, but there still remain important
matters of patent law at stake, and we are considering our
options to get them addressed, including a petition to the
Supreme Court,&#8221; Kevin Kutz, a spokesman for Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft lost a jury trial over the patent last year and
was ordered to alter its Word program or halt sales. A U.S.
appeals court upheld both the verdict and the court order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML is a common way of encoding data, and nothing in the
order prevented Microsoft from continuing to offer that feature
in Word, or for allowing customized XML when it&#8217;s used in plain
text. The disputed feature is one used by large companies to add
special data to Word files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is i4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 2009-1504, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower-court case is i4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 07-cv-113, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court Tells Patent Holder to Stop Suing PG, Kimberly-Clark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that
bars a Maryland patent owner from filing any new patent-
infringement cases against Procter  Gamble Co. and Kimberly-
Clark Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based court, which hears appeals of patent
cases, told Allegra D. Hemphill that a trial court properly
rejected her infringement claims against the two consumer-
products companies as &#8220;baseless accusations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemphill is the named inventor on patent 4,557,720, for a
disposable vaginal applicator. She claimed that personal hygiene
products such as Cincinnati-based PG&#8217;s Always, and Dallas-based
Kimberly-Clark&#8217;s Kotex and Poise infringed her patent, issued in
December 1985, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trial courts determined that the sanitary-napkin products
made by the consumer companies didn&#8217;t constitute &#8220;vaginal
swabs&#8221; as the term is used in the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemphill has made &#8220;hundreds of pages of largely repetitive
filings&#8221; that failed to support her case, and engaged &#8220;in a
vexatious pattern of filing multiple duplicative lawsuits,
forum-shopping among various district and appellate courts&#8221; the
appeals court said. The court said it is &#8220;apparent&#8221; that her
claims are without merit and &#8220;baseless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent owner represented herself in the appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hemphill v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 10-01047,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SABMiller Patents Easy-to-Open Beer Can That Doubles as Cup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SABMiller Plc said it patented an easy-to-open beer can
that doubles as a cup after the entire top has been removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The can is a first in the global beer industry and will be
used at the World Cup soccer tournament that starts in South
Africa next month, Norman Adami, managing director of the
Johannesburg-based unit, told reporters in the city yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brewer, which said it has invested 170 million rand
($22.6 million) in support of the World Cup, said in a statement
yesterday that it expects to sell the equivalent of 30 million
more bottles of beer during the tournament than it normally
sells in June and July in South Arica. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pesticide Management Bill Faces Opposition Over Data Monopoly &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s Bjaratiya Janta Party opposes a bill for pesticide
management currently under consideration, the Economic Times
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party&#8217;s objection is to a section on pesticide-testing
&#8220;data exclusivity,&#8221; which it claims is the result of pressure
from U.S. chemical companies, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill gives researchers a 20-year monopoly over their
data, which the party claims would make it difficult for generic
versions of the product to be created, according to the Economic
Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permitting data monopoly to go ahead may lead to higher
pesticide prices, a party leader told the Economic Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prisoner-Restraint Patent Issued to Utah Inventors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Utah inventors received a U.S. patent yesterday for a
method of securing a prisoner to a motor vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent 7,723,300 covers a device that can be hooked to the
prisoner&#8217;s handcuffs that will keep the prisoner&#8217;s hands behind
his back and prevent his escape from a police vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the patent, the device can be triggered
remotely, and can be used even if the prisoner is placed in a
vehicle&#8217;s front seat. While the prisoner is tethered to the car
seat, &#8220;the police officer can then go about his other necessary
duties which may include: dealing with other suspects, searching
or inventorying a vehicle, talking with victims and witnesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device can be used in conjunction with an automobile
seatbelt, and, in the event of a collision, can be released by
means of a remote-control switch, or cut with a knife or
scissors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application for the patent was filed in March 2006 with
assistance from the Bateman IP Law Group of Salt Lake City. The
patent was issued to Keith D. Squires of Morgan, Utah, and Omar
L. Issa of Venice, Utah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viacom, Indian Company Accused of Infringing Runyon Rights &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viacom Inc. was sued for copyright infringement by the
owner of the copyright for a short story by the late Damon
Runyon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit related to an Indian movie, &#8220;Singh is Kinng,&#8221;
which American Rights Management Co. of New York claims is
derived from Runyon&#8217;s &#8220;Madame La Gimp.&#8221; The 2008 Bollywood
film was directed by Anees Bazmee and starred Akshay Kumar and
Katrina Kaif. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viacom was sued as the film&#8217;s distributor. Vipul Amrutlal
Shah, producer of &#8220;Singh is Kinng&#8221; told Agence France-Presse
that he was &#8220;truly baffled&#8221; at the infringement allegations,
and the fact that the rights holder waited two years to file a
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Runyon story, originally published in 1929 in Hearst
Corp.&#8217;s Cosmopolitan magazine, is &#8220;generally recognizable by
the public&#8221; through several derivative films, Frank Capra&#8217;s
&#8220;Lady for a Day&#8221; and &#8220;Pocketful of Miracles,&#8221; and Jackie
Chan&#8217;s &#8220;Miracles,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Rights claims that the Bollywood film also
infringes the copyright for the two Capra films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short story&#8217;s copyright holder claims the Bollywood
film is similar in essence, structure, pattern and sequence,
pace, setting, characterization and mood. The defendants
&#8220;purposefully employed immaterial variations or transparent re-
phrasing to produce essentially an update&#8221; of the Runyon story,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Rights asked the court to order the defendants to
quit infringing the copyright, including barring future
distribution of the film. Additionally, the rights holder
requested an award of money damages, litigation costs and
attorney fees, and extra cash compensation to punish the
defendants&#8217; for their actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rights holder is represented by Steven M. Hayes, of New
York&#8217;s Hanly Conroy Bierstein Sheridan Fisher LLP, and Clay M.
Townsend and Keith R. Mitnik, of Orlando, Florida&#8217;s Morgan 
Morgan PA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is American Rights Management v. Viacom 18 US,
1:10-cv-03690-VM, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan)). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EA to Take Make &#8216;Spore&#8217; Darker, Trademark Application Hints &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic Arts Inc., whose &#8220;Spore&#8221; was the most pirated
game in 2008, is taking the game to the dark side, if recent
trademark applications are any indication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redwood City, California-based games company filed four
applications to register &#8220;Darkspore&#8221; with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office on May 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic Arts seeks to register the mark for a wide range
of goods and products including film production, online computer
games, action figures, playing cards, board games, pajamas, T-
shirts, and computer and video-game software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newspaper Reveals Hidden Ownership of Bafana Bafana Brand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month before South Africa hosts the World Cup soccer
games, the country&#8217;s Times newspaper reported that Wayne Smidt,
a Johannesburg businessman, owns 49.9 percent of Slam, a company
that controls the trademark rights to Bafana Bafana, the
country&#8217;s national team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South African Football Association owns the other 50.1
percent of the company, according to the Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smidt told the Times he objected to the newspaper&#8217;s
&#8220;drawing sinister motives&#8221; from his refusal to divulge more
information about the ownership or how much money he expected to
make during the World Cup games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivian Casaletti, Slam&#8217;s chief executive, said she expected
at least 1.6 million Bafana Bafana items to be sold, and that
the team licensing program  -- under which Slam makes 15 percent
on each item sold -- is &#8220;the most successful licensing program
in Africa,&#8221; according to the Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makeup of Chemical Dispersant Used in Gulf a Trade Secret &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists and Louisiana fishermen say they are worried
about damage chemical dispersants may cause the region&#8217;s
fisheries and their lack of knowledge of the chemicals being
used, the U.K.&#8217;s Telegraph reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 325,000 gallons of dispersants have been used on
waters in the Gulf of Mexico in efforts to halt the spread of
the oil that has been spewing from beneath the sea since the
April 20 explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon rig leased
by BP Plc, according to the Telegraph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product used to break up the oil is Corexit, produced
by Nalco Holding Co.&#8217;s Nalco Energy Services, the newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LuAnn White, a Tulane University toxicologist, told the
Telegraph &#8220;we don&#8217;t know&#8221; what&#8217;s in the product &#8220;because it&#8217;s
a trade secret.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble Co., the world&#8217;s
largest consumer products company, increased a planned sale of
five-year bonds to 75 billion yen ($809 million) from an initial
50 billion yen, according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent told
investors it may price the notes to yield between 28 basis
points and 30 basis points more than the yen swap rate, said the
people, who asked not to be named as the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Good credit companies like PG can attract investors&#8221;
even amid market jitters over Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis,
Nobuto Yamazaki, an executive fund manager at DIAM Asset
Management Co., said in a phone interview from Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond issuance worldwide has tumbled amid investor
skepticism that a $1 trillion rescue package announced by the
European Union will be enough to bolster the region&#8217;s most-
indebted governments. Companies have sold $15 billion of debt
this month, a 62 percent decline from the same period in April,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG, based in Cincinnati, is rated Aa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service, the risk assessor&#8217;s fourth-highest investment grade. It
has an equivalent AA- from Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This deal shows that Japanese investors can be a
stabilizing presence,&#8221; said Tetsuo Ishihara, a credit analyst
at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi UFJ Securities, Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings
Plc are managing the sale, which is aimed at Japanese and
international investors. PG last sold yen-denominated debt in
May 2000, when it raised 50 billion yen from 10-year, 2 percent
bonds maturing next month, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An official who answered the phone when Bloomberg News
called PG&#8217;s Japan unit in Tokyo today declined to comment on
the bonds or give his name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA Chief Executive
Officer Emilio Azcarraga said the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster seeks to expand by buying companies
involved in program production and distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are definitely looking for opportunities because the
financial situation of Televisa today is very good,&#8221; Azcarraga
said today in an interview in Moscow, where he is speaking at a
conference. &#8220;Any opportunity in the business of the production
of content or the distribution of content we would look at.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is tapping into the growth of pay television in
Latin America by investing in new cable-TV channels offering
sports and news programming. The company has spent more than
$500 million since 2007 to acquire stakes in Mexican cable
carriers and a long-distance phone and Internet network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa fell 1 centavo to 48.44 pesos at 4 p.m. New York
time in Mexico City trading. The shares have lost 11 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megacable Holdings SAB, Mexico&#8217;s largest cable-TV company,
has said it is interested in buying closely held Mexican
carriers Grupo Hevi and Cablecom. Azcarraga, 42, didn&#8217;t name
specific targets or say when Televisa would make purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa, based in Mexico City, had 36 billion pesos ($2.91
billion) in cash and equivalents at the end of March. The
company agreed in February to buy a 30 percent stake in the
Mexican unit of wireless carrier NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) for $1.44
billion to offer mobile-phone service to the clients of
Televisa&#8217;s cable companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fighting Slim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cable carriers are battling billionaire Carlos Slim&#8217;s
Telefonos de Mexico SAB, the nation&#8217;s largest phone and Internet
company, by offering &#8220;triple-play&#8221; packages of voice, Web and
television service. Slim also controls America Movil SAB,
Mexico&#8217;s largest mobile-phone company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very competitive environment in the case that only
one company is the one that can offer mobile and fixed
telephone,&#8221; Azcarraga said, referring to Slim&#8217;s holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering customers triple-play packages and wireless
service &#8220;makes a lot of sense because that model obviously
makes the cost of productivity of communications lower than it
is today,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That way we benefit as a company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telmex, as Slim&#8217;s carrier is known, has unsuccessfully
sought government permission to sell TV service in Mexico. Asked
whether Telmex should be allowed to sell TV plans, Azcarraga
said his company welcomes competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We know how to compete and we are very good in
competition,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is in discussions for a new agreement with U.S.
Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Communications Inc.,
which has a contract to air Televisa&#8217;s programming through 2017,
Azcarraga said. Univision won a U.S. court ruling last year
blocking Televisa from distributing its programming in the
country over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are &#8220;trying to develop a better deal for
them and for us and we are still working on that, but we don&#8217;t
have any news right now,&#8221; Azcarraga said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee rose for the fifth straight
session on concern that global supplies may lag behind demand.
Cocoa dropped the most in almost four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World coffee output probably will decline 4.8 percent to
122 million bags in the year that began on Oct. 1, the
International Coffee Organization said in a report on May 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The short-term supply concern is pushing prices higher,&#8221;
said Rodrigo Costa, a vice president of institutional sales at
Newedge USA LLC in New York. &#8220;The dollar&#8217;s strength, however,
will limit the gains.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee for July delivery rose 0.25 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $1.371 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The
commodity gained 2.9 percent in the last five sessions and 7.8
percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro traded near its lowest level since March 2009 on
concern that governments may not cut deficits fast enough after
the European Union announced an almost $1 trillion bailout for
the region&#8217;s most-indebted countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another ICE market, cocoa for July delivery declined
$59, or 2 percent, to $2,913 a metric ton. Earlier, it fell to
$2,898, the lowest price for a most-active contract since April
15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On London&#8217;s Liffe exchange, cocoa futures for July delivery
fell 31 pounds, or 1.4 percent, to 2,256 pounds ($3,306) a ton.
Robusta-coffee futures for July delivery declined $6, or 0.4
percent, to $1,402 a ton. Earlier, it rose to $1,410, the
highest price since Nov. 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past three years, Pfizer
Inc. was an earner without profit in its own country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of the cholesterol medication Lipitor, the
world&#8217;s top-selling prescription drug, reported almost half its
revenues in the U.S. for 2007 through 2009, while booking
domestic pretax losses totaling $5.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abroad, it was another story. A Dutch subsidiary more than
made up for New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s American losses. It reported
pretax profits totaling $20.4 billion in 2007 and 2008 -- with a
tax expense of 5 percent, a seventh of the top U.S. rate.
Overseas tax savings increased the drugmaker&#8217;s net income by $1
billion last year, according to Robert Willens, a tax consultant
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is one of thousands of American companies that
bolster their profits by attributing income to subsidiaries in
countries with lower income tax rates, legally cutting their tax
bills. Eli Lilly  Co. and Oracle Corp. were among other big
companies that helped drive a 70 percent increase in accumulated
earnings abroad that weren&#8217;t taxed in the U.S. from 2006 to
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An inordinate concentration of profits in a low-tax
country, way out of proportion to actual economic activity, is a
sure sign of aggressive tax planning,&#8221; said Martin Sullivan, a
tax economist who formerly worked for the U.S. Treasury and
Arthur Andersen LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Increased &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willens, the president of Robert Willens LLC, a consulting
firm in New York that advises investors on tax issues, analyzed
financial filings for last year by Pfizer, Lilly and Oracle and
found: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Pfizer increased net income by 13 percent compared with
what it would have been without the tax benefit from foreign
earnings. The company&#8217;s $8.6 billion in net income would have
been $7.6 billion, Willens said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Lilly increased its 2009 net income by 21 percent to
$4.3 billion from $3.6 billion, Willens found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Oracle reported $5.6 billion in net income last year, 14
percent more than it would have reported without foreign
earnings taxed at lower rates, according to the analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, each of those companies has actual sales
abroad, although often in countries with tax rates similar to
the U.S., which has an average combined state and federal
corporate income tax rate of about 39 percent. Oracle, which
reported 44 percent of its sales in the U.S., had 16 percent in
Germany, Japan, Canada and France, countries with rates ranging
from 30 percent to 39 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectual Property &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of U.S. companies attributed income to foreign
subsidiaries in 2008 that exceeded their share of actual sales
abroad, according to offshore corporate records and U.S.
securities filings compiled by Standard  Poor&#8217;s Capital IQ. In
some cases, the foreign units employ few or no workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For pharmaceutical and technology companies it&#8217;s relatively
easy to shift ownership of patents and other intellectual
property abroad, said Sheldon S. Cohen, a former IRS
commissioner who is now a director at the investment firm Farr,
Miller  Washington LLC in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a typical arrangement, a company will license the
overseas rights for a patent developed in the U.S. to a
subsidiary in a low-tax country, said Michael C. Durst, special
counsel at Steptoe  Johnson LLP, in Washington. That permits
income from foreign sales to be attributed to the low-tax
country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury Department regulations require that prices paid
between subsidiaries, such as licensing fees, be based on what
unaffiliated companies would pay. Payments among Pfizer&#8217;s
subsidiaries are supported by economic studies of similar third-
party transactions, said Joan Campion, a company spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arm&#8217;s Length &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All our transactions satisfy all arm&#8217;s-length
requirements,&#8221; Campion said. Charges related to cost-cutting
and mergers helped lower Pfizer&#8217;s U.S. income, she said. The
company manufactures Lipitor in Ireland, among other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Irish subsidiary of Oracle that has no employees and
paid no income tax in 2006 and 2007 was responsible for roughly
a quarter of the parent&#8217;s pretax income of $10.8 billion in
those years, according to Irish records and Oracle&#8217;s U.S.
securities filings. The unit distributes products &#8220;primarily in
the European market&#8221; that were developed by the Redwood City,
California-based company and &#8220;jointly funded under a cost
sharing arrangement,&#8221; according to its annual report from 2007,
the most recent year available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Laws &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Glueck, a senior vice president for Oracle, declined to
answer questions about the company&#8217;s use of transfer pricing. In
an e-mail, he compared transfer pricing to the mortgage-interest
deduction that individuals can claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Can someone please explain to me how following the tax
laws of the United States became a reportable issue for
Bloomberg News?&#8221; Glueck wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of the past seven years, Lilly has reported more
than half its sales in the U.S. yet more than half its profits
overseas. In 2007, a Swiss subsidiary booked pretax income of
$3.2 billion -- more than 80 percent of the $3.9 billion the
parent company reported that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss holding company has an Irish manufacturing branch
that produces drugs and sells them to affiliated companies,
according to its annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lilly takes great care to ensure that we have properly
determined our income and assessed our tax obligations to each
jurisdiction in which we do business,&#8221; said Mark E. Taylor, a
company spokesman, in an e-mail. In some years, U.S. profits
were reduced by merger-related costs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonds sold by U.S. financial firms
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. offer value after a fraud
lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission caused spreads
to widen, according to BT Investment Management Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTIM, a manager of about A$13.5 billion ($12.1 billion) of
cash and fixed-income assets, has been buying bonds of U.S.
institutions such as Goldman Sachs that mature in about a year,
and is considering buying more, head of income strategies Scott Osborne and senior portfolio manager Jean-Luc Petit said in an
interview in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Short-dated U.S. financial notes offer more bang for your
buck than their global peers,&#8221; said Osborne. &#8220;While the
spreads have widened on the recent SEC probe issues, the U.S.
economic recovery will underpin the strength of the financial
system in the medium term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. financial debt has lost almost 1 percent since the SEC
filed its suit against the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history on April 16, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index shows,
after handing investors profits in 11 of the 12 months ending
March. The lawsuit sparked concern the government will crack
down on Wall Street and hurt profits, even as the U.S. economy
recovers from the worst global recession since World War II. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj
Rajaratnam had a ready answer for every question U.S. regulators
put to him about possible insider trading three years ago,
Bloomberg News&#8217;s David Glovin and Andrew M. Harris report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;AMD on August 1st, now 13th,&#8221; Rajaratnam wrote in an
Aug. 2, 2006, instant message sent to an RBC Capital Markets
analyst. The analyst responded: &#8220;Hey, for the tickets have to
choose package B?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; Securities and Exchange Commission
lawyer Andrew Michaelson asked Rajaratnam during a formal agency
deposition on June 7, 2007. He wanted to know about the link
between &#8220;package B&#8221; and the ticker symbol for computer
component-maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were going to see cricket in Trinidad,&#8221; he told
Michaelson. &#8220;We were talking about the cricket packages.&#8221;
Rajaratnam said he didn&#8217;t recall the significance of Aug. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam was indicted in December as part of the largest-
ever hedge fund insider trading prosecution. The previously
undisclosed deposition, taken at the SEC&#8217;s New York office as
part of an agency investigation, was filed May 7 in Manhattan
federal court by defense lawyers in the criminal case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, who has pleaded not guilty, is scheduled for
trial in October for conspiracy and securities fraud. He faces
more than 10 years in prison if convicted. Government lawyers,
including Michaelson, who joined the prosecution team, claim
that Rajaratnam used inside tips to trade in AMD shares in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors may use the deposition to question Rajaratnam,
52, if he testifies at trial, said Jacob Frenkel, a former
federal prosecutor who is now a partner at Shulman Rogers Gandal
Pordy  Eckerin in Potomac, Maryland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;His prior testimony before the SEC could be used for
impeachment -- to show inconsistencies&#8221; in his account, said
Frenkel, who isn&#8217;t involved in the Galleon investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deposition was filed as part of a defense effort to
suppress secret government wiretaps of Rajaratnam, evidence
central to the prosecution&#8217;s case. His attorneys claim Justice
Department lawyers misled the judge who approved the wiretap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At trial, Rajaratnam&#8217;s defense team may be able to point to
the daylong deposition as evidence that he was &#8220;extremely
forthcoming&#8221; with the investigators probing Galleon, said
lawyer Roger Zuckerman of Zuckerman Spaeder LLP in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Zuckerman said there are &#8220;strong
indications&#8221; that prosecutors may have misled the judge by not
disclosing this and other events related to the SEC&#8217;s probe in
their 2008 request for a wiretap of Rajaratnam&#8217;s cell phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim McCarthy, a spokesman for Rajaratnam, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deposition stemmed from an SEC investigation into
suspected insider trading at Sedna Capital Management, a hedge
fund run by Rajaratnam&#8217;s brother, Rengan. During the agency
questioning, much of which focuses on Galleon&#8217;s trading, Raj
Rajaratnam denied using confidential tips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice Oh, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam&#8217;s defense lawyers submitted the 2007 deposition
to U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell in an effort to show that
prosecutors lied in their wiretap application the next year,
when they claimed they&#8217;d been investigating Rajaratnam for only
a brief period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deposition and other documents filed with the court
show the government had been probing him since 2000, the lawyers
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-cr-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ackermann Says Deutsche Bank Didn&#8217;t Cause IKB Crisis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG Chief Executive Officer Josef Ackermann
told a Dusseldorf court that the lender wasn&#8217;t responsible for
the 2007 funding crisis that forced IKB Deutsche Industriebank
AG to seek a bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ackermann testified that IKB&#8217;s capital base was in peril
before its credit line was cut by Deutsche Bank. Ackermann
testified yesterday at former IKB Chief Executive Officer Stefan
Ortseifen&#8217;s trial on charges he misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB was bailed out in 2007 by KfW Group and banking
associations and has subsequently received guarantees of as much
as 12 billion euros ($15 billion) from the Soffin bank-rescue
fund. Ortseifen is charged with misleading investors by
downplaying the effect of the looming crisis in a press release
on July 20, 2007. IKB received a bailout package 10 days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t cause the reputational damage that put IKB in
the crisis,&#8221; Ackermann said yesterday. &#8220;We only cut the credit
line when it became obvious that IKB was already in a crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the opening of the case in March, Ortseifen had blamed
Deutsche Bank for causing IKB&#8217;s near-collapse in 2007. Deutsche
Bank halted all transactions with IKB on July 27 of that year,
hurting IKB&#8217;s reputation and triggering the crisis, the former
executive told the Dusseldorf Regional Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My client never wanted to blame Deutsche Bank for causing
the crisis,&#8221; Ortseifen&#8217;s lawyer, Rainer Hamm, said following
Ackermann&#8217;s testimony. &#8220;He only wanted to express that the line
was cut without warning and the move took IKB by surprise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dusseldorf prosecutors in July charged Ortseifen with
manipulating IKB&#8217;s share price before the near collapse of the
lender in 2007. Ortseifen &#8220;consciously in a misleading
fashion&#8221; downplayed the likely impact of the looming crisis in
the July 20, 2007, press release, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the evidence so far, the court considers the press
release misleading, Presiding Judge Brigitte Koppenhoefer said
at an earlier hearing. The court&#8217;s assessment is preliminary and
may change in the course of the trial, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ortseifen denies the charges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iceland&#8217;s Glitnir Bank Sues in U.S., U.K. to Recoup $2 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glitnir Bank hf sued Jon Asgeir Johannesson, the former
chairman of FL Group hf, and other people connected with the
investment company that controlled the failed lender, accusing
them of taking $2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johannesson led a group that wrested control of the
Icelandic bank and drained it of money to prop up their own
failing companies, according to the lawsuit filed May 11 in New
York state Supreme Court in Manhattan. Glitnir Chairman
Thorsteinn Jonsson and PricewaterhouseCoopers hf, Glitnir&#8217;s
external auditor, also are defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glitnir was among the trio of banks that collapsed in
October 2008 after they amassed $61 billion of debt, equivalent
to 12 times Iceland&#8217;s gross domestic product. The government
took over the three banks and was forced to seek an
International Monetary Fund bailout as its currency lost as much
as 80 percent of its value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Glitnir collapsed in 2008 in no small part due to the
Johannesson Transactions,&#8221; the bank said in its complaint. The
deals and associated loans cost Glitnir and its creditors more
than $2 billion, according to the suit, which says Glitnir
raised funds through the sale of notes to investors in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also secured an order in the U.K. freezing
Johannesson&#8217;s assets worldwide, including two apartments in
Manhattan&#8217;s Gramercy Park neighborhood, Glitnir&#8217;s liquidators
said in a statement yesterday. Glitnir has already filed
separate lawsuits in Iceland, the liquidators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s just politics,&#8221; Johannesson, 42, said yesterday
about the lawsuits when reached on his mobile phone. He declined
to discuss his whereabouts. &#8220;I have full proof that we were
repaying loans that were maturing 20 to 40 days later. This was
just the refinancing of older loans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PricewaterhouseCoopers didn&#8217;t return a voice-mail message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Glitnir Bank hf v. Johannesson, 601217/2010,
New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adelphia&#8217;s Rigases Win New Hearing in Tax-Fraud Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adelphia Communications Corp. founder John Rigas and his
son Timothy won a new hearing on their bid for dismissal of tax
indictments stemming from a fraud involving the cable company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled yesterday
that a judge must allow the pair to produce evidence showing
prosecutors are seeking to try them twice for the same crime.
John Rigas, 84, is serving 12 years in prison, and Timothy
Rigas, 53, a 17-year term, for looting the cable company and
lying about its finances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After their convictions by a federal jury in New York in
2004, prosecutors in Pennsylvania charged the men with failing
to pay taxes on $1.9 billion they were accused of stealing. The
executives contend the tax charges focus on the same conduct
that was at issue in the New York trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The record reveals no factor that would have prevented
the government from bringing the counts charged in the
Pennsylvania indictment in the New York prosecution,&#8221; the full
court said in its 7-4 decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New York, the Rigases were convicted of securities fraud
and bank fraud, as well as conspiring to commit securities
fraud, bank fraud, falsify books and records and make false
statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Adelphia
was once the fifth-largest U.S. cable-television company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania case charges them under the same
conspiracy statute with plotting to defraud the U.S. of more
than $300 million in tax revenue. It also charges them with six
counts of tax evasion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Rocktashel, a prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s
Office in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, declined to comment
immediately on the appeals court&#8217;s ruling. Prosecutors filed the
charges against the Rigases in that court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence G. McMichael, a Philadelphia-based lawyer for the
executives, didn&#8217;t return a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rigas, 08-3218, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr Seeks Order for Cuomo to Disclose AIG Records &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maurice &#8220;Hank&#8221; Greenberg&#8217;s Starr International USA Inc.
asked a New York court to compel state Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo to disclose records related to American International
Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr called &#8220;unlawful and arbitrary&#8221; Cuomo&#8217;s office&#8217;s
refusal to disclose records dating from 2005 submitted by an
independent consultant to Cuomo&#8217;s office, in a May 7 filing in
Manhattan state Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Starr is entitled to these records,&#8221; the company said in
its court papers, citing New York&#8217;s Freedom of Information Law.
&#8220;FOIL imposes a broad duty of disclosure on government
agencies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuomo&#8217;s office has a pending lawsuit accusing Greenberg,
84, and former AIG Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith of using
sham reinsurance deals and other transactions to distort AIG&#8217;s
reported financial condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Bamberger, a spokesman for Cuomo, didn&#8217;t return a

&lt;p&gt;Miami Hotel Builders Face Tax Prosecution, Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Miami Beach hotel developers must face charges that
they hid more than $45 million from the Internal Revenue
Service, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Mauricio Cohen Assor and his son Leon Cohen
Levy, who built residential hotels under the Flatotel name,
failed yesterday to convince a judge in federal court in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, that prosecutors lacked evidence to file
charges. U.S. Magistrate Judge Lurana Snow said testimony by IRS
Agent Scott Johnson convinced her the case should proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have probable cause, and this will be bound over to
the grand jury for further proceedings,&#8221; Snow ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both men have been held without bail since their arrest in
New York on April 15 and Snow set a bail hearing for May 20. At
yesterday&#8217;s hearing, defense lawyer Michael Pasano questioned
Johnson about his 14-page arrest affidavit, seeking to show how
the government&#8217;s claim that the men controlled companies at the
heart of the case was incorrect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v. Cohen Assor, 10-mj-06159, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal Reviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG Reviewing Possible Recovery in Goldman Trades &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. attorneys are reviewing
whether the company may recover funds tied to transactions with
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the insurer&#8217;s chief executive officer
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have fine lawyers, we are looking at all of the
activities that occurred,&#8221; CEO Robert Benmosche said yesterday
at AIG&#8217;s annual meeting in New York after a shareholder asked
about transactions with Goldman Sachs. &#8220;To the extent we find
anything that was done wrong, or any harm to AIG that should not
have happened, our legal staff will take appropriate actions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benmosche, hired in August, is seeking to stabilize a firm
that reported almost $100 billion in net losses in 2008 after
bad bets on mortgage-related investments including
collateralized debt obligations. Collateral calls from Goldman
Sachs and other investment banks forced AIG to the brink of
collapse in September 2008. The insurer&#8217;s bailout that year
provided funds to help meet obligations to Wall Street firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs received about $12.9 billion related to
credit-default swaps and securities-lending contracts that the
insurer wound down after its rescue. The Securities and Exchange
Commission sued Goldman Sachs last month for misleading clients
including ABN Amro Bank NV in CDO trades. Benmosche, 65, didn&#8217;t
specify which trades AIG is reviewing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Herr, a spokesman for AIG, and Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Michael
DuVally declined to comment. Goldman Sachs has said the SEC suit
is unfounded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government owns about 80 percent of AIG, a stake
it took after rescuing the company in September 2008. Fairholme
Capital Management, the investment firm run by Bruce Berkowitz,
has the second-largest stake. Berkowitz raised his bet on AIG&#8217;s
recovery by increasing holdings to 25.5 million shares,
according to a filing this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG&#8217;s rescue includes a $60 billion Federal Reserve credit
line, a Treasury Department investment of as much as $69.8
billion and up to $52.5 billion to buy mortgage-linked assets
owned or backed by the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coventree Misled Investors About Subprime Risks, OSC Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coventree Inc., the biggest seller of non-bank asset-backed
commercial paper in Canada when the market collapsed in 2007,
misled investors about the risks of some of the securities, a
lawyer for the country&#8217;s main stock-market regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a July 2007 e-mail, Toronto-based Coventree alerted
dealers, including pension manager Caisse de Depot et Placement
du Quebec, that some of its debt funds had ties to U.S. subprime
mortgages, said Jane Waechter, a lawyer for the Ontario
Securities Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being notified, Caisse &#8220;began to withdraw, and
demand for Coventree-sponsored ABCP deteriorated rapidly,&#8221; told
a three-member OSC panel yesterday at the start of a hearing in
Toronto. As a result, about C$16 billion ($15.7 billion) of debt
couldn&#8217;t be refinanced, leading to the collapse of the market,
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collapse resulted in the biggest insolvency in Canadian
history, with C$32 billion of notes pooled into trusts that
filed for bankruptcy protection. At least 100 companies and
institutional investors, and more than 1,750 individuals, were
stuck with notes that couldn&#8217;t be traded. An Ontario judge in
January 2009 approved a plan to swap the insolvent commercial
paper for longer-term notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of
Canada and brokerages agreed to pay a total of C$134 million in
fines and penalties to settle regulators&#8217; claims they improperly
sold the paper just before the market collapsed. Bank of Nova
Scotia&#8217;s Scotia Capital unit agreed to pay C$29.3 million to
resolve the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OSC also accuses Coventree Chief Executive Officer
Geoffrey Cornish and former CEO Dean Tai of misleading investors
in April 2007 presentations by telling them that 7.4 percent of
its asset-backed commercial paper was tied to U.S. subprime
mortgages. The figure exceeded 15 percent in some investments
and in one case topped 40 percent, the OSC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is misleading to ABCP investors by omission,&#8221;
Waechter told the commission panel. &#8220;Disclosure is the
cornerstone of securities&#8217; regulations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coventree and the executives have denied any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Case Rewards Repeat Whistleblowers With $45 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blowing the whistle on drugmakers is becoming a habit for a
salesman and a psychiatrist splitting a $45 million award after
AstraZeneca Plc settled claims of illegally marketing a
schizophrenia drug, Bloomberg News&#8217;s David Voreacos and Margaret
Cronin Fisk report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Wetta, a former company sales representative, sued in
2004 claiming AstraZeneca marketed Seroquel to children,
prisoners and the elderly for uses not approved by regulators.
Stefan Kruszewski, a psychiatrist, sued two years later, saying
the company misrepresented Seroquel&#8217;s risks and benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department joined their cases and settled
April 27 with the company for $520 million under the False
Claims Act. The men received payments after years of waiting.
Each previously won awards in such litigation, an event that
attorney Erika A. Kelton said is growing more common. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Repeat whistleblowers exist in the pharma industry
because off-label marketing is so prevalent,&#8221; said Kelton, of
Phillips  Cohen LLP, a Washington law firm that successfully
represented about 70 such clients over 15 years. &#8220;Sales reps do
jump from company to company, so they may be exposed to a number
of similarly illegal practices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The False Claims Act lets private citizens sue on behalf of
the government and share in any recovery. Whistleblowers were
paid $2.39 billion from 1987 to 2009, or 16 percent of the
$15.19 billion collected in False Claims lawsuits where the U.S.
government joined the case, according to the Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kruszewski earlier sued Pfizer Inc. over claims about
Geodon, an antipsychotic. He said he&#8217;ll get $14.5 million from a
settlement last year in which Pfizer agreed to pay $2.3 billion
to resolve claims over drugs that included Geodon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wetta marketed the antipsychotic Zyprexa at Eli Lilly  Co.
before joining AstraZeneca. He sued Indianapolis-based Lilly in
2003 over sales practices and was one of nine whistleblowers who
split about $100 million when the company paid $1.42 billion
last year to settle state and federal claims. Wetta joined
AstraZeneca before the Lilly case was made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Jewell, a U.S. spokesman for London-based AstraZeneca,
the U.K.&#8217;s second-largest drugmaker, declined to comment on
Wetta and Kruszewski. The company denied allegations of illegal
marketing and settled the case to avoid &#8220;the delay, uncertainty
and expense of protracted litigation,&#8221; Glenn Engelmann, U.S.
general counsel, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Loder, a spokesman for New York-based Pfizer, the
world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, declined to comment on Kruszewski. He
said the company didn&#8217;t admit wrongdoing in marketing Geodon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seroquel case is U.S. ex rel. Kruszewski v. AstraZeneca
Pharmaceuticals, 06-4004, U.S. District Court, Eastern District
of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Court News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan&#8217;s Powers of Persuasion Would Be Tested on Supreme Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elena Kagan was only 43 when she became dean of Harvard Law
School in 2003. One of her goals: Persuade some of her older
colleagues to take on more courses and publish more papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She would sit down with them and tell them they had to be
more productive,&#8221; said professor Alan Dershowitz, a colleague
on the faculty. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t easy. Some of these faculty members
were 20 years older than her. She insisted on high quality work
from the professors. She got some people to work a little
harder.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan&#8217;s powers of persuasion have served her well in her
career -- so well that she has almost reached the pinnacle of
success in her field as President Barack Obama&#8217;s second U.S.
Supreme Court nominee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question now is how her interpersonal skills would
transfer to the unique, often mysterious world of the Supreme
Court, Bloomberg News&#8217;s Greg Stohr reports. Kagan, 50, would
become not only the newest justice, but also the youngest and by
far the least experienced in the art of judging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven of her eight prospective colleagues have served on a
federal court -- trial, appellate or Supreme -- for at least 17
years. The eighth, John Roberts, has been a judge since 2003 and
chief justice since 2005. Kagan has never been a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She would join a court where Roberts and four colleagues --
Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Anthony
Kennedy -- have banded together to strike down campaign finance
regulations, limit shareholder lawsuits and protect gun owners&#8217;
rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The potential is there for her to have a very significant
impact, but it&#8217;s hard to know how Scalia and Thomas and Roberts
and Alito are going to react to her,&#8221; said Stephen Wermiel, a
former Supreme Court reporter who now teaches at American
University&#8217;s Washington College of Law. &#8220;These are strong
personalities and strong-willed people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

justice of India&#8217;s Supreme Court, succeeding K.G. Balakrishnan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kapadia, 62, was administered the oath of office by
President Pratibha Patil at her residence in New Delhi. Kapadia
will head India&#8217;s judiciary until Sept. 29, 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asian stocks rose the most in two
months, led by computer-related companies after earnings from
Tokyo Electron Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. boosted confidence
in the technology industry, and as concern about Europe eased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Electron, the world&#8217;s second-largest maker of
semiconductor equipment, jumped 7 percent after forecasting a
return to profit. Tencent, China&#8217;s biggest Internet company by
market value, gained 5 percent in Hong Kong after reporting a
gain in net income. Samsung Electronics Co., Asia&#8217;s biggest
chipmaker, rose 3 percent in Seoul. Hyundai Motor Co., South
Korea&#8217;s largest automaker, climbed to a record after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. boosted its rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.7 percent to 120.79 at
7:29 p.m. in Tokyo, set for its biggest gain since March 8. Five
stocks climbed for each that fell. The index has fallen 6.4
percent since a high for the year on April 15 as Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis and concern China will quell inflation eroded confidence
in a global economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The underlying message from the economy and corporate
earnings is that we&#8217;re on the recovery path,&#8221; said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage $1.7 billion in Sydney at Platypus
Asset Management Ltd. &#8220;The disruptions in the European Union
over the last few weeks could have interfered with that process
of healing. But the decisive action taken means the recovery
won&#8217;t get cut short.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&#8217;s Taiex Index advanced 2.21 percent, the biggest
increase among major equity benchmarks in the Asia-Pacific
region. South Korea&#8217;s Kospi Index gained 1.9 percent. Hong
Kong&#8217;s Hang Seng Index increased 1 percent. China&#8217;s Shanghai
Composite Index advanced 2.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexes Advance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose almost 2.2 percent as
the finance ministry said the nation&#8217;s current-account surplus
widened in March on exports, a sign overseas demand is
sustaining a recovery in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s SP/ASX 200 Index gained 1.8 percent. The
statistics bureau said job growth accelerated in April,
propelled by full-time employment and indicating diminished
slack in an economy fueled by resource shipments to China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index slipped 0.1
percent. The index rose 1.4 percent yesterday in New York as a
bond sale by Portugal, Spain&#8217;s reduction of public wages and new
U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s plans to cut the deficit
boosted optimism that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will ease. Earlier
this week, European policy makers unveiled a financial-aid
package of almost $1 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anxiety over Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis has eased,&#8221;
said Naoki Fujiwara, a fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management
Co. in Tokyo, which oversees about $6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Debt Crisis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell every day last week and
erased its gains for the year as concern mounted that countries
in addition to Greece will struggle to repay their debt. The
average price of stocks in the gauge sank to 15 times estimated
earnings on May 7, the lowest level since January 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Electron jumped 7 percent to 6,080 yen, its biggest
gain this year. The company forecast net income of 55 billion
yen ($590 million) this fiscal year after a net loss of 9
billion yen last year as demand rebounds for semiconductors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Microelectronics Corp., the world&#8217;s second-largest
custom-chip maker, bought NT$505 million ($16 million) of
equipment from Tokyo Electron, according to a filing to the
Taiwan stock exchange today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tencent climbed 5 percent to HK$158.90 in Hong Kong after
saying first-quarter profit increased 72 percent. Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co., the assembler of Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPod,
gained 2.9 percent to NT$144 in Taipei and was the biggest
contributor to Taiwan&#8217;s Taiex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Surprising Contribution&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elpida Memory Inc., Japan&#8217;s No. 1 maker of computer-memory
chips, rose 2.5 percent to 1,901 yen after reporting annual
profit for the first time since fiscal year 2007 as sales surged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in Tokyo, NTT Urban Development Co. surged 7.7 percent
to 89,900 yen. The company forecast full-year net income will
rise to 9 billion yen from 6.1 billion yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was a surprising contribution to profit growth from
a reduction in the primary costs ratio and non-operating costs,
and a decline in extraordinary losses,&#8221; Shoji Hirakawa and
Masaaki Shinoda, UBS AG strategists, said in a report on
Japanese stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics gained 3 percent to 813,000 won in
Seoul, the biggest contributor to the MSCI index&#8217;s increase.
Hynix Semiconductor Inc., the world&#8217;s second-largest maker of
computer-memory chips, gained 4.5 percent to 26,850 won. They
were the most active stocks by value in South Korea. Advantest
Corp., the world&#8217;s No. 1 maker of memory-chip testers, gained
3.2 percent to 2,342 yen in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, Cisco &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday in the U.S., International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest provider of computer services, led
gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after setting new
profit and revenue goals. Cisco Systems Inc., the biggest maker
of networking equipment, reported profit that topped analysts&#8217;
estimates after the close of trading in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology-related companies rose the most among the MSCI
index&#8217;s 10 industry groups today, followed by financial shares.
All groups advanced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan&#8217;s biggest bank
by market value, rose 2.9 percent to 462 yen. Commonwealth Bank
of Australia, the country&#8217;s No. 1 lender, climbed 1.2 percent to
A$54.94. Westpac Banking Corp. rose 1.7 percent to A$25.28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyundai Motor, South Korea&#8217;s largest automaker, led
consumer stocks higher after Goldman Sachs raised its rating to
&#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;neutral,&#8221; saying new products in the second half
will help improve earnings. The stock rose 5.6 percent to
141,500 won, its highest close on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isuzu Motors Ltd., Japan&#8217;s largest maker of light-duty
trucks, leapt 8.6 percent to 328 yen, the biggest advance in the
MSCI index. The stock extended a 6.3 percent jump yesterday
after forecasting profit will more than double this year. Yamaha
Motor Co., the world&#8217;s second-biggest motorcycle maker, rose 5.1
percent to 1,438 yen in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air China Ltd., the nation&#8217;s largest international carrier,
increased 6.7 percent to HK$7.62 in Hong Kong after Morgan
Stanley raised its rating to &#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;equal
weight,&#8221; citing the effects of a tax waiver on earnings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble Co., the world&#8217;s
largest consumer products company, raised 100 billion yen ($1.1
billion) from its first sale of bonds denominated in the
Japanese currency for a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent priced 0.95
percent, five-year notes to yield 28 basis points more than the
yen swap rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It told
investors earlier this week that it planned to sell 50 billion
yen of notes at a spread of as much as 35 basis points,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the spread has narrowed, it still &#8220;looks attractive
for Japanese investors,&#8221; said Katsuyuki Tokushima, chief fixed-
income analyst at NLI Research Institute, a unit of Nippon
Mutual Life Insurance Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese corporate bond sales slumped 17 percent to 2.9
trillion yen this year compared with the same period of 2009
amid concern about contagion from Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis,
Bloomberg data show. The extra yield investors demand to own yen
notes sold by overseas borrowers in Japan, or Samurai bonds,
fell to 147 basis points yesterday from 152 basis points May 7
before European governments announced a $1 trillion stability
plan, according to an index compiled by Nomura Securities Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Grade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG, based in Cincinnati, is rated Aa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service, the risk assessor&#8217;s fourth-highest investment grade. It
last sold yen-denominated debt in May 2000, when it raised 50
billion yen from 10-year, 2 percent bonds maturing next month,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five-year, 0.71 percent notes sold by Mizuho Corporate Bank
in April were quoted yesterday at 3 basis points less than the
yen swap rate, according to Japan Securities Dealers Association
prices on Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit of Mizuho Financial Group Inc. is also rated Aa3
by Moody&#8217;s. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money raised from the new bonds will be used &#8220;for general
corporate purposes,&#8221; PG spokeswoman Jennifer Chelune said in
an e-mailed response to queries from Bloomberg News today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boeing Co. and Exxon Mobil Corp. are
lobbying to fend off tightened sanctions against Iran that
business groups say may cost $25 billion in U.S. exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legislation before Congress would expand a 1996 law
penalizing foreign companies that invest in that country&#8217;s oil
industry. U.S. firms, already barred from investing there, say
their sales worldwide could be hurt by provisions that ban doing
business with companies in Europe, Russia or China that trade
with Iran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are up on Capitol Hill talking about the collateral
damage,&#8221; William Reinsch, president of the National Foreign
Trade Council, a Washington-based group that represents Exxon
and Boeing, said in an interview. &#8220;There is legitimate, non-
Iran business that will be cut off.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sanctions measure follows President Barack Obama&#8217;s
difficulty in getting members of the United Nations to agree to
expanded financial penalties on Iran, which the U.S. estimates
may be three to five years from having a nuclear bomb. Lawmakers
are trying to work out differences this month between Senate and
House versions of the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargill Inc., ConocoPhillips, Hannover Re, Bechtel Corp.,
Halliburton Co. and Siemens AG are among more than 20 companies
that have lobbied on the proposed sanctions, according to
congressional disclosure forms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. fell in
New York trading after the U.S. Senate included limits on debit-
card fees in the financial-overhaul bill and analysts said the
House is likely to approve the amendment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure would empower the Federal Reserve to curb
debit-card interchange, or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, charged to merchants.
Visa, the world&#8217;s biggest payments network, dropped $8.47, or
9.9 percent, to $77.26 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, and has fallen 20 percent from a closing high
of $96.59 on April 23. MasterCard fell $19.86, or 8.6 percent,
to $212.45, also sliding 20 percent in three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of networks and banks came under pressure last week
as Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin pushed the fee curbs. The
limits may crimp revenue at Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo 
Co. and JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. debit-card
issuers. The measure cleared the Senate because of the
industry&#8217;s &#8220;terrible&#8221; attitude toward merchants, Durbin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They do things that are just totally indefensible,&#8221;
Durbin said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;They really have
done everything they can to suppress any competition between the
two giants.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate voted 64-33 to approve Durbin&#8217;s amendment, which
passed with the support of 17 Republicans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the Wall
Street firm facing a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, named E. Gerald Corrigan and J. Michael Evans to oversee a new business standards committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corrigan, 68, joined the firm in 1994 after a 25-year
career at the Federal Reserve, culminating as president of the
New York Fed. Evans, 52, arrived in 1993 after 10 years at
Salomon Brothers, now part of Citigroup Inc., and is both a vice
chairman of the company and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia. The
panel will make a final report public after a December board
meeting, Goldman Sachs said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer, announced plans to create the committee at
the firm&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting on May 7. He said the
panel, formed after the SEC lawsuit and a U.S. Senate grilling
of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s top executives over their treatment of
clients, would make recommendations on how the firm could
reinforce its focus on clients and ethics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This initiative is consistent with our obligation to
ensure that our standards across our business activities are of
the highest quality and represent the benchmark for the industry
globally,&#8221; Blankfein, 55, said in today&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee will have 17 members, the firm said. They
include Chief Administrative Officer Jeffrey Schroeder, who will
serve as the panel&#8217;s chief operating officer, and David Greenwald, the firm&#8217;s international general counsel and deputy
general counsel, who will provide legal advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper, Daffey, Gnodde &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other members are: Edith Cooper, global head of human
capital management; Michael Daffey, global head of equities
sales and securities distribution in Europe; Richard Gnodde, co-
CEO of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s European business; David Heller, global
co-head of the securities division; Kevin Kennedy, head of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Latin American business; Arthur Levitt, the
former SEC chairman who now serves as an adviser to Goldman
Sachs; Gwen Libstag, head of business selection and conflicts
clearance; Timothy O&#8217;Neill, co-head of the investment management
division; Harvey Schwartz, global co-head of the securities
division; Sarah Smith, controller and chief accounting officer;
David Solomon and John S. Weinberg, co-heads of the investment
banking division; and Matthew Westerman, global head of equity
capital markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten of the 17 members of the committee, including Evans,
already serve on the firm&#8217;s 30-person management committee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will buy
Nexen Inc.&#8217;s North American natural-gas trading business for an
undisclosed price, reducing volatility in Nexen&#8217;s earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nexen Vice President Pierre Alvarez confirmed the sale in
an e-mail today. The trading assets will be sold to J. Aron 
Co., the commodity-trading division of Goldman Sachs, Alvarez
said. Michael Duvally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, confirmed the sale and refused further comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale is expected to be cash-neutral, Nexen said in an
April 30 filing, and the Calgary-based company said it would
likely report a $250 million to $290 million non-cash loss
associated with the sale. The company said in the filing its
marketing business has generated about $800 million in cash
during the last 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They probably had contracts that were loss positions that
these guys had to take, so as a result it was cash-neutral,&#8221;
said Kristopher Zack, an analyst with Raymond James Ltd. in
Calgary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the sale won&#8217;t boost Nexen&#8217;s cash flow, it will
likely remove volatility from the oil exploration and production
company&#8217;s results, Zack said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nexen sold its European gas and power-marketing business
earlier this year. The company was formed by Occidental
Petroleum Corp. when it combined its Canadian units in the early
1970s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
securities firm that makes about 10 percent of its revenue from
trades on its own behalf, is ceasing proprietary trading in one
type of structured debt, according to a person close to the
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of traders who were focused on making bets on
collateralized loan obligations with the New York-based firm&#8217;s
own money are now handling trades for clients, the person said,
speaking anonymously because the plans aren&#8217;t public. CLOs are
bonds backed by pools of corporate loans. Andrea Rachman, a
spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm, merged
the proprietary trading desk with the team that handles
transactions for clients as it wound down the positions in the
proprietary trading book, the person said. Both groups were run
by Gerald Ouderkirk, who was promoted to managing director in
October 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset-Backed Alert, an industry newsletter, reported on the
changes in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s CLO trading division in its May 14
issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation, debt
instruments that repackage loans into securities of varying risk
that pay investors different yields. The market boomed in the
first half of the last decade, helping fuel a spree of leveraged
buyouts by providing demand for loans that helped reduce the
cost of funding. The market dried up in 2007 and 2008 as the
mortgage market crisis caused investors to flee from structured
credit into simpler and safer securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fair value of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s retained interests in
CDOs and CLOS dropped to $367 million at the end of November
2008 from $1.97 billion two years earlier, according to company
filings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. hired HSBC Holdings Plc,
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG to
sell a 40-year index-linked bond as the new government maintains
near-record debt sales to fund its budget deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale of the 0.5 percent inflation-protected gilt due in
2050 will start the week of May 24, the Debt Management Office
said today in a statement. The transaction is part of 185.2
billion pounds ($270 billion) of gilts the Treasury plans to
issue in the fiscal year ended March 2011, the debt agency said
in April. Of the total, 38 billion pounds will be inflation-
linked bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason to think this bond sale isn&#8217;t going to
go well given the underlying structural demand for long-dated
and index-linked bonds in the U.K,&#8221; said Charles Diebel, head
of sovereign strategy at Nomura International Plc in London, one
of the 17 primary dealers which deals directly with the
Treasury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syndicated sale is the first since the coalition took
power on May 11. During the campaign, members of the
Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties questioned whether the
government should hire Goldman Sachs, which is facing a fraud
lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
company has denied wrongdoing and said it will fight the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition to Goldman &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable, the coalition government&#8217;s business secretary
and a member of Liberal Democrats, said on April 20 that the
government should stop working with the bank &#8220;until this matter
is cleared up.&#8221; Conservative Mark Hoban, now a Treasury
minister, asked the same day why former Prime Minister Gordon Brown was using Goldman Sachs after describing the firm as
&#8220;morally bankrupt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment today. The matter is an
operational issue for the debt agency, the U.K. Treasury said in
a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Debt Management Office&#8217;s appointment of the bank was
based on &#8220;government financing and operational matters alone,&#8221;
said Sarah Ellis, a spokeswoman at the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We appointed Goldman Sachs on the same basis as the other
lead managers and other transactions, consistent with our
assessment of which banks will ensure a successful transaction
for the taxpayer,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The decision on the composition
of the syndicate is a routine operational one, taken strictly in
accordance with debt-management principles.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakeven Rate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. long-dated index-linked bonds underperformed regular
gilts this year. The securities, which come due in 25 years or
longer, handed investors a loss of 5.4 percent, compared with a
gain of 0.3 percent from conventional bonds of comparable
maturities, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the 40-year index-linked gilt declined two
basis points to 0.73 percent as of 4:47 p.m. in London. In the
U.K., the bonds pay interest on a principal amount that rises or
falls based on the retail price index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. 30-year breakeven rate, a gauge of long-term
inflation expectations derived from the difference in yields
between regular gilts and index-linked bonds, declined to 361
basis points, from 367 basis points last week, and from 378
basis points at the end of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transocean Ltd., the owner and
operator of the oil rig leased to BP Plc that exploded last
month and killed 11 workers, asked a U.S. judge to limit its
liability to $26.7 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request, filed yesterday in Houston federal court under
a 150-year-old law originally designed for the shipping
industry, applies to all litigation the company faces over the
explosion and subsequent oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think there are more than 100 cases now,&#8221; Guy
Cantwell, Transocean&#8217;s spokesman, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig off the coast of
Louisiana exploded on April 20 and sank two days later.
Transocean and co-owners of the Deepwater Horizon, which now
lies wrecked a mile deep in the Gulf of Mexico, say the state-
of-the-art rig has a present value of zero and had accrued
almost $27 million in unpaid rental fees before it exploded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also asked that all litigation against the rig
owners be consolidated before one federal judge in Houston,
where Transocean&#8217;s U.S. operations are based. Vernier,
Switzerland-based Transocean said it would create a court-
administered fund, equal to the unpaid fees, from which all
claims against the company could be paid on a pro-rata basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for victims of the rig disaster and spill said that
while Transocean&#8217;s move to limit its liability probably wouldn&#8217;t
succeed, it could cause the oil spill litigation to be
consolidated into a single multidistrict proceeding in federal
court in Houston, as BP has also requested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean denied responsibility for the explosion and
spill and said the Deepwater Horizon, known as a mobile offshore
drilling unit, was &#8220;in all respects seaworthy&#8221; and properly
maintained and staffed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re The complaint and petition of Triton
Asset Leasing GmbH, 4:10-cv-01721, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam Again Seeks to Block Stock Trade Evidence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of hedge fund firm Galleon
Group LLC who faces insider trading charges, again asked a judge
to bar prosecutors from admitting evidence at his trial of
trades in 22 companies that prosecutors didn&#8217;t initially cite in
the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam was indicted for making illegal trades in 12
stocks. In March and April, prosecutors said they planned to
offer evidence at Rajaratnam&#8217;s October trial of his suspect
trades in 22 more companies, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers previously asked to exclude evidence of the
additional companies and reiterated the request yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An ambush it was,&#8221; defense attorney John Dowd wrote in a
six-page legal brief, referring to the disclosure of additional
companies. The 22 new companies &#8220;were not mentioned at all&#8221; in
the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is the central figure in a wide-ranging inside
trading probe that has led to criminal charges against 21 people
in two overlapping cases. Eleven people have pleaded guilty,
including the four other defendants arrested with Rajaratnam and
Danielle Chiesi on Oct. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is accused of using secret tips from hedge fund
executives, corporate officials and other insiders to earn
millions of dollars in illegal stock trades. He has denied the
charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-1184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Plaintiffs&#8217; Lawyers Jockey to Lead Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several dozen lawyers asked a federal judge in California
yesterday to appoint them to leadership positions over lawsuits
against Toyota Motor Corp. related to sudden acceleration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota, the world&#8217;s largest automaker, faces at least 228
federal and 99 state lawsuits, including proposed class actions
over economic loss and claims of personal injuries or deaths
caused by sudden-acceleration incidents. The federal lawsuits
were combined April 9 in a multidistrict litigation, or MDL,
before U.S. District Judge James V. Selna in Santa Ana,
California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys from more than 70 firms filed requests seeking to
be appointed by Selna as lead counsel or committee members for
the litigation, the judge said in court papers May 11. He heard
applicants&#8217; arguments at an initial organizing conference
yesterday. Selna said he will rule by May 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toyota City, Japan-based company has recalled more than
8 million vehicles for fixes related to sudden, unintended
acceleration. The automaker announced in September that it was
recalling 3.8 million Toyota and Lexus vehicles because of a
defect that may cause floor mats to jam accelerator pedals. The
company later recalled vehicles over defects involving the
pedals themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Toyota is confident the legal process will be conducted
with integrity and fairness,&#8221; the company said yesterday in a
statement on the opening of the litigation. &#8220;Recently we have
seen instances where the facts did not support the initial
claims and sensational reports. In the best interest of all
those involved, it&#8217;s important to keep this in mind as the case
proceeds and facts are presented.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are combined as In re Toyota Motor Corp.
Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products
Liability Litigation, 8:10-ml-02151, U.S. District Court,

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay Sellers Allege PayPal Improperly Holds Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two EBay Inc. customers sued the company alleging that its
PayPal payments unit improperly freezes sellers&#8217; funds for as
long as 180 days without adequately explaining why customers
can&#8217;t access their money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay tells customers that the holds are for security issues
or suspicious activity, according to a complaint alleging unfair
business practices that was filed yesterday in federal court in
San Francisco. Users have been unable to get the hold lifted
after complaining and providing documentation and personal
information, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sellers are told that they must obtain a subpoena or court
order to find out why their accounts are on hold, according to
the complaint. EBay retains the interest that has accrued when
the funds are returned, the customers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We haven&#8217;t yet been served with the lawsuit and are
therefore unable to comment on the matter specifically,&#8221; Anuj
Nayar, an EBay spokesman, said in an e-mail. &#8220;However, our
policies are standard in the industry and we believe they comply
with all applicable laws.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Osman v. EBay, 10-2046, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks&#8217; Municipal Debt Trades Face Preliminary Probe, WSJ Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators are exploring possible conflicts of
interest for banks that sold municipal bonds and bet the
securities would fail, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and state
authorities opened a preliminary probe into municipal credit-
default swap trades by banks, the newspaper said. The inquiry
seeks to determine whether banks used their own capital to bet
against bonds they sold and if the practice was disclosed
properly to buyers, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The municipal bond investigation may not lead to any final
action, the Wall Street Journal said. All the banks declined to
comment on the SEC probe and a related inquiry by California,
the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, California Treasurer Bill Lockyer asked six
banks how much they earned by betting against the state&#8217;s bonds,
according to the report. He sent letters to Bank of America
Corp., Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley, the newspaper said. In
March, Lockyer questioned how the same banks marketed contracts
used to bet against municipal bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clare Williams, Barclays Asia-Pacific spokeswoman, Rob
Stewart, a Bank of America spokesman, and Citigroup&#8217;s Asian
spokesman James Griffiths all declined to comment. E-mails to
the other three banks seeking comment weren&#8217;t returned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks, Rating Companies Said to Be Subpoenaed by Cuomo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, UBS AG and five
other banks were subpoenaed by New York Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo over whether they misled rating companies about mortgage-
backed securities, according to a person familiar with the
investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuomo is probing the relationships between the banks and
the companies, which also were subpoenaed, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the investigation is
continuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subpoenas were sent May 12, the person said. State and
federal regulators since at least 2008 have been looking into
why Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Fitch
Ratings gave top grades to subprime-mortgage backed securities
and collateralized debt obligations that later plummeted in
value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subpoenas also went to Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche
Bank AG, Citigroup Inc., Credit Agricole SA and Merrill Lynch 
Co., which was acquired by Bank of America Corp., the person
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2008, after probing the role of the three ratings
agencies in the subprime-mortgage crisis, Cuomo announced
settlements that he said included a new fee structure designed
to eliminate shopping by investment banks for ratings for
residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS received a subpoena from the New York attorney general
and will comply, said Doug Morris, a spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s Mark Lake declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coventree Followed Law in Commercial Paper Sale, Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coventree Inc., once the biggest seller of non-bank asset-
backed commercial paper in Canada, complied with Ontario
regulatory law, the company&#8217;s lawyer said, denying allegations
the bank misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ontario Securities Commission &#8220;sought to attribute to
Coventree knowledge that it did not have,&#8221; Kent Thomson,
Coventree&#8217;s lawyer, said yesterday at an OSC hearing in Toronto.
&#8220;One can&#8217;t disclose what one does not know.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSC lawyer Jane Waechter said May 12 Coventree misled
investors about the risks of its commercial paper investments
and failed to disclose that institutional buyers, including
Caisse de depot et Placement du Quebec, were pulling out of the
market on concern that the notes had ties to U.S. subprime
mortgages. The market for the notes froze in August 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OSC filed a statement Dec. 7 alleging that Coventree
broke securities law. The commission isn&#8217;t seeking specific
monetary damages, and any fine would be up to the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OSC also accused Coventree Chief Executive Officer
Geoffrey Cornish and former CEO Dean Tai of misleading investors
in April 2007 presentations by telling them that 7.4 percent of
its asset-backed commercial paper was tied to U.S. subprime
mortgages. That figure actually exceeded 15 percent in some
investments and in one case topped 40 percent, the OSC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is misleading to ABCP investors by omission,&#8221;
Waechter told the commission panel May 12. &#8220;Disclosure is the
cornerstone of securities&#8217; regulations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-JJ Unit Executive Wins Appeal of London Jail Time &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former employee at Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s U.K. unit who
admitted to joining a scheme to pay bribes to Greek doctors had
his prison sentence overturned in a ruling that may still limit
the U.K. Serious Fraud Office&#8217;s ability to offer plea bargains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling yesterday by the Court of Appeal in London
overturns a 12-month prison term given to Robert John Dougall,
44, who agreed with Britain&#8217;s SFO to admit his role in the plot
and help with the probe in exchange for avoiding jail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges David Clarke and Lloyd Jones said Dougall should
have his prison sentence suspended because he cooperated with
authorities and didn&#8217;t profit from the scheme. They also said
the SFO shouldn&#8217;t offer such deals to whistleblowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A plea agreement or bargain between the prosecution and
the defense, in which they agree what the sentence should be, or
present what is in effect an agreed package for the court&#8217;s
acquiescence, is contrary to principle,&#8221; the judges wrote in a
19-page decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling is the second to challenge the SFO&#8217;s ability to
offer plea bargains as it seeks to win court approval for a
separate settlement with BAE Systems Plc in a fraud and bribery
case. David Corker, a criminal defense lawyer at Corker Binning
in London, said the ruling is a rebuke to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dougall&#8217;s lawyer, Shaul Brazil, said the court recognized
the tactical value of cooperation and that his client&#8217;s
successful appeal will still help investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dougall admitted paying commissions in advance on sales
made by Medec SA, a Greek distributor of the company&#8217;s
orthopedic products. Some of the money was used to make
&#8220;incentive payments&#8221; to persuade Greek surgeons to use DePuy&#8217;s
products, the SFO said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyer Fined $591,000 for Helping Boiler Room Scam, FSA Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founding partner of a London law firm will be fined
400,000 pounds ($591,000) for aiding a multimillion-pound
illegal share scam, Britain&#8217;s Financial Services Authority said
yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Greystock, a former investment banker at NM
Rothschild  Sons Ltd. and senior partner of Atlantic Law LLP,
will also be banned by the FSA from working in financial
services for signing off on advertising from four Spanish firms
that were boiler rooms, the FSA said. Around 130 British
consumers lost a total of 3 million pounds in the scam,
according to the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA is able to levy the penalty after Greystock lost a
legal challenge at a London tribunal. Greystock wasn&#8217;t
immediately available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Mortgage&#8217;s Hayden Pleads Guilty to Loan Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former service manager of bankrupt U.S. Mortgage Corp.
pleaded guilty to conspiring to sell mortgage loans fraudulently
in a scheme that cost credit unions and Fannie Mae at least $136
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leroy Hayden, 47, pleaded guilty yesterday in federal court
in Newark, New Jersey, to conspiring to commit wire fraud from
2004 to January 2009. He faces as long as five years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Mortgage, based in Pine Brook, New Jersey, filed for
bankruptcy in February 2009 and is being liquidated. The company
underwrote mortgages and serviced loans for credit unions. The
former president of U.S. Mortgage, Michael J. McGrath Jr.,
pleaded guilty last June and faces a prison sentence of 12 1/2
to 20 years under a plea agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Frauds of this magnitude don&#8217;t happen without someone to
cook the books and push the paper,&#8221; U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman
said in a statement. &#8220;Leroy had to decide whether to go along
with his boss&#8217;s fraud or alert law enforcement to the scheme.
Unfortunately, he made the criminal choice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayden, a resident of East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania,
admitted helping McGrath sell hundreds of loans without credit-
union authorization to government-supported Fannie Mae, the
largest holder of U.S. mortgage risk. Those sales &#8220;dramatically
increased&#8221; from 2008 to early 2009, he told U.S. District Judge
Katharine Hayden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also admitted giving reports to credit unions falsely
stating loans that had been sold were still in the credit
unions&#8217; portfolios. He admitted he modified data in U.S.
Mortgage&#8217;s servicing system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stacy Ann Biancamano, a lawyer for Leroy Hayden, declined
to comment after the hearing. Hayden is scheduled to be
sentenced July 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v. Hayden, U.S. District Court, District of
New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayfair Capital&#8217;s Green Is Sentenced to 41 Months &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Green, the former chairman of Mayfair Capital Group
and NoonMark Advisors LLC, was sentenced to 41 months in prison
for stealing more than $5.75 million from investors in his New
York-based firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green, who lives in Locust Valley, New York, last year
pleaded guilty to securities fraud, Manhattan U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara said yesterday in statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a scheme running between 2005 and 2009, Green lied to
investors about how he would use their money, according to the
statement. U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl in Manhattan
ordered Green to pay $5.8 million in restitution and directed
him to forfeit the same amount for his offenses, Bharara said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense lawyer Bobbi Sternheim didn&#8217;t return a call after
business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Green, 1:09-mj-1880, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reggie Bush&#8217;s Lawyer Keeps L.A. Stars Out of Jail and the News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Orleans Saints tailback Reggie Bush, aided by a lawyer
known for representing Hollywood celebrities, settled a lawsuit
over alleged payments to him and his family while he was still
in college. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bush&#8217;s lawyer, Shawn Chapman Holley, has made a career out
of keeping high-profile clients like Bush out of the spotlight.
That means resolving claims before cases are filed, avoiding
court appearances and staying mum on out-of-court settlements,
she said in an interview. The Los Angeles native honed her
skills as a public defender, on the O.J. Simpson defense team as
a prot&#233;g&#233; of Johnnie Cochran, and in four years of rescuing
celebrities at her present law firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I came over here and I was a fish out of water,&#8221; Holley
said of joining veteran entertainment lawyer Howard Weitzman,
who was setting up the firm Kinsella, Weitzman, Iser, Kump 
Aldisert LLP in Santa Monica, California. &#8220;We had all these
celebrity clients with entertainment business litigation cases,
and then suddenly they also had DUIs. My whole thing took off
from there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holley declined to comment on the Bush case. The
settlement, confirmed by Edward P. Swan, a San Diego-based
lawyer who also represents Bush, avoids a deposition of Bush
that, according to an April 22 Los Angeles Times report, may
have been used by the National Collegiate Athletic Association
in a probe of payments to University of Southern California
athletes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holley said her success in representing well-known clients
like Bush is the product of years of legal practice, including a
caseload filled with drunk-driving and paparazzi-assaults by the
famous and almost famous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her clients have included actress Lindsay Lohan, hotel
heiress Paris Hilton and Hilton&#8217;s &#8220;The Simple Life&#8221; co-star
Nicole Richie, rappers Snoop Dogg and the late Tupac Shakur, as
well as boxer Mike Tyson. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Court News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan &#8216;Not Sympathetic&#8217; as Law Clerk to Gun-Rights Argument &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elena Kagan said as a U.S. Supreme Court law clerk in 1987
that she was &#8220;not sympathetic&#8221; toward a man who contended that
his constitutional rights were violated when he was convicted
for carrying an unlicensed pistol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan, whom President Barack Obama nominated to the high
court this week, made the comment to Justice Thurgood Marshall,
urging him in a one-paragraph memo to vote against hearing the
District of Columbia man&#8217;s appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man&#8217;s &#8220;sole contention is that the District of
Columbia&#8217;s firearms statutes violate his constitutional right to
&#8216;keep and bear arms,&#8217;&#8221; Kagan wrote. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sympathetic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan, currently the U.S. solicitor general, has made few
public remarks about the Constitution&#8217;s Second Amendment. The
Supreme Court in 2008 ruled, in a case that overturned the
District of Columbia&#8217;s handgun ban, that the Constitution
protects individual gun rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a nominee to be solicitor general last year, Kagan told
lawmakers that she accepted that 5-4 decision in District of
Columbia v. Heller as a precedent of the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no question, after Heller, that the Second
Amendment guarantees individuals the right to keep and bear arms
and that this right, like others in the Constitution, provides
strong although not unlimited protection against governmental
regulation,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White House spokesman Ben LaBolt said the position taken in
the memo to Marshall reflected the prevailing view of the law at
the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Liu Approved by U.S. Senate Panel for Appeals Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate Judiciary Committee approved, in a party-line
vote, the nomination of law professor Goodwin Liu to be a
federal appeals court judge, clearing the way for a confirmation
vote by the full Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans said they fear Liu will be an activist judge,
raising an issue that is likely to come up when the Senate
weighs the nomination by President Barack Obama of Supreme Court
nominee Elena Kagan. Liu, 39, could also be a possible future
nominee to the high court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s vote was 12-7 for Liu, a professor at the
University of California at Berkeley. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one-year-olds never listen.
Just ask Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Individual to individual, all interaction has been pretty
amicable,&#8221; said Mariel Fiedler, the Syracuse University senior
who fielded a call from Dimon after helping lead protests
against his selection as commencement speaker. &#8220;Otherwise, it&#8217;s
just difference in opinion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 1,200 Syracuse students, alumni and supporters
have signed an online petition urging the university to rescind
the invitation to Dimon, JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s chief executive
officer. The group said it opposed allowing JPMorgan to use the
occasion to &#8220;restore the public image of the banking industry
and validate the anti-environmental and anti-humanitarian
interests of JPMorgan Chase.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 54, told reporters on April 14 that he planned to
deliver the address as planned and that the students should
&#8220;stand up for what they believe in.&#8221; He called Fiedler that
month after seeing her comments about the speech, which is set
for May 16, said Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-
based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We had a really in-depth conversation,&#8221; Fiedler,
a broadcast journalism and English major from Long Island, said
in an interview yesterday. &#8220;He basically just asked me 
what it was that we were so opposed to with having him speak
here. I laid out the different reasoning that people had.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble Co. is locked in a
public-relations war with blogging parents demanding that the
company recall Pampers diapers they say are unsafe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission launched an
investigation May 3 into complaints that Pampers with Dry Max,
the latest iteration of PG&#8217;s $9-billion-a-year brand, causes
rashes and chemical burns. The company denied the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parent bloggers can damage companies that anger them, said
Jackie Huba, principal of Ant&#8217;s Eye View, an Austin, Texas,
strategy consulting firm. Unproven blog posts can metastasize on
the Web and spread far and wide, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of brands live in fear of the mommy bloggers,&#8221;
said Huba. &#8220;Social media is a word-of-mouth jet stream. When
you have angry moms, it&#8217;s going to go all over the world. This
is very dangerous for PG. Their reputation is very important as
they compete with cheaper generic diapers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 11 and May 12, two lawsuits seeking class-action
status were filed in Ohio against Cincinnati-based PG. The
plaintiff parents assert the company &#8220;knew or should have known
that Pampers with Dry Max had the capacity to and, in many cases,
did actually harm infants and toddlers by causing severe rashes,
blisters, chemical burns, infections, and/or other ailments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average reversing a 184-point drop, as the euro&#8217;s
rebound from a four-year low bolstered optimism that the shared
European currency will weather the region&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint Nextel Corp. climbed 3 percent to help lead
telephone companies to the biggest gain among 10 groups after
saying &#8220;steep&#8221; revenue declines have ended. GLG Partners Inc.
rallied 50 percent as Man Group Plc agreed to buy the hedge-fund
firm for $1.6 billion, while Pactiv Corp. surged 19 percent
after a person with knowledge of the discussions said Apollo
Global Management LLC may buy the maker of Hefty trash bags. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index gained 0.1 percent to
1,136.94 at 4 p.m. in New York, recovering from a 1.8 percent
slide. The Dow rose 5.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,625.83.
Equities rebounded from early losses as the euro gained 0.3
percent to $1.2399, snapping a four-day losing streak and
rebounding from its lowest level since April 2006 reached
earlier in the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was quite a remarkable turnaround,&#8221; said John Carey,
Boston-based money-manager at Pioneer Investment Management,
which oversees about $230 billion. &#8220;The fact that the euro has
reversed its earlier losses is a hopeful sign given there&#8217;s so
much concern about the European debt situation. The market was
oversold. The economic recovery is still in place. MA deals are
an indication of that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early Slump &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier slump in stocks was led by energy shares as oil
dipped below $70 a barrel for the first time this year amid
concern Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will derail the economic recovery.
The SP 500 has lost 6.6 percent from its high for the year on
April 23 as credit-ratings downgrades of Greece, Portugal and
Spain added to concern that European governments will struggle
to fund budget deficits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchases of U.S. equities, notes and bonds totaled $140.5
billion in March, more than double economists&#8217; projections,
after net buying of $47.1 billion in February, the Treasury
Department said today. Treasury purchases rose by the most since
June as China, the largest lender to the U.S., added to its
holdings for the first time since September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European finance ministers, meeting in Brussels today, are
under pressure to show they can reduce deficits fast enough to
satisfy investors and then police budgets effectively once
targets are met. Spain and Portugal have already announced
budget cuts. European leaders agreed last week to a $1 trillion
financial lifeline meant to instill confidence with investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Wait-and-See&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a wait-and-see attitude,&#8221; said Stanley Nabi, New
York-based vice chairman of Silvercrest Asset Management Group,
which manages $9 billion. &#8220;What&#8217;s the end game in Europe and
the euro zone? American investors are watching the developments
in Europe, which are not very steady. There&#8217;s a great deal of
concern still on the effect of all that on the global
recovery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint advanced 3 percent to $4.49. Chief Financial Officer
Robert Brust said &#8220;steep&#8221; revenue declines have likely ended
for the third-largest U.S. mobile-phone carrier due in part to
the success of its prepaid services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve entered a more stable period in our operations,&#8221;
Brust said today at a JPMorgan Chase  Co. conference in Boston.
&#8220;The worst of that is over.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gauge of nine telephone companies in the SP 500 rallied
1.2 percent for the top gain among the index&#8217;s 10 main industry
groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MA Pickup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLG Partners surged 50 percent to $4.36. Man Group Plc, the
biggest publicly traded hedge fund firm, agreed to buy the
company for $1.6 billion to reduce its reliance on a single
trading program and expand its range of funds. GLG&#8217;s
shareholders will receive $4.50 in cash for each share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pactiv Corp. had the biggest gain in the SP 500, surging
19 percent to $28.44. Apollo Global Management LLC is in talks
to buy the maker of Hefty trash bags, according to a person with
knowledge of the discussions. Charles Zehren, a spokesman for
New York-based Apollo, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The global recovery is still intact,&#8221; said Chad Morganlander, a Florham Park, New Jersey-based money manager at
Stifel Nicolaus  Co., which oversees $98 billion. &#8220;That is
translating into confidence and mergers and acquisitions
starting to accelerate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kraft Foods Inc. had the biggest gain in the Dow, rising
1.7 percent to $30.55. The maker of Oreo cookies and Maxwell
House coffee&#8217;s profit may rise as its $19 billion purchase of
British confectioner Cadbury Plc helps expand revenue and reduce
costs, Barron&#8217;s reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo Group Inc. and other education companies rallied
after the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Education
Deputy Undersecretary Robert Shireman will step down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The investment community has viewed Shireman as the key
driver of increased scrutiny on the for-profit sector,
specifically the proposed gainful employment regulation, which,
for the most part, is focused on the for-profit sector and could
limit the sector&#8217;s profitability and growth if enacted as
currently proposed,&#8221; Jeffrey M. Silber, an analyst with BMO
Capital Markets, wrote in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo, the biggest U.S. for-profit education provider,
advanced 9.6 percent to $57.85. Corinthian Colleges Inc., Career
Education Corp. and DeVry Inc. gained at least 4.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. and ConocoPhillips helped drag the SP
500 Energy Index to the biggest decline among 10 industries with
a 1 percent drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Slumps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil for June delivery fell 2.2 percent to $70.06 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
settlement since Dec. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early losses in stocks also came after manufacturing in the
New York region expanded at a slower pace in May than forecast
as sales cooled. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York&#8217;s general
economic index fell to 19.1 from 31.9 in April, which was the
second-highest level in four years. Readings greater than zero
signal gains in the so-called Empire State Index that covers New
York, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe&#8217;s Cos. slid 3.1 percent to $25.26. The retailer
projected second-quarter earnings of as much as 59 cents a
share, short of the 62-cent average of analyst estimates. Lowe&#8217;s
is bracing for &#8220;a year of transition&#8221; in 2010, the company
said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The economic barometers are weighing on investors&#8217;
mood,&#8221; said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Chicago-
based Harris Private Bank, which oversees $55 billion.
&#8220;Manufacturing and Lowe&#8217;s numbers did not help, we&#8217;ve got oil
down and there&#8217;s still concern about Europe. Investors appear to
be resetting their expectations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massey Tumbles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massey Energy Co. had the biggest loss in the SP 500,
sinking 10 percent to $33.29. The company&#8217;s unit that operated
the West Virginia coal mine where 29 miners died on April 5 is
being investigated for possible &#8220;willful criminal activity,&#8221;
the Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, rose as much as 13 percent today before erasing
gains and falling 1.3 percent to 30.84. The benchmark index for
U.S. stock options had the biggest weekly advance in its two-
decade history at the beginning of May, surging 86 percent, as
concern that the European debt crisis will curtail global growth
wiped out the 2010 gain for the MSCI World Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not pretty out there,&#8221; said Cliff Remily, a money
manager at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment
Management, which oversees $57 billion. &#8220;Everything oil-related
is doing so poorly. When you combine that with weaker
manufacturing data, Lowe&#8217;s disappointing forecast and
uncertainty about Europe, you&#8217;ll get higher volatility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., facing a
fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
ended talks to hire Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison LLP
to bolster its legal team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussions, which started earlier this month, were
terminated last week and Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t plan to hire
another law firm instead, a person briefed on the matter said,
speaking anonymously because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, confirmed
that the firm isn&#8217;t hiring Paul, Weiss. Madelaine Miller, a
spokeswoman for Paul Weiss, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which generated a record $13.4 billion
profit last year, was seeking additional legal advice as it
faces issues tied to its sale of mortgage-linked securities that
include the SEC suit and a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing last
month. Federal prosecutors are also investigating the firm&#8217;s
activities in the area, people familiar with the matter said
last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was to supplement, not replace, the company&#8217;s
current legal advisers including Sullivan  Cromwell LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard H. Klapper at Sullivan  Cromwell is among the
partners leading Goldman Sachs&#8217;s defense against the SEC
lawsuit. The firm also received advice ahead of the Senate
hearing from K. Lee Blalack II of O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP, who has
previously worked as the subcommittee&#8217;s chief counsel and staff
director. Gregory Craig, President Barack Obama&#8217;s former White
House counsel, is now the partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher  Flom LLP assigned to advise Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 59 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$142.64 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock
has dropped 15.5 percent this year, the most of the biggest six
banks in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the U.S. Senate prepares to vote
as early as this week on legislation rewriting the rules for
Wall Street, the financial industry is holding fundraisers for
lawmakers at a rate of almost one every business day this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some members of Congress have criticized Wall Street one
month only to ask the industry for money the next. U.S.
Representative John Adler, a New Jersey Democrat, demanded
accountability from Wall Street in an April 29 statement. This
week, he&#8217;s holding what is billed as a &#8220;financial services
dinner&#8221; in Washington with a minimum contribution of $1,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 20 House and Senate lawmakers have scheduled
fundraisers in May targeting the industry or hosted by lobbyists
for banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc.,
according to Democratic and Republican party committee schedules
sent to prospective donors. The events allow lobbyists to mingle
with lawmakers as the Senate debates sweeping new regulations
for the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;How hard are you going to be on somebody who&#8217;s handing
you money?&#8221; said Bill Allison, an editor at the Sunlight
Foundation, a Washington-based watchdog group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of fundraisers includes those for Senate
Republicans and for House Democrats and Republicans. The
schedule for Senate Democrats couldn&#8217;t be obtained. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase  Co. reverse-
convertible note paying 64 percent annualized interest plunged
in value on May 14, three days after being sold, showing the
risks of these products usually bought by individual investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structured notes offered 10.7 percent in interest
payments over their two-month term and a return of principal, as
long as shares of TiVo Inc. didn&#8217;t fall more than 25 percent,
according to a prospectus. TiVo dropped 42 percent on May 14
after an adverse court ruling, triggering a provision that will
leave investors holding the possibly depressed stock at
maturity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Barclays Plc
sold $656 million of reverse convertibles in the U.S. last
month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities,
which combine features of bonds and stock options, are often
sold to individuals who don&#8217;t understand the risks, said Jake Zamansky, a New York-based attorney who represents investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s being sold as a bond, an income-generating product,
and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s being explained to people that you can
get stuck with the stock,&#8221; the securities lawyer at Zamansky 
Associates said in a telephone interview on May 14. He has
represented investors in lawsuits related to the products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment.
The prospectus&#8217;s listing of risk considerations includes the
statements &#8220;your investment in the notes may result in a loss&#8221;
and &#8220;your protection may terminate on any day.&#8221; &#8220;Protection&#8221;
refers to the feature where the principal is returned unless, on
any day, the stock closes 25 percent below its initial price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving Stock &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because that level was breached, noteholders will receive
at maturity as many shares of the stock as their investment
would have bought at the initial price, hence the name &#8220;reverse
convertible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Individuals should be buying reverse convertibles on
stocks that they otherwise would consider owning outright,&#8221;
said Keith Styrcula, chairman of the New York-based Structured
Products Association, in a telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in JPMorgan&#8217;s notes could make money if TiVo&#8217;s
share price recovers. The stock was up 5.8 percent, to $10.75,
at 1:09 p.m. today in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange,
compared with $16.88 when the notes were issued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold $800,000 of the TiVo-linked products, it said
in the prospectus. The 64 percent interest rate was the highest
offered on any reverse convertible in months, according to Craig McCann, a Fairfax, Virginia-based litigation consultant who&#8217;s
preparing a study of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Ridiculous&#8217; Commission &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of the securities included a 1.75 percent sales
commission, of which JPMorgan received 0.75 percentage point,
according to the prospectus. That&#8217;s 10.5 percent on an
annualized basis, which is much higher than the commission
charged on comparable investments, according to Seth Lipner, a
Garden City, New York-based attorney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A 10.5 percent commission is ridiculous,&#8221; Lipner said in
a telephone interview on May 14. &#8220;The cost would be much
lower&#8221; for investors to make the same kind of market bet using
various options rather than reverse convertibles, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured notes generally include other costs, such as to
offset risks related to the security, as well as a profit for
the issuer. The built-in costs of the TiVo-linked note were
limited to the 1.75 percent commission, according to the
prospectus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each $1,000 TiVo note was worth $945 on the day it was
offered, according to Bloomberg&#8217;s reverse-convertible pricing
model. McCann said his model came up with an initial value of
$960. Prices generated by the models vary based on the source of
market data and assumptions about liquidity and volatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TiVo&#8217;s decline came after an appeals court said on May 14
it would reconsider the company&#8217;s victory over Dish Network
Corp. and EchoStar Corp. in a digital-video recording patent
case. Dish and EchoStar had asked on April 5 for the full panel
of the appeals court to rehear the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think something with a major development about to
take place, positive or negative, should be put into a reverse
convertible,&#8221; Zamansky said. &#8220;There&#8217;s just too much
volatility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s prospectus states that TiVo&#8217;s stock &#8220;has
experienced significant fluctuations.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t mention the
pending patent case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many investors who lost money on reverse convertibles have
filed arbitration claims against their brokers, according to
Zamansky. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a trade
group, said in a February letter to its members that reverse
convertibles can be &#8220;difficult for retail investors and
registered representatives to evaluate.&#8221; Brokers&#8217; sales pitches
must be &#8220;fair and balanced,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokers often market reverse convertibles as a way for
individuals to take advantage of the sophisticated derivatives
trading that banks use, according to Chris Vernon, a Naples,
Florida-based attorney who represents structured-note investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The pitch with these complex structured products is that
this is what the big boys are doing and now you can do it too,&#8221;
Vernon said in a telephone interview on May 14. &#8220;But the big
boys aren&#8217;t paying 10 percent-plus commission per year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. agreed to settle a
wrongful-death lawsuit alleging its Neurontin epilepsy medicine
caused a retired minister to commit suicide two months after he
started taking the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, told a judge in Nashville, Tennessee, they resolved
claims by the family of Richard Smith, which were set to go to
trial today. It&#8217;s the second settlement of claims that officials
of a Pfizer unit knew the epilepsy drug posed a suicide risk and
failed to disclose it to patients and doctors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased the case has been resolved,&#8221; U.S.
District Judge Aleta Trauger told lawyers for Smith&#8217;s family and
the company today. The terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. Smith, 79, was a
retired Church of Christ minister, according to court papers. He
was taking the drug to deal with chronic pain, not epilepsy, the
filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer faces more than 1,000 lawsuits accusing it of
illegally promoting Neurontin for unapproved uses and helping to
cause some users&#8217; suicides. In March, a Boston jury ordered
Pfizer to pay more than $140 million in damages to an insurer
over its marketing practices in connection with the drug. Pfizer
has denied any wrongdoing in connection with its handling of
Neurontin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Great Sympathy&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its Warner-Lambert subsidiary pleaded guilty in 2004 to
criminal charges filed by the Justice Department in connection
with allegations it illegally marketed Neurontin and paid a $430
million fine. Pfizer bought Warner-Lambert for $120 billion in
2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to have reached an agreement with the
Smith family to resolve this case as it avoids the time and
expense of a trial,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We have great sympathy for the Smith
family and respect their desire for privacy regarding the
outcome of the case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By prescribing Neurontin as a painkiller, Smith&#8217;s doctor
was recommending a so-called off-label use of the drug. While
doctors may prescribe a medicine for uses not approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, companies are barred from
promoting products for off-label uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the guilty plea, Warner-Lambert officials
acknowledged the company engaged in &#8220;deceptive off-label
marketing&#8221; of Neurontin, Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. said in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Snake-Oil List&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Warner-Lambert medical liaison testified in an
earlier Neurontin suit he was trained to market the drug to
doctors for uses beyond those approved by regulators. Dr. David
Franklin, who won a $25 million whistleblower suit against the
drugmaker over the medicine, said he was given a &#8220;snake-oil
list&#8221; of unapproved uses to help pump up Neurontin&#8217;s sales.
Franklin had been set to testify in Smith&#8217;s case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, who worked part-time as a service manager at a
Nashville office-machines store, began taking Neurontin in March
2004 to deal with chronic pain tied to back and neck surgeries,
according to court filings. Lawyers for his family say in the
filings that Warner-Lambert officials didn&#8217;t properly warn
Smith&#8217;s doctors the drug had been found to cause depression and
suicidal thoughts in some users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Forgive Me&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Smith killed himself with a gunshot to the head,
according to the filings. In a note he left to his family, Smith
indicated he was tired of being in pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Forgive me; I cannot go on like this, I cannot have my
body, the temple of the Holy Spirit, cut on anymore,&#8221; Smith
said in the note. &#8220;I have talked to God all night and he
understands.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Smith&#8217;s family said he&#8217;d told relatives prior
to his suicide that the Neurontin &#8220;was making him feel not
himself,&#8221; according to court filings. &#8220;Mr. Smith&#8217;s death was
inexplicable to family members because Mr. Smith was a godly man
and he knew suicide was wrong,&#8221; they added in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s lawyers countered in their filings Smith suffered
through &#8220;numerous surgeries&#8221; which left him dealing with
&#8220;increasing pain.&#8221; The retired minister told his family he
&#8220;wished he could die because of the pain and the depression,&#8221;
the filing added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ruby Smith v. Pfizer Inc., 05-cv-11515-PBS,
U.S. District Court, Middle District of Tennessee (Nashville). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Global
Economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said it is &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; to suggest that
the euro area will break up within the next year and predicted
the currency&#8217;s decline may be almost over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The simple misconception is people trying to equate pure
economic logic with social political reality,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in
an interview from his office in London today. &#8220;The Germans and
French are passionately committed to it whether the rest of us
think it&#8217;s crazy or not.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro dropped today to its lowest level in more than
four years against the dollar, partly on concern that the $1
trillion aid package ministers agreed last week won&#8217;t reduce
economic imbalances within the 16-nation region. Christopher
Wood, chief equity strategist at CLSA Asia Pacific Markets,
today predicted the currency will drop to parity with the U.S.
dollar &#8220;sooner or later.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is 60 years of history in the making, so the idea
that the euro simply falls apart at first test of its
credibility, I think it highly unlikely,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;It
might well be in 20 years time it doesn&#8217;t exist but the idea
that it&#8217;s not going to exist in the next year because the market
is worried about Spain and Portugal&#8217;s funding requirements is
ridiculous.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro&#8217;s national governments need to use the crisis as
an opportunity to overhaul their governance or the risk of a
breakup will grow with time, O&#8217;Neill said. Finance ministers
from the region are gathering today in Brussels to consider ways
to more closely coordinate their policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Virtually Guaranteed&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro fell as much as 1 percent today to $1.2235, the
lowest level since April 18, 2006, before recovering in later
trading. It was little changed at $1.2378 as of 2:33 p.m. in
London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill said the overwhelming consensus is that euro will
weaken further. Of 600 people he addressed recently, only three
predicted the currency would strengthen, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In my experience of being in the foreign exchange market
for 29 years, that makes it virtually guaranteed that the euro
isn&#8217;t going to go down much further,&#8221; he said. O&#8217;Neill predicts
the euro may fall as low as $1.20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &#8220;lots of weaknesses of EMU and this crisis is
demonstrating what they are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At the core of it, the
inability to have a central fiscal authority is a major problem
and that they are going to have to deal with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British pound may extend this
year&#8217;s 12 percent drop against the Canadian dollar and
depreciate to C$1.35, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank maintains its &#8220;bearish view for pound/Canadian
dollar&#8221; after the found failed to breach the C$1.60 level last
week, Niall O&#8217;Connor, a technical analyst at JPMorgan in New
York, wrote in an e-mailed note received today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound, which is currently trading at about C$1.49, may
test its 1984 low of C$1.4580 before declining to &#8220;the 1.35
zone,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor wrote. That followed this week&#8217;s decline
through the C$1.50 support level, where buying orders may be
concentrated, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is also known, has
gained against 15 of 16 of its most active counterparts this
year on speculation the nation&#8217;s budget deficit will narrow
while the Bank of Canada becomes the first Group of Seven
central bank to raise interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield advantage of two-year Canadian bonds over U.K.
debt of the same maturity widened to 89 basis points from 79
basis points a week ago, according to Bloomberg generic prices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., operator of the
Altona oil refinery in Australia&#8217;s Victoria state, said power at
the plant is restored after an outage yesterday shut a &#8220;number
of units.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The units were &#8220;getting back to normal&#8221; by midmorning
today, Alan Bailey, a Melbourne-based spokesman for the Irving,
Texas-based company, said by telephone. The outage occurred
shortly before 9 p.m. local time yesterday, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altona, the smallest of Australia&#8217;s seven refineries, is 13
kilometers (8 miles) west of Melbourne and supplies half of
Victoria&#8217;s fuel needs, according to Exxon&#8217;s website. The plant
makes about 13 million liters (3.4 million gallons) of products
a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It took some time for the power to be restored and then
it took us a little while to get the plant up and running
again,&#8221; Bailey said. &#8220;It does have a short-term impact, but
we&#8217;re not anticipating any measurable supply impacts out in the
market place as a result of this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VeriSign Inc. Chief Financial Officer
Brian Robins canceled a presentation at a JPMorgan Chase  Co.
conference today because of a scheduling conflict, according to
company spokesman Brad Williams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VeriSign shares rose 5.2 percent to $28.23 at 4 p.m. in New
York. A record 63,401 call options changed hands, 54 times the
four-week average. September $28 calls were the most-active
contracts, followed by June $29 calls. The stock hasn&#8217;t closed
above $29 since September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pullout fueled speculation that VeriSign, the biggest
operator of computers that direct Internet traffic, may be
involved in merger or acquisition talks, said Jamie Lissette,
founder of the Hammerstone Group, a Westport, Connecticut-based
operator of online discussion forums for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whenever someone cancels a conference, people suddenly
jump on the idea that it&#8217;s a takeout candidate,&#8221; Lissette said.
&#8220;Tech companies especially get put in the crosshairs as a
target for the larger companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VeriSign may be close to selling its security business to
Symantec Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest maker of security software,
CNBC reported earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams wouldn&#8217;t elaborate on what prevented Robins from
appearing at the Global Technology, Media  Telecom Conference
in Boston. VeriSign is based in Mountain View, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VeriSign has been selling businesses that don&#8217;t fit with its
Internet operations. In its main divisions, VeriSign manages the
Internet&#8217;s dot-com and dot-net addresses and sells online
certificates confirming that surfers landed on legitimate
websites. Its iDefense unit also helps large companies protect
themselves from cyber attacks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, is upgrading Hotmail to make it easier to manage
the flow of photos, videos and social-networking updates to a
user&#8217;s inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version, scheduled to be released in July or
August, is designed to allow easier document sharing and provide
a quick view of photos and videos at the top of e-mails. The
upgrade also helps users easily send photos, videos and other
media, along with Web links, to their contacts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which sells ads next to Hotmail inboxes, is
updating the service to attract users from rivals such as Yahoo!
Inc. and Google Inc. While Hotmail is the leading e-mail service
worldwide, it&#8217;s No. 2 in the U.S. behind Yahoo Mail, according
to ComScore Inc. in Reston, Virginia. Google&#8217;s Gmail, the
fastest-growing of the leaders, was third. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This update, I think, is the most significant one we&#8217;ve
ever done,&#8221; said Chris Jones, a corporate vice president at
Microsoft. &#8220;We are already second. We hope this is a product
that can take us to first.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 21 cents to
$28.60 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
The shares have fallen 6.2 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Hotmail upgrade, users can quickly see whether
they have e-mails from friends and social networks, along with
messages about package shipments or appointments, without
sorting through the inbox. Another feature, called &#8220;sweep,&#8221;
lets users clean out or move a block of similar e-mails with a
few clicks of the mouse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. will close eight
manufacturing plants and scale back operations at six other
sites worldwide, eliminating 6,000 jobs as part of a previously
announced plan to trim its workforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker plans to shut manufacturing operations over
the next five years at plants in Puerto Rico, Ireland, and
Rouses Point, New York. Operations at plants in Germany,
Ireland, Puerto Rico, the U.K. and U.S. will be cut back, the
New York-based company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts are part of the more than 19,000 jobs Pfizer said
it would eliminate after its $68 billion acquisition last year
of Wyeth. Pfizer said it has spent the past six months reviewing
how to reduce the combined company&#8217;s manufacturing operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is slashing costs as it braces to lose patent
protection next year on the company&#8217;s top-selling Lipitor
cholesterol pill, which generated about a quarter of Pfizer&#8217;s
sales last year. The drugmaker has eliminated 48,000 positions,
or 38 percent of its total workforce, over the past six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell 30 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $15.81 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, its lowest price
since Aug. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plants that will be closed include those in Caguas,
Puerto Rico; Carolina, Puerto Rico; Dublin; Loughbeg, Ireland;
Shanbally, Ireland; Rouses Point, New York; Richmond, Virginia;
and Pearl River, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth said in 2005 that it would sell the Rouses Point,
site. Research operations in Pearl River and Richmond won&#8217;t be
affected by the manufacturing cuts, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operations will be downsized in Guayama, Puerto Rico;
Newbridge, Ireland; Andover, Massachusetts; Sanford, North
Carolina; Havant, U.K.; and Illertissen, Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The restructuring of our global plant network is critical
to our efforts to remain competitive so that we can continue to
meet patient needs and expand the access and affordability of
our medicines,&#8221; said Pfizer&#8217;s head of manufacturing Nat Ricciardi in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest oil company, said its plan to drill a deep-water oil
well in the Gulf of Mexico called Hadrian has been delayed by a
U.S. moratorium on offshore drilling permits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon moved a rig to a site in 6,941 feet (2,116 meters) of
water in anticipation of drilling the well before the moratorium
was imposed earlier this month, halting any additional work on
the project, said Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for the Irving,
Texas-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Interior Department report issued today that
included Hadrian in a list of deep-water projects that began in
the week ended May 17 may have been referring to Exxon&#8217;s
preparatory work, Jeffers said. The moratorium on new permits
was declared after an April 20 explosion and fire aboard a
Transocean Ltd. rig that killed 11 workers and triggered subsea
oil leaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caryl Fagot, a spokeswoman for the department&#8217;s Minerals
Management Service, which produced today&#8217;s report, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a telephone message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency&#8217;s weekly deep-water activity report also showed
Newfield Exploration Co. and ATP Oil  Gas Corp. began drilling
deep-water oil wells in the Gulf in the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyranees Drilling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Schmidt, a spokesman for Newfield, confirmed drilling
has begun on a well at the company&#8217;s Pyranees project in 2,095
feet of water. Isabel Plume, an ATP spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment on
the deep-water report. Both companies are based in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon dropped 48 cents to $62.79 as of 4:01 p.m. in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Newfield fell
$1.07, or 2 percent, to $51.44. ATP declined 42 cents to $14.71
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are at least 37 deep-water drilling projects
operating in the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico, the report
showed. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil&#8217;s state-controlled
explorer, is overseeing the deepest, Chinook, in 8,850 feet of
water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc, the London-based company that was leasing the rig
that exploded, burned and sank last month, is drilling a relief
well to halt leaks in the one damaged in the disaster that
claimed 11 lives. It&#8217;s BP&#8217;s only active deep-water project,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. shareholders
rejected a proposal to split the roles of chairman and chief
executive officer currently held by Jamie Dimon, who gave
investors an upbeat outlook on the U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution to separate the positions failed to pass
with about 34 percent of the vote, according to a preliminary
tally given to investors at today&#8217;s annual meeting in New York.
All members of the board standing for election received at least
89 percent of the vote, said General Counsel Stephen Cutler.
More than a dozen homeowners with Chase mortgages and consumer
advocates, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson appealed to Dimon to
do more for borrowers seeking loan modifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 54, who has led the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets and its board for more than four years, told shareholders
&#8220;there&#8217;s a chance down the road&#8221; that the lender would
reinstate a stock-buyback program. When asked whether the firm
would consider repurchasing shares, he said &#8220;not quite yet.&#8221;
He said he hoped to reinstate the quarterly dividend, which was
cut to 5 cents in 2009, at 30 percent to 40 percent of earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The economy is growing as we speak,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We think
it&#8217;s better to wait when things are stable so we can pay a
dividend you can count on.&#8221; It was the company&#8217;s first public
meeting since posting a 55 percent increase in net income for
the first quarter to $3.33 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Votes on Proposals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders also approved a resolution for an advisory
vote on executive compensation by more than 95 percent. They
backed by 54 percent a measure allowing investors to take
actions outside of the public-meeting process if they have the
written consent of a majority of shares outstanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proposal allowing anyone with at least 10 percent of
outstanding common stock to call shareholder meetings lost while
attracting 44 percent of the vote. Another proposal seeking more
detailed derivatives disclosures and stricter collateral
requirements won about 34 percent of the vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We already do substantially some of the things you&#8217;re
talking about, not all of them, but some of them,&#8221; Dimon told
Sister Barbara Aires, who spoke on behalf of the groups of nuns
and priests who submitted the derivatives proposal. Aires said
in an interview that the same proposal received similar support
from shareholders at Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two dozen borrowers came to the meeting and appealed
for help on their home loans. Dimon referred them to mortgage
specialists sitting outside to answer questions about specific
foreclosure cases and pending modifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a government program, so it&#8217;s not always up to
JPMorgan&#8221; in deciding who qualifies and who doesn&#8217;t for the
Home Affordable Modification Program, Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc., fighting a
fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators who accuse the company of
misleading investors, is trying to persuade more Americans to
trust the firm with their retirement funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company is promoting alternative asset
funds and designing target-date funds that provide guaranteed
income to grab a bigger piece of the $2.7 trillion 401(k)
market, said Bill McDermott, a managing director at Goldman
Sachs Asset Management and head of its defined-contribution
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We understand risk and we understand asset allocation,&#8221;
said McDermott, who joined the firm in February to strengthen
its retirement-plan products and marketing. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking to
leverage that for the 401(k) market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s 401(k) plan assets totaled $17.5 billion as of
March 31, according to the company. Fidelity Investments, the
largest 401(k) asset manager, had $347.8 billion as of December
31. Assets in 401(k) plans are estimated to increase 41 percent,
to $3.8 trillion, by the end of 2014, according to data from
Cerulli Associates in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman and BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s largest asset
manager, don&#8217;t administer retirement plans and have been seeking
more 401(k) business. The business has been dominated by firms
such as Boston-based Fidelity and Vanguard Group, based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, which administer plans as well as
manage assets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, agreed to pay VirnetX Holding Corp. $200 million
and license technology to communicate privately over the
Internet, ending a patent dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that this successful resolution of our
litigation with Microsoft will allow us to focus on the upcoming
pilot system&#8221; for a virtual private network, Chief Executive
Officer Kendall Larsen said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VirnetX, which won a $105.8 million jury verdict in its
patent-infringement lawsuit in March, was seeking a court order
to block Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft from continuing to
use the technology in its Windows operating system and
Communications Server. The jury award also could have been
tripled by the court&#8217;s judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft argued at trial that the patents were valued at
no more than $15 million. Investors bet the patents were worth
more, driving Scotts Valley, California-based VirnetX&#8217;s share
price up almost 300 percent in the past 12 months. VirnetX had a
market value of $267.9 million, based on the May 14 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VirnetX had been public in its desire to be bought to
resolve the dispute. The agreement in which it obtained the
patents from defense contractor SAIC Inc. included a provision
that SAIC would get 10 percent of any proceeds if VirnetX were
acquired by Microsoft, according to a company regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents relate to use of a domain-name service to set
up virtual private networks, through which a website owner can
interact with a customer in a secure way or an employee can work
at home and access a company&#8217;s files. The technology stemmed
from work performed for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to
develop secure communications, VirnetX said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the trial, VirnetX filed another lawsuit
against Microsoft in the same court, arguing that Windows 7 also
infringed the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows 7 case is VirnetX v. Microsoft Corp., 10cv94,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). The
older case is VirnetX Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 07cv80, in the
same court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyundai Motor Wins Reversal of $34 Million Patent Verdict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyundai Motor Co. won its appeal of a $34 million verdict
that said South Korea&#8217;s largest automaker infringed a Texas
company&#8217;s patent for computerizing the sale of car parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit yesterday
said Orion IP LLC&#8217;s patent was invalid and vacated the verdict.
The opinion was posted on the court&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is insufficient evidence to support the jury&#8217;s
verdict&#8221; in Orion&#8217;s favor on the question of validity, the
three-judge court panel ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orion, a patent-licensing firm based in Longview, Texas,
had sued 20 automakers, claiming infringement of a patent for a
way to help a salesperson select auto parts without relying on
catalogs or order forms. The other auto companies settled before
the 2007 trial in Tyler, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyundai argued that companies other than Orion had come up
with the idea of electronic parts catalogs in 1987, and the
patented computer-assisted system a year later wasn&#8217;t different
enough to be considered a new invention. The Federal Circuit
agreed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the verdict, U.S. District Judge Leonard Davis
ordered Seoul-based Hyundai to pay a 2 percent royalty on parts
revenue generated through its website or dealer communication
system after June 19, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Orion IP LLC V. Hyundai Motor America, 2009-
1130, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The lower court case is Orion IP LLC v. Mercedes-
Benz USA LLC, 05cv322, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Texas (Tyler). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi-Aventis Wins Patent Case Against Mylan in Delaware Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan Pharmaceutical Inc. extended-release bladder tablets
will infringe on asserted claims of a patent held by Sanofi-
Aventis known as the 491 patent, according to May 14 decision by
a federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The May 14 decision concerned Mylan&#8217;s proposed 10 mg
extended release alfuzosin hydrochloride tablets. The drug is an
alpha1-blocker that relaxes the smooth muscle in the lower
urinary tract, including bladder neck and prostate, to treat
illnesses of the prostate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 491 patent was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
office April 28, 1987, to Synthelabo, a predecessor of Sanofi-
Aventis, the court wrote in the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan filed its application in 2007. The court found that
Sanofi-Aventis showed by weight of the evidence that Mylan
&#8220;literally infringes&#8221; the asserted claims of the 491 patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Alfuzosin Hydrochloride Patent
Litigation, 08-md-1941, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrysler Seeks to Block Imports of China&#8217;s Jeepzter Knockoff &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrysler Group, the U.S. automaker run by Fiat Spa, filed a
trade complaint to block U.S. imports of the Jeepzter, a car it
calls a knockoff of its Jeep off-road vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrysler filed a complaint May 14 with the U.S.
International Trade Commission in Washington against Xingyue
Group Co., claiming the Chinese company is making a vehicle that
copies a patented design for the Jeep Hurricane. The Hurricane,
shown as a concept car by Chrysler at the 2005 North American
International Auto Show in Detroit, was never mass produced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jeepzter &#8220;is the same or substantially the same to the
eye of the ordinary observer as the ornamental design&#8221; covered
by the patent, Chrysler said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrysler, whose U.S. sales plummeted 36 percent last year,
is refreshing models including the Jeep Grand Cherokee as part
of a turnaround of its Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrysler also filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit in
federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 11 against
three companies selling Jeepzters in the U.S. That case claims
the companies are selling vehicles that copy the grille design
of the Jeep Wrangler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noel Farbman, president of USA Wholesale Scooters in
Florida, said he took ads for the Jeepzter off his website as
soon as he heard of the lawsuit. He said he sold three of the
vehicles before learning of Chrysler&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wade Liu, manager of Excalibur Motor Sports in Chino,
California, one of the companies named in the ITC complaint,
said he hadn&#8217;t yet received any of the Jeepzters and planned to
pull ads off his company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also named in the ITC case were three other businesses in
Tennessee, Texas and North Carolina that advertised the
vehicles, as well as importers connected to Xingyue. Efforts to
reach Xingyue&#8217;s U.S. offices in California were unsuccessful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Automotive
Vehicles and Designs Thereof, 2734. The civil suit is Chrysler
Group LLC v. USA Wholesale Scooters Inc., 10cv60774, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright
Coach Reaches Settlement in Suit on Alleged Design Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach Inc. said it settled a copyright infringement suit
filed against Target Corp. in October. The suit, which also
originally named Rosetti Handbags and Accessories Ltd. as a
defendant, was filed in federal court in New York. Terms of the
settlement are confidential, according to a statement released
by New York-based Coach yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable Companies Lose at High Court on Must-Carry Rule &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court, refusing to reconsider a
longstanding cable industry complaint, left intact a federal
requirement that providers include local broadcast stations in
their channel lineups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high court yesterday rejected an appeal from New York-
area cable provider Cablevision Systems Corp., which objected on
free-speech grounds to a requirement that it make a local
station available to customers on Long Island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal sought to overturn 1994 and 1997 Supreme Court
decisions that upheld the must-carry rule, which Congress
enacted in 1992 to protect the broadcasting industry from the
growing power of cable TV networks. Cablevision, backed by Time
Warner Cable Inc. and an industry trade group, said the
rationale behind the must-carry rule no longer exists, in part
because satellite services have captured more of the TV market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is pitting the cable industry and some program
providers against broadcasters and the Obama administration,
which is defending the must-carry requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In urging the high court not to hear the case, U.S.
Solicitor General Elena Kagan argued that cable systems now have
far greater channel capacity than they did in the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cablevision Systems v. FCC, 09-901, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former McKinsey  Co. director Anil
Kumar has agreed to pay almost $2.8 million to settle civil
allegations of insider trading brought by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumar&#8217;s settlement with the SEC comes four months after he
pleaded guilty in the largest ever hedge fund insider trading
case. He&#8217;s cooperating with prosecutors in the criminal case
against Galleon Group LLC founder Raj Rajaratnam, who has denied
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement covers $2.6 million in illegal profits for
Kumar and interest of about $190,000, according to a filing
yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. Kumar also agreed as
part of the settlement not to &#8220;engage in any act, practice or
course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or
deceit upon any person.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Morvillo, a lawyer for Kumar, declined to comment.
John Heine, a spokesman for the SEC, didn&#8217;t have an immediate
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its civil lawsuit against Kumar, the SEC said Kumar was
a friend of Rajaratnam&#8217;s and a direct or indirect investor in at
least one Galleon fund. In court in January, Kumar said
Rajaratnam approached him in late 2003 or early 2004 and offered
to pay him $500,000 annually in exchange for tips about McKinsey
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Galleon, 09-cv-8811, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merkin Investor Awarded $1.8 Million in Madoff Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investor in J. Ezra Merkin&#8217;s Ascot Partners L.P., a
feeder fund for Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff, was awarded $1.75
million by arbitrators who found Merkin intentionally breached
his fiduciary duty by not disclosing Madoff&#8217;s role in the fund,
according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merkin also was negligent in performing due diligence on
Madoff, a majority of an arbitration panel found, according to a
petition filed yesterday in New York state court. Investor Noel
Wiederhorn, who put $1.46 million into Ascot Partners in 2003
and 2004, is seeking a judgment confirming the award, which was
for the amount he invested plus interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiederhorn, a Wycoff, New Jersey, pediatrician, also asked
that the sealed record of the arbitration case be made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These findings could have significance in later
litigation and arbitrations against Mr. Merkin as well as
against numerous other Madoff feeder-fund managers,&#8221;
Weiderhorn&#8217;s attorney, David Bamberger, wrote in asking for the
record to be unsealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence showed &#8220;major contradictions and
ambiguities&#8221; in transaction confirmations, which should have
caused Merkin to question the Madoff trades, according to his
filing. The evidence in the hearing also established the
&#8220;extreme improbability&#8221; of the transactions Madoff reported in
the over-the-counter options market, the papers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merkin has been pursued by investors, government officials
and regulators since Madoff&#8217;s $65 billion fraud was exposed in
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 71, pleaded guilty in March 2009 and is serving a
150-year sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new case is Wiederhorn v. Merkin, 601265/2010, New York
State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Citigroup Are Winners in Barring Short-Selling Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court refused to revive a price-fixing
suit that accused a dozen Wall Street firms, including Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc., of conspiring to inflate
brokerage fees to short sellers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday left intact a decision by a federal
appeals court in New York throwing out the suit. The lower court
concluded that the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s
oversight of short selling puts that business outside the ambit
of the federal antitrust laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic Trading Group LLC claimed in the 2006 lawsuit,
which sought class-action status, that the banks conspired to
charge inflated borrowing fees through daily conversations, e-
mails and faxes. The suit alleged that the firms jointly
determined which securities they should classify as &#8220;hard-to-
borrow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit also named units of Bank of America Corp.,
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley and UBS
AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Electronic Trading Group v. Banc of America
Securities, 09-1059, U.S. Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infineon, Elpida Said to Be in EU Cartel Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infineon Technologies AG, Europe&#8217;s second-largest
chipmaker, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and other chipmakers agreed
to pay fines as part of the first settlement of a price-fixing
case brought by the European Union, four people with knowledge
of the investigation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement with the European Commission may be
disclosed as soon as May 19, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the negotiations are private. As many as
seven other chipmakers, including Elpida Memory Inc., will also
participate, the people said. Micron Technology Inc. received
immunity in the case, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement is the first time the Brussels-based
commission has reached an agreement with companies involved in a
price-fixing probe. All companies that agree to the settlement
terms as proposed by the commission receive a 10 percent
reduction in their fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for EU antitrust matters, said
she can&#8217;t comment on cases where the Brussels-based commission
hasn&#8217;t yet reached a decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay Laudien, a spokesman for Neubiberg, Germany-based
Infineon, couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for a comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai Pei-lin, a spokesman for Taoyuan, Taiwan-based Nanya
Technology, declined to comment on whether the company had
agreed to pay a fine. Representatives at Samsung, Hynix,
Mitsubishi, Elpida, Toshiba, Hitachi, and NEC also declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novartis Must Pay Punitive Damages in Sex-Bias Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Novartis AG pharmaceuticals unit discriminated against
female sales representatives in the U.S. and must pay $3.4
million to a dozen women plus punitive damages to be decided, a
federal jury found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury in Manhattan federal court reached its decision
yesterday after a month long trial of a class-action lawsuit on
claims of discrimination against women at Novartis
Pharmaceuticals, a U.S. unit of Europe&#8217;s second-largest
drugmaker. The nine jurors&#8217; award to the women for lost pay and
other damages came in the first stage of deliberations. The
panel will decide tomorrow on the amount of punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women are part of the Basel, Switzerland-based
company&#8217;s 14,000-member workforce in the U.S. They&#8217;ve said
they&#8217;re seeking about $200 million in punitive damages. Jurors
found that Novartis discriminated against women over pay and
promotion and because they got pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Novartis has been involved in systemic discrimination
since 2002,&#8221; David Sanford, a lawyer for the women, said in an
interview after the verdict. &#8220;The verdict supports the claims
of 5,600 women.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novartis said in a statement that it is disappointed in the
verdict and plans to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the plaintiffs&#8217; claims were unfounded,&#8221; the
company said, adding that it has been &#8220;recognized for its
commitment to an inclusive environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Velez v. Novartis Corp., 04-cv-9194, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Settles Neurontin Suit Over Minister&#8217;s Death &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. agreed to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit
alleging its Neurontin epilepsy medicine caused a retired
minister to commit suicide two months after he started taking
the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, told U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger in Nashville,
Tennessee, they resolved claims by the family of Richard Smith,
which were set to go to trial yesterday. It&#8217;s the second
settlement of claims that officials of a Pfizer unit knew the
epilepsy drug posed a suicide risk and failed to disclose it to
patients and doctors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. Smith, 79, was a retired
Church of Christ minister, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer faces more than 1,000 lawsuits accusing it of
illegally promoting Neurontin for unapproved uses and helping to
cause some users&#8217; suicides. In March, a Boston jury ordered
Pfizer to pay more than $140 million in damages to an insurer
over its marketing practices in connection with the drug. Pfizer
has denied any wrongdoing in connection with its handling of
Neurontin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to have reached an agreement with the
Smith family to resolve this case as it avoids the time and
expense of a trial,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ruby Smith v. Pfizer Inc., 05-cv-11515-PBS,
U.S. District Court, Middle District of Tennessee (Nashville). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cable Companies Rejected by U.S. High Court on Must-Carry Rule &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court, refusing to reconsider a
longstanding cable industry complaint, left intact a federal

their channel lineups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high court yesterday rejected an appeal from New York-

rationale behind the must-carry rule no longer exists, in part
because satellite services have captured more of the TV market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cable industry has experienced transformative market
and technological changes, including the emergence of vibrant
competition,&#8221; Cablevision argued in its appeal. &#8220;Cable
companies simply no longer have the bottleneck control that was
crucial to the court&#8217;s rationale&#8221; in the earlier cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cablevision Systems v. FCC, 09-901, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;Seamstress in SEC Insider Case Wins Judge&#8217;s Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A retired Croatian seamstress won a ruling from a federal
judge in New York reversing a $5.7 million judgment against her
in a 2005 insider trading lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Sonja Anticevic, 63, convinced U.S. District
Judge Kimba Wood in New York to vacate the judgment. Anticevic
is the aunt of David Pajcin, one of the ringleaders of a wide-
ranging insider-trading plot that operated from mid-2004 to mid-
2005. Pajcin, of Clifton, New Jersey, went to prison as one of a
half-dozen defendants who pleaded guilty in a criminal case. In
a related civil lawsuit, the SEC claimed Anticevic gave Pajcin
permission to execute illegal trades through her account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood said in a May 14 ruling that she received a letter
from Anticevic&#8217;s Croatian lawyer on March 30 explaining why the
retired seamstress had failed to respond to the lawsuit after
the judge ordered her to do so last year. That failure prompted
Wood to enter a default judgment against Anticevic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anticevic made a good faith effort to respond to the
court&#8217;s July 2009 order,&#8221; Wood wrote, explaining that
Anticevic&#8217;s 2009 response was returned to her because it was
improperly addressed. &#8220;Further, the court notes that Anticevic
is a foreigner and likely not familiar with the U.S. legal
system and court procedures.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Minerals Service Sued Over Whistleblower Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Minerals Management Service failed to act on a
whistleblower&#8217;s warnings that a BP Plc oil and gas platform in
the Gulf of Mexico lacked safety and engineering documentation,
an environmental watchdog said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food  Water Watch filed a suit yesterday asking a U.S.
judge to force MMS, which oversees mineral production on federal
lands and the Outer Continental Shelf, to shut down London-based
BP&#8217;s Atlantis platform until the company can prove the system,
one of the Gulf&#8217;s largest, was built according to engineer-
certified designs and is operating safely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlantis, which can produce 200,000 barrels of oil and
180 million cubic feet of gas daily, is located about 100 miles
south of the runaway well damaged by last month&#8217;s sinking of the
Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, which was leased by BP. The
blowout well has already spilled more than 4 million gallons of
crude into the nation&#8217;s second-largest fishery since the sinking
occurred April 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is inconceivable that BP could justify the risk of
commissioning Atlantis production without completed design
documentation,&#8221; Mike Sawyer, an independent safety engineer
with Apex Safety Consultants of Houston, said in an affidavit
provided to MMS last year. Sawyer was hired to analyze evidence
former BP contractor Kenneth Abbott provided to the
environmental group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP believes the accusations in the MMS lawsuit are
unsubstantiated, spokesman Scott Dean said. &#8220;We are aware that
the MMS is conducting an investigation in connection with past
allegations made about our Atlantis platform,&#8221; he said in an e-
mail yesterday. &#8220;We will continue to cooperate fully with their
requests for information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDC said May 4 it would be bought for $33.86 per share.
Investor Brad Marques sued in Delaware Chancery Court seeking

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite its promise and poise for growth, the company

&lt;p&gt;Brian Willinsky, a spokesman for Bedford, Massachusetts-

&lt;p&gt;Japan Air Fixed Cargo-Fuel Surcharge, Australian Regulator Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan Airlines Corp. illegally fixed fuel and security
surcharges between 2002 and 2006, the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission alleged in a lawsuit filed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission started proceedings in Australia&#8217;s Federal
Court against the carrier, which is restructuring under
bankruptcy protection. The civil suit, which alleges Japan Air
conspired with competing freight carriers, seeks penalties and
costs, according to a statement received by e-mail from the
commission yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo-based Japan Air has received the complaint and
declined to comment until it has reviewed it, spokeswoman Sze
Hunn Yap said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator has already filed suit against Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd., Korean Air Lines Co., Air New Zealand Ltd., and
five other airlines, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece Considering Legal Action Against U.S. Banks for Crisis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece is considering taking legal action against U.S.
investment banks that might have contributed to the country&#8217;s
debt crisis, Prime Minister George Papandreou said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t rule out that this may be a recourse,&#8221;
Papandreou said, in response to questions about the role of U.S.
banks in the crisis, in an interview on CNN&#8217;s &#8220;Fareed Zakaria
GPS.&#8221; The program, broadcast yesterday, was taped on May 13.
Neither Papandreou nor Zakaria mentioned any banks by name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papandreou said the decision on whether to go after U.S.
banks will be made after a Greek parliamentary investigation
into the cause of the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days leading up to the May 10 announcement of a loan
package worth almost $1 trillion to halt the spread of Greece&#8217;s
fiscal woes, European Union regulators were examining whether
speculators manipulated the prices of bonds and equities and
contributed to the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Committee of European Securities Regulators said on May
7 it was investigating &#8220;exceptional volatility&#8221; in the markets
and would work with other regulators, including the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, as part of a coordinated
clampdown. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NML Asks Bank of America If Kirchner Holds Assets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NML Capital Ltd., which is suing Argentina for repayment of
its defaulted bonds, asked Bank of America Corp. whether
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and 130 individual
public officials are holding assets there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of NML&#8217;s March 10 subpoena was included in a court
filing by Argentina yesterday in Manhattan federal court.
Argentina is asking U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in New
York to quash, or suppress, the subpoena as irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NML has a $300 million judgment against Argentina stemming
from a 2001 bond default and wants to collect on the judgment.
In a May 4 letter to the lawyer for NML, Argentina&#8217;s attorney,
Carmine Boccuzzi, said the request to Bank of America for
information about assets held there by Kirchner and other
Argentine officials had no bearing to the case. Creditors may
only pursue state assets, not those of government officials, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Among the reasons the NML subpoena is improper is that it
requests information concerning third parties separate from the
Republic, including dozens of Republic officials, independent
corporate entities, and government agencies and
instrumentalities that have already been held by the court to be
separate from the Republic,&#8221; Boccuzzi wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a May 12 response, NML&#8217;s lawyer said the firm is
entitled to seek Argentina&#8217;s assets &#8220;anywhere&#8221; they&#8217;re held. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qatari Diar Abandoned Chelsea Deal, CPC Says at Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Co., a unit of the
emirate&#8217;s sovereign-wealth fund, should pay as much as 81
million pounds ($117 million) for abandoning a deal to build
luxury apartments at London&#8217;s Chelsea Barracks, U.K. developer
CPC Group Ltd. said at a trial yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatari had no reason to back out of the project and is now
refusing to pay so-called deferred compensation it owes after
buying CPC&#8217;s share of the development, lawyer Anthony Stephen
Grabiner said in opening arguments at a London trial over the
contract dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatari&#8217;s employees made personal allegations against real-
estate entrepreneur Christian Candy, who controls CPC, in a
&#8220;desperate throw of the dice to divert attention from its own
actions,&#8221; Grabiner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A joint venture of CPC and Qatari Diar paid 959 million
pounds for Chelsea Barracks in January 2008. In November of that
year, Qatari Diar bought out CPC&#8217;s stake for an initial payment
of about 38 million pounds and agreed to pay 81 million pounds
later in deferred compensation, CPC said. Candy was retained for
project management, design and marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Prince Charles subsequently criticized the development
as unsuitable for the area, Qatari Diar withdrew its planning
application. CPC sued in November for breach of contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Smouha, Qatari&#8217;s lawyer from Essex Court Chambers, said
the deferred compensation being demanded by CPC was &#8220;uncertain
in both amount and timing.&#8221; Qatari argues that it shouldn&#8217;t
have to pay the deferred compensation because no value has been
created on the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPC said the deferred payment is intended to cover what has
already been sold to Qatari, rather than a projected value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whether or not QD believed it had made a bad bargain, it
was and is still required to comply with its terms,&#8221; CPC said
in court papers. Qatari &#8220;wants full control of the project, and
wants to shuffle off the corresponding obligation to pay for
it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial before Judge Peter Smith is scheduled to last
from five to 10 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CPC Group Ltd. v. Qatari Diar Real Estate
Investment Company, case no. 4260/09, High Court of Justice,
Chancery Division (London). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SunTrust Judge Says Auction Buyers Don&#8217;t Owe Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SunTrust Banks Inc. customers who lost their lawsuit
against the company for selling them auction-rate securities
don&#8217;t have to pay the bank&#8217;s legal fees for bringing the suit, a
federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Thomas W. Thrash Jr. in Atlanta nixed
SunTrust&#8217;s argument that the investors should have to pay the
bank&#8217;s legal fees because they sued the wrong subsidiary and
because they said they held auction-rate securities after they
had redeemed them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their auction-rate securities became illiquid and were
worth less because of it,&#8221; Thrash wrote in a May 14 order
docketed yesterday. &#8220;Even if they could eventually sell at par,
they suffered harm because of the long period of illiquidity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, Thrash threw out the investors&#8217; suit, saying
the allegations weren&#8217;t &#8220;stated with particularity&#8221; and didn&#8217;t
give rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent, as
required by U.S. securities law. At least 19 underwriters and
broker-dealers have been sued in class-action, or group, suits
since the $330 billion market for auction-rate securities
collapsed in February 2008. None of the suits has survived a
motion to dismiss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auction-rate securities are municipal bonds, corporate
bonds and preferred stocks whose rates of return are
periodically reset through auctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugh Suhr, a spokesman for Atlanta-based SunTrust, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said the plaintiffs should be punished for making
allegations that weren&#8217;t supported by the evidence. It said that
they weren&#8217;t harmed by owning the securities because they had
redeemed them at par. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Zisholtz v. SunTrust Banks Inc., 08-cv-1287,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portugal Telecom SGPS SA&#8217;s stake in
Brazil&#8217;s largest mobile-phone company is &#8220;strategic&#8221; and its
sale shouldn&#8217;t even be considered, said Paulo Varela of Grupo
Visabeira SGPS SA, which owns one of the biggest stakes in the
Portuguese phone company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefonica SA (TEF) made an unsolicited 5.7 billion-euro ($7
billion) offer last week to buy out Portugal Telecom&#8217;s stake in
the venture that controls Vivo Participacoes SA. The bid values
the Vivo shares at more than twice their average price in the
month to May 6, Telefonica said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although it&#8217;s a very flattering proposal, we have to
reiterate Portugal Telecom&#8217;s strategy and that Brazil is a
fundamental part of it,&#8221; the Visabeira vice chairman said in a
May 12 interview. Visabeira has a 2 percent stake in Portugal
Telecom and Varela is a member of the company&#8217;s board. &#8220;To
withdraw such a significant part of the company would be to
amputate its growth potential,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portugal Telecom has counted on Brazil to spur revenue as
growth slows and competition increases at home. Its Brazilian
sales rose 4.1 percent to 3.23 billion euros last year, while
revenue from Portugal declined 1.9 percent. Vivo had 30 percent
of Brazil&#8217;s 179 million wireless subscriptions at the end of
March, according to the country&#8217;s phone regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Visabeira, a maker of telecommunications and
electrical equipment, based in Viseu, northern Portugal, has
been a supplier to Portugal Telecom and its predecessor
companies for about 30 years, Varela said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Board &#8216;Deserves Trust&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portugal Telecom, whose board rejected the Vivo offer,
hasn&#8217;t called a shareholders&#8217; meeting to vote on it, a move that
Telefonica&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer Santiago Fernandez Valbuena
called &#8220;perplexing&#8221; on a May 13 conference call for analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board has in a consistent and consolidated way
delivered results to shareholders,&#8221; Visabeira&#8217;s Varela said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s normal that it deserves the trust to act in the best
interests of Portugal Telecom and all its stakeholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visabeira is &#8220;comfortable&#8221; with its stake in Portugal
Telecom, which &#8220;reflects the commitment to the company and the
desire to participate in its growth process,&#8221; Varela said. He
doesn&#8217;t rule out raising the stake if &#8220;in a certain context
it&#8217;s seen as important to defend our vision for the company.&#8221;
For now, &#8220;we don&#8217;t see that need.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission is challenging the Portuguese
government&#8217;s veto power over key decisions at the company.
Telefonica, Spain&#8217;s biggest phone company, is Portugal Telecom&#8217;s
top investor, with a 10 percent holding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visabeira is also an investor in Zon Multimedia SGPS SA,
which competes with Portugal Telecom in the voice, Internet and
pay-television markets, with a 2.15 percent stake, according to
the Zon website. &#8220;We&#8217;re comfortable with the position we
have,&#8221; Varela said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks to sell
its Australian service stations after a proposed A$300 million
($262 million) deal with Caltex Australia Ltd. was blocked by a
regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not our business model,&#8221; Exxon Mobil Australia
Chairman John Dashwood said in an interview in Brisbane today.
&#8220;I guess the distinction I make is, are you an oil and gas
company or are you a groceries company? The industry has changed
to the point where the two meld, and some have used the shop to
move fuel. We&#8217;re not in the business of being a shop.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal to buy 300 filling stations would have increased
Caltex&#8217; ability to compete for fuel sales with BP Plc and
supermarket chains Woolworths Ltd and Wesfarmers Ltd.&#8217;s Coles.
Exxon Mobil Australia wants to focus on natural-gas projects,
with plans to spend &#8220;many billions of dollars&#8221; in Australia
and Papua New Guinea in three to five years, Dashwood said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. energy company is operator of a $15
billion liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea and is
a partner in the $38 billion Gorgon venture in Australia led by
Chevron Corp. Exxon is also developing the Turrum and Kipper gas
ventures, which it estimates will cost A$3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a substantial amount relative to what we&#8217;ve been
investing here&#8221; over the past five years, Dashwood said,
declining to give a specific figure for the company&#8217;s spending
in Australia. &#8220;It&#8217;s a re-energizing of the organization.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kipper, Turrum &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon aims to decide in 2010 how to develop the Scarborough
gas field 300 kilometers (185 miles) off the coast of Western
Australia, he said. The project is a joint venture with BHP
Billiton Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budgets and schedules for Turrum and Kipper off
southeastern Australia are &#8220;under review,&#8221; partner BHP
Billiton said in April. Santos Ltd., which owns 35 percent of
Kipper, said this month that first gas from the project has been
delayed until the second half of 2011 due to &#8220;design issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the timeline has &#8220;probably shifted a little bit,&#8221;
Exxon has not strayed from its 2011 target, Dashwood said today
on the sidelines of the Australian Petroleum Production and
Exploration Association conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caltex Australia, the nation&#8217;s biggest oil refiner,
scrapped plans to buy Exxon Mobil&#8217;s filling stations after the
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission opposed a
transaction that would have given the company an estimated 22
percent of the country&#8217;s branded fuel market. The regulator said
in December it was concerned the deal would lead to higher
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We jointly decided we wouldn&#8217;t proceed with that deal,&#8221;
Dashwood said. &#8220;In the meantime we&#8217;ve got to operate those
facilities. We&#8217;ll see where commercial discussions take us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He declined to reveal the potential buyers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;England will repeat its 1966 soccer
World Cup triumph in South Africa this year, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While record five-time champion Brazil is the strongest
team playing in the 32-nation event, England will beat Spain in
the July 11 final, according to Matthew Burgess and Marco Dion,
London-based analysts with JPMorgan&#8217;s equity quantitative
analysis team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whilst our model points towards Brazil as being the
strongest team to take part in the World Cup, our World Cup Wall
Chart indicates that thanks to the actual fixtures determined by
the schedule, we believe England will be the winner of the 2010
World Cup,&#8221; Burgess and Dion said in a report released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 18 previous editions of soccer&#8217;s four-yearly
championship have produced just seven different winners, while
six countries have been represented in the past 10 finals. UBS
Wealth Management Research, which correctly predicted Italy
would win the 2006 World Cup, forecast last month that Brazil
will win this year&#8217;s tournament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which described the report as &#8220;an opportunity to
lightheartedly explain quantitative techniques,&#8221; applied a
mathematical model, built to screen and identify stocks, to
soccer. It used data including bookmakers&#8217; odds, official FIFA
world rankings, previous results and the match schedule to
predict a winner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European champion Spain, which has never won the World Cup,
is rated the 4-1 favorite by U.K. bookmaker William Hill Plc
ahead of 5-1 second-favorite Brazil and 6-1 chance England. That
means a successful 1 pound ($1.44) bet on Spain would return 4
pounds plus the original stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil last won the World Cup in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. filed two lawsuits to
combat what it says is a previously unknown form of pay-per-
click fraud on its adCenter network that has cost advertisers
hundreds of thousands of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company alleged that RedOrbit Inc., a Texas operator of
a website about science-related topics, its president and
unidentified defendants have used technical measures to make
invalid ad clicks appear to have originated from legitimate
sources, according to a Microsoft statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With click fraud, a company inflates the number of times an
ad is clicked on, often boosting advertising costs for a
competitor. In some cases, a website operator uses the technique
to increase its own revenue. Microsoft said RedOrbit&#8217;s actions
represent &#8220;click laundering,&#8221; a form of the practice designed
to evade fraud detection systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are indications of the increasing sophistication&#8221;
of click fraud, said Jim Jansen, an associate professor of
information sciences at Penn State in University Park,
Pennsylvania. &#8220;It highlights that the ad platforms cannot get
complacent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, advertisers have sued companies, such as
Google Inc., that make money based on the number of times Web
users interact with online advertisements. Google, the most-used
Internet search engine, agreed in 2006 to pay $90 million to
settle a lawsuit with companies that said they paid for clicks
on ads that had no chance of generating sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Best Defense&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s legal moves suggest Internet companies are
taking a more proactive role in cracking down on click fraud,
said Laurence Pulgram, a lawyer at Fenwick  West in San
Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a case of the search engine deciding the best
defense is a good offense, so the advertisers won&#8217;t be blaming
them,&#8221; Pulgram said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said investigators uncovered the fraud following
&#8220;dramatic and irregular growth in click traffic&#8221; on two sites
within its adCenter network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RedOrbit.com click traffic increased from 75 clicks a day
to 10,000 clicks over a three-month period, according to one of
two complaints filed in federal court in Seattle by the Redmond,
Washington-based company, the world&#8217;s largest software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is RedOrbit&#8217;s policy not to comment on pending
litigation,&#8221; said Eric Ralls, founder of RedOrbit, listed as
the defendant in one of the lawsuits. &#8220;However, we do not, nor
have we ever, engaged, assisted in, or condoned click fraud. We
are disappointed that Microsoft has made these completely
baseless allegations, and intend to defend against them
vigorously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mask the Masking? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Boscovich, a senior attorney with Microsoft, says
Ralls figured out how to trick adCenter into making clicks that
weren&#8217;t valid look as though they had come from a legitimate
site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We found that he&#8217;d done something that was thought to be
technically unfeasible,&#8221; Boscovich said. While many websites
have used methods to mask the true source of traffic, &#8220;he was
able to mask the fact that he was masking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said it has taken steps to root out click fraud,
including in cases where the traffic is automated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We design our systems to catch bot-related attacks,&#8221;
said Deanna Yick, a spokeswoman for Mountain View, California-
based Google. &#8220;Because a significant amount of malicious
traffic is automated, advertisers are protected from these kinds
of attacks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Microsoft v. Eric Ralls, 10-818, and
Microsoft v. John Does, 10-820, U.S. District Court, Western
District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move by General Electric Co. and
several Wall Street banks to salvage a Chicago lender with White
House ties prompted Republicans to demand that the Obama
administration answer questions about any role it may have
played in the rescue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ShoreBank Corp., which needs about $200 million in
additional capital to stave off regulators, also is receiving
help from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp., the Chicago Tribune
reported. Representative Spencer Bachus, the ranking Republican
on the House Financial Services Committee, said they were doing
so to gain favor with the administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some believe that ShoreBank was really saved because of an
assumption that high-ranking officials in the Obama
administration favored a bailout of this failing institution
with deep political ties,&#8221; Bachus, an Alabama lawmaker, said in
a letter he sent to President Barack Obama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Electric said yesterday it&#8217;s investing $20 million
in the community bank, which is based on Chicago&#8217;s South Side
and has long-standing ties to the president. After Obama was
elected, former ShoreBank executive Robert Weissbourd served on
the president-elect&#8217;s transition team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no way a bank without ShoreBank&#8217;s political
connections would receive this kind of attention,&#8221; Bachus said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White House Question &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administration officials haven&#8217;t met with ShoreBank about
its efforts to raise capital nor asked other lenders to provide
it with &#8220;financial assistance,&#8221; Amy Brundage, a White House
spokeswoman, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, a 1970s-era pioneer in lending to low-income
neighborhoods, has raised more than its target of $125 million
in private capital, said Brian Berg, a ShoreBank spokesman. The
remaining money may come from government funds, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re still looking into what Bachus is asking for,&#8221;
Berg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bachus&#8217;s letter to the president also was signed by
Republican Representative Judy Biggert of Illinois. They said it
is unfair for a &#8220;politically connected hometown bank&#8221; to get
assistance as others are closed by regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Republicans urged the White House to release all
communication records that may exist between the administration
and financial executives involved in helping ShoreBank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The investment is consistent with our focus on small- and
medium-sized businesses, and it is a valuable community bank,&#8221;
GE spokesman Russell Wilkerson said yesterday. GE Capital, the
Stamford, Connecticut-based unit of GE, makes loans to
businesses through its commercial lending and leasing division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Role &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New
York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman has agreed to invest $20 million in ShoreBank and
never had contact from the White House on the matter, said a
person familiar with Goldman&#8217;s involvement. The firm&#8217;s
connections were through Ellen Seidman, who is on ShoreBank&#8217;s
board and is a founding member of the advisory council of a
Goldman small-business initiative, as well as former U.S.
Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig and Sheila Bair,
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the person
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. named Eduardo Cruz
head of global banking for Latin America and hired Alberto Pandolfi from JPMorgan Chase  Co. to lead mergers and
acquisitions in the region, according to an internal memo
confirmed by Citigroup spokesman Mark Costiglio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruz, 46, will remain based in New York and keep his
current position as co-head of industrial investment banking.
Beginning today, he will also lead Citigroup&#8217;s investment and
corporate banking throughout Latin America, reporting to Raymond J. McGuire, head of global banking, and Fernand Quiroz Robles,
chief executive officer of the institutional clients group in
Mexico and Latin America, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Citi has a longstanding and powerful presence in Latin
America,&#8221; Cruz said in a phone interview. &#8220;We are very excited
about building on that legacy to establish the preeminent global
banking franchise in the region.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandolfi, 38, will be based in New York and start on June
1, reporting to Cruz and to Citigroup&#8217;s global head of mergers
and acquisitions, Mark Shafir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruz joined Citigroup in 2005 and became co-head of
industrial investment banking in 2008. He spent 14 years at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and left as a partner in
the firm&#8217;s industrial investment banking group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citi also named Fidel Andueza as head of
investment banking in Brazil. He will be based in Sao Paulo
and report to Cruz and to Gustavo Marin, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andueza has been with Citi for 13 years, during 11 of which
he led mergers and acquisitions in Spain and Portugal. He spent
the last two years as a partner at Citi Infrastructure
Investors. He replaces Ricardo Lacerda who headed Citi
investment banking in Brazil from 2005 through July 2009, when
he left to found a boutique firm called BR Partners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Global
Economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said that while Europe&#8217;s debt crisis has
eased the euro&#8217;s &#8220;overvaluation,&#8221; policy makers may have to
take coordinated steps to shore up the currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People need to remember that for the past couple of years
the euro&#8217;s been very expensive,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill told Bloomberg Radio
from London today. Still, the euro&#8217;s recent slide indicates
expectations that monetary union could unravel, &#8220;so, there
needs to be something done by European policy makers to
stabilize the euro in the near future,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro has shed 15 percent against the dollar this year
on concern a Greek fiscal crisis will spread across the 16-
member currency region. While European leaders last week pledged
a rescue package worth almost $1 trillion and the European
Central Bank started purchasing government bonds, investors
remain concerned about nations&#8217; ability to push down deficits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro remained near a four-year low against the dollar
today, trading at $1.2292 at 1:45 p.m. in London. It dropped as
low as $1.2144 today, the lowest level since April 17, 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece on May 18 received the first installment of a
European Union aid package allowing it pay back 8.5 billion
euros of bond maturing today and avoid default. The government
pledged 30 billion euros of budget cuts to secure the aid and
pledged to reduce the budget gap to 8.1 percent of gross
domestic product this year from 13.6 percent in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7-Eleven Australia is close to
acquiring most of Exxon Mobil Corp&#8217;s local filling stations, the
Australian newspaper reported on its website, without
saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caltex Australia Ltd., the nation&#8217;s biggest oil refiner,
last month scrapped plans to buy 302 filling stations from Exxon
Mobil for A$300 million ($257 million) after the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission opposed the transaction on
concerns the deal would lead to higher prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is looking at the options for its retail fuel
business, Alan Bailey, a spokesman in Melbourne for the Texas-
based company, said by telephone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He declined to comment on potential buyers of the filling
stations. 7-Eleven is interested in acquisitions and has looked
at a &#8220;multitude of opportunities,&#8221; Melbourne-based spokeswoman
Tracy Hammon said by telephone. No agreements have been reached,
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Australia wants to focus on natural-gas
projects, with plans to spend &#8220;many billions of dollars&#8221; in
Australia and Papua New Guinea in three to five years, the
company&#8217;s Australian Chairman John Dashwood said in an interview
in Brisbane yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filling stations are &#8220;not our business model,&#8221; Dashwood
said &#8220;I guess the distinction I make is, are you an oil and gas
company or are you a groceries company? The industry has changed
to the point where the two meld, and some have used the shop to
move fuel. We&#8217;re not in the business of being a shop.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. racked up
trading profits for itself every day last quarter. Clients who
followed the firm&#8217;s investment advice fared far worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven of the investment bank&#8217;s nine &#8220;recommended top
trades for 2010&#8221; have been money losers for investors who
adopted the New York-based firm&#8217;s advice, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg from a Goldman Sachs research note sent
yesterday. Clients who used the tips lost 14 percent buying the
Polish zloty versus the Japanese yen, 9.4 percent buying
Chinese stocks in Hong Kong and 9.8 percent trading the British
pound against the New Zealand dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The struggles for analysts at Goldman Sachs, which is 
fighting a fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators who accuse the
company of misleading investors in a mortgage-linked security, 
show the difficulty of predicting market movements as widening 
budget deficits, a fragile global economic recovery and tighter
financial regulations increase volatility. Stock and currency
fluctuations rose to the highest in a year this month as Europe
pledged about $1 trillion to stop a debt crisis in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This says that Goldman&#8217;s guys are only human,&#8221; said Axel Merk, who oversees $500 million as president and chief
investment officer of Merk Investments LLC in Palo Alto,
California. &#8220;No one is always right. There are a lot of cross
currents in this market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gia Moron, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Bear Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s trading profits come from capturing bid-
offer spreads when its traders act as intermediaries for
clients, Gary Cohn, the firm&#8217;s president and chief operating
officer, said last week in New York. Proprietary trading isn&#8217;t a
main driver of earnings, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade advice for customers is distributed by Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s global markets economic research group. It tracks the
performance of the trades in a daily research note. The time
period of the recommendations is 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance this year is a reversal from 2009, when
nine of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 11 trading recommendations made money.
Investors saw a 22 percent return owning Chinese stocks and a 12
percent gain buying the British pound versus the dollar,
according to a Goldman Sachs note on Dec. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analysts made eight trade recommendations for
this year in December, including telling clients to buy the
British pound against the New Zealand dollar. On April 1,
Goldman Sachs added a ninth &#8220;top&#8221; trade, telling clients to
buy Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong and predicting the Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index would rise 19 percent to 15,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tough Analysis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the gauge has slid 9.4 percent to 11,426.18.
The Shanghai Composite index has entered a bear market, losing
about 21 percent this year. That&#8217;s the third biggest decline in
the world after Greece and Cyprus. The decline accelerated this
month on concern Greece, Spain and Portugal will struggle to
finance their budget deficits and dismantle the euro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese stock recommendation was made by a group led by
Dominic Wilson, a senior Goldman Sachs economist in New York.
Wilson cited inexpensive valuations and &#8220;robust&#8221; economic
growth. He also said investors have already factored in the risk
of higher interest rates in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson wasn&#8217;t available to comment because he was out of
the office traveling, according to an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exit Calls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Emerging markets appear superior to the developed world,
but the market isn&#8217;t trading that relationship,&#8221; said Eric Fine, who manages Van Eck Associates Corp.&#8217;s G-175 Strategies
emerging-market hedge fund. &#8220;It may be that some assets are
mispriced, but if the market starts to discount the end point of
the game, such as the collapse of the euro, it&#8217;s not that
mispriced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Goldman Sachs recommended investors exit two
trades in February, one involving interest-rate swap rates in
the U.K. and another advising clients to buy credit-default
swaps in Spain and sell similar contracts in Ireland. The first
trade had a potential loss of 24 basis points and the other had
a return of 2.9 percent, according to figures issued in the
appendix of the research note in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owning currencies that are tied to growth is the only
remaining trade that has increased in value this year, according
to Goldman Sachs. The Goldman Sachs FX Growth Index
has climbed 3.4 percent since the firm made the recommendation
in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betting on Markets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs makes more money from trading than any other
Wall Street firm. In the first quarter, the bank&#8217;s $7.39 billion
in revenue from trading fixed-income, currencies and commodities
dwarfed the $5.52 billion made by its closest rival, Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America Corp. In equities, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s $2.35 billion in revenue was about 50 percent higher
than its nearest competitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn told investors at a May 11 conference in New York that
the firm lost money on only 11 days in the last 12 months. He
said that uncanny streak of success refutes suspicions that the
bank depends on proprietary bets with its own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is implausible that a proprietary-driven business
model could be right 96 percent of the time,&#8221; Cohn said.
Instead, he said the &#8220;simple answer&#8221; is that the firm makes
money by capturing bid-offer spreads when acting as an
intermediary for client trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs executives have grappled before with
questions about whether they&#8217;re better at making money for the
firm than for their clients, according to an internal e-mail
dated Sept. 26, 2007, that was released by a U.S. Senate
subcommittee last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The e-mail to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein from
Peter Kraus, who was then co-head of the company&#8217;s investment-
management division, explains that individual investors, unlike
institutional clients, occasionally make &#8220;comments like ur good
at making money for urself but not us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit
against Goldman on April 16 accusing the company of misleading
investors in a mortgage-linked asset. Goldman denies those
allegations and said it will fight the charges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit
Suisse Group Inc. cut profit and share-price estimates for
Chinese property companies, citing a government clampdown on
speculation to avoid asset bubbles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, ranked second for Asian property coverage by
Institutional Investor magazine, lowered its 2010 net income
estimates by an average 13 percent and reduced earnings
forecasts for the next two years by 25 percent, analysts led by
Yi Wang wrote in a report today. Credit Suisse pared earnings-
per-share estimates by as much as 15 percent for 2010 and 20
percent for 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI China Real Estate Index&#8217;s 16 companies have
slumped an average 23 percent this year as the central bank
raised bank reserve requirements three times, while the
government raised down payment requirements for second homes and
banned loans for third homes. The slump in property stocks
outpaced the 9.5 percent drop in the broader MSCI China Index
that tracks mostly Hong Kong-traded stocks. The brokerages also
slashed share-price targets by as much as 57 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In view of the revised tightening measures since mid-
April, we turn more cautious on the property sector,
particularly on transaction volumes for the remainder of the
year,&#8221; Credit Suisse analysts led by Jinsong Du wrote in a
report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling Transactions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property transaction volumes will tumble by about 15
percent on average this year from 2009, the brokerage estimated,
keeping an earlier forecast that prices will slump 30 percent
from current levels. There are signs the government may &#8220;adopt
a more cautious stance on tightening&#8221; amid the European
sovereign-debt crisis, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has slid 21
percent this year, Asia&#8217;s worst performer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs predicted volumes will fall 40 percent
between May and December from a year earlier, while home prices
will fall as much as 30 percent from current levels, according
to a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A number of developers with funding gaps may face
refinancing issues if banks tighten credit to developers
further,&#8221; the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. &#8220;We suggest
investors avoid such secondary real estate brokers due to their
high leverage to transaction volumes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guangzhou RF, Sino-Ocean &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of new homes in Shanghai fell to a five-year low last
week as tightening measures took effect, property consultant
Shanghai UWin Real Estate Information Services Co. said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Sales from May 10 to May 16
fell 16 percent to 60,000 square meters from the week before,
the lowest level for the same period since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs cut its ratings for Guangzhou RF Properties
Co., Shimao Property Holdings Ltd., Sino-Ocean Land Holdings
Ltd. and Yanlord Land Group Ltd. to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy.&#8221; It
downgraded IFM Investments Ltd., Shanghai Forte Land Co. and
Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town Holdings Co. to &#8220;sell&#8221; from
&#8220;neutral,&#8221; while upgrading China Resources Land Ltd. to
&#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;sell.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse lowered its recommendation for Greentown
China Holdings Ltd. to &#8220;underperform&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; and
downgraded Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. and Hopson
Development Holdings Ltd. to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;outperform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered Bank also downgraded Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd. and Sino Land Co. today to &#8220;in-line&#8221; from
&#8220;outperform,&#8221; citing a &#8220;less visible outlook&#8221; for Hong
Kong&#8217;s residential prices, according to an e-mailed note by
analyst John Chan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guangzhou RF, the largest developer in the southern
Chinese city, fell 1.9 percent in Hong Kong trading, pacing a
retreat among property stocks. Shimao declined 1.2 percent while
Sino-Ocean Land lost 2.3 percent. Greentown China fell 2.2
percent while Hopson dropped 2.3 percent. Evergrande, China&#8217;s
second-biggest developer by first-quarter sales, tumbled 6.6
percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. and Celldex Therapeutics
Inc.&#8217;s said 70 percent of patients getting their experimental
brain tumor vaccine were alive without their cancer worsening
about eight months after diagnosis, a study found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer typically progresses in about 50 percent of patients
during that time period, said Tom Davis, Celldex&#8217;s chief medical
officer. The finding, involving 40 patients, is from an interim
analysis of a study reported today by the American Society for
Clinical Oncology. The full results will be presented June 5 at
the group&#8217;s annual meeting in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker,
licensed rights to the drug last year from Needham,
Massachusetts-based Celldex for as much as $440 million, plus
royalties. If approved for brain cancer, the vaccine could have
$450 million in peak annual sales and come on the market in
2013, said Joseph Pantginis, an analyst with Roth Capital
Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investors may be disappointed because previous,
smaller studies appeared to show a greater benefit with about 90
percent of patients alive without their cancer worsening after
the treatment, called CDX-110, Pantginis said. That may be a
misinterpretation of the data because the studies aren&#8217;t
&#8220;apples-to-apples&#8221; comparisons, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celldex fell 8.9 percent to $6.99 at 7:06 p.m. New York
time in extended trading after the close of the Nasdaq Stock
Market. Pfizer fell 13 cents to $15.10 in extended New York
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Data Needed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further data on the vaccine&#8217;s survival benefit will be
needed to draw definitive conclusions on the treatment, said
Pantginis, who has a &#8216;buy&#8217; rating on Celldex shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There might be some disappointment out there because you
have erosion to the progression rate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is still
a positive progression number, but the data are immature.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment is designed to ramp up the body&#8217;s immune
response to fight off the tumor. The vaccine targets the
molecule called epidermal growth factor receptor variant III,
which plays a role in cell growth. The strategy could be applied
to breast, ovarian and prostate cancer as well, though none of
those indications are in human testing, Celldex said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug is in the second of three stages of testing
required to get U.S. regulatory approval. Pfizer hasn&#8217;t
announced plans to start final-stage testing. The next step
likely will be a placebo-controlled study looking at about 200
patients worldwide, Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the research, newly diagnosed patients received
injections of CDX-110 along with radiation therapy and Merck 
Co.&#8217;s Temodar until their tumor progressed. All patients
received the experimental treatment, rather than giving the
medicine to half of the participants while the other half
received placebos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final results from 65 patients enrolled in the trial should
be available by year&#8217;s end, Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the energy producer
fighting lawsuits over drilling in Ecuador, must wait until
May 31 before proceeding with a subpoena seeking outtakes from a
movie about oil exploration, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron won a court ruling May 6 ordering filmmaker Joseph Berlinger to surrender outtakes from his documentary about the
San Ramon, California-based company&#8217;s drilling in Ecuador. The
company argued that footage shot for &#8220;Crude: The Real Price of
Oil&#8221; may be relevant in a lawsuit brought by Ecuadorians, in
Chevron&#8217;s arbitration against Ecuador, and in criminal
proceedings in the South American country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Chevron subpoena required Berlinger to surrender his
outtakes by tomorrow. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New
York today granted a 10-day postponement so that Berlinger may
appeal the judge&#8217;s May 6 ruling to the Court of Appeals in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berlinger&#8217;s lawyer, Maura Wogan, argued yesterday that
Kaplan&#8217;s earlier ruling will compromise the rights of other
documentary makers not to disclose unpublished material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also today, lawyers for Berlinger filed an appeal of
Kaplan&#8217;s May 6 order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Application of Chevron Corp., M-19-111,

familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to drop Goldman wasn&#8217;t related to a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the firm last
month, accusing it of misleading investors in a mortgage-linked
security, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the decision wasn&#8217;t public. The agency, which carries
8.5 million passengers a day, went through its normal process of
requesting proposals and found a better deal, said the person,
declining to be more specific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advisory assignment with the MTA, one of the biggest
issuers of U.S. municipal debt, is among the market&#8217;s most
lucrative. The MTA, the largest mass-transit system in the U.S.,
plans to sell about $9 billion in bonds for capital projects in
the four years through 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman became the MTA&#8217;s financial adviser in 2000, and its
contract was renewed in 2004. The firm earned about $21 million
advising the agency on bond issues, based on its fee of 65 cents
per each $1,000 unit sold since early 2002. The agency has
issued more than $31 billion in debt since March 2002, according
to audited financial statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MTA&#8217;s finance committee will recommend the board change
advisers on May 24, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MTA&#8217;s decision not to renew Goldman&#8217;s contract was
reported earlier by the New York Post and New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Soffin, a spokesman for the MTA, and Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG&#8217;s head of capital markets
in Asia, Steven Barg, left Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank to join
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barg, 48, quit the bank today and a successor will be
announced later, Chris Cockerill, a Hong Kong-based spokesman
for UBS, said by telephone. He will join Goldman as co-head of
equity capital markets in Asia with Jonathan Penkin, according
to Connie Ling, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS fell to sixth in arranging equity offerings in the
Asia-Pacific region this year from second in 2009, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The Zurich-based bank had been among the top
three underwriters in the region every year since 2001. New
York-based Goldman rose to second place this year from fourth
in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barg, who declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg,
will remain in Hong Kong and report to Dan Dees, head of
Goldman&#8217;s Asian financing group, Ling said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departure follows the resignation of Mark Williams,
UBS&#8217;s head of Asia equity capital markets, earlier this month.
Williams was hired by Nomura Holdings Inc. to lead its equity
capital-markets team in Asia outside Japan, two people with
knowledge of the decision told Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sutha Kandiah, UBS&#8217;s co-head of equity capital markets in
Asia, was hired in March by Religare Enterprises Ltd., Indian
billionaire Malvinder Singh&#8217;s financial-services company, as
head of global equity capital markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fee Pool Grows &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Deutsche Bank AG lured away Robert Rankin, who
headed investment banking for Asia-Pacific at UBS, making him
chief executive officer for the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment-banking fee pool in the Asia-Pacific area
may grow 8.8 percent annually to about 50 billion Swiss francs
($43.5 billion) by 2012, Chi-Won Yoon, UBS&#8217;s CEO for the region,
told investors in November, citing estimates by Boston
Consulting Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Larry Estrada graduates from
Harvard Business School next week, he&#8217;ll begin work at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. He&#8217;ll do so only after taking an oath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estrada, 30, joined about 150 fellow business school
students and faculty worldwide to campaign for the acceptance 
of an MBA ethics pledge modeled on the Hippocratic Oath taken 
by doctors. The aim is to get as many as 6,000 graduates at 50
MBA programs to swear they won&#8217;t put personal ambitions before 
the interests of their employers or society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created last year by Harvard Business students to counter a
growing public mistrust of business, the oath is being
championed by Nitin Nohria, the newly appointed dean of the
school. After the global financial crisis, Bernard Madoff&#8217;s $65
billion Ponzi scheme and scandals at Goldman Sachs, there has
never been a better time for managers to rethink their role in
society, said Rich Leimsider, director of the Aspen Institute&#8217;s
Center for Business Education, in New York, which is helping to
coordinate the movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the things we&#8217;re hoping to do is force hundreds of
thousands of people in business to talk about and think about
their responsibilities,&#8221; Leimsider said. &#8220;Nitin has given
Harvard a huge head start in that direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;484 MBAs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, 484 new MBAs at Harvard Business School, in
Boston, took the pledge, inspired partly by an article by Nohria
and Harvard professor Rakesh Khurana, in the October 2008 issue
of the Harvard Business Review, calling for a code of ethics for
managers. About another 1,500 took it at the Wharton School of
the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, and the Kellogg
School of Management of Northwestern University, in Evanston,
Illinois, and at other U.S. management schools, Leimsider said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For me, it was a stake in the ground, to say here are my
values, here&#8217;s what I believe in,&#8221; said Estrada, who plans to
work as an investment manager for Goldman Sachs in Seattle.
&#8220;When I have a tough decision, I want to be in a position where
I have my own personal oath.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all Harvard Business students support the oath. About
45 percent of the graduating class of 886 last year didn&#8217;t take
it, and a similar share won&#8217;t this year, either, Estrada said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oath is &#8220;the knee-jerk reaction by business apologists
to the current financial crisis,&#8221; Justin McLeod, 26, a Harvard
Business student, wrote in the Harbus, a school publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Cosmetic&#8217; Change &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farmers in Argentina, the world&#8217;s
third-biggest producers of soybeans, are doing everything they
can to avoid selling their record harvest of 55 million tons in
a bet the peso is poised to plummet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping their dollar-denominated commodity -- 2 billion
bushels worth $19.3 billion -- from the market when inflation is
accelerating and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicts the currency
will decline to 4.15 to the dollar from 3.90 is a form of
protection, according to Alabern, Fabrega y Cia, a commodities
trading company based in the Pampas city of Rosario. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When faced with uncertain circumstances farmers hold onto
the currency they understand best, the beans,&#8221; Miguel Calvo,
president of the Argentine Soy Association, said in a telephone
interview from Rosario, 286 km (178 miles) from Buenos Aires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers are hoarding soybeans to preserve their wealth as
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner pursues a weak peso
policy intended to stimulate exports from South America&#8217;s
second-largest economy. Argentina outperformed Brazil and Chile
last year and posted a record $17 billion trade surplus after
Fernandez presided over a 20 percent drop in the peso since
taking office for a four-year term in December 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso&#8217;s loss is spurring inflation. Consumer prices may
soar 25 percent in the next year, according to a monthly survey
by Torcuato Di Tella University in Buenos Aires. Inflation at
that rate would lag behind only Venezuela&#8217;s 34 percent rate
worldwide, based on data from the International Monetary Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peso&#8217;s Loss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso will decline 7.3 percent to 4.2 per dollar by
year-end, the biggest decline among 33 currencies with forecasts
available, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The peso has
declined every year since 2003, losing a quarter of its value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile&#8217;s peso slid 7.1 percent against the U.S. dollar this
year after the country&#8217;s pension-fund regulator changed rules on
currency hedging, prompting pension funds to buy more dollars.
The Brazilian real has declined 4.2 percent in that period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers sold about 36 percent of the season&#8217;s soy crop, or
19.4 million tons, through April, compared with 38 percent, or
17.6 million tons, in the same period in 2008, according to the
Rosario Cereals Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales were expected to be &#8220;far higher&#8221; this year after a
drought last year curbed output and caused farmers to take on
new debt, Patricia Bergero, deputy head of economic studies at
the exchange, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing Money &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alabern said farmers holding on to their crops risk losing
money if international soy prices fall amid rising supplies.
Brazilian farmers, the world&#8217;s second-biggest producers, are
reaping a record crop and U.S. growers, the world&#8217;s largest, are
planting more. World soybean prices will slip about 24 cents a
bushel, or 2.6 percent, to $9.195 a bushel by November, futures
contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producers are stockpiling beans in special bags on their
farms rather than sell the crops, Omar Barchetta, a vice-
president of the Rosario-based Argentine Agrarian Federation
farmers group, said in a May 7 phone interview. The Federation
is lobbying for a weaker peso to help maintain revenue if the
government doesn&#8217;t lower export taxes this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Farmers mistrust the government and the financial system
and that&#8217;s why they choose to hold on to their soybeans rather
than transform it into cash,&#8221; Barchetta said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Competitive Peso&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercedes Marco del Pont, who took over as the head of
Argentina&#8217;s Central Bank on Feb. 4, said she&#8217;d continue monetary
and exchange rate policies to maintain a &#8220;competitive&#8221;
Argentine peso. Her predecessor, Martin Redrado, was ousted
after a dispute over the use of bank reserves to repay debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president of the Agrarian Federation, Eduardo Buzzi,
said at an April 12 press conference that the currency should be
driven down to four pesos to the dollar. Soy is priced in
dollars, so a weaker peso means higher sales in local currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso is the second-worst performer among 26 major
emerging-market currencies after Iceland&#8217;s krona since 2003.
Option traders are now more bearish on the peso than any other
currency, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soybeans gained about 6.2 percent in April in Chicago, the
biggest monthly advance since November, on rising demand from
China. Farmers in the U.S. are planting for next year at a
&#8220;spectacular&#8221; rate, according to Dante Romano, a commodities
analyst at Alabern. U.S. soybean acres this year will increase
0.8 percent to 78.1 million, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil increased its forecast on May 6 for a record soybean
harvest of 67.9 million metric tons, from an estimate of 67.4
million tons expected last month, because of above-average rains
in the center-western region, where about half the country&#8217;s
crop is grown. The precipitation allowed farmers to plant
earlier than usual at the end of last year and increased yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Prices are far too high given the market context,&#8221;
Romano said in an interview from Rosario. &#8220;We don&#8217;t find any
fundamentals that justify a continuation of the increases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising inflation is making Argentina&#8217;s products more
expensive to foreign buyers and will prompt the government and
the central bank to allow the currency to depreciate to 4.15 per
dollar by year-end, Alberto Ramos, an economist in New York at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;They Will Devalue&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They will devalue, which will keep inflation higher, and
then they will devalue again,&#8221; Ramos said. &#8220;Every year they
devalued the currency by a fair amount to keep the real exchange
rate broadly competitive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires SA, HSBC Holdings Plc,
Banco Frances SA and Banco Santander Rio SA said in April that
they expect loans in their agribusiness to increase 20 percent
to 40 percent this year because of the record soy crop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This year, inflation eats into your savings, so one way
to avoid the depreciation of your assets is to put the savings
directly into soy,&#8221; Bergero said April 28. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Moffat, the former
International Business Machines Corp. executive who pleaded
guilty in the Galleon Group LLC insider-trading scheme, had an
&#8220;intimate relationship&#8221; with accused tipster Danielle Chiesi,
prosecutors said in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moffat admitted to securities fraud and conspiracy in March
and is scheduled to be sentenced in July. He faces six months in
prison at most. Today at the sentencing of Mark Kurland, a co-
founder of New Castle Funds LLC and Chiesi&#8217;s former boss, a
defense lawyer said Kurland deserved no more prison time than
Moffat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky told U.S.
District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan that Kurland was
motivated by greed while Moffat had an &#8220;intimate relationship&#8221;
with Chiesi. Brodsky didn&#8217;t elaborate, saying he hadn&#8217;t intended
to discuss Moffat&#8217;s case until Kurland&#8217;s lawyer, Patrick Smith,
began focusing on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurland, who was sentenced today to 27 months in prison,
and Moffat are among 21 people charged since October in two
waves of insider-trading arrests. Among them are Galleon co-
founder Raj Rajaratnam, who is charged with using confidential
tips to earn millions of dollars on illegal stock trades, and
Chiesi, whom Kurland supervised at New York-based New Castle.
Both Chiesi and Rajaratnam deny wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislation to bar a tax-avoidance
transaction companies such as Verizon Communications Inc. used
to spin off operations is closer to becoming law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Sander Levin and
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus included the
provision in a jobs bill they introduced yesterday and are
trying to pass through Congress by the end of the month. The
provision is likely to survive in the final bill, said Robert Willens, president of Robert Willens LLC, a consulting firm that
advises investors on tax and accounting rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would say the chances of this being enacted are quite
high,&#8221; Willens said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal would generate $255 million in revenue over
the next decade, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has
estimated. The House Ways and Means Committee voted in March to
end use of the transaction, while Senate committees haven&#8217;t
acted on the measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers still must resolve differences over the broader
legislation that would extend unemployment benefits, business
tax cuts and a program to help local governments reduce
borrowing costs. Senators including Budget Committee Chairman
Kent Conrad said the $195 billion measure is too large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Verizon, which has the largest U.S. mobile-
phone business, has made extensive use of the transaction, known
as a &#8220;reverse Morris Trust,&#8221; according to company filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viacom, Kraft &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies that have used the strategy include Viacom
Inc., Kraft Foods Inc. and Walt Disney Co. Other
telecommunications companies such as Alltel Corp. and Sprint
Nextel Corp. used it to separate landline businesses from
wireless enterprises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers including New York Democratic Representatives
Louise Slaughter and Charles Rangel said in December they viewed
such transactions as an abuse of tax laws that allow tax-free
spinoffs because they allow the acquirer of the spun-off
subsidiary to be loaded with debt. Labor unions including the
AFL-CIO have criticized the transaction for similar reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon is using the transaction as part of a deal to sell
rural phone lines in 14 states to Frontier Communications Corp.
The Federal Communications Commission approved the sale today,
according to two agency officials. The commission voted 5-0 to
clear the transaction, valued at about $8.6 billion, said the
officials, who asked not to be identified before the
announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation, as drafted, would apply only to deals
structured after its enactment and wouldn&#8217;t affect the Verizon-
Frontier transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Thonis, a spokesman for Verizon, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call seeking comment today. In March, Thonis said in an
interview that &#8220;many, many&#8221; companies have used the
transaction, which has been legal since 1997. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a southern
Appalachia coal producer, led miners higher on speculation a
sell-off prompted by the European debt crisis was overdone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter climbed $5.81, or 8.8 percent, to $71.91 as of 11:47
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Massey Energy
Co., the sixth-biggest U.S. coal producer, jumped $2.07, or 6.9
percent, to $32.03. Patriot Coal Corp. (PATCA), the fourth-biggest
eastern U.S. coal company, gained $1.13, or 7.6 percent, to
$15.96. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the coal companies has fallen at least 17 percent
in the past month amid concern the global economic recovery will
falter and slow demand. Coal, a barometer for the economy, is
used to generate electricity and make steel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They definitely got too cheap considering the underlying
fundamentals,&#8221; said Jeremy Sussman, an analyst at Brean Murray
Carret  Co. in New York. &#8220;What we&#8217;re seeing is investors are
taking a look at these coal names, looking at valuations and
thinking something doesn&#8217;t jibe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR), the third-biggest U.S. coal
producer, rose $1.78, or 5.2 percent, to $35.89. Consol Energy
Inc. (CNX), the natural gas and coal company, added $1.99, or 5.9
percent, to $35.72. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arch Coal Inc. (ACI), the second-biggest coal company, gained
$1.04, or 5.3 percent, to $20.71. Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU), the
largest U.S. coal producer, advanced $1.59, or 4.4 percent, to
$37.66. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portugal Telecom SGPS SA was cut to
&#8220;underweight&#8221; at JPMorgan Chase  Co., which said Telefonica
SA&#8217;s 5.7 billion-euro ($7 billion) bid for the company&#8217;s stake
in a Brazilian joint venture is likely to fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock recommendation was reduced from &#8220;neutral&#8221; also
because of the growth outlook in Lisbon-based Portugal Telecom&#8217;s
home market, JPMorgan analysts, including Daniel Morris in
London, said in a research report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefonica offered on May 6 to buy Portugal Telecom&#8217;s stake
in Vivo Participacoes SA, a venture that controls Brazil&#8217;s
biggest mobile-phone company. The Madrid-based phone company&#8217;s
bid for control will probably fail as Portugal Telecom&#8217;s
rejection of the proposal has the backing of local investors and
the country&#8217;s prime minister, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the prospects for successful value crystallization
of PT&#8217;s Vivo stake fading, in our view, we see few positive
catalysts near term,&#8221; Morris said in the report. &#8220;We expect
focus to return to an increasingly tough domestic environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any offer for all of Portugal Telecom is also unlikely to
succeed due to the &#8220;political opposition, PT bylaws and

&lt;p&gt;Analysts predict Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. will pay $1 billion or more to settle a Securities and
Exchange Commission fraud suit that triggered a 26 percent drop
in the firm&#8217;s stock. Extracting such a record-setting penalty
may be easier said than done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to presenting a settlement for court
approval, the SEC will have to &#8220;have a good explanation and
justification for the number,&#8221; said Donald Langevoort, a former
SEC attorney who teaches securities law at Georgetown University
in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looming over negotiations between the SEC and Wall Street&#8217;s
most profitable investment bank is a reminder from Judge Jed Rakoff that courts can reject settlements -- even when the SEC&#8217;s
adversary is willing and able to pay. Rakoff, a U.S. district
court judge in Manhattan, refused to sign off on a $33 million
accord with Bank of America Corp. in September, noting that the
SEC didn&#8217;t adequately explain how it came up with the dollar
amount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sanction in the range of $1 billion would be hard to
support based on the allegations in the Goldman Sachs complaint,
according to James Coffman, a former SEC enforcement official
who retired in 2007. That figure would be more than double what
any Wall Street firm has agreed to pay as part of a civil
settlement with authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under one formula outlined in securities laws, the SEC
could impose a maximum $15 million penalty on the bank to
resolve fraud allegations that it misled buyers of mortgage-
backed investments. That formula has been routinely ignored in
enforcement cases and the SEC will seek more from a firm
depicted as an icon of Wall Street greed at congressional
hearings, Coffman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$1 Billion &#8216;Goalpost&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s April 16 complaint accused Goldman Sachs of
defrauding investors in a collateralized debt obligation linked
to home loans. The firm concealed the fact that Paulson  Co., a
New York-based hedge fund, picked components of the CDO and bet
it would collapse, the agency said. Goldman Sachs, which
underwrote and marketed the product in 2007, collected about $15
million in fees and Paulson reaped a $1 billion profit. The
remaining investors lost more than $1 billion, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, has denied wrongdoing. Paulson hasn&#8217;t been
accused of any impropriety and the firm&#8217;s founder, John Paulson,
has said it didn&#8217;t market the transaction or have authority to
select securities in the CDO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $1 billion loss for investors has become the minimum
&#8220;goalpost&#8221; that the public expects the SEC to reach, according
to James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University in
Durham, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Whatever it Takes&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A settlement would cost the firm &#8220;at least $1 billion, if
not more, which they can easily pay,&#8221; Matt McCormick, an
analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Inc. in Cincinnati, which manages about
$2.8 billion, said in an April 30 Bloomberg Television
interview. The firm &#8220;will do whatever it takes to get this
away, or at least they should.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the agency&#8217;s first effort to punish a bank for creating
and selling securities tied to subprime mortgages, the Goldman
Sachs case will be dissected by the industry, in Congress and in
the media, Coffman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot of attention paid to this on Capitol
Hill and in the press,&#8221; said Coffman, who predicts Goldman
Sachs will pay about $100 million. The SEC will consider &#8220;how
much public interest there is in sending a strong message and
coming up with a settlement that shows the cops are on the
beat.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Nester and Goldman Sachs spokesman
Michael Duvally declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Softening Its Tone &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public statements from Goldman Sachs have softened in the
month since the SEC announced its case as the firm&#8217;s image and
stock price have taken a beating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an April 16 press release, Goldman Sachs called the suit
&#8220;completely unfounded&#8221; and pledged to &#8220;vigorously&#8221; defend
its reputation. Four days later, co-General Counsel Greg Palm
broached the idea of resolving the case, saying on a conference
call with investors that &#8220;you always have the option&#8221; of
settling if both sides forge an agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days following an April 27 Senate hearing where
Goldman Sachs managers were accused of putting the firm&#8217;s
interest ahead of clients, two executives at the firm who spoke
on condition of anonymity said the company was eager to settle
the SEC case in an attempt to contain the reputational damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramifications of Accord &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject of how much money the firm may pay hasn&#8217;t been
raised during early discussions between the SEC and Goldman 
Sachs, according to a person briefed on the matter, speaking
anonymously because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations are more likely to stall over the way the SEC
ultimately describes the firm&#8217;s conduct, rather than the size 
of any fine, said two people familiar with Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
thinking. Goldman would resist agreeing to a settlement that
includes an allegation of fraud, because doing so could hurt
the firm&#8217;s business, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settling a fraud case would restrict Goldman Sachs and its
employees from managing investment companies registered with the
SEC, unless the bank got an exemption from the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s asset management unit currently oversees
mutual funds, money-market funds and bond funds, according to
its website. Goldman Sachs would also risk losing its ability to
raise money quickly through securities sales without meeting
certain regulatory burdens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC and New York-based Goldman Sachs will have to
litigate if they can&#8217;t agree on an accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Pecuniary Gain&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC suit cites the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Both laws limit their most
severe fines to either $650,000 per violation or the &#8220;pecuniary
gain&#8221; reaped by the defendant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC investigators don&#8217;t have to follow those limitations if
they can persuade companies to pay more, a majority of agency
commissioners vote to approve the settlement and a judge signs
off on the accord, said former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s basically what the two sides hammer out,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs argues the $15 million in commissions it
received for putting the CDO together were offset by more than
$90 million the firm lost on its own stake in the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABN Amro Bank NV lost more than $840 million and
Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG lost
most of its $150 million investment, according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC typically requires defendants in a settlement to
pay a fine and return ill-gotten profits to victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s 2003 Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. paid $400 million in 2003 to settle SEC and
state allegations that its analysts hyped telecommunications
stocks that its researchers privately thought were
underperformers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said in its complaint that Citigroup made $790
million in revenue from underwriting telecom securities from
1999 through 2001, relying on analysts to &#8220;generate substantial
profits&#8221; for the company&#8217;s investment bankers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup agreed to a $150 million fine, returned $150
million of ill-gotten gains, and paid $100 million to provide
clients with independent research and investor education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, in the second-biggest agreement between
the SEC and a bank in the past decade, paid $375 million in 2004
to settle claims the company didn&#8217;t disclose that some of its
mutual funds allowed clients to make trades detrimental to other
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America paid a $125
million fine and $250 million in disgorgement. Its fine was 10
times the $12.5 million in revenue the SEC said it received from
one of the hedge funds making improper trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prudential&#8217;s Choice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prudential Securities Inc. agreed in a 1993 settlement
with the SEC and state regulators to pay $371 million in
restitution and fines, and to fully compensate all investors who
lost money in oil, gas and real estate partnerships it sold
without disclosing the risks. Over time the company paid more
than $1 billion to resolve claims dating back to the 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs remains the most profitable firm in Wall
Street history. It earned $13.4 billion in 2009 and an
additional $3.5 billion in the first three months of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Money hurts but limitations on business can hurt in a lot
more ways and that can be the hurt that keeps on giving,&#8221;
Coffman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 20 (Bloomberg) -- A weeklong rout in stocks deepened,
with U.S. benchmark indexes losing the most in more than a year,

&lt;p&gt;May 19 (Bloomberg) -- Credit-default swaps soared as German

&lt;p&gt;May 21 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Senate, bringing Congress to
the brink of passing the most comprehensive regulation of the
financial industry since the Great Depression, approved a bill
that imposes restrictions on proprietary trading by banks and
creates a consumer protection agency designed to prevent lending
abuses that triggered the housing collapse and the worst
unemployment in almost three decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Europe&#8217;s Rescue for Greece Brings Euro to New Normal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 20 (Bloomberg) -- Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will depress the

&lt;p&gt;May 18 (Bloomberg) -- Germany will temporarily ban naked
short selling and naked credit-default swaps of euro-area
government bonds at midnight after politicians blamed the

&lt;p&gt;May 17 (Bloomberg) -- Trader demand for insurance against a
slide in the euro is the highest in more than seven years as

&lt;p&gt;May 21 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks jumped, halting a

&lt;p&gt;9. U.S. Stocks Drop on German Trading Restrictions, Foreclosures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 19 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks fell, wiping out the 2010
gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, as Germany&#8217;s ban on

&lt;p&gt;May 18 (Bloomberg) -- New York University professor Nouriel

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. is less optimistic
about China as a market than India or Indonesia because of the
country&#8217;s lack of progress in stamping out software piracy,
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;India is not perfect but the intellectual property
protection in India is far, far better than it would be in
China,&#8221; the head of the world&#8217;s largest software maker said in
an interview in Hanoi, Vietnam, yesterday. &#8220;China is a less
interesting market to us than India, than Indonesia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer&#8217;s concerns underscore growing dismay among U.S.
companies toward operating in the world&#8217;s third-largest economy.
Google Inc. in March moved its Chinese service out of the
mainland to avoid censorship rules, and the American Chamber of
Commerce in Beijing said last month its members face an
increasingly difficult regulatory environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has implemented more than 1,000 measures related to
the protection of intellectual property and the government will
continue such efforts, said Chen Rongkai, a media officer at the
nation&#8217;s Ministry of Commerce in Beijing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China&#8217;s effort at strengthening protection of
intellectual property is universally recognized,&#8221; Chen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of progress in protecting intellectual property has
led China, which may overtake the U.S. as the world&#8217;s biggest
personal-computer market in a year, to generate less revenue for
Microsoft than India and South Korea, Ballmer said. China&#8217;s
gross domestic product is twice the two economies combined. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprint Nextel Corp. climbed the most
in more than three months after a Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
analyst raised his rating on the shares, projecting fewer
subscriber cancellations than in previous years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kansas, rose 38 cents, or
8.6 percent, to $4.79 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, the biggest increase since Feb. 2. The shares
have gained 31 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint, the third-largest U.S. mobile-phone carrier, added
fewer two-year contract customers in 2008, reducing &#8220;the
logical pool of churn subscribers&#8221; this year,  Jason Armstrong,
an analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York, said in a note
yesterday. He raised his rating to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; and
the 12-month price target to $6 from $3.50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue this year is likely to be $32.2 billion, up less
than 1 percent from his previous estimate, Armstrong said. In
2011, sales probably will be $32.5 billion, an increase of 1.2
percent from Armstrong&#8217;s prior projection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, agreed to
buy Sterling Commerce for $1.4 billion in cash, gaining software
that helps businesses conduct transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM will buy Dublin, Ohio-based Sterling from ATT Inc.,
the biggest U.S. phone carrier, according to a statement from
the companies today. Its software helps businesses share
information and transfer files to other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano plans to spend
$20 billion on takeovers in the next five years as he bolsters
the software business, IBM&#8217;s most profitable. Sterling&#8217;s
programs allow companies to manage and create their networks on
external servers, a business known as cloud computing -- which
IBM expects to reach $3 billion by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plugging this gap was crucial for IBM,&#8221; said Ken
Vollmer, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Syracuse, New
York. &#8220;IBM will be able to take the technology and meld it
together with theirs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction will likely close in the second half of
2010, the companies said. ATT probably will record a pretax
gain of $750 million on the deal once it&#8217;s completed. About
2,500 Sterling employees will join IBM&#8217;s software division. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latin American stocks, led by raw-
materials producers and homebuilders, are poised for a rebound
after falling as much as 21 percent on concern the global
economic recovery is faltering, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on fifteen regional &#8220;corrections&#8221; of more than 20
percent over the past two decades, buying Latin American
equities at this point of the selloff may generate a 12-month
return of 27 percent, strategist Ben Laidler wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It pays to buy the correction,&#8221; New York-based Laidler
wrote in a note to clients dated May 21. &#8220;Investors should be
positioning for a rebound as European contagion gradually
subsides on EU stabilization plan implementation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clobbered&#8221; stocks including state oil company Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, copper producer Grupo Mexico SAB and homebuilders
Gafisa SA and PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos  Participacoes are
set to lead gains, according to Laidler. Government-run lender
Banco do Brasil SA and utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA
are also poised to rebound, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correction won&#8217;t become a &#8220;crash,&#8221; defined as a drop
of more than 50 percent, according to Laidler. There have been
four crashes since 1987, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Global fundamentals are significantly better than 2008,&#8221;
Laidler wrote. &#8220;Regional valuations are attractive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Latin America Index rebounded May 21 after
entering a bear market, extending its drop from an April 14 high
to 21 percent through May 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Very Compelling&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian stocks are &#8220;very compelling&#8221; after companies in
the benchmark Bovespa index reported better-than-expected first-
quarter earnings, offsetting a decline in share prices, Banco
BTG Pactual SA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When global markets stabilize, foreign investors will be
attracted by Brazil&#8217;s compelling valuations, driving the market
back up,&#8221; BTG Pactual strategists Carlos Sequeira and Antonio Junqueira wrote in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that account for 48 percent of the Bovespa by
index weighting reported higher-than-forecast profit, helped by
financial institutions and state oil company Petrobras, while 23
percent missed estimates, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure has been sent &#8220;plummeting&#8221; because of
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis, U.S. banking reforms and concerns China
will take further steps to cool growth, according to BTG
Pactual. The index is now trading at a &#8220;very compelling
valuation&#8221; of 9.8 times estimated earnings over the next four
quarters, the Rio de Janeiro-based analysts wrote. While that&#8217;s
in line with the gauge&#8217;s six-year average, it is lower than the
&#8220;pre-crisis peak&#8221; of 16 times, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Solid&#8217; Fundamentals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTG Pactual&#8217;s current forecast of 6 percent economic growth
in 2010 &#8220;now looks conservative,&#8221; the analysts said. The bank
forecasts Brazilian firms&#8217; earnings will grow 37 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fundamentals of the Brazilian economy are as solid as
ever,&#8221; Sequeira and Junqueira wrote. &#8220;Companies&#8217; recent
results confirm the positive economic outlook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s economic &#8220;improvement&#8221; will spur the country&#8217;s
financial stocks to recover from the selloff, Barclays Plc said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fear and uncertainty may drive the market in the short
term,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;Some investors will take this
opportunity to unwind investments in some asset classes in order
to re-allocate their positions, thus participating in a market
recovery from an eight-month low.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy companies including Itausa -
Investimentos Itau SA, the owner of Latin America&#8217;s largest bank
by market value, and exchange-operator BMFBovespa SA, analysts
including Roberto Attuch wrote in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian banks, which are trading at &#8220;more attractive&#8221;
valuations than their Latin American peers, will see &#8220;robust
growth and quality earnings,&#8221; according to Barclays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa dropped to 58,192.08 last week, the lowest
closing value since September. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offshore drillers may need to order
about $5.5 billion in new rig-safety equipment as the Gulf of
Mexico oil-rig explosion and subsequent leaking well lead to
potential changes in environmental standards, JPMorgan Chase 
Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Noble Corp. and Pride
International Inc. would be most affected, J. David Anderson,
Adam Aron and Samantha Hoh, analysts at JPMorgan in New York,
wrote today in a note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire worldwide fleet of offshore rigs may need more
than 400 additional blowout preventers, or BOPs, which is about
$20 million in extra equipment per rig, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the near to medium term, drillers are poised to see
an increase in costs in maintenance, capital equipment and
insurance premiums,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;Furthermore, we
expect utilization rates to be lower to account for increased
down days related to maintenance and BOP testing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Interior Department halted drilling permits for
new wells pending findings of a government study into the April
20 Deepwater Horizon blast, which left 11 people dead. BP Plc,
which leased the rig from Transocean Ltd., has been struggling
to contain the well leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional costs may crimp cash flow for the drilling
contractors. Diamond Offshore, the largest U.S. deepwater oil
driller, may see its free cash flow drop as much as 22 percent
next year and 27 percent in 2012, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blowout-preventer system costs about $40 million, or
about 10 percent of the total cost of the drilling vessel,
according to Quest Offshore Resources Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les Van Dyke, a spokesman for Diamond Offshore, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment. Kate Perez, a
spokeswoman for Pride, declined to comment. Both companies are
based in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s too soon to tell,&#8221; said John Breed, a spokesman for
Geneva-based Noble. &#8220;You can&#8217;t know what it would ultimately
cost, if anything, until those rules are adopted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors don&#8217;t plan to
bring charges against former American International Group Inc.
executive Joseph Cassano after a two-year probe of the insurer&#8217;s
collapse, according to a person familiar with the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Department investigators found there is insufficient
evidence to charge Cassano, the former head of AIG&#8217;s Financial
Products division, the person said. The following is a list of
the major U.S. law enforcement and regulatory probes and actions
thus far in response to the subprime-mortgage meltdown and
ensuing financial crisis: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 2008: A Securities and Exchange Commission task force,
which began meeting the previous year, is working on about three
dozen inquiries into potential violations related to subprime
loans, the agency&#8217;s then-deputy enforcement director, Walter Ricciardi, says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 3, 2008: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the biggest sources
of financing for U.S. home loans, reached an agreement with New
York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to buy mortgages only from
lenders that adopt new standards he said were intended to ensure
independent home appraisals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 2008: The SEC&#8217;s list of active investigations stemming from
the credit crisis surpasses 50 as regulatory concerns grow in
the wake of Bear Stearns Cos.&#8217; emergency takeover by JPMorgan
Chase  Co., according to a person familiar with the caseload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 5, 2008: Moody&#8217;s Corp., Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Fitch Ratings
complete a deal with Cuomo that lets them avoid sanctions for
their roles in the subprime-mortgage crisis. The firms must
implement new policies for mortgage bonds, such as a fee
structure meant to address so-called ratings shopping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 19, 2008: Former Bear Stearns hedge fund managers Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin are indicted for mail fraud and
conspiracy in the first federal prosecution to target Wall
Street&#8217;s role in the credit crisis. The SEC also files a
parallel civil lawsuit, claiming they misrepresented their
funds&#8217; investments in mortgage-backed securities. Cioffi and
Tannin&#8217;s lawyers say the pair are being made scapegoats, and vow
to fight the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 3, 2008: Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and the SEC
accuse former Credit Suisse Group AG brokers Julian Tzolov and
Eric Butler of fraudulently selling subprime-mortgage-linked
securities to corporate clients as they sought higher
commissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 28, 2009: Michael Strauss, the former chief executive
officer of American Home Mortgage Investment Corp., agrees to
pay $2.45 million to settle SEC civil claims. The agency says he
understated how much money the lender needed to set aside for
bad loans during the first quarter of 2007, before the housing
market&#8217;s collapse triggered his firm&#8217;s bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 4, 2009: The SEC sues former Countrywide Financial Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Angelo Mozilo, claiming he publicly
reassured investors about the quality of its loans while issuing
&#8220;dire&#8221; internal warnings. Mozilo, who built Countrywide into
the nation&#8217;s biggest mortgage lender, also accelerated sales of
his shares to illegally avoid losses, the agency claims. He
denies wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July 22, 2009: Former Credit Suisse broker Tzolov pleads guilty
to securities fraud, conspiracy and wire fraud, telling the
judge that he misled clients about securities purchased on their
behalf. He has not yet been sentenced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 3, 2009: Bank of America Corp. agrees to pay $33 million to
settle SEC claims it misled investors about bonuses while
seeking permission to acquire Merrill Lynch  Co. in the wake of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s collapse. U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff later rejects the accord, calling it a
&#8220;contrivance,&#8221; and questions why executives weren&#8217;t accused of
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 17, 2009: Former Credit Suisse trader Butler is convicted
of fraudulently selling subprime-mortgage-backed securities. He
is later sentenced to five years in prison. His attorneys have
filed an appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov. 10, 2009: A jury finds former Bear Stearns hedge-fund
managers Cioffi and Tannin not guilty of misleading investors.
The acquittal may discourage additional federal prosecutions
related to financial instruments based on subprime loans. The
SEC later says it will proceed with its parallel civil lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dec. 7, 2009: The SEC sues three former New Century Financial
Corp. executives for allegedly concealing from investors that
the company&#8217;s subprime-mortgage business was at risk of
collapse. All three deny the claims. New Century was the No. 2
subprime lender when it filed for bankruptcy in April 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 22, 2010: Judge Rakoff says he &#8220;reluctantly&#8221; approved a
revised $150 million settlement between Bank of America and the
SEC, after the agency expanded its claims to target the bank&#8217;s
alleged 2008 misstatements about Merrill Lynch&#8217;s mounting
losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 16, 2010: The SEC sues Goldman Sachs Group Inc., claiming
the bank defrauded investors in a collateralized debt obligation
linked to home loans. The firm concealed the fact that Paulson 
Co., a New York-based hedge fund, picked components of the CDO
and bet it would collapse, the agency says. Goldman Sachs calls
the allegations &#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 30, 2010: Federal prosecutors in New York are also
investigating transactions by Goldman Sachs to determine whether
to pursue a criminal fraud case, according to two people
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 13, 2010: Cuomo subpoenas Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, UBS
AG and five other banks to see whether they misled credit rating
companies about mortgage-backed securities, according to a
person familiar with the probe. The inquiry focuses on whether
the banks manipulated raters&#8217; models and whether rating company
employees gave favorable treatment to banks that later hired
them. Ratings companies are also subpoenaed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HP, the world&#8217;s biggest personal-computer maker, had $3.4

increased 6 percent to $10.8 billion, Gartner said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global Partners LP, the owner of fuel
depots in the U.S. Northeast, agreed to buy 190 Mobil-branded
gasoline stations from Exxon Mobil Corp. for $200 million to
boost profits from supplying gasoline and diesel to retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction includes rights to supply fuel to the 190
stations, which are located in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and
New Hampshire, as well as 31 other Mobil outlets in the same
region that are owned by independent dealers, Global said today
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase will expand Global&#8217;s sales of transportation
fuels and increase its presence in New England as a wholesale
supplier to gasoline retailers, Eric Slifka, the partnership&#8217;s
chief executive officer, said in the statement. The purchase
will be financed with bank borrowings under an existing credit
line or by tapping capital markets, said Global, based in
Waltham, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the world&#8217;s largest company by market value,
is selling filling stations around the world to focus on higher-
return investments in oil and natural-gas production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Partners fell 32 cents to $19.90 as of the 4 p.m.
close of New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The units
have dropped 13 percent this year. Irving, Texas-based Exxon
Mobil fell 48 cents to $59.71. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. private
equity fund is seeking to join Oaktree Capital Management LP and
the Illinois teachers&#8217; pension fund as an investor in a company
planning to buy failed U.S. banks, according to public records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs applied to acquire as much as 25 percent of
SKBHC Holdings LLC, a Corona del Mar, California-based firm
trying to win approval to become a bank holding company,
according to an announcement on the Federal Register website.
Oaktree is also seeking 25 percent of the company and the
Illinois fund voted to invest $100 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SKBHC is trying to purchase Starbuck, Minnesota-based
Starbuck Bancshares Inc. and acquire assets and liabilities from
failed U.S. depositories, the company said in its application to
the Federal Reserve. Scott Kisting, the former co-head of global
banking at Merrill Lynch  Co., is SKBHC&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer, according to the application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks are collapsing amid losses on residential and
commercial real estate loans. The FDIC&#8217;s list of problem lenders
has ballooned to 745, the most since 1992. FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair has said she expects the number of failures in 2010 to
exceed last year&#8217;s total of 140. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. ended negotiations to
sell its Miramax film studio to Los Angeles billionaire Ron Burkle, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, resumed talks
with Los Angeles investors Alec and Tom Gores, who had earlier
made an offer, said a third person. The people asked not to be
identified because the talks aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burkle remains interested, one of the people said. He is
working with Bob and Harvey Weinstein, the Miramax founders who
sold the studio to Disney in 1993. The group is talking with the
board of the Weinstein Co. to resolve legal issues that caused
delays, the person said. If a settlement is reached, a deal
could be revived, two people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Disney ended
talks. Burkle had offered $625 million, two of the people said.
The Weinstein brothers, who weren&#8217;t expected to hold an equity
stake, were to receive pay and performance bonuses for
overseeing the studio and library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Burbank, California-
based Disney, declined to comment. Dani Weinstein, a spokeswoman
for New York-based Weinstein Co., had no immediate comment.
Burkle didn&#8217;t respond to a request for an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinstein Co. investor Mark Cuban said on April 21 that he
may try to stop the Weinstein brothers from joining Burkle&#8217;s
bid. The Cuban dispute involves the 2009 release &#8220;The Road,&#8221;
Dani Weinstein said at the time. The film, produced for $25
million, took in $23.9 million in worldwide ticket sales,
according to researcher Box Office Mojo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 55 cents to $31.93 at 2:16 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had climbed less
than 1 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fight breaks out as student Vikas
Dagar jostles with dozens of men, women and children to fill
buckets from a truck that brings water twice a week to the
village of Jharoda Kalan on the outskirts of New Delhi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three thousand kilometers (1,900 miles) away, near Xi&#8217;an in
central China, power-plant worker Zhou Jie stands on the mostly
dry bed of the Wei River, remembering when he used to fish there
before pollution made the catch inedible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dagar and Zhou show the daily struggle with tainted or
inadequate water in India and China, a growing shortage that the
World Bank says will hamper growth in the world&#8217;s fastest-
growing major economies. It also is pitting water-intensive
businesses such as Intel Corp.&#8217;s China unit and bottling plants
of Coca-Cola Co. against growing urban use and the 1.6 billion
people in China and India who rely on farming for a living. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Water will become the next big power, not only in China
but the whole world,&#8221; Li Haifeng, vice president at sewage-
treatment company Beijing Enterprises Water Group Ltd., said in
a telephone interview. &#8220;Wars may start over the scarcity of
water.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 2.4 billion people live in &#8220;water-stressed&#8221;
countries such as China, according to a 2009 report by the
Pacific Institute, an Oakland, California-based nonprofit
scientific research group. Water scarcity and pollution reduce
China&#8217;s gross domestic product by about 2.3 percent, the World
Bank said in a 2007 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doubling Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water demand in the next two decades will double in India
to 1.5 trillion cubic meters and rise 32 percent in China to 818
billion cubic meters, according to the 2030 Water Resources
Group, a research collaboration between the World Bank,
management consulting firm McKinsey  Co. and industrial water
users such as Coca-Cola. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will produce returns of 12 percent or more from
investments in companies that treat or process water, said
Arnaud Bisschop, who oversees $3.27 billion investments in the
Water Fund run by a unit of Pictet  Cie in Geneva. The fund
included stocks such as Beijing Enterprises Water and Hong Kong-
based environmental protection company China Everbright
International Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s 1.33 billion people each have 2,117 cubic meters of
water available per year, compared with 1,614 cubic meters in
India and as much as 9,943 cubic meters in the U.S., according
to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
The 1.2 billion people in India, where farmers use 80 percent of
available water, will exhaust their fresh-water supplies by 2050
at the current rate, the World Bank estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Buckets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Dagar, 21, and the 200 other villagers in Jharoda
Kalan, that dearth is already a daily fact of life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is for our drinking and cooking,&#8221; he said, pointing
to four bucketfuls he won from the fight. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting
for the past hour.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southwest China had its worst drought in a century this
year, prompting Premier Wen Jiabao to say that the country would
face a test to meet its grain output target. The drought
affected 24 million people and 16 million acres of arable land,
Liu Ning, vice-minister of water resources, said on March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s farmers are awaiting the start of the rainy season
this month after the weakest monsoon in more than three decades
last year cut rice output by as much as 10 percent, according to
the agriculture ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivers and Lakes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, with 20 percent of the world&#8217;s population and 7
percent of its fresh water, has contaminated 70 percent of its
rivers and lakes, while half the cities have polluted
groundwater, according to the World Bank. By 2030 China will
have a supply shortfall of 201 billion cubic meters unless the
government takes steps to control demand, McKinsey partner
Martin Joerss in Beijing wrote in an April report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wei river was rated &#8220;severely polluted&#8221; by the
government in 2009, according to a March 2 report in state-run
China Daily. That&#8217;s forced Zhou to fish instead in pools near
the river. The river level has dropped by about three-quarters
in some places in the past decade, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pollution and shrinking rivers are partly a result of
China&#8217;s rapid industrialization. Economic growth accelerated to
11.9 percent in the first quarter, the fastest pace in almost
three years. It is set to reach 10.5 percent this year,
according to Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value, Cost &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China can solve this problem in a way that creates
economic value as opposed to economic cost,&#8221; said Joerss in an
interview. &#8220;There is tremendous, though largely untapped,
opportunity to meet China&#8217;s enormous need for water resources by
focusing on better managing demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investments in technologies to ease China&#8217;s water deficit
are expected to reap 131 billion yuan ($19 billion) in profit a
year, according to the McKinsey report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian water-related companies have benefitted from the
demand for treatment and supply and have potential for further
gains, said Pictet&#8217;s Bisschop. He said profit on water
investments in China may be about 8 percent to 12 percent a
year, with even higher returns in some cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are looking for companies, for example, which provide
beverage companies water-efficient technology in cleaning the
bottles,&#8221; Bisschop said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Water is a resource under great pressure in China and
globally,&#8221; said Kenth Kaerhoeg, a spokesman in Hong Kong for
Coca-Cola Pacific, which has water recovery systems at its 39
plants in China to reduce consumption. &#8220;Economic development,
climate change and population growth will increase pressure on
freshwater resources in China.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Serious Depletion&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, a panel from the southern Indian state of Kerala
recommended suing Coca-Cola bottler Hindustan Coca-Cola
Beverages Pvt. for 2.16 billion rupees ($48 million) damages for
contamination and &#8220;serious depletion&#8221; of water in the town of
Palakkad. In an April 26 e-mail, the company denied that its
plant, shut since March 2004, depleted or tainted the town&#8217;s
water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Water and water treatment is going to be the next growth
story after power,&#8221; said M. S. Unnikrishnan, managing director
at Pune, India-based Thermax, which makes water-recycling
equipment. Thermax shares have almost doubled to 670 rupees on
the Bombay Stock Exchange in the past year, compared with a 16
percent gain in the benchmark Sensex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. K. Sandeep, vice president, corporate marketing at
Mumbai-based Ion Exchange (India) Ltd., which set up India&#8217;s
largest desalination plant in the southern city of Chennai, said
he expects rising demand for the technology. Ion had sales of
about 5 billion rupees in the year ended March, 2009. Its shares
have risen 32 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Critical Need&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Industrial water treatment and, equally important, waste
water treatment is a critical need,&#8221; Sandeep said. &#8220;Water is a
crucial raw material for most industries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel said in an e-mail it has expanded its transparency
and disclosure on water use and adopted a new water policy as
part of the Santa Clara, California-based company&#8217;s commitment
to responsible water management. Intel spokeswoman Susan Qian
declined to comment on the company&#8217;s water use in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for Beijing Enterprises Water rose more than
sixfold in 2009 from the previous 18 months after it bought a
sewage purification and treatment company in August 2008. More
than half the profit came from sewage treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, a unit of city government-controlled Beijing
Enterprises Holdings Ltd., had 47 sewage treatment plants and
four water supply factories across 13 Chinese provinces at the
end of 2009, and is building 20 more. The stock has doubled in a
year in Hong Kong, compared with an 11 percent rise in the Hang
Seng index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food and Water &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This decade belongs to food and water,&#8221; said Vijay
Bhambwani, CEO of online stock researcher Bsplindia.com. He
holds shares in Ion Exchange. &#8220;I am quite bullish on water
stocks. Next year onwards they will start outperforming the
market by a factor of two.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both China and India, fresh water reserves are unevenly
distributed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northern China, with cities including Beijing, the capital,
has less than a fifth of the country&#8217;s fresh water and almost
half the population, the World Bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Chinese leader Mao Zedong, who began trying to
address the water issue as early as the 1950s, conceived the
South-North Water Diversion Project to carry water along three
routes from the Yangtze River to the Yellow River. Construction
began in 2003 and has cost more than $5.8 billion so far. The
completion date has been pushed back four years to 2014 as costs
and environmental concerns mount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government proposals in India were no less ambitious.
Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2003 appointed a
panel to assess building a series of dams and canals that would
link rivers to control floods and curtail shortages. The 5-
trillion-rupee plan was shelved after protests from
environmentalists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian Conservation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, India has concentrated on conservation. The
government has made it mandatory for new houses and condominiums
in cities to collect rainwater in an effort to curb a decline in
groundwater levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Congress-led coalition is also implementing a six-year-
old plan to replenish about a million lakes, ponds and water
tanks. About 60 percent of India&#8217;s arable land still depends on
the annual monsoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Water availability has declined to such an extent that
many parts of India today face a drought-like situation,&#8221; said
Sushmita Sengupta, research associate at the Centre for Science
and Environment in New Delhi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two countries&#8217; plans don&#8217;t always mesh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tibet Dam &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When China dammed the Mekong, the largest river flowing
into Southeast Asia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos all
called for greater cooperation to prevent droughts and floods.
China also plans a dam in Tibet on the Yarlung Zangbo, the
highest major river in the world, which flows into India as the
Brahmaputra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project would give Beijing control of the water supply
to more than 90,000 square kilometers of land controlled by
India while China claims sovereignty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Water scarcity is probably one of the biggest risks for
investors in China and India,&#8221; said Lucy Carmody, executive
director of Singapore-based investor advisory firm Responsible
Research. &#8220;There is a lot of potential for border conflicts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anglo American Plc, the company that
controls the world&#8217;s biggest platinum producer, will probably
resume dividends in August after it sold assets to curb debt and
as metals prices increased, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo&#8217;s finances are in &#8220;a healthier position than we had
anticipated earlier this year,&#8221; Goldman analyst Peter Mallin- Jones wrote in a note yesterday. &#8220;This should allow the company
to restore its dividend at the interim results in August.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman added Anglo to its &#8220;conviction buy&#8221; list of
recommended companies from &#8220;neutral&#8221; previously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reuters/Jefferies index of commodity prices has risen
23 percent since Feb. 20, 2009, when Anglo suspended dividends.
The company agreed to sell zinc mines to Vedanta Resources Plc
for $1.34 billion and parts of its Tarmac unit for $400 million,
after disposing of $2.4 billion in assets last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper, nickel and iron ore projects should boost volumes
in 2011 and 2012, raising cash flow and allowing dividends to
&#8220;grow strongly,&#8221; Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo has gained 51 percent in the past year, the fourth-
best performer on the 15-member FTSE 350 Mining index. Xstrata
Plc rose 40 percent and BHP Billiton Ltd. 24 percent. Anglo fell
2.6 percent to 2,462.5 pence by the close of trade in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. plans to buy
$1.5 billion of Alliance  Leicester Plc mortgage-backed bonds,
according to three people with knowledge of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An affiliate of the New York-based bank, the second-biggest
U.S. lender by assets, will purchase the notes to be issued
through Alliance  Leicester&#8217;s Fosse Master Issuer Plc Series
2010-2 vehicle, said the people, who declined to be identified
before the sale is completed. The top-rated securities, backed
by prime U.K. residential mortgages, will also be offered to
other investors, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alliance  Leicester, a U.K. unit of Banco Santander SA,
Spain&#8217;s largest bank, will issue the notes in dollars, pounds
and euros, the people said. The bonds have a weighted average
life of 2.6 years and will be priced to yield about 140 basis
points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate,
or Libor, according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Frost, a London-based spokesman for Santander,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a phone call and e-mail seeking
comment.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also joined the deal as a joint lead manager
and bookrunner, alongside original leads Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, Citigroup Inc., Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and
Banco Santander. Barclays Capital is the sole arranger on the
deal, which is due to be priced on May 26 or 27, the people
said. &lt;/p&gt;

Marois and William Selway" date="May 25, 2010 11:46 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-25/ebay-s-whitman-hurt-in-california-governor-s-race-by-goldman-immigration.html"><headline>EBay's Whitman Battered by Goldman, Immigration as Lead Slides</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Meg Whitman, the former EBay Inc.
executive who&#8217;s seeking the Republican nomination to succeed
Arnold Schwarzenegger as California&#8217;s governor, has seen her
lead in polls evaporate over her ties to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and her stand on illegal immigration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitman, 53, has spent $68 million of her own money in the
race only to have her support among likely Republican voters
plunge 23 points since March in her race with state Insurance
Commissioner Steve Poizner, according to a poll by the Public
Policy Institute of California released May 19. Poizner, who was
paid $1 billion by Qualcomm Inc. for his cell-phone technology
company in 2000, has plowed $24 million of his own into the
Republican race. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s been hitting her pretty hard on two issues in
particular, Goldman Sachs and illegal immigration,&#8221; said Dan Schnur, a former Republican strategist who heads the Jesse M.
Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern
California in Los Angeles. &#8220;In different ways, both have hurt
her greatly with the party&#8217;s base. You&#8217;d still have to consider
her the favorite for the nomination, but it&#8217;s no longer a
foregone conclusion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The race narrowed as Poizner stepped up attacks, accusing
Whitman of profiting from pornography, supporting Barack Obama&#8217;s
immigration amnesty and failing to vote in past elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats Join &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Democrats poured money into the race,
highlighting Whitman&#8217;s position as a former director of Goldman
Sachs, the world&#8217;s most profitable investment bank, and
capitalizing on public anger over Wall Street&#8217;s role in a
recession that sent the state unemployment rate to 12.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve basically got the campaign of Steve Poizner and
the Democratic Central Committee doing everything they can to
prevent Meg Whitman from becoming the nominee,&#8221; said Allan Hoffenblum, a former Republican consultant who publishes books
on California political races. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats &#8220;don&#8217;t want Meg Whitman to be the nominee,&#8221;
Hoffenblum said. &#8220;They think they can beat Steve Poizner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From March through May, Whitman&#8217;s lead over Poizner slid
from 50 percentage points to 9, according to polls of 2,003
adult residents by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Public Policy
Institute, based in San Francisco. Whitman, EBay&#8217;s former chief
executive officer, held a 38 percent to 29 percent advantage
over Poizner in a survey taken from May 9 to May 16. That&#8217;s down
from 61 percent to 11 percent in March. One-third of likely
voters remain undecided, the institute found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitman&#8217;s early lead was a sign of her ability to use her
cash to develop name recognition with voters, said Barbara O&#8217;Connor, the director of the Institute for the Study of
Politics and Media at California State University, Sacramento.
Now, she said, Poizner&#8217;s &#8220;back from the dead.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising Blitz &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just two weeks before the election, Poizner and
Whitman have intensified advertising aimed at bolstering their
conservative credentials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poizner, 53, who&#8217;s made illegal immigration a central
issue, seized on Whitman&#8217;s statement that she opposes a new law
in Arizona that requires local police to determine the
immigration status of anyone suspected of being in the country
without proper documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poizner also accused Whitman of making money from
pornography because she ran EBay at a time when the online
auction site developed a porn and sex-paraphernalia business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s Meg Whitman: From Goldman Sachs deals to porn,
it&#8217;s all about the money,&#8221; says a voice in one of Poizner&#8217;s
television ads. &#8220;Meg Whitman -- bad judgment, wrong values.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance Commissioner &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitman, a first-time candidate, says Poizner failed to
roll back the size of government during his time as state
insurance commissioner. She also said he flip-flopped on support
of California&#8217;s landmark global-warming law that business groups
say will push companies and jobs out of the state. Poizner
voiced support for the law in 2006, though he now says he
supports a ballot measure to suspend it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve aggressively defined him as a liberal and using his
own record against him,&#8221; Rob Stutzman, a Whitman adviser.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve been very focused in defining Meg as the fiscal
conservative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitman wasn&#8217;t available for an interview yesterday, said
her press secretary, Sarah Pompei. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Poizner campaign is seeking to capture anti-
establishment sentiment to topple Whitman, whose supporters
include former Governor Pete Wilson and ex-Vice President Dick Cheney, said Jarrod Agen, a spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Striking Distance&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re in striking distance now,&#8221; Agen said. &#8220;The last
two weeks will really decide this thing.&#8221; Agen said Poizer
wasn&#8217;t available for an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poll released today by SurveyUSA shows Whitman may have
regained momentum. In a survey of 612 likely voters from May 21
through May 23, Whitman leads Poizner 54 percent to 27 percent.
When the same poll was conducted two weeks ago, Whitman was
ahead by only 2 percentage points. The results have a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contest contrasts with the Democratic primary, in which
Attorney General Jerry Brown, 72, is running for the governor&#8217;s
nomination without serious opposition. That&#8217;s left Brown, who
was governor from 1975 to 1983, unscathed as he heads toward the
general election in a state where Democrats overshadow
Republicans, 45 percent to 31 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of mid-March, Brown had $14 million on hand for the
general election, records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California&#8217;s election battle follows the worst fiscal
crisis since the Great Depression, which led Schwarzenegger and
lawmakers to raise taxes and slash spending on schools and
health care. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, can&#8217;t run again
because of term limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legislators are now struggling to erase a $19 billion
budget deficit through June 2011, a gap that threatens to drain
California of its cash and has left it with the lowest credit
rating among U.S. states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern Among Republicans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s concern in Republican circles -- and delight among
Democrats -- that the primary election may alienate Latino
voters and leave either victor tarnished, said Hoffenblum, the
former Republican consultant. That could pave the way for
Brown&#8217;s victory, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For a Republican to win statewide in California it&#8217;s
always an upset -- this is a Democratic seat,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For a
Republican to win, they have to have a superior candidate, a
superior campaign, and it has to be adequately financed. You
don&#8217;t get elected statewide in California by bashing immigrants,
illegal or otherwise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp.
and trade groups for major U.S. companies are pressing Congress
to defeat a jobs bill containing billions of dollars in taxes on
their global operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort is led in part by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
and an alliance of companies including IBM, Microsoft Corp. and
General Electric Co. They are targeting a measure that extends
aid to unemployed workers, promotes bonds for infrastructure
projects and renews more than three-dozen business tax breaks,
including a credit for experimental research that many of the
companies support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter to lawmakers yesterday, Armonk, New York-based
IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, told
lawmakers it &#8220;strongly opposes&#8221; the legislation and would
rather do without the research credit than face new taxes on
overseas profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although our company has been a long-time supporter of
the RD tax credit that has enjoyed bipartisan support in
Congress over many years, the pending legislation would impose
significant new tax increases that will completely overwhelm any
positive economic effect&#8221; of the tax credit, wrote Christopher Padilla, vice president of governmental programs for IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No &#8216;Meaningful Benefit&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM reduced its effective tax rate by 9 percentage points
in 2009 because it was able to defer U.S. taxes on money earned
in lower-tax countries, according to filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The value of its research tax credits
wasn&#8217;t specified. IBM, in a June 2008 policy document, said it
has been &#8220;unable to derive meaningful benefit&#8221; from the
research credit for &#8220;many years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition from major U.S.-based multinational corporations
injects a new lobbying front into an effort to defeat the bill,
which has been opposed most prominently by private-equity firms
such as New York-based Blackstone Group LP and Washington-based
Carlyle Group, the National Venture Capital Association and the
Real Estate Roundtable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those groups are trying to block a proposed tax increase on
carried interest, the share of profits that fund executives earn
as part of their compensation. Carried interest is taxed at the
lower capital-gains rate when it involves long-term gains. That
rate is currently 15 percent and is scheduled to rise to 20
percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinary Rates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill would begin taxing half of carried interest at
ordinary rates as high as 35 percent this year. By 2013, three-
quarters of carried interest would be subject to ordinary rates,
which are scheduled to be more than 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM and the business groups are protesting eight provisions
in the bill projected to raise about $14.5 billion by making it
harder for U.S.-based companies to claim credits for taxes they
pay to other governments. The tax credits are intended to
prevent double taxation and can only be claimed when those
foreign profits are repatriated to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers, including House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat, say companies are
using a variety of techniques to reduce their U.S. tax bills
without ever bringing their profits to the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &#8220;have used techniques to maximize the amount of money
they leave overseas at the same time they&#8217;re claiming&#8221; the
foreign tax credit &#8220;to avoid U.S. taxes on other income
sources,&#8221; Levin told reporters on a conference call today. He
called the technique a &#8220;manipulation of the tax code&#8221; that is
&#8220;tilting the playing field in favor of investment overseas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government Spending &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill also faces some opposition in the Senate because
it would add to the deficit. It would spend $63 billion to
postpone cuts in Medicare fees to doctors, $55 billion to extend
unemployment benefits and $24 billion to aid state governments.
Lawyers, oil companies and businesses that use offshore tax
havens would see their taxes go up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House is scheduled to debate the broader tax measure
this week, and the Senate is poised to act too. Lawmakers are
under pressure to adopt the bill because the unemployment aid
expires May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, on
the conference call with Levin, wouldn&#8217;t say how soon the bill
will come to the floor. &#8220;I&#8217;m confident that we will have the
votes&#8221; to pass it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition to international tax provisions are complicating
the effort to pass more than three-dozen tax breaks that have
been popular with lawmakers in the past, even as they were
criticized for bestowing narrow benefits on special interests
including race track owners, makers of toy bows and arrows,
restaurant operators, and tuna canners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build America Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package would also extend the Build America Bonds
program and renew a provision that benefits companies such as
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE and New York-based Citigroup
Inc. that sell financial products in overseas markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax breaks, which generally expired Dec. 31 and must be
renewed to be available this year, also include benefits for
individuals, such as a $250 deduction for teachers who buy their
own classroom supplies and a write-off for state and local sales
taxes that primarily benefits residents of states like Texas,
Alaska and Florida, which have no income taxes to deduct on
federal forms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the economy needs an extension of expiring
provisions, the chamber cannot support legislation which imposes
onerous, permanent tax increases to pay for the temporary
extension of these provisions,&#8221; wrote Bruce Josten, executive
vice president of government affairs for the Chamber of
Commerce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Principles of Fairness&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate coalition, Promote America&#8217;s Competitive Edge,
which counts GE; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft; Peoria,
Illinois-based Caterpillar Inc., and Cincinnati-based Procter 
Gamble Co. among its members, also protested the bill, saying
the international tax changes &#8220;run contrary to the principles
of fairness and due process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Association of Manufacturers, a Washington
trade group, today urged lawmakers to strip the international
tax provisions from the bill. It said the way companies use the
foreign tax credit has been &#8220;mischaracterized as loopholes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;NAM strongly urges policymakers to advance legislation
that includes much-needed tax relief without anti-growth, anti-
competitiveness revenue raisers,&#8221; the group wrote to House
members. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. hired Achintya Mangla and Aloke Gupte back from Merrill Lynch  Co., about a
month after they departed for the U.S. rival, said two people
with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mangla will become co-head of equity capital and
derivatives markets for Asia outside Japan and Australia
together with Arjun Khullar, one of the people said, declining
to be identified as no public announcement has been made. Gupte
will run convertible bond underwriting for the Asia-Pacific
region, the position Mangla previously held, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks have stepped up hiring in Asia in the past
year as the region led the global economy out of a recession.
Investment-banking fees in Asia jumped 68 percent in the first
four months from a year earlier to a record $5.6 billion,
according to New York-based research firm Freeman  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mangla and Khullar will report to Doug Howland and Kester Ng, who were promoted to joint heads of equity capital and
derivatives markets for Asia-Pacific, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Hong Kong-based spokeswoman Marie Cheung
declined to comment, as did Rob Stewart of Merrill Lynch, the
investment-banking division of Bank of America Corp. Mangla and
Gupte weren&#8217;t available, said a person who answered the phone at
JPMorgan&#8217;s Hong Kong offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch hired Mangla in late April to run its
convertible bond underwriting business in the Asia-Pacific
outside Japan, people with knowledge of the matter said at the
time. Gupte joined Merrill Lynch at the same time. Both bankers
were on so-called gardening leave and hadn&#8217;t yet started work at
Merrill Lynch when JPMorgan rehired them, one person said. They
will be based in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anglo American Plc, which controls

&lt;p&gt;The brokerage lifted its recommendation from &#8220;neutral,&#8221;
citing exposure to commodities for which it expects &#8220;prices to
generally remain well above mid-cycle levels over the next three
years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also raised its stance on Nyrstar NV, the

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall
Street&#8217;s most profitable firm, sold $1.25 billion of 10-year
senior notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6 percent fixed-rate debt priced to yield 280 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale came as companies sold $6 billion in debt today,
the most in five weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Issuance of corporate bonds has fallen 59 percent this month
from April amid growing concerns that European countries will
struggle to manage their debts, slowing the global economic
recovery, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman is pretty good at timing the market when these
chances open up,&#8221; said Charles Sanford, who helps manage $129
billion at Babson Capital Management LLC in Springfield,
Massachusetts. &#8220;It was an opportunistic deal on Goldman&#8217;s
part.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid more to tap the corporate debt market
than it did two months ago, when it sold $750 million of 10-
year, 5.375 percent notes at a spread of 175 basis points on
March 19 in a reopening of an issue from earlier that month,
Bloomberg data show. It paid a 190 basis-point spread when it
sold $2 billion of the notes on March 1, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those notes traded at 95.862 cents on the dollar at 3:53
p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt
yields 5.94 percent, or 273.6 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, Trace data show. On May 25, the bonds ended
trading at a 276.1 basis-point spread, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Buying Opportunity&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think it&#8217;s a buying opportunity now,&#8221; said Michael Donelan, director of trading and head portfolio manager at Ryan
Labs Inc., who yesterday bought 10-year Goldman Sachs notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads on all investment-grade corporate bonds fell 2
basis points to 204 basis points, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch Corporate Master Index. Bonds issued by
banks fell 7 basis points to 276 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have demanded higher yields from the world&#8217;s
biggest financial institutions than other corporate bond issuers
because of concern that Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis will
reduce lenders&#8217; creditworthiness and that regulatory efforts to
control risk taking will crimp their profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $1.5 billion of 10-year notes sold
on March 25 rose 0.409 cent on the dollar to 100.263 cents at
3:30 p.m. in New York, according to Trace data. The notes yield
4.915 percent, or 171.6 basis points more than benchmarks, Trace
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies selling bonds today included TransCanada
Pipelines Ltd., which offered $1.25 billion of 5- and 30-year
notes, and Discovery Communications Inc., which issued $3
billion of debt in a three-part offering, according to Bloomberg
data. Today&#8217;s total is the most since $12.3 billion on April 21,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., the computer maker turned
mobile gadgeteer, overtook Microsoft Corp. to become the most
valuable technology company on optimism the company will keep
adding customers for its iPhone, Macintosh computer and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s market value reached $222.1 billion, surpassing
Microsoft&#8217;s $219.2 billion at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading. That makes Apple the most valuable
technology firm in the world. It&#8217;s also the second-largest U.S.
stock by market value, behind oil company Exxon Mobil Corp.,
valued at $278.6 billion on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a 16 percent gain this year, Apple&#8217;s stock climbed to
a high of $252.13 in intraday trading today. Chief Executive
Officer Steve Jobs last month said profit almost doubled and
sales soared 49 percent on demand for the iPhone. The results
don&#8217;t yet include the iPad, which went on sale after the close
of the quarter for the Cupertino, California-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apple really checks all the boxes when you look at the
tech sector,&#8221; said Ryan Jacob, a fund manager at Jacob Internet
Fund in Los Angeles, which has Apple as its top holding. &#8220;Do
they have the opportunity to gain share in their markets? What
are the prospects for margins? It&#8217;s hard to find a company that
you can have more confidence in than Apple.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value shift underscores the changing fortunes of two
technology industry pioneers. Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, has had mixed success expanding beyond its
mainstay Windows operating system business into new markets,
including mobile phones, Web search and gaming consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s Revamp &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, on the verge of bankruptcy when Jobs resumed
leadership in 1997, has transformed itself from the maker of
Macintosh personal computers into a consumer electronics
trendsetter with the release of the iPod music player in 2001,
the iPhone in 2007 and this year&#8217;s release of the iPad tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft slipped 4.1 percent to
$25.01 in Nasdaq trading. That marked the seventh straight day
of declines, the longest streak of losses since February 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In remarks to reporters in Singapore earlier, Microsoft
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said European financial
troubles &#8220;will not be isolated to Europe and have a ripple
impact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft has been extremely weak over the last month,
underperforming other technology stocks and that&#8217;s really
what&#8217;s moved Apple into the leading position in terms of market
cap,&#8221; Jacob said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPad Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs, 55, said Apple sold more than 1 million tablets in
the U.S. in the first 28 days after its April 3 debut and that
demand is outpacing supply. The iPad goes on sale outside the
U.S., including in the U.K., France, Germany, Canada and Japan,
on May 28. Jobs, who will give the keynote speech at Apple&#8217;s
Worldwide Developer&#8217;s Conference, is expected to introduce a new
iPhone at the event, according to analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said last month third-quarter sales rose 6.3
percent to $14.5 billion, below the most optimistic estimates.
While both profit and sales exceeded the average estimate of
analysts in a Bloomberg survey, some investors held out for
larger gains, said Dave Stepherson, a fund manager at Hardesty
Capital Management in Baltimore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unearned revenue, a measure of multiyear contracts, also
fell short of some estimates, a sign business demand for
Microsoft products may not be picking up as quickly as some
analysts had predicted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy will expand up to 4
percent annually for a &#8220;couple of years&#8221; and then settle into
a predicted &#8220;new normal&#8221; of slow growth, according to Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Kasman said that while he agrees with
Pacific Investment Management Co.&#8217;s new-normal concept, the
economy may be initially buoyant. Pimco Chief Executive Officer
Mohamed A. El-Erian has forecast the worst slump since the Great
Depression will be followed by an environment of below-average
economic expansion, increased regulation and lower consumption
amid higher unemployment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are buyers of the idea that there is a new normal in
terms of where unemployment rates are going to be, what the
supply side of the U.S. economy&#8217;s going to deliver,&#8221; Kasman
said in a Bloomberg Radio interview today with Tom Keene. &#8220;Our
distinction is we can see a lot of reasons to be pessimistic
about structural performance here in medium-term trends and
still see a couple of years of pretty good growth, 3 to 4
percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newport Beach, California-based El-Erian wrote in a
Bloomberg News column in February that the U.S. economy faces a
&#8220;protracted post-crisis resetting&#8221; as high unemployment
persists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasman, a former researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, correctly predicted January&#8217;s unexpectedly strong 5.7
percent gain in GDP. JPMorgan forecasts GDP growth for the
second and third quarters to be 4 percent, slowing to 3.5
percent in the fourth quarter and to 3.2 percent for 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The new-normal thesis makes sense in terms of what&#8217;s
happening underneath the surface, but I don&#8217;t think you want to
apply it to GDP and production and labor income data in a world
in which there&#8217;s going to be a cyclical lift that carries us for
a while,&#8221; Kasman said. &lt;/p&gt;

America&#8217;s biggest bourse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs clients will be able to trade electronically

&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc named Martin Mackay
to lead research and development, hiring a Pfizer Inc. executive
for the second time this year as the U.K. drugmaker seeks to
replace revenue it&#8217;s losing to generic competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mackay, a native of Scotland, starts at AstraZeneca July 1,
the company said in a statement today. He ran global research at
New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, and had
been overseeing the combination of Pfizer&#8217;s laboratories with
those of Wyeth after Pfizer bought the company for $68 billion
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At AstraZeneca, he will be charged with helping Chief
Executive Officer David Brennan meet his goal of introducing at
least two new products annually. The London-based company faces
threats from generic drugs to seven products by 2014, including
three of its biggest sellers. The company said in January it
needs $4 billion to $6 billion of revenue from new treatments to
reach its 2014 sales target of $28 billion to $34 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s an organization that&#8217;s turning the corner so he&#8217;ll
be beholden to Astra to get the drugs onto the market,&#8221; Gbola
Amusa, an analyst at UBS AG, said in a telephone interview. 
&#8220;If it were me I would be more willing to come to a company with
interesting assets than non-interesting assets, so this looks
like a positive&#8221; endorsement of AstraZeneca&#8217;s pipeline, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Team &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mackay will report to Brennan and will be a member of the
company&#8217;s senior executive team, AstraZeneca said. John
Patterson, the former head of research, retired in early 2009
and Jan Lundberg, head of early-stage drug development, left for
Eli Lilly  Co. last year. AstraZeneca in March hired Pfizer&#8217;s
Menelas Pangalos to replace Lundberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brennan has said as many as five new products may reach the
market this year including the Brilinta anti-clotting agent and
Vimivo for pain. The company&#8217;s promising experimental projects
include dapagliflozin for diabetes and olaparib, which belongs
to an emerging new class of cancer treatments, according to
Amusa, the UBS analyst, who recommends buying the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mackay, who was named Pfizer&#8217;s head of research almost
three years ago, shared the role with Mikael Dolsten, the former
head of research at Wyeth, following the acquisition. Mackay
oversaw pharmaceutical research and Dolsten was in charge of
biotechnology. Dolsten will replace Mackay, Pfizer said in a
separate statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has had research setbacks in the past year, with its
experimental Alzheimer&#8217;s drug Dimebon and its cancer treatments
Sutent and figitumumab failing to provide a benefit in studies.
Pfizer&#8217;s research labs haven&#8217;t generated enough new products to
overcome the $11 billion in revenue the company will start
losing when generic copies of its top-selling Lipitor
cholesterol pill come on the market next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer&#8217;s RD hasn&#8217;t lit the world on fire and whether
that is the fault of Mackay or not is up to debate,&#8221; said Les Funtleyder, an analyst with Miller Tabak  Co. in New York. His
departure &#8220;isn&#8217;t a surprise because there has been a lack of
progress at Pfizer and where there is a lack of progress people
make changes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ArcelorMittal, the world&#8217;s largest
steelmaker, was added to the &#8220;conviction buy&#8221; list at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., which said the company&#8217;s geographical reach
makes it &#8220;relatively immune to euro weakness.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArcelorMittal&#8217;s businesses give it a broader geographical
spread of cash flows, which &#8220;limit its potential downside
substantially,&#8221; Goldman analyst Peter Mallin-Jones wrote in a
note today. &#8220;The recent sell-off makes ArcelorMittal a strong
value proposition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman raised its recommendation on the Luxembourg-based
company to &#8220;conviction buy&#8221; from &#8220;buy&#8221; and maintained its
12-month target price at 48 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArcelorMittal rose as much as 6.8 percent to 24.72 euros in
Amsterdam trading and was at 24.60 euros as of 3:53 p.m. local
time, the steepest gain since May 10. The stock has slumped 24
percent since the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PTC India Financial Services Ltd., a
company backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Macquarie Group
Ltd., is planning a share sale to tap growing investor interest
in the South Asian nation&#8217;s power projects, the chairman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PFS, which invests in electricity generation plants and
assets, needs to raise as much as 10 billion rupees ($211
million) and may make an initial public offering by end
September, said Tantra Narayan Thakur, who is also chairman of
parent company PTC India Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today is the best time to invest in the Indian power
market,&#8221; Thakur said in an interview in New Delhi. &#8220;More and
more people want electricity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India plans to double its installed electricity capacity in
the next seven years to meet energy demand and reduce blackouts
in the world&#8217;s second-fastest growing major economy. The federal
government has raised at least 102 billion rupees from selling
shares in three state-owned power-related companies since
January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PFS may sell a stake to a private equity investor before
the IPO, said Thakur. JM Financial Ltd., SBI Capital Markets Ltd.
and ICICI Securities Ltd. will advise the sale, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PTC, India&#8217;s largest power trader, has a 77 percent stake
in PFS and plans to retain a 51 percent holding after the sale,
Thakur said. Goldman Sachs and Macquarie currently hold 11.5
percent each, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashmore Fund &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks paid 16 rupees a share for their holdings in 2008,
he said. Macquarie spokesman Paul Scanlon said in an e-mail the
company had no comment. Deepa Jayaraman, a New Delhi-based
spokeswoman at IPAN Hill  Knowlton, which handles public
relations for Goldman Sachs, was unable to respond immediately
to an e-mail requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PTC India is setting up a $1 billion fund with the U.K.-
based Ashmore Group Plc to finance electricity generation
projects in India, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PTC and Ashmore aim to raise $500 million in the first
round by the end of September that will be invested in eight to
10 thermal and hydropower projects in the pipeline, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund plans to make minimum investments of $25 million
each, mostly in power projects and potentially in energy assets
such as gas import terminals and pipelines, Thakur said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PTC may spend up to 3 billion rupees to acquire coal assets
abroad as part of an effort to diversify into fuel sources,
Thakur said. The power trader raised $400 million by selling
shares to institutional investors in January 2008 and May 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government sold stakes in Rural Electrification Corp.,
a state-owned lender for power projects, NTPC Ltd., the
country&#8217;s biggest power generator, and SJVN Ltd., operator of
India&#8217;s largest hydropower plant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexican President Felipe Calderon
said he &#8220;regrets&#8221; a Canadian decision last year to require
Mexicans to obtain visas before visiting the country, which has
lowered visits to Canada by 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I cannot fail to convey to you our regret,&#8221; Calderon
told lawmakers in Ottawa during an address to Parliament. &#8220;I
reiterate to you our full willingness to work with the Canadian
government so that this temporary measure can be put behind
us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada last year started requiring visas for Mexicans
visiting the country after a surge in refugee claims from Mexico
made it the biggest source of requests for Canada. The number of
Mexicans seeking refugee status in Canada rose to 9,533 in 2008,
from 1,114 in 1999, according to Citizenship and Immigration
Canada data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immigration Minister Jason Kenney in March proposed reforms
to the Canadian system that aim to speed up the process by which
refugee claims are dealt with and make it easier to expel people
who have been rejected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We sincerely hope that the solution that this Parliament
is studying through comprehensive amendments to the refugee law
will also serve as a bridge that will allow us to renew our
exchanges,&#8221; Calderon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refugee Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Stephen Harper, whose Conservatives hold a
minority of seats in the lower house and who needs support from
opposition lawmakers to amend the immigration system, reiterated
today the problem lies not with Mexican policies, but with the
way false refugee claims are dealt with in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Toronto, speaking to a Canadian business audience later
in the day, Calderon pitched Mexico as an attractive place for
investment, citing cuts in import tariffs, reforms of the
judicial system and banking and telecommunications industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calderon said security is improving as a result of a
crackdown on drug producers in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He blamed growth of the drug trade on demand in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our neighbor is the largest consumer of drugs in the
world,&#8221; Calderon said, referring to the U.S. &#8220;Everyone wants
to sell the drugs through our door.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government crackdown is succeeding, he said, citing the
seizure of $2.5 billion in cash from drug producers in one
instance and 45,000 assault weapons in another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re kicking them, the criminals, and we&#8217;re kicking them
hard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We will win this battle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., the
world&#8217;s biggest payment networks, may raise antitrust concerns
if they &#8220;collude&#8221; with larger banks to block limits on debit-
card interchange fees and &#8220;frighten&#8221; small banks into joining
the opposition, U.S. Senator Richard Durbin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If your companies were to coordinate such punitive
actions in the same way that you appear to have coordinated your
messaging tactics, serious concerns would be raised that you are
engaging in an unlawful restraint of trade,&#8221; Durbin, the
Illinois Democrat and majority whip, said today in a letter to
the chief executive officers of San Francisco-based Visa and
Purchase, New York-based MasterCard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durbin is pushing legislation that empowers the Federal
Reserve to impose limits on debit-card interchange or &#8220;swipe&#8221;
fees that merchants pay to accept the cards. Curbing the fees,
which average about 1 percent per transaction, could crimp
revenue at Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo  Co. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. debit-card issuers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate voted 64-33 to approve the measure as part of
the financial overhaul bill. The proposal becomes law if it
survives a bipartisan panel assigned to merge the House and
Senate versions of the legislation, and President Barack Obama
signs it. Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat
nominated to participate in the talks, said she expects changes
in Durbin&#8217;s proposal, without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock Reaction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, which had climbed 2.4 percent today in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, erased most of its gains and
finished with a gain of 29 cents to $73.69. MasterCard increased
$2.80, or 1.4 percent, to $207.80. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two firms are saying they may alter network operating
rules and swipe fees for small banks to &#8220;frighten&#8221; them into
opposing the legislation, Durbin said. &#8220;I warn you&#8221; that such
changes might be seen as restraining trade, Durbin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry groups representing community banks and credit
unions said Durbin&#8217;s exemption for banks with assets of less
than $10 billion failed to win their support because it would
make their debit cards more expensive for merchants compared
with those issued by the biggest lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Community banks don&#8217;t need Visa or MasterCard to help them
recognize the harm this amendment will cause to their
institutions and their customers,&#8221; said Jason Kratovil, a vice
president at the Washington-based Independent Community Bankers
Association of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fee Levels &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard could lower interchange rates for all
banks to levels that prompt credit unions and community lenders
to &#8220;re-evaluate&#8221; their ability to issue debit cards, the ICBA
and the Credit Union National Association said in a May 12
letter to senators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This opposition appears to be based on community banks&#8217;
and credit unions&#8217; recognition that the Durbin amendment would
turn the economics of the entire payment system on its head with
negative consequences for all participants, including
consumers,&#8221; MasterCard said today in an e-mailed statement from
spokesman James Issokson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Association of Federal Credit Unions hasn&#8217;t
been threatened by Visa and MasterCard and is &#8220;not aware&#8221; of
any threats to its members,&#8221; Fred Becker, the group&#8217;s
president, said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail Stores &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The interchange provision will do nothing but add to the
bottom line of big-box stores and giant retailers -- all at the
expense of consumers and small financial institutions,&#8221; Becker
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa spokeswoman Denise Dunckel had no comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durbin, in his letter to Visa CEOJoseph W. Saunders and
MasterCard chief Robert W. Selander, sought a pledge from both
companies that they wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;take steps to purposely
disadvantage small issuers&#8221; if his amendment becomes law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Nebraska Treasurer Shane Osborn wrote to
lawmakers saying that curbs on debit-card fees could increase
costs to taxpayers and harm citizens who receive benefits on
prepaid cards. The letter contains a passage almost identical to
one on Visa&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve researched this significantly to try and go out and
get information on what&#8217;s going on as this thing changes, so we
use all types of resources,&#8221; Osborn said in an interview today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Wyeth unit lost a bid
at Canada&#8217;s highest court to block a lawsuit that alleges the
menopause drug Premarin caused breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of Canada today declined to hear Wyeth&#8217;s
appeal of a British Columbia decision denying the company&#8217;s
claim that its U.S. units couldn&#8217;t be sued in the province. The
high court gave no reason for its decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling clears the way for the suit to proceed to a
certification hearing in December, where plaintiff Dianna
Stanway will ask a judge to let all Canadian women who took
Wyeth&#8217;s hormone-replacement medicines sue as a group, said David
Klein, Stanway&#8217;s lawyer at Klein Lyons in Vancouver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;About nine out of 10 pharmaceutical lawsuits in Canada
are certified,&#8221; Klein said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth&#8217;s U.S. and Canadian units were sued in 2006 by
Stanway, of Sechelt, British Columbia. Stanway claimed she
developed breast cancer as a result of taking estrogen-based
Premarin in combination with the drug progestin. Wyeth&#8217;s U.S.
units urged the appeals court to throw out the suit, claiming
British Columbia courts lacked jurisdiction to try the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth sold and promoted the drug in Canada and its
&#8220;conduct amounts to personal subjection to the jurisdiction,&#8221;
Judge Kenneth Smith wrote on behalf of the appeals panel. &#8220;It
was therefore reasonable for them to contemplate they might be
sued in British Columbia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Acted Responsibly&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court ruling was procedural and not a decision
on the merits of the case, said Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to believe Wyeth acted responsibly by
conducting or supporting more than 180 studies on hormone
therapy&#8217;s benefits and risks,&#8221; Loder said. The company
&#8220;provided proper, accurate and science-based information to
patients and doctors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the menopause
medicines. New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker,
completed its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian suit won&#8217;t include women who took menopause
drugs that weren&#8217;t made by Wyeth, which had the biggest market
share in the country, or who suffered from other side effects,
Klein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case is about breast cancer,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wyeth Pharmaceuticals v. Dianna Louise Stanway,
33580, Supreme Court of Canada (Ottawa). The appeals court case
is Between Dianna Louise Stanway and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
CA036317, Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Vancouver). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. fell too far in a
selloff that pushed the software maker&#8217;s market value below
Apple Inc., according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, slumped 18 percent
in May through yesterday, when Apple of Cupertino, California,
was worth $2.94 billion more. Microsoft lost 4.1 percent
yesterday after Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said that
the effects of the European debt crisis will spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While European contagion is a concern, Ballmer&#8217;s comments
were not Microsoft specific,&#8221; Sarah Friar, an analyst at New
York-based Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report to clients dated
yesterday. &#8220;The shares underperformed large-cap tech despite
having relatively lower exposure outside of the U.S. Given
significant underperformance and attractive valuation levels, we
are buyers of the shares.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index had
retreated 11 percent this month through yesterday. Today,
Microsoft jumped 4 percent, the most since Oct. 23, to $26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Friar said that Microsoft&#8217;s fourth-quarter
earnings, scheduled for July 22, will show signs of improving
corporate demand for personal computers. On average, analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg estimate sales of $15.2 billion at the
world&#8217;s largest software maker, compared with $13.1 billion a
year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing Estimates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reported third-quarter revenue last month that

percent to $14.5 billion, compared with analysts&#8217; estimates that
were as high as $14.8 billion for the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft&#8217;s Windows business has benefited from
increased consumer demand for personal computers, corporations
have avoided purchases of machines and long-term contracts.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. lost a bid to have a
judge throw out a $9.4 million jury award to an Alabama woman
who developed breast cancer after taking the company&#8217;s menopause
drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state-court judge in Philadelphia denied requests by
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit to set aside the award to Audrey Singleton
or reduce the $6 million in punitive damages jurors awarded over
her use of the drugmaker&#8217;s hormone-replacement medicines.
Singleton&#8217;s lawyers alleged the company hid the drugs&#8217; health
risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge&#8217;s ruling &#8220;validates the jury system and confirms
that this community is outraged by Wyeth&#8217;s conduct,&#8221; Zoe Littlepage, one of Singleton&#8217;s lawyers, said in an interview
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women have taken hormone-replacement
medicines to treat menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, night
sweats and mood swings. Until 1995, many patients combined
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug made by Wyeth, with progestin-
laden Provera, made by another Pfizer unit. Wyeth combined the
two hormones in its Prempro medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we are disappointed in the trial court&#8217;s ruling, it
clears the way for the company to appeal this decision,&#8221; Pfizer
spokesman Chris Loder said today in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We
stand by our belief that there is no basis in fact or law for
the jury&#8217;s verdict.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the menopause
medicines, which are still on the market. New York-based Pfizer,
the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, completed its $68 billion
purchase of Wyeth last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litigation Record &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth has lost seven of the 11 Prempro cases that have been
considered by jurors since the cases began going to trial in
2006. The company has persuaded judges to throw out some of
those verdicts at the post-trial stage and reduce awards in
others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singleton, a retired school-bus driver from Chatom,
Alabama, began taking Prempro in August 1997. A mammogram at
that time was normal, her lawyers said during the trial. She
stopped taking the drug in January 2004 after her breast cancer
diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman&#8217;s lawyers argued in the case that Wyeth
executives hid or downplayed Prempro&#8217;s health risks as part of a
marketing campaign designed boost sales and put profits over
women&#8217;s health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual sales of Wyeth&#8217;s hormone-replacement drugs topped $2
billion before the 2002 Women&#8217;s Health Initiative study,
sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, suggested
women using the medicines had a higher breast-cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No New Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas concluded in
February Singleton deserved $3.45 million in compensatory
damages and $6 million in punishment damages over Wyeth&#8217;s
failure to properly warn about the drug&#8217;s risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker&#8217;s lawyers asked Judge Mark Bernstein to throw
out the verdict and grant Wyeth a new trial or to cut
Singleton&#8217;s damage award. Bernstein denied the company&#8217;s request
in a May 20 order that was made public yesterday, according to
court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s highest court today declined to hear Wyeth&#8217;s
appeal of a judge&#8217;s decision to allow a class-action case over
Premarin to proceed in that country&#8217;s courts. A group of
Canadian women are pressing claims that the drug helped cause
their breast cancers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia case is Singleton v. Wyeth Inc.,
050102885, Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County,
Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, may cut the monthly fee it charges for streaming
music on its Zune portable player, senior product manager Terry
Farrell said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zune Pass, which features unlimited music streaming and 10
song downloads a month, now costs $14.99. Farrell didn&#8217;t say by
how much Microsoft may cut the service&#8217;s price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a challenging business,&#8221; Farrell said,
referring to competition in online music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is contending with rivals that offer music at
little or no charge, while striving to erode Apple Inc.&#8217;s lead
in the market for digital music players and downloadable songs.
RealNetworks Inc.&#8217;s Rhapsody service in April slashed the
monthly price of a premium music service to $10 from $14.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zune had 2 percent of the U.S. digital music player market
in the first quarter, compared with 76 percent for Apple
products, according to NPD Group Inc., a Port Washington, New
York-based researcher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can access Microsoft&#8217;s download service on personal
computers and the company&#8217;s Zune players and Kin phones. The
company plans to offer the service on smartphones running its
Windows Phone 7 software later this year, Farrell said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may spend
$621 million to settle the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s
fraud suit that triggered a 13 percent one-day drop in the
firm&#8217;s stock, analyst Brad Hintz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations between the SEC and Wall Street&#8217;s most
profitable investment bank may end with Goldman Sachs paying a
fine of about $250 million, plus $371 million to reimburse
investors in the disputed trades, Hintz, an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co., wrote in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While this would be painful to Goldman, we believe it
would allow both Goldman Sachs and the SEC to walk away
declaring &#8216;victory&#8217;,&#8221; said Hintz, who has had an &#8220;outperform&#8221;
rating on the stock since June 2009. &#8220;Certainly Goldman wants
this case settled. Its management has stated that it wants a
&#8217;normal&#8217; relationship with its regulators.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount could reduce the New York-based firm&#8217;s earnings
per share by $1.05, or 5.4 percent of 2010 earnings, which are
estimated to be $19.55, according to the average estimate of
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs slumped on April 16 when the SEC accused
Goldman Sachs of defrauding investors in a collateralized debt
obligation linked to home loans. The firm concealed the fact
that Paulson  Co., a New York-based hedge fund, picked
components of the CDO and bet it would collapse, the agency
said. The bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein,
55, has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Nester and Goldman Sachs spokesman
Michael Duvally declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sued
JPMorgan Chase  Co. to recover tens of billions of dollars in
&#8220;lost value,&#8221; accusing the bank of precipitating its downfall
and preventing it from winding down in an orderly fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which was Lehman&#8217;s main short-term lender before
its September 2008 bankruptcy, helped cause the failure by
demanding $8.6 billion of collateral as credit markets tightened
during the financial crisis, Lehman said in a complaint filed
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the brink of LBHI&#8217;s bankruptcy, JPMorgan leveraged its
life and death power as the brokerage firm&#8217;s primary clearing
bank to force LBHI into a series of one-sided agreements and to
siphon billions of dollars in critically needed assets,&#8221; Lehman
said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, once the fourth-biggest investment bank, has said
it may spend another five years selling assets to pay unsecured
creditors as little as 14.7 cents on the dollar. Any money
recovered through lawsuits may increase the payout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lawsuit is ill conceived, and the costly litigation
will cause a further drain on the limited resources available to
the Lehman bankruptcy estate,&#8221; said Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan
spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit follows a report by Lehman examiner Anton
Valukas, who said in March that Lehman might have grounds for
suing JPMorgan and other banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman said JPMorgan&#8217;s top managers took advantage of
privileged information they gained as Lehman&#8217;s primary clearing
bank to &#8220;capitalize&#8221; on a Lehman bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chairman Jamie Dimon knew from meetings in
Washington with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and former
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that the U.S. wouldn&#8217;t
rescue Lehman and decided to &#8220;accelerate&#8221; the bank&#8217;s efforts
to gain more collateral from Lehman, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan gained extra collateral from Lehman in part by
threatening to stop providing clearing services that were the
&#8220;lifeblood&#8221; of the Lehman brokerage and other affiliates,
according to the lawsuit. Lehman said JPMorgan put a &#8220;financial
gun&#8221; to its head and gave the already insolvent investment bank
nothing in return for the collateral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the examiner&#8217;s report makes clear, it was the ill-
advised decisions of Lehman itself and its principals to take on
perilous leverage and to double down on subprime mortgages and
overpriced commercial real estate, and not any conduct by
JPMorgan, that led to Lehman&#8217;s demise and the enormous losses to
its various constituents,&#8221; Evangelisti said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP to Appoint Independent Mediator for Claims Process &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc said it will appoint an independent mediator to
review and assist in the claims-payment process for damages
caused by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP will &#8220;promptly&#8221; pay legitimate claims for loss and
damage caused by the spill resulting from the sinking of the
Deepwater Horizon drilling rig off the Louisiana coast last
month, the company said in an e-mailed statement, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are absolutely committed to a simple, fair claims
process that gets funds to people who have been hurt by this
disaster as quickly as possible,&#8221; Tony Hayward, BP&#8217;s chief
executive, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, more than 26,000 claims have been submitted,
resulting in payments of more than $36 million, BP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These claims are separate from the more than 130 lawsuits
that have been filed across the Gulf Coast on behalf of
thousands of commercial fishermen, property owners and coastal
business-owners claiming damage from the drifting oil. Lawyers
packed into New Orleans federal court last week to ask a U.S.
judge to appoint a special master to oversee problems that had
developed with BP&#8217;s claims process. Lawyers for BP urged the
judge not to intervene and to give the process a chance to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The claims process is designed to be free of judges and
lawyers,&#8221; BP&#8217;s lawyer Don Haycraft told U.S. District Judge
Carl Barbier at the hearing. &#8220;We need to give the process a
little more time to let the dust settle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbier ordered BP and lawyers for spill victims to return
for another hearing on the matter in his New Orleans courtroom
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP has established more than 400 claims centers across the
Gulf Coast to assist individuals damaged by the spill, according
to the company. Victims can also submit claims through BP&#8217;s
website and through a toll free number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for spill victims complained BP&#8217;s claims-payment
process wasn&#8217;t working as designed. They told Barbier last week
that fishermen and business owners suffering severe economic
effects from the spill were being given confusing and
conflicting instructions by BP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judge Refuses to Delay Oil Spill Lawsuit Against BP &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Alabama federal judge denied BP Plc&#8217;s request to stay
one of more than 130 lawsuits brought by fishermen, property
owners and coastal businesses harmed by the Gulf of Mexico oil
spill until a judicial panel decides whether to combine the
cases into a single multidistrict proceeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an order handed down late yesterday, Chief U.S. District
Judge William H. Steele of Alabama called BP&#8217;s request to halt
the litigation &#8220;premature.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no reason why this action cannot move forward
with preliminary steps&#8221; before the judicial panel acts on BP&#8217;s
request to combine all oil spill litigation into one massive
case at a hearing in July, Steele said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Entering a stay at this juncture and under these
circumstances would not rescue defendants from material hardship
or the risk of inconsistent adjudications, after all, they must
answer the complaint anyway,&#8221; Steele ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP has filed motions in courts across five Gulf Coast
states seeking to stay litigation resulting from the growing oil
spill, caused by the explosion and sinking of the Deepwater
Horizon off the coast of Louisiana last month. BP, as owner of
the offshore lease where the damaged well is located, has
primary responsibility for claims from people and businesses
harmed by the drifting oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Billy&#8217;s Seafood Inc. v. Transocean et al, 1:10-
cv-00215, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miami Beach Hotel Developers Indicted on Tax Charges &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Miami Beach hotel developers were charged with hiding
more than $150 million in assets from the Internal Revenue
Service, including real estate, luxury cars and a helicopter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors in an indictment released yesterday expanded
charges against Mauricio Cohen Assor, 76, and his son Leon Cohen
Levy, 46, who have been in custody since their April 15 arrest.
They face as long as 14 years in prison if convicted of
conspiracy and filing false tax returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment by a grand jury in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,
accuses them of failing to declare a $45 million investment
portfolio, $55 million in commercial properties in Miami Beach,
homes in New York and Florida, and cars including a Rolls-Royce
Phantom, a Porsche Carrera GT and Ferrari Testarossa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohen Assor and Cohen Levy placed &#8220;personal residences and
luxury vehicles in the name of shell companies and nominees to
conceal the defendants&#8217; ownership and control of assets and
income from the IRS,&#8221; according to the seven-count defendant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohen Assor, a Spanish citizen, developed high-end hotels
under the name Flatotel International in Paris, Brussels, the
French Riviera and Marbella, Spain. Cohen Levy, a computer
software developer, worked with his father in real estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men have been involved in extensive litigation with CDR
Creances SA, a company set up by the French government to sell
unprofitable businesses of Credit Lyonnais SA, over the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attorney for the men, Michael Pasano of the law firm
Carlton Fields in Miami, denied the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government indictment merely retells the same story
CDR Bank has been trying to sell for years,&#8221; Pasano said in an
e-mailed statement. &#8220;That story is not accurate and we look
forward to demonstrating the Cohens&#8217; innocence in court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v. Assor, 10-cr-60159, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prosecutors Will Drop AIG Financial Unit Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. prosecutors are dropping their investigation into
American International Group Inc.&#8217;s financial-products unit less
than a week after the U.S. Department of Justice closed a
similar probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have carried out a thorough review of the issues
relevant to the U.K. and this has not revealed any criminal
charges we could bring,&#8221; Serious Fraud Office spokesman Sam
Jaffa said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department last week decided to end its two-
year investigation into Joseph Cassano, the former chief
executive officer of AIG&#8217;s Financial Products division, because
there was insufficient evidence, a person familiar with the
investigation said. The unit brought the company to the verge of
collapse in 2008 with bad bets on credit-default swaps, forcing
the U.S. government to bail out the insurer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators were examining comments made in 2007 by
Cassano and other AIG executives to determine whether executives
misrepresented the value of AIG&#8217;s portfolio of &#8220;super senior&#8221;
credit-default swaps, which insured bond losses tied to the U.S.
housing market. The SFO opened its investigation into the unit
in February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to drop the AIG probe wasn&#8217;t related to U.S.
prosecutors&#8217; move to end their investigation, Jaffa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassano, who was based in London and Connecticut, stepped
down as president and CEO of the financial products unit in
2008, a day after AIG posted what was then its biggest quarterly
loss, writing down $11.1 billion on swaps the unit managed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We welcome the Serious Fraud Office&#8217;s decision, and we
continue to cooperate with other authorities on their assessment
of these events as we focus on strengthening our businesses and
repaying American taxpayers,&#8221; AIG spokesman Mark Herr said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesian Supreme Court Backs Bumi Unit in Tax Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia&#8217;s Supreme Court rejected a government appeal
against a lower court ruling that denied preliminary evidence in
a tax investigation of PT Kaltim Prima Coal, or KPC, a unit of
coal producer PT Bumi Resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia&#8217;s tax office filed an appeal to the Supreme Court
on March 29, asking the country&#8217;s highest legal body to dismiss
a December 2009 ruling by the Jakarta-based tax court that
faulted the steps taken in getting the preliminary evidence
related to suspicions that KPC underreported its tax
obligations. A panel of three judges turned down that appeal on
May 24, the Supreme Court said in a statement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Directorate General of Taxation needs to obey the
ruling and halt the investigation against KPC,&#8221; Aji Wijaya, a
lawyer for the Bumi unit said in a text message yesterday,
adding KPC &#8220;didn&#8217;t carry out tax irregularities.&#8221; If the tax
office keeps probing, &#8220;it will further distress taxpayers,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was elected for a second
term last year in part because of successes fighting corruption
in state agencies and reforming the bureaucracy, including the
tax office. While Finance Minister Agus Martowardojo last week
promised further reforms, he said collecting tax shouldn&#8217;t only
mean chasing &#8220;tax evaders but also ensuring businesses can have
a healthy investment climate&#8221; to boost trust in the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither KPC nor the tax office has received a copy of the
ruling. Tax office spokesman Iqbal Alamsjah said because of
that, it was too early to comment and the office would only make
a response after receiving the copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Icahn Wins Dismissal of Delaware XO Stock Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire investor Carl Icahn won a dismissal of a
Delaware lawsuit over preferred stock of telecommunications
company XO Holdings Inc., while a parallel case in New York will
continue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XO shareholder Donald Hillenmeyer Jr. sued directors of the
Herndon, Virginia-based company, including Chairman Icahn,
seeking damages for XO after Icahn was issued $780 million in
Class B and Class C shares, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in duplicative proceedings,&#8221; Delaware
Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine Jr. told lawyers at a hearing in
Wilmington yesterday. &#8220;It&#8217;s injurious to investors to have
identical issues pending in multiple forums.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillenmeyer&#8217;s lawyers alleged that Icahn, as controlling
shareholder, used directors and officers &#8220;as puppets,&#8221;
according to an amended complaint filed in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Icahn employed his control of XO to carry out a series of
actions designed to benefit himself at the expense of the
company&#8221; and investors, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Board lawyers convinced Strine that a similar action filed
12 weeks before the Delaware case in Supreme Court of New York
by 9 percent stakeholder R2 Investments should take precedence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn wasn&#8217;t in his New York office and didn&#8217;t return a
call seeking comment on the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Delaware case is Donald J. Hillenmeyer Jr. v. Carl C.
Icahn, CA4749, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). The New
York case is R2 Investments LDC v. Carl Icahn, 601296-2009,

&lt;p&gt;Disney Assistant Accused of Plot to Sell Stock Tips Wins Bail &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Los Angeles federal judge granted $50,000 bail to an
assistant to Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s head of corporate communications
accused of leaking confidential stock tips about the
entertainment company&#8217;s earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonnie Hoxie, the assistant to Zenia Mucha, was ordered to
appear June 3 for a court hearing in New York, while her
boyfriend, Yonni Sebbag, was detained without bail. Federal
prosecutors in New York charged the pair yesterday with sending
letters in March to at least 33 investment companies including
hedge funds with offers to sell confidential information about
Burbank, California-based Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magistrate Judge Patrick J. Walsh in Los Angeles rejected a
$10,000 bond for Hoxie before setting bail at $50,000, saying
&#8220;there&#8217;s potential for her to be a flight risk.&#8221; Walsh said
Sebbag &#8220;might be inclined to leave the country based on these
charges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoxie, 33, and Sebbag, 29, were arrested yesterday in Los
Angeles. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday
also sued them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hoxie and Sebbag stole Disney&#8217;s confidential pre-release
earnings information and put it up for sale,&#8221; Robert Khuzami,
the SEC&#8217;s enforcement director, said in a statement.
&#8220;Fortunately, multiple hedge funds reported the illicit scheme,
and the SEC and criminal law enforcement authorities acted
quickly to stop this brazen attempt to establish an ongoing
insider-trading business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Walt Disney Company has been fully cooperating with
this investigation,&#8221; the company said in a two-sentence
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoxie and Sebbag were represented by public defenders who
weren&#8217;t available for comment after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Hoxie, 10-mag-01113, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dubai&#8217;s Drydocks Sues Singapore Tycoon Over Takeover &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drydocks World LLC, Dubai World&#8217;s ship-repair unit, has
sued Singaporean tycoon Tan Boy Tee for breaching an agreement
tied to a S$2.4 billion ($1.7 billion) takeover deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drydocks sued Tan in the Singapore High Court last month
for the profits from buying and selling 11 million shares of
Singapore shipbuilder Otto Marine Ltd. No value was cited in
Drydocks&#8217; claim. That number of shares is worth about S$4.1
million today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan&#8217;s indirect interest in Otto breached a three-year non-
compete clause in his agreement to sell Labroy Marine Ltd., a
shipyard operator he founded, to Drydock in January 2008, the
unit of the Dubai state holding company said in its suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his filing, Tan denied having an interest in the shares
bought by his son in late January and sold on Feb. 14. A Feb. 4
Otto statement said Tan had taken a significant stake in the
company as part of a share placement that raised S$95 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempts to reach Tan, whose mobile-phone and home numbers
aren&#8217;t listed, were unsuccessful. Calls to Tan&#8217;s privately held
Bestford Capital were directed to a fax machine. A business
associate, who asked not to be identified, said Tan won&#8217;t
comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Singapore-based spokesman for Drydocks, who declined to
be identified because of the company&#8217;s policy, said the two
sides are holding talks to see if the dispute can be resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen  Gledhill LLP is representing Drydocks and Drew 
Napier LLC is acting for Tan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Drydocks World LLC v. Tan Boy Tee OS387/2010 in
the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trial/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon Claims It Didn&#8217;t Know of Sentinel Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. didn&#8217;t know cash management
firm Sentinel Management Group Inc. was using investors&#8217; assets
as collateral for a $312 million credit line, an attorney for
the bank told a federal judge in closing arguments yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentinel liquidation trustee Frederick Grede claims the
bank extended the company credit knowing it lacked enough
capital to cover the debt, helping its principals finance a
heavily leveraged trading portfolio. Grede, claiming the bank
enabled Sentinel to deceive its clients, seeks the recovery of
about $600 million for Sentinel&#8217;s creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bank, like so many others, didn&#8217;t know that Sentinel
was engaged in fraud,&#8221; Hector Gonzalez, an attorney for Bank of
New York Mellon told U.S. District Judge James B. Zagel.
Sentinel&#8217;s actions &#8220;didn&#8217;t amount to a red flag,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentinel, based in Northbrook, Illinois, filed for
bankruptcy in 2007, four days after it froze client accounts
citing credit market instability. Customer claims have totaled
about $1.2 billion. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John H. Squires in
December 2008 approved a liquidation plan under which investors
could be repaid 35 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee claims BNY Mellon was only concerned about its
own loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They let Sentinel keep going and hoped they would dig
themselves out,&#8221; trustee lawyer Chris Gair told Zagel. &#8220;They
clearly had a motive and clearly lied about what they did.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zagel told the attorneys he hoped to reach a verdict
&#8220;before the summer is out.&#8221; The trial started in April in
federal court in Chicago, though closing arguments were held
yesterday in Washington, where Zagel is serving as a visiting
judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon is seeking enforce its collateralized claim for
the $312 million in outstanding credit extended to the firm when
it failed, plus accrued interest and attorney fees. Grede wants
Zagel to subordinate that lien to the claims of other Sentinel
creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Grede v. Bank of New York, 08cv2582, in the
Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambac Judge Rules Against Mortgage Bond Investors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambac Financial Group Inc. clients who purchased protection
on residential mortgage-backed securities lost a court bid to
halt implementation of a Wisconsin regulator&#8217;s plan to wind down
the insurer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lafayette County Circuit Judge William Johnston made the
ruling in state court in Darlington, Wisconsin, according to a
statement May 25 from Insurance Commissioner Sean Dilweg&#8217;s
office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a compromise with a group of banks, including
Deutsche Bank AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, was in
the financial interest of Ambac and policyholders, and failure
to do so may escalate claims by more than $8 billion, according
to Dilweg&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The steps we&#8217;re taking are aimed at avoiding billions of
dollars of losses, and will provide the best way toward a
durable solution for all policyholders,&#8221; Dilweg said in the
statement. &#8220;There are very real and dramatic risks, if the
orderly process we are pursuing is not preserved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to Ambac spokesman Peter Poillon wasn&#8217;t returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors objected to Dilweg&#8217;s plan to create a segregated
account for their policies that would pay them 25 cents on the
dollar in cash for their claims, in addition to surplus notes
that may be redeemed later if Ambac has sufficient funds.
Critics of Dilweg&#8217;s plan said it favored banks that purchased
protection separately for collateralized debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnston dismissed a motion to enjoin Wisconsin-regulated
Ambac Assurance Corp. and the bank group from proceeding with a
so-called commutation of guarantees on $16.5 billion of
securities backed by mortgages. Certain Ambac-insured
bondholders challenged the deal saying it was unfair to all
policyholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambac, the second-largest bond insurer before the onset of
the credit crisis, was stripped of its AAA credit ratings in
2008 after losses on securities backed by mortgages surged. In
March, Dilweg announced he was splitting Ambac&#8217;s insurance unit
in two in order to segregate policies on which the bond insurer
is expected to pay claims. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refco Fraud Victims Get $135 Million From Executives &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refco Inc. fraud victims will receive more than $135
million in funds forfeited by former Chief Executive Officer
Phillip Bennett and other executives and insiders, a U.S.
Attorney said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of forfeited money, including $92.7
million from Bennett, comes on top of $437 million previously
given to victims of the former trading company, U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara said in a statement yesterday in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the biggest independent U.S. futures trader, New York-
based Refco collapsed in October 2005, two months after raising
$670 million in an initial public offering. Bennett, Tone Grant,
Santo Maggio, Robert Trosten and others hid trading losses and
fraudulently moved expenses off the books to facilitate a 2004
leveraged buyout of Refco and the stock offering in 2005,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bennett was sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2008 and
ordered to pay a total of $2.4 billion in forfeiture money,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which provided clearing and prime-brokerage
services, filed for bankruptcy after disclosing that a Bennett-
controlled firm owed hundreds of millions of dollars to Refco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Bennett, 05-CR-1192, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nortel Networks Corp., the insolvent
Canadian phone-equipment maker, may get as much as $1.1 billion
for technology patents that analysts say would benefit potential
bidders including Research In Motion Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toronto-based company has about 4,500 patents granted
and more than 1,000 applications for designs pending, according
to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data, said Peter Conley of
MDB Capital Group LLC, who estimated their value. They would be
a &#8220;natural fit&#8221; for BlackBerry maker RIM, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Patent estates of this size don&#8217;t come along that
often,&#8221; said Conley, who is managing director of Santa Monica-
based MDB, an investment bank specialized in intellectual
property. &#8220;This is the equivalent of acquiring the IP of a
large technology company. If you could buy that for a billion
dollars, it would be a bargain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nortel&#8217;s patents would give buyers technology used in
wireless networks that support data-hungry smartphones like
Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone. A sale would add to the more than $2.8
billion Nortel has raised from selling assets in bankruptcy and
be a boon to creditors, said Ehud Gelblum, a New York-based
Morgan Stanley analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nortel said this month it has started soliciting bids for
the patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nortel filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2009
after posting a loss of $5.8 billion in 2008. The company has
since auctioned off businesses, and the patents are among the
last assets left, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with a discount to account for Nortel&#8217;s insolvency,
the patents are worth $750 million to $1.1 billion, said Conley,
the intellectual-property banker. His valuation is based on an
estimate for types of patents, multiplied by the number in the
portfolio and discounted for the age of the patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott McKeown, a patent lawyer with Oblon, Spivak,
McCLelland, Maier and Neustadt in Alexandria, Virginia, said a
sale price of at least $750 million for the patents is
reasonable, especially as they include Nortel&#8217;s Long Term
Evolution, or LTE, technology for the newest wireless networks,
called fourth generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nortel has yet to decide whether a sale, licensing, some
combination of the two or another alternative is the best
decision, said spokeswoman Moody. She declined to comment on how
many LTE patents Nortel has or on the estimate for their value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM, based in Waterloo, Ontario, attempted to block
Ericsson AB&#8217;s $1.13 billion purchase last year of Nortel&#8217;s code-
division multiple access, or CDMA, technology, on which most
mobile phones in North America run, saying the deal would
deprive Canada of vital technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson, based in Stockholm, would be interested in
pursuing more Nortel patents, Mark Henderson, head of the
company&#8217;s Canadian unit, said last August. Patricia Maclean, a
company spokeswoman in Canada, said Ericsson had nothing to add. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco Systems Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest maker of networking
equipment, may also be interested in Nortel&#8217;s patents, according
to Conley. The San Jose, California-based company has cited
Nortel 3,200 times in its patent applications, Conley said,
citing U.S. patent office data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David McCulloch, a Cisco spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Seeks Patent for Traffic-Signal Auto Engine-Stop Technology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. filed an application
for a U.S. patent on a technology to increase fuel economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application 20100125402, published in the database of the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office May 20, is for a technology
that will permit traffic signals and railroad crossing signals
to turn off the engines of waiting cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method would be used to increase fuel economy,
according to the application. Calculations would be made to
determine whether more fuel would be saved by turning off and
restarting the engine or permitting it to run while the vehicle
is stopped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication between the vehicle and the signal can be
accomplished by utilizing wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi,
cellular network, or satellite communications, according to the
application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armonk, New York-based IBM applied for the patent in
November 2008, with the assistance of Suiter Swantz pc llo of
Omaha, Nebraska. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Film Funder, Distributor Sued over &#8216;Torture Room&#8217; Rights &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moviebank LLC, a closely held company that finances feature
films, was sued for copyright infringement by an Arcadia-
California-based film company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randles Films LLC accused Moviebank of infringing the
copyright to &#8220;Brainwashed: the Torture Room.&#8221; According to the
Internet Movie Database, the film has been renamed &#8220;Pledge of
Allegiance,&#8221; and was written by Eric Forsberg, who also wrote
&#8220;Snakes on a Train,&#8221; and &#8220;30,000 Leagues Under the Sea.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a  review posted on the database, &#8220;Pledge of
Allegiance&#8221; is &#8220;culled from the descriptions of torture and
tactics used on those released or interviewed at Gitmo and Abu
Graib.&#8221; The review says the film &#8220;weaves a chillingly
realistic tale of the plausible, sadistic, and alarmingly
unchecked torment; exacted in the name of Homeland Security.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codefendant with Moviebank is Echo Bridge Entertainment LLC
of Beverly Hills, California, an independent content-
distribution company. Quantum Releasing LLC of Burbank,
California, a distributor of independent films and television
programs, is also a defendant. The complaint, filed May 25 in
federal court in Los Angeles, also lists 10 unnamed defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randles Films claims the defendants &#8220;wrongfully created
copies&#8221; of the disputed film, and distributed and sold them
without authorization. The film company claims it&#8217;s lost income
and profits and the value of its rights have been diluted by the
defendants&#8217; actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to bar the defendants from future
infringement and for an award for all profits they realized from
their allegedly unauthorized acts. Additionally, the film
company seeks an award of money damages, attorney fees,
litigation costs and an order for seizure and destruction of all
unauthorized copied of the film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randles Films is represented by Lawrence B. Steinberg and
Oren Bitan of Los Angeles-based Buchalter Nemer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Randles Films LLC v. Quantum Releasing LLC,
2:10-cv-03909-SJO-SS, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont Goes After Record Company for Using &#8216;Teflon&#8217; Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont Co., the 208-year-old chemical company, sued a Los
Angeles-based record company for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teflon Blood Records Inc. is accused of infringing DuPont&#8217;s
&#8220;Teflon&#8221; trademarks, used for the company&#8217;s fluoropolymer
products. The chemical company says it&#8217;s been using the name
since 1944, and registered a number of Teflon marks with the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office beginning in 1946. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It objects to the record company&#8217;s use of &#8220;Teflon,&#8221; and
its inference that Teflon is a bullet-proof substance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teflon Blood&#8217;s logo of a pulsating heart wrapped in a so-
called bulletproof vest &#8220;is likely to cause confusion to the
consuming public as to the use and applications for DuPont&#8217;s
Teflon&#8221; fabrics and resins, the company said in the complaint
transferred May 25 to federal court in Los Angeles from federal
court in Denver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having been sent multiple cease-and-desist letters,
the record company continues to use the Teflon mark without
authorization, DuPont said in its pleadings. The president of
Teflon Blood told DuPont his company doesn&#8217;t intend to comply
with the chemical company&#8217;s requests, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teflon Blood&#8217;s principle recording group is Black Judah, a
reggae dancehall band, according to the company website. The
chemical company claims it&#8217;s suffering &#8220;great damage to its
business, good will, reputation, profits and the strength of its
Teflon mark&#8221; due to the record company&#8217;s unauthorized use of
the mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont asked the court for
attorney fees, litigation costs, money damages of as much as $1
million for each counterfeit mark, and for an award of Teflon
Blood&#8217;s profits stemming from its alleged infringement.
Additionally, the company seeks a court order barring any
unauthorized use of its Teflon mark, and the seizure of all
offending material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical company is represented by Stephen D. Gurr of
Kamlet Reichert LLP and Barry A. Schwartz of the Public
Defender&#8217;s Office, both of Denver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. v. Teflon Blood
Inc., 2:10-cv-02908-R-E, U.S. District Court, Central District
of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danone Defeats Glanbia in Irish Trademark Battle over &#8216;Essensis&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danone SA, the world&#8217;s largest yogurt maker, has won an
Irish  trademark battle with Kilkenny, Ireland&#8217;s Glanbia Plc,
according to the DairyReporter.com news website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit stems from the brand name &#8220;Bifidus Essensis&#8221;
Paris-based Danone used for a yogurt culture used in its Activia
yogurts, according to the DairyReporter.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Dublin&#8217;s High Court ruled against Danone in 2007,
the country&#8217;s Supreme Court determined that ruling was &#8220;unduly
narrow,&#8221; the website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glanbia, which produced the Yoplait Essence product that
was the subject of the dispute, said it will &#8220;review its legal
options,&#8221; according to the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renault&#8217;s &#8216;Zoe&#8217; Name Choice for New Car Drawing Zoes&#8217; Ire &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renault ZA, the Paris-based automaker, is receiving
opposition from its proposal to brand its new zero-emission car
&#8220;Zoe&#8221; to be released in 2012, the BBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word, which means &#8220;life&#8221; in Greek, is a popular
girls&#8217; name, and women named Zoe are petitioning the company
reconsider its choice, according to the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for one woman named Zoe told the BBC that if
Renault didn&#8217;t reconsider its name choice, he would sue the
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renault said the name isn&#8217;t yet a &#8220;definitive choice,&#8221;
according to the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia Pacific Tells Church To Halt Use of &#8216;Yeah Right&#8217; Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd.&#8217;s  DB Breweries unit has warned
a church in Tauranga, New Zealand, that it&#8217;s infringing a
trademark, the New Zealand Herald reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bethlehem Community Church was told its sign &#8220;Atheists
have nothing to worry about! Yeah right&#8221; was infringing the
&#8220;yeah right&#8221; mark the Singapore-based company was using for
its Tui brand beer, according to the Herald. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church had used a variety of slogans incorporating
&#8220;yeah right&#8221; on its own billboards for eight years, according
to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A church official told the Herald he thought the phrase
&#8220;yeah right&#8221; was a New Zealand colloquialism and couldn&#8217;t be
protected by trademark law, the Herald reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Pop Singer Won&#8217;t Sue Food Shop Owner for Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong pop singer Andy Lau&#8217;s management company said it
didn&#8217;t file a trademark infringement against the owner of a food
shop in China&#8217;s Sichuan Province, the ChannelNewsAsia website
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dispute with the owner of a salted duck shop related to
the owner&#8217;s attempt to register his shop&#8217;s name as a trademark,
according to ChannelNewsAsia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shop&#8217;s name contains the words &#8220;Liu De Hua,&#8221; which is
Lau&#8217;s name in Mandarin, the website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Lau&#8217;s did initially oppose the trademark registration
on the grounds that association with pressed salted duck would
defame singer&#8217;s name in addition to infringing, its statement
said it wouldn&#8217;t interfere with people&#8217;s using their own names
or registering trademarks, according to ChannelNewsAsia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian Patent-Outsourcing Firm to Hire 100 More Lawyers for
Delhi &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pangea3 LLP, the Mumbai-based legal outsourcing firm that
performs patent analytics and patent-application work, will hire
100 more lawyers in the next six months, India&#8217;s Business
Standard reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which already has more than 450 lawyers, will
place the new hires in its facilities in Delhi, India, according
to the Business Standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delhi was chosen because of the large number of lawyers
available there and the improvements in the city&#8217;s business
infrastructure, Sanjay Kamlan, Pangea3&#8217;s co-chief executive
officer told the Business Standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to patent work, Pangea3 also does litigation
and electronic discovery services, the Business Standard
Reported. &lt;/p&gt;

are convinced it won&#8217;t succeed,&#8221; Doug Suttles, the BP executive
in charge of the spill response, said at an afternoon press
conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP said in a statement today that it has spent $930 million
responding to the spill, which began after an April 20 rig
explosion that killed 11 workers. The well has been spewing an
estimated 12,000 to 19,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf, a
U.S. government panel said yesterday. The midpoint of that
estimate would make it the nation&#8217;s largest oil spill on record
and more than twice as big as the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is clearly an environmental catastrophe,&#8221; Hayward
said today in a CNN television interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s comments came two weeks after Hayward was quoted by
The Guardian newspaper in the U.K. as saying the spill was
&#8220;relatively tiny&#8221; compared with the &#8220;very big ocean.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spill has polluted 107 miles (172 kilometers of
Louisiana&#8217;s beaches and marshes, Governor Bobby Jindal said
today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relief Well Stopped &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP suspended drilling on the second of two relief wells
intended to permanently seal the damaged well from the bottom,
so that its blowout preventer will be available should the top
kill fail, Suttles said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that event, BP will saw off a section of crimped pipe
from the top of the blowout preventer of the leaking well,
install the second blowout preventer atop the first, and close
its valves to halt the leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will take several days and in the interim, engineers
plan to cover the sawn-off pipe with a temporary cap designed to
direct some of the oil to a ship on the surface, Suttles said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halting work on the second relief well is not a sign that
BP has concluded the top kill will fail, Suttles said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mud Supplies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first phase of the top-kill effort used less than
15,000 barrels of drilling mud, Suttles said. BP had 50,000
barrels available and has made sure there are additional
supplies of mud and rubber material, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8221;It&#8217;s not going well,&#8221; Tad Patzek, chairman of the
Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Department at the
University of Texas at Austin, said, based on a live video feed
of the leak 2 p.m. New York time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have more or less the equivalent of six fire hoses
blasting oil and gas upwards and two fire hoses blasting mud
down,&#8221; said Patzek, who watched the video feed over much of the
past 48 hours. &#8220;So you can see that they are at a
disadvantage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The giant oil slick in the Gulf threatens the region&#8217;s
fishing and tourism industries. The amount of oil being spilled
will help determine BP&#8217;s liability for the leak, according to
U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fishing Shutdown Grows &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration today
expanded closure of federal waters to fishing to encompass
60,683 square miles (157,169 kilometers), about a quarter of the
Gulf of Mexico. The dog leg-shaped area extends from Atchafalaya
Bay in Louisiana to a point west of Naples, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP added the &#8220;junk-shot&#8221; materials after pumping mud
alone into the well for 11 hours Wednesday. The company
previously said it would add the rubber pieces if needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mud alone may not have been sufficient to hold back the
oil, said Pedro Alvarez, chairman of the Civil and Environmental
Engineering Department at Rice University in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It became fluidized in a way, like quicksand,&#8221; Alvarez
said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;When you have the oil
bubbling up from this gorge, the oil coming up pushed the mud
out.&#8221; The rubber materials may allow the mud to set completely
enough for BP to cap the well with concrete, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 19-hour pause in injecting material in the well may
have allowed BP to evaluate whether the mud would stop the flow
of oil completely enough to allow the company to add concrete,
Alvarez said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see it as something really weird,
necessarily,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Little Bit Extra&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don Van Nieuwenhuise, director of Professional Geoscience
Programs at the University of Houston, said he sees BP&#8217;s chances
of success with top kill at 60 percent to 70 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they hadn&#8217;t had to do the junk shot, I would have
thought the things are working really well, but the fact that
they&#8217;ve done this junk shot suggests that they decided that they
needed to do something a little bit extra to do it more
effectively,&#8221; Nieuwenhuise said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP leased the rig destroyed in the explosion, the Deepwater
Horizon, from Geneva-based Transocean Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest
deep-water driller. BP has a 65 percent stake in the field,
known as Macondo. Its partners in the project are Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. and Japan&#8217;s Mitsui  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of safety concerns raised by the blast and spill,
President Barack Obama extended a moratorium on deep-water
drilling permits by six months. Obama, who traveled to Louisiana
today as he sought to blunt criticism of his administration&#8217;s
response to the spill, said Energy Secretary Steven Chu will
work with BP to seek alternatives if the top-kill plan fails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are going to be a lot of judgment calls involved
here,&#8221; Obama told reporters in Grand Isle, Louisiana. &#8220;There
are not going to be silver bullets for the problems we face.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP fell 5 percent to 494.8 pence in London and has lost 25
percent of its market value since the blast. It rose 5.9 percent
yesterday, its biggest gain in more than a year, after reports
of progress on the top kill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko, based near Houston, dropped 5.8 percent to $52.33
as of the 4 p.m. close of New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Transocean fell 4.9 percent to $56.77. Mitsui rose 1.4
percent to 1,321 yen in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress has scheduled at least 20 hearings on the
Deepwater Horizon and offshore drilling since the rig exploded,
and the Minerals Management Service and Coast Guard are holding
hearings in Louisiana on the reasons for the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spill has cost BP about $24 million a day. BP&#8217;s profit
last year averaged $45 million a day. The response has involved
more than 1,300 tugs, barges and other vessels. More than 3.15
million feet of containment boom is in place to protect the
shoreline and fish nurseries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 26,000 damage claims have been filed and 11,650 have
already been paid, BP said today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Trustee objected to
Washington Mutual Inc.&#8217;s liquidation plan, joining bondholders
of the company&#8217;s former bank and other creditors who were left
out of a settlement with JPMorgan Chase  Co. and regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of the U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice
Department that monitors corporate bankruptcies, said WaMu&#8217;s
plan seeks to force a promise from lower-ranking creditors that
they won&#8217;t sue the company&#8217;s senior lenders and senior
noteholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidation plan contains a &#8220;trap door&#8221; for
creditors, U.S. Trustee attorney Joseph McMahon said in papers
filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware.
The plan &#8220;is unduly coercive and effectively vitiates any
proposed consent that may be obtained.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WaMu was the holding company for the biggest U.S. bank to
fail in 2008. JPMorgan bought the bank for $1.9 billion after it
was seized by federal regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company attorney Brian Rosen didn&#8217;t immediately return a
call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After WaMu filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, the
company fought in court with JPMorgan and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. over the ownership of billions of dollars in
deposits and tax refunds. WaMu also considered suing JPMorgan
and the FDIC over the seizure and sale of the bank, seeking
documents from them and court permission to question their
employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three later agreed to settle any potential claims WaMu
may have had related to the bank failure. The settlement, which
splits $5.8 billion in tax refunds and $4 billion in cash, has
divided bondholders of the holding company, who are being paid
under the liquidation plan, and bondholders of the bank, who are
not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank bondholders argued the proposed settlement deprived
them of tax refunds that were rightfully theirs. They also
wanted the FDIC to fight for more than the $850 million it will
get under the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That money, along with the $1.9 billion paid by JPMorgan
for the bank in 2008, will be used to pay bank creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WaMu filed for bankruptcy the day after the takeover.
Before it failed, Washington Mutual Bank had more than 2,200
branches and $188 billion in deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholder Opposition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders also oppose the settlement. They asked U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath to force JPMorgan, the FDIC and
others involved in the bank sale to turn over documents.
Shareholders would get nothing under the proposed liquidation of
most of WaMu&#8217;s remaining assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walrath must approve the settlement and the liquidation
plan before WaMu&#8217;s creditors, owed about $7 billion, can be
paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan would be sent to creditors for a vote. It would
also ask creditors to release claims against some company
lenders and noteholders, McMahon said in court papers. Should
creditors refuse to vote for the release, they wouldn&#8217;t be paid,
McMahon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders have said in court papers that WaMu could
collect as much as $20 billion from lawsuits, tax refunds and
the deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Washington Mutual Inc., 08-
12229, and a related financial dispute is Washington Mutual Inc.
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 09-50934, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano will probably cede the
post next year, raising the possibility of the first female or
first black CEO in the 99-year-old company&#8217;s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of IBM&#8217;s last four chief executives have stepped down
at 60, with the exception being John Akers, who was forced out
by IBM&#8217;s board before he reached that age. Palmisano, who has
led the company for more than eight years, will hit that mark
next July. IBM&#8217;s tradition of CEOs stepping aside at 60 helps
retain top executives, said Val Rahmani, former general manager
of an IBM security software business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People need to see that there&#8217;s the opportunity to
progress,&#8221; said Rahmani, who left IBM last year and is now CEO
of the Atlanta-based security software firm Damballa Inc. She
said Palmisano will probably retire next year. &#8220;There&#8217;s loads
of speculation going on at the moment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, has
brought in a CEO from outside the company only once, when it
named Louis V. Gerstner Jr. to succeed Akers in 1993. The likely
candidates this time are internal, including the senior vice
presidents who oversee sales, hardware, consulting and
technology services. Steve Mills, the well-respected senior vice
president for software, may be unlikely to take over the top
post since he also turns 60 next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Plc resumed pumping thousands of
barrels of mud into a damaged oil well to halt a Gulf of Mexico
oil spill that is bigger than the Exxon Valdez disaster and may
be the largest in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;top kill&#8221; attempt restarted at 7 p.m. New York time
yesterday, said U.S. Coast Guard Chief Bob Laura. The effort
began May 26 and was suspended the same day at 11 p.m. for
checks and for changes to the procedure. The effort may last for
the next 24 hours to 48 hours, BP said today in a statement,
adding that &#8220;response&#8221; costs so far amount to $930 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we do believe we&#8217;ve done is successfully pump some
drilling mud into the well bore,&#8221; Doug Suttles, BP&#8217;s chief
operating officer for exploration and production, said yesterday
at a press conference in Robert, Louisiana. &#8220;We will continue
the efforts as long as there&#8217;s a possibility of success.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful top-kill would bring a temporary end to a leak
that has poured an estimated 23 million gallons of oil into
ocean and soiled 100 miles (161 kilometers) of coast. The slick,
stemming from the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon
rig that killed 11 people, threatens the Gulf fishing and
tourism industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Valdez &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well has been leaking oil at an estimated rate of
12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day, Marcia McNutt, head of a U.S.
government panel studying the flow, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the midpoint of the best estimates released by the
Flow Rate Technical Group, the well may have leaked about
527,000 barrels as of May 26 since the rig sank, April 22. That
has exceeded the 262,000 barrels spilled by the Exxon Valdez in
1989 and the U.S. record 300,000-barrel spill by a tanker off
the Oregon coast in 1968, according to statistics from the
American Petroleum Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of oil being spilled will help determine BP&#8217;s
liability for the leak. BP leased the rig from Geneva-based
Transocean Ltd., the largest deep-water driller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will inject material originally intended for
another well-blocking solution known as a &#8220;junk shot.&#8221; Adding
the items to the mud may help BP to seal leaks so that enough
pressure can be exerted on the column of oil to block the flow.
Some of items are fibrous and small, and others are larger
rubber balls, Suttles said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Arm Wrestle&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first phase of the top kill effort used less than
15,000 barrels of drilling mud to try to fill the well, Suttles
said. BP had 50,000 barrels available and has made sure there
are additional supplies on hand for when pumping resumes, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top kill process uses drilling fluid to &#8220;arm wrestle&#8221;
the gusher of oil and natural gas back into the well, said
Robert Dudley, managing director for the London-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure will serve as a temporary block on the
damaged well until another well can be drilled and used to
permanently plug it with cement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A live video feed provided by BP showed brown fluid flowing
from the site. The feed alone can&#8217;t indicate the success of the
effort to block the well, Suttles said. Ultimately, the effort
will be considered successful when mud has fully blocked oil
from leaking and the well has been capped with concrete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP fell 1.7 percent to 512 pence in London as of 8:17 a.m.
It rose 5.9 percent yesterday after reports on some advance in
the operation. Anadarko Petroleum Corp., which owns a 25 percent
stake in the well, rose $2.23, or 4.2 percent, to $55.57. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean rose as much as 9.1 percent yesterday in New
York trading and closed up 1.9 percent at $59.71. Halliburton
Co., which provided services on the rig, rose $1.11, or 4.3
percent, to $26.99. Cameron International Corp., which provided
equipment for the rig, rose $2, or 5.5 percent, to $38.08. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An underwater oil plume from the spill may have spread 22
miles northeast toward Mobile, Alabama, researchers from the
University of South Florida said in a preliminary report. Tests
conducted by the school&#8217;s Weatherbird II vessel showed the
highest concentrations of &#8220;dissolved hydrocarbons&#8221; were 400
meters underwater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress has scheduled at least 20 hearings on the
Deepwater Horizon and offshore drilling since the rig exploded,
and the Minerals Management Service and Coast Guard held another
day of hearings in Louisiana on the reasons for the accident
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling Moratorium &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama yesterday extended by six months a
moratorium on new deep-water drilling permits that began after
oil started to spill from BP&#8217;s well. The president also canceled
a proposal to drill for oil off the coast of Virginia and
suspended planned drilling by Royal Dutch Shell Plc of
exploratory wells in the Arctic off Alaska. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Birnbaum, the head of the Minerals Management
Service, the federal agency that oversees offshore drilling,
resigned yesterday, according to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spill has cost BP a total of about $24 million a day.
Average daily profit last year was $45 million a day, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accident &#8220;threatens to be the worst oil spill disaster
in history,&#8221; BP investor Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority claimed in a Delaware Chancery Court
lawsuit filed against BP directors on May 21 in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Harm &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directors violated their duties to the company, causing
&#8220;enormous economic harm for failure to act in the interests of
BP and its shareholders&#8221; and exposing the company to
liabilities in the billions of dollars, Septa lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit lists potential damage claims of about $2.5
billion to the Gulf fishing industry; $3 billion to tourism;
$700 million in remediation efforts so far; $6 million a day in
continuing costs and &#8220;incalculable damages to BP&#8217;s
reputation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cleanup has involved more than 1,300 tugs, barges and
other vessels and the use of more than 3.15 million feet of
containment boom is in place to protect the shoreline and fish
nurseries. About 274,000 barrels (11.5 million gallons) of oily
liquids have been skimmed from the water surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far 26,000 claims have been filed and 11,650 have
already been paid, BP said today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KKR  Co. LP and Bain Capital
Partners LLC hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for a $1 billion
initial public offering of Toys R Us Inc., the retailer the
buyout firms purchased in 2005, according to people with
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing for the U.S. listing may come as soon as today,
said the people, who declined to be named because the
discussions are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of KKR, Bain and Goldman Sachs declined to
comment. Calls to Kathleen Waugh, a Toys R Us spokeswoman, after
regular business hours weren&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms, which spent a record $1.6 trillion on
deals from 2005 to 2007, are using public market offerings to
pay down debt and reap profits from companies they own. KKR,
based in New York, has completed IPOs for chipmaker Avago
Technologies Ltd. and retailer Dollar General Corp. during the
past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bain, based in Boston, KKR, and Vornado Realty Trust in New
York bought Wayne, New Jersey-based Toys R Us for $7.5 billion,
including assumed debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales at U.S. retailers climbed in April for the seventh
straight month, led by automobile dealers and building-material
stores, according to Commerce Department figures released on May
14. Purchases rose 0.4 percent, exceeding the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That followed a 2.1 percent
gain in March that was larger than previously estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail purchases will climb 2 percent to 2.5 percent this
month, less than previously forecast, the International Council
of Shopping Centers said May 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Post reported the Toys R Us plans yesterday on
its website. JPMorgan Chase  Co. has also been hired to help
lead a banking group that includes Bank of America Corp. and
Credit Suisse Group AG, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toys &#8220;R&#8221; Us is forging ahead with its sale even after the
European debt crisis pushed the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index down
7.1 percent this month and prompted at least 20 companies around
the world to postpone or withdraw IPOs. Initial offerings from
U.S. companies backed by private-equity firms are also losing
money for investors for the first time in a least a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 14 initial sales by private-equity funds this year have
fallen 2.8 percent in the first month of trading through May 26
after averaging gains every year since at least 2001, data
compiled by Bloomberg and Greenwich, Connecticut-based
Renaissance Capital LLC show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the IPOs have beaten the SP 500 by 0.9 percentage
point in the first month, companies without support from buyout
firms outperformed the benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks by 6
percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bubble Aftermath &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyout funds are turning to IPOs to offload some of the $2
trillion in leveraged buyouts made during the credit-market
bubble. The largest rebound in the SP 500 since the Great
Depression had spurred private-equity owners to turn to IPOs
after returning less money to clients last year than at any time
since at least 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money raised by LBO firms fell 78 percent to $35 billion in
the fourth quarter of 2009, according to Preqin Ltd. of London,
after the collapse of New York-based Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. a year earlier stymied deals and froze credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR and Bain are pressing ahead with what may be the
biggest initial U.S. offerings of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HCA Inc., the hospital chain bought four years ago in a $33
billion LBO led by KKR and Bain, filed this month to sell as
much as $4.6 billion in shares. The Nashville, Tennessee-based
company&#8217;s U.S. IPO would be the largest since Visa Inc. of San
Francisco raised $19.7 billion in March 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NXP Semiconductors NV, the Dutch chipmaker owned by KKR and
Bain, said in April it will seek to sell $1.15 billion of
shares. Apax Partners LLP in London was also among the private-
equity funds that acquired Eindhoven, Netherlands-based NXP from
Royal Philips Electronics NV of Amsterdam in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. hired
Kenichiro Yoshida, the No. 2 analyst for Japanese trading
companies, to bolster its research for corporate clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoshida, a former analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., was
hired two days ago and assigned to lead research activities,
Shojiro Hirota, general manager for communications at Tokyo-
based Nikko Cordial, said in an interview yesterday. Nikkei Inc.
ranked Yoshida the No. 2 analyst for Japanese trading companies
for 2010. The analyst had been ranked No. 1 by Nikkei for nine
consecutive years from 1999, according to Nikkei&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoshida&#8217;s hiring is the latest step by Tokyo-based Nikko
Cordial to build its research business. The firm hired Yutaka Yoshino in March as its chief technical analyst. Yoshino was
ranked No. 2 in Nikkei&#8217;s survey last year and was formerly an
analyst at Citigroup in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikko Cordial is apparently targeting &#8220;corporate customers
and aims to compete with value-added services rather than low
prices,&#8221; said Naoki Fujiwara, a fund manager in Tokyo at
Shinkin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo, which oversees about $6
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikko Cordial plans to hire about 1,000 people over the
next three years to March 2013, increasing its staff 14 percent,
the company said on March 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also aims to boost investment banking revenue by more
than sevenfold to 100 billion yen ($1.09 billion), or a third of
its overall income, Nikko Cordial said. In the year to March 31,
investment banking accounted for 7.7 percent of the total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., which acquired Nikko
Cordial from Citigroup Inc. in October, is building its own
investment banking businesses after ending a 10-year joint
venture with Daiwa Securities Group Inc., the nation&#8217;s No. 2
brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumiko Iwadate, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman at Goldman,
declined to comment on Yoshida leaving the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Cuban President Fidel Castro
said the global ban on coca, the leaf used to make cocaine, is
like taking away tea from the English. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaf, whose eradication is mandated by a 1961 United
Nations treaty, is used as part of millennia-old traditions
among Indians in Andean countries including Bolivia, Castro
wrote in a &#8220;Reflections&#8221; column published on the Cuba Debate
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Prohibiting it is like saying to the English that they
can&#8217;t consume tea, a healthy custom imported by the U.K. from
Asia, which was conquered and colonized by them for centuries,&#8221;
Castro wrote in the column titled &#8220;The Empire and Drugs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peasants and miners in Bolivia chew coca, a stimulant, to
ward off hunger and ease headaches. Bolivia is the world&#8217;s
third-largest cocaine producer after Colombia and Peru,
according to a UN report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leader of the 1959 Cuban Revolution said Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez and his counterpart in Bolivia, Evo Morales, are &#8220;working especially hard&#8221; to combat the
production and trafficking of cocaine, which he said is
different from the raw leaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coca leaf contains less than 1 percent of the alkaloid
that in large amounts can be used to make cocaine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telus Corp., Canada&#8217;s third-largest
wireless carrier, is creating an online medical database with
Microsoft Corp. to expand its telecommunication services to the
health-care industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secure Internet-based service will be available to
Canadian consumers and their health-care providers and will be
based upon Microsoft&#8217;s HealthVault software, the Vancouver-based
company said today in a statement. Telus didn&#8217;t disclose
financial terms of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telus is beefing up its health-care business as the
Canadian population ages and the company&#8217;s overall revenue
stagnates amid increased competition from new mobile-phone
operators. Telus currently posts sales of about C$400 million
($382 million) a year from its health-care business, helping
hospitals to transmit and manage data and to electronically link
doctors with patients in remote locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Telus&#8217; total sales were little changed last year at
C$9.6 billion, revenue from its health-care business is
expanding by more than 10 percent a year and the unit is
profitable, Chief Executive Officer Darren Entwistle said in an
interview last month. He also plans to accelerate the growth of
that unit with small &#8220;tuck-under&#8221; transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telus rose 38 cents to C$38.87 at 1:17 p.m in Toronto Stock
Exchange trading. Before today, the stock had climbed 13 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fujitsu Ltd., Japan&#8217;s biggest
computer-services provider, aims to boost supercomputer sales to
$1 billion in five years to challenge Hewlett-Packard Co. and
International Business Machines Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company intends to control 10 percent of the $9 billion
market, from the current 2.2 percent, by tapping rising demand
in Germany, France and the U.K., said Masahiko Yamada, president
of Fujitsu technical computing solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supercomputers used to map the human genome and forecast
weather are also helping companies design cars and aircraft,
research drugs and develop financial market strategies. Sales of
the machines may grow about 8.6 percent annually during the
three years to 2012, four times faster than for conventional
servers, according to Fujitsu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Manufacturers are using these tools to become more
competitive,&#8221; Yamada said in an interview in Tokyo. Fujitsu has
sold supercomputers with as many as 2,600 processors to auto and
precision-equipment makers, he said, declining to identify any.
&#8220;The day isn&#8217;t that far off when things like cars or cell
phones will be designed from beginning to end inside a
computer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard, the world&#8217;s
biggest PC maker, leads the market for supercomputers with a 42
percent share, according to supercomputer-ranking website Top500.
IBM has 37 percent of the world market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley hired Kazunobu Ezawa,
a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managing director, for its
fixed-income business in Japan, according to an internal company
memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezawa, 42, this month joined Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities
Co., a joint venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,
to help boost fixed-income sales to listed Japanese companies
and add new clients, the Morgan Stanley memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Morgan Stanley in April posted earnings that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates as fixed-income trading revenue more
than doubled from a year earlier. The bank follows UBS AG and
other overseas banks in luring executives away from rivals in
Japan after the value of domestic bond transactions in the
country rose 12 percent to 16 trillion yen ($174 billion) last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natsuo Nishio, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Morgan Stanley,
confirmed the hiring, without commenting further. Ezawa wasn&#8217;t
immediately available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ started two joint
ventures this month for investment banking and trading. Teaming
up with Mitsubishi UFJ, which invested $9 billion in the Wall
Street firm in 2008, may help Morgan Stanley bolster its ranking
in advising on Japanese mergers and securities underwriting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi UFJ ranked second in Japanese domestic bond
underwriting last year and Morgan Stanley ranked eighth,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter revenue from fixed-income sales and trading
at Morgan Stanley jumped to $2.7 billion last quarter from $1.29
billion a year earlier helping it return to a net income of
$1.78 billion in the period, it said in a statement on April 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezawa will be a managing director at the bank, according to
the internal memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, earlier this month hired
former Nomura Holdings Inc. executive Zenji Nakamura to run its
fixed income, currencies and commodities unit in Japan. Bank of
America Corp. last month recruited Tomomi Kikuchi from JPMorgan
Chase  Co. to head sales of mortgage-backed securities in Japan.
Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co., a unit of Bank of America,
in April appointed Kikuchi as a managing director. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The five-week drop in the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 is consistent with a temporary pullback within a bull
market, said Thomas J. Lee, the chief U.S. equity strategist at
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a pretty normal correction in a bull market,&#8221; Lee
said today in a Bloomberg Television interview. &#8220;It pays up to
be a slow buyer here. If you start to get enough positive
headlines to offset the negatives, that would be a way to build
confidence. Investors are seeing good opportunities to buy, and
that could be as a sign of potential capitulation as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has fallen 12 percent from a 19-month high on
April 23 on concern that widening budget deficits in Europe
could derail global growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you have these types of corrections, the groups hit
the hardest are the ones that bounced back the most,&#8221; Lee said,
citing energy and raw-materials shares as the ones poised to
recover faster. SP 500 companies in those industries have
fallen 16 percent and 13 percent, respectively, since April 23. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading of bullish Newell Rubbermaid
Inc. options surged to the highest in almost three months on
speculation the maker of food-storage and home products may be
taken over by Procter  Gamble Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 14,000 calls to buy the stock changed hands, 10
times the four-week average and 11 times the number of puts,
which give the right to sell. The most-active contracts were
June $17.50 calls, which rose 60 percent to 40 cents and
accounted for more than half of all options volume for Atlanta-
based Newell. Those contracts expire June 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s an unsubstantiated rumor that Newell may be taken
over by Procter  Gamble,&#8221; said Patrick Mortimer, director of
options trading at Pipeline Trading Systems LLC in New Hope,
Pennsylvania. &#8220;That could drive the trading in options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble, the Cincinnati-based company that gets
half of its revenue from household-care products, agreed last
month to acquire closely held Natura Pet Products Inc. Newell
Chief Executive Officer Mark Ketchum said in an interview today
that the company may expand its cooperation with Avon Products
Inc. to developing countries such as China where it doesn&#8217;t
offer Rubbermaid products and Avon has salespeople. The plan was
announced last week at an analyst conference in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newell&#8217;s Share Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newell&#8217;s stock had gained 11 percent this year before
today. The shares rose as much as 5 percent today before closing
unchanged at $16.66. Procter  Gamble, the world&#8217;s largest
consumer products company, rose 0.1 percent to $61.16. Avon,
based in New York, fell 2.4 percent to $25.86. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotha Penn, a spokeswoman for Procter  Gamble, said the
company doesn&#8217;t comment on rumors about acquisitions or
divestitures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Managing the product portfolio is an ongoing process,&#8221;
Penn said in an e-mail. &#8220;Procter  Gamble management and the
board regularly review the portfolio to ensure the businesses
are capable of meeting our shareholder value creation
expectations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, adding to losses
from the Dow Jones Industrial Average&#8217;s worst May since 1940, as
BP Plc&#8217;s failure to plug a leaking oil well dragged down energy
producers and Agence France-Presse reported Lebanon fired on
on Israeli warplanes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean Ltd., Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Halliburton
Co. fell more than 11 percent after BP gave up trying to plug
the worst oil spill in U.S. history any sooner than August.
Benchmark indexes erased earlier gains triggered by growth in
construction spending and manufacturing after a senior Israeli
security official told AFP that the nation&#8217;s aircraft were
targeted by Lebanese anti-aircraft guns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index decreased 1.7 percent to
1,070.71 at 4 p.m. in New York. The SP 500 lost 8.2 percent in
May, its worst month since February 2009, on concern Europe&#8217;s
debt crisis will hamper the global economic recovery and China
will take more steps to cool its economy. The Dow lost 112.61
points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,024.02 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The nervousness about the global economic recovery
continues,&#8221; said Giri Cherukuri, portfolio manager and head
trader at Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, which manages
$2.2 billion. &#8220;Also, political tension across the world is
making investors more cautious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has fallen 12 percent from a 19-month high on
April 23 on concern that widening budget deficits in Europe
could derail global growth. The five-week slide is consistent
with a temporary pullback within a bull market, said Thomas J. Lee, the chief U.S. equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Pretty Normal&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a pretty normal correction in a bull market,&#8221; Lee
said today in a Bloomberg Television interview. &#8220;It pays up to
be a slow buyer here. If you start to get enough positive
headlines to offset the negatives, that would be a way to build
confidence. Investors are seeing good opportunities to buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks fell to the lowest levels of the day after AFP said
Lebanon&#8217;s military fired at Israeli planes as they flew over its
airspace, according to a senior Israeli security official. The
report came a day after nine people were killed in an Israeli
commando raid on boats carrying pro-Palestinian activists to the
Gaza Strip. Israeli forces killed two Palestinians who tried to
infiltrate from the enclave today and another three who tried to
fire a rocket, according to an army statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy companies extended losses after Attorney General
Eric Holder said the U.S. Justice Department is investigating
whether any criminal or civil laws were violated in the BP oil
spill in the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;A Tragedy&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone
who has violated the law,&#8221; Holder said. &#8220;This disaster is
nothing less than a tragedy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP plunged 15 percent in New York, its largest retreat
since at least 1980. Transocean, owner of the Deepwater Horizon
rig that exploded April 20, declined 9.4 percent to $51.45.
Halliburton, which provided oilfield services on the well,
dropped 13 percent to $21.72. Anadarko Petroleum Corp., which
owns a 25 percent stake in the well, lost 16 percent to $43.99
for the biggest drop in the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenet Healthcare Corp. fell 15 percent to $4.89 for the
second-biggest drop in the SP 500. The third-largest publicly
held U.S. hospital chain said it is discussing a potential
acquisition of Healthscope Ltd., the second-largest private
hospital company in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, Europe Slowdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern that economic growth in China and Europe will slow
also weighed on equities. China&#8217;s Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index
slid to 53.9 from 55.7 in April, the Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said today. That was less than the median 54.5
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 18 economists. Readings
above 50 indicate expansion in manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is the world&#8217;s biggest consumer of industrial metals
including copper and zinc, and the second-biggest consumer of
crude oil after the U.S. Emerging markets such as China are
driving the global economy, which the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development estimates will expand 4.6 percent
this year. Excluding emerging countries, the forecast is 2.7
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro touched a four-year low against the U.S. dollar
after the European Union&#8217;s statistics office said the jobless
rate in the 16-nation currency zone increased to 10.1 percent in
April, the highest since June 1998. The currency has lost 14
percent of its value against the dollar this year as the ability
of countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal to avoid debt
restructuring has discouraged investment in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISM, Construction Spending &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. benchmark indexes temporarily recovered from their
lows of the day after the Institute for Supply Management&#8217;s
factory index came in at 59.7 for May, topping the reading of 59
in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Commerce Department figures
showed construction spending rose 2.7 in April after a gain of
0.2 percent the prior month. That exceeded economists&#8217; estimates
that it would remain even. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing has been a leader in the U.S. economic
recovery as demand from abroad strengthened and firms picked up
production and spending to meet demand after a record drawdown
in inventories last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The underpinning of the economic recovery in the U.S. and
emerging markets appear to be sustainable despite what&#8217;s going
on in Europe,&#8221; said Jason Pride, director of investment
strategy at Glenmede in Philadelphia, which manages $18 billion.
&#8220;This is not a crystal-clear resolution that we&#8217;ll have
enduring growth, because the debt bogeyman can peak around the
corner and surprise anyone at almost any time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RadioShack rose 2.8 percent to $21.01 for the biggest
advance in the SP 500. The New York Post reported that
Blackstone Group LP is a leading bidder for the electronics
chain and said KKR  Co., Bain Capital LLC and TPG are also
likely to be involved in the bidding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hershey Co. increased 2.6 percent to $48. The candy maker
said it may cut 500 to 600 jobs in a plan to modernize its
manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ev3 Inc. rallied 17 percent to $22.22 for the second-
biggest advance in Russell 2000 Index. Covidien Plc, the
medical-device company spun off from Tyco International Ltd.,
agreed to buy ev3 for $2.6 billion to add treatments for heart
disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French Open may move to
Versailles or Disneyland Paris because of political uncertainty
about expansion at Roland Garros, its tournament director said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are short of space,&#8221; Gilbert Ysern said in an
interview with a small group of reporters today. &#8220;We strongly
believe that if we do not expand our facilities, we could
endanger the tournament.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans announced last year to build a new 120 million-euro
($145 million) stadium a five-minute walk from its current site
in the Bois de Boulogne in the 16th arrondissement were shelved
because of &#8220;a lack of political consensus,&#8221; among local
politicians in Paris, Ysern said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French Open tennis organizers are now considering three
options on the outskirts of Paris: a site near the Palace of
Versailles; a location in Marne-la-Vallee, where Disneyland
Paris is based; or Gonesse, which is close to Charles de Gaulle
airport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to Marne-la-Vallee would be the &#8220;least attractive&#8221;
of the three options, Ysern said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be the
Disney Open.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the City of Paris, which owns the
Roland Garros site, is in favor of expanding the current
facilities to the neighboring municipal greenhouses at the
Jardin des Serres, which would increase its location by about
half, Ysern said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A move away from its current site by 2016 -- when an
agreement with Paris expires -- would cost around 600 million
euros, Ysern said. Expansion at its current location will cost a
third of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French Open generates around 250 million euros annually
for the country&#8217;s economy, Ysern said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis Cup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 10-minute taxi ride from the Eiffel Tower and the Champs-
Elysees, the Roland Garros site was built for the 1928 Davis Cup
match between the U.S. and France. Originally covering eight
acres of land with five courts, Roland Garros now has 20 outside
courts spread over 21 acres. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roland Garros remains the smallest of the four tennis
majors, and players, press and spectators frequently complain
about its lack of space, Ysern said. During multiple rain delays
last week, thousands of tennis fans found themselves stranded
outside, unable to find cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wimbledon and Melbourne Park, where the Australian Open is
played, each cover close to 50 acres, while the U.S. Open has
34.5 acres of land at Flushing Meadows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players don&#8217;t want the tournament to move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think that Roland Garros has a longstanding history,
which is here,&#8221; four-time champion Rafael Nadal said last week.
&#8220;Roland Garros should remain here, because here we can breathe
the history of tennis within these walls. It&#8217;s very important,
whereas if we move elsewhere, maybe the site is going to be
bigger, we&#8217;re going to lose part of our soul.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper may rise to $7,755 a metric
ton and crude oil to $93 a barrel by the end of the year as
economic growth spurs demand for raw materials, according to
Jeffrey Currie, London-based global head of commodities research
at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platinum will climb to $1,830 an ounce by the end of the
year as returns for commodities from the SP GSCI Enhanced Total
Return Index are 17.6 percent in 12 months, Currie said in an
interview on May 27. Oil consumption in China so far this year
is 1.3 million barrels a day, exceeding Goldman Sachs&#8217;s forecast
of 700,000 barrels a day, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you look at the underlying fundamentals, whether
it&#8217;s macroeconomic data or commodity-specific data, the
fundamental picture is still very strong,&#8221; Currie, who has
followed commodities for 20 years, said. &#8220;With copper, the
fundamentals are outright rock solid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for delivery in three months was at $6,737 a ton at
8:25 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange, indicating a 15 percent
increase in prices to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s target by year-end. Crude
oil is at about $73 a barrel, 27 percent below the bank&#8217;s
projection, and platinum is at $1,559 an ounce, 17 percent below
its year-end projection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GSCI Total Return Index of 24 commodities dropped 13
percent in May, led by a 19 percent decline in nickel and 17
percent drop in lead as Europe sought to control debts and China
took steps to curb growth. Speculators in New York oil and
product futures reduced their net-long position in the two weeks
ended May 18 by 121 million barrels, the most on record,
according to Goldman Sachs estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net effect of all austerity programs such as in Greece
and Spain against the fiscal easing programs such as in Germany
will be a net positive 0.2 percent boost to Europe&#8217;s economic
growth this year, Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are any commodities to avoid, they are natural
gas, aluminum, nickel, soybeans and wheat, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long position is a bet on higher prices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s stocks may &#8220;meander&#8221; at
current levels for the next few months on concern that policy
tightening and Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will derail global growth,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Jing Ulrich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the near term, we still remain quite cautious on both
A shares and H shares because you still have a lot of
uncertainty in China,&#8221; Ulrich, chairwoman of China equities and
commodities at JPMorgan, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview, referring to yuan-denominated Chinese stocks and
those traded in Hong Kong. &#8220;Globally, in Europe, people are
beginning to question the global economic recovery, whether
that&#8217;s intact,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index lost 9.7 percent last month,
the most since August, and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
retreated 5.6 percent as the government raised bank reserve
requirements for a third time this year and Europe stepped up
measures to cut budget deficits. Europe is China&#8217;s biggest
export destination, making up 20 percent of total overseas sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese manufacturing expanded at a slower pace in May,
data showed today, adding to signs that growth may moderate in
the world&#8217;s third-biggest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real estate closings in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in
May plunged as contract numbers dropped by as much as 70 percent
from April, the Shanghai Securities News reported today, citing
data from a local property website, a property agent and the
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property Curbs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re certainly seeing momentum slowing. Back in mid
April, the Chinese government introduced a series of measures to
tighten control of the property sector,&#8221; Ulrich said. &#8220;Since
then we&#8217;ve seen transaction volumes fall, we&#8217;ve seen the stock
market correcting and in the meantime, I think the sentiment is
spilling over to the industrial sector as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks will only rally when government policy stabilizes
and &#8220;uncertainties&#8221; removed, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two weeks of April, the government raised
mortgage rates and down payment ratios, barred lending for
third-home purchases and ordered tighter scrutiny of developers&#8217;
financing to restrain property prices that surged 11.7 percent
in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index fell to 53.9 from 55.7 in
April, the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today.
That was less than the median 54.5 estimate in a Bloomberg News
economist survey. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion. A
separate purchasing managers&#8217; index from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics fell to 52.7 in May from 55.2 in April. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging markets may extend this
year&#8217;s declines as China cuts dependence on fixed-asset
investment, lowering demand for commodities, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Adrian Mowat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to get a further correction,&#8221; Mowat, chief
Asian strategist at JPMorgan, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview today. &#8220;What we expect to happen is bulk commodity
demand is going to weaken as China rebalances away from building
lots of infrastructure and real estate towards consumption.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 756-stock MSCI Emerging Markets Index may fall 8.8
percent from current levels to 840, said Hong Kong-based Mowat,
who&#8217;s ranked third for Asian equity strategy in Institutional
Investor&#8217;s annual survey. Mowat&#8217;s forecast contrasts with
investor Antoine van Agtmael, who said yesterday developing-
nation stocks are probably &#8220;past the worst point&#8221; for the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developing-nation gauge has declined 7.6 percent in
2010 on concern widening fiscal deficits in Europe and China&#8217;s
property-market curbs will slow global growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s stocks have led regional declines. The benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index is down 22 percent this year, trailing
only Greece, Cyprus and Spain among the 93 global stock gauges
tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of six metals traded on the London Metal Exchange,
which includes copper, aluminum and nickel, has retreated 11
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further declines in bulk commodity prices could lead to
&#8220;another down leg&#8221; in emerging markets as countries such as
Brazil, Russia and Indonesia depend on raw-material production,
said Mowat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Agtmael, who coined the term &#8220;emerging markets&#8221; in
1981, said in a Bloomberg Television interview the global
economy will avoid slipping back into recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current slowdown in China is also &#8220;expected,&#8221; given
the pace of recovery and efforts to curb overheating in the
property market, he said. China&#8217;s purchasing managers&#8217; index
released this week showed manufacturing expanded at a slower
pace than estimated in May, adding to concern that the world&#8217;s
third-largest economy may decelerate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has raised reserve requirements for banks, increased
mortgage rates and barred loans for purchases of multiple homes
to curb property prices, which rose a record 12.8 percent in
April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real estate closings in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in
May plunged as contract numbers dropped by as much as 70 percent
from April, Shanghai Securities reported this week, citing data
from a local property website, a property agent and the
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see countless policies designed to slow down the
property market and to slow down fixed-asset investment,&#8221; said
Mowat. This shift towards a consumption-driven economy is
&#8220;rather bad news for commodities, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. aims to almost double
annual retail sales of licensed merchandise in five to seven
years after buying comic-book and film maker Marvel
Entertainment in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Products licensed by Disney may reach $50 billion in sales,
compared with $27 billion in fiscal 2009, Andrew Mooney, head of
the Burbank, California-based company&#8217;s consumer-products
division, said today on a webcast presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to open a redesigned store in New York&#8217;s
Times Square this fall as the U.S. continues to recover from the
recession, Mooney said. Disney&#8217;s media networks, the biggest
division, contributed 71 percent of operating income last year,
compared with 9 percent from consumer products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Products tied to &#8220;Toy Story 3,&#8221; in theaters June 18, will
sell $2.4 billion in related merchandise, Mooney said. &#8220;Cars&#8221;
has averaged $2 billion annually in retail sales of branded
products since its 2006 release. A &#8220;Cars&#8221; sequel, due in
theaters next year, may set a record for merchandise sales, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, climbed $1.41,
or 4.2 percent, to $34.74 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares have gained 7.7 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s largest
media company, went on trial over claims it cheated the U.K.
creator of the &#8220;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&#8221; game show
through self-dealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celador International Ltd. sued Disney six years ago,
alleging Disney&#8217;s Buena Vista Television unit broke an implied
promise by failing to negotiate a higher license fee with
Disney&#8217;s ABC television network after the show proved a hit.
Celador says that prevented Buena Vista from making a bigger
profit it would have had to share with the creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They agreed that BVT would only be paid enough money to
cover the cost of making the show and BVT would never make a
profit,&#8221; Roman Silberfeld, a lawyer for Celador, said today
during his opening statement in federal court in Riverside,
California. &#8220;When they got through making their secret deal,
the ad revenue was shielded, no one could ever get to it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quiz show came on the air in the U.S. in 1999 and
helped lift ABC to first place from third in audience ratings in
2000, prompting the network to run the program four times a
week. &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; was first broadcast in the U.K. in 1998
and has been carried in 106 countries, including Australia,
India, Japan, Germany and Russia, Celador said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share of Profit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Celador entered into an agreement with Buena
Vista, a production and distribution unit of Disney, and ABC in
1998 that entitled the creators to a share of the profit from
the show in North America, according to a 2006 amended
complaint. Silberfeld said Buena Vista made an &#8220;implied promise&#8221;
in the agreement to &#8220;act in good faith&#8221; to obtain the highest
possible price for the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Celador said in its lawsuit, ABC paid below-market
value for &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; because Buena Vista, at Disney&#8217;s
behest, didn&#8217;t seek a higher fee after the show became a
success. The creators also claim Disney, using an affiliated
production company, inflated production costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creators seek more than $200 million in damages for the
network run of &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; as well as $16 million for
merchandising, Silberfeld said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s lawyer Martin Katz responded in his opening
statement that Buena Vista has shopped the show to other
networks who weren&#8217;t interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Buena Vista took the financial risk and there was no
secret deal between Buena Vista and ABC,&#8221; Katz said. &#8220;The
division of rights between ABC and BTV is just how one would
expect division of rights to be,&#8221; Katz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celador so far has received $19.2 million in production
fees for the shows, $13 million for the network broadcasts, $6.2
million for syndicated shows, Katz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Celador International Ltd. v. Walt Disney Co.,
04-3541, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Riverside.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. isn&#8217;t considering
delaying sales of its DVDs to video-rental kiosk operator Redbox
as other studios have, Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger, speaking at a conference sponsored by Sanford C.
Bernstein today, said Disney hasn&#8217;t seen any cannibalization of
new DVD sales from Coinstar Inc.&#8217;s Redbox, which rents movies
for $1 a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney has a higher ratio between box-office and home
entertainment sales than rivals who are delaying titles to
Redbox, Iger said. Redbox agreed to begin carrying discs 28 days
after DVDs from Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s Warner Bros. and Universal
Studios go on sale. In return, Redbox receives discounts that
are unacceptable to Disney, Iger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would not have made as much money,&#8221; Iger said.
&#8220;Selling them units at a 50 percent reduction in cost, or
whatever the proposition, even for the 28-day window was not an
equation that made sense to us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, gained $1.09 to
$34.42 at 12:20 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares climbed 3.4 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG LLC in New York,
criticized Iger today in a report for allowing &#8220;Alice in
Wonderland&#8221; to be available in Redbox kiosks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A key thesis behind our buy rating on Disney is the
dramatic improvement we expect in studio&#160;entertainment&#160;over the
coming year,&#8221; Greenfield wrote. &#8220;Disney should want us to buy,
not rent for $1/day.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Ian Henderson,
manager of $7 billion in natural-resource assets, sold about a
quarter of his combined Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd.
holdings on concern a proposed Australian tax will curb growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to say we&#8217;ve reduced our Australian exposure,&#8221;
Henderson said in a phone interview today. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a wake-up
call frankly. I had not thought that the changes in Australia
would be quite as drastic as they are proposed to be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia last month said it planned to impose a 40 percent
tax on mining company profits from 2012 to raise A$12 billion
($10 billion) in the first two years of the changes. Rio, BHP
and Xstrata Plc are reviewing the viability of some projects in
the country and are pressing for changes to the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It clearly does reduce the attractions of developing new
projects in Australia and indeed investing in Australian-based
mining ventures,&#8221; Henderson, who has been a fund manager with
JPMorgan since 1991, said from London. &#8220;It has made people
aware of the potential for these industries to be used as milk
cows by governments. That has altered the risk profile for the
mining industry probably for quite a long time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio, the third-largest mining company, had been Henderson&#8217;s
top holding, comprising about 4.5 percent of his funds,
including the Global Natural Resources Fund. The stake in the
company &#8220;has been reduced by about $100 million,&#8221; he said. The
fund returned 111 percent in 2009, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Henderson cut stakes in companies with Australian
assets shortly after the tax plan was announced, he has raised
holdings of gold miners. Prices of the metal are up 11 percent
this year and reached a record $1,249.40 an ounce on May 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying Gold &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our gold exposure has gone up over the past couple of
months,&#8221; Henderson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the companies likely to be affected by the taxation
plan, Henderson also made a &#8220;reasonably significant&#8221; reduction
in his holdings of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortescue, Australia&#8217;s third-largest iron ore exporter, put
about $15 billion of projects on hold because of the plan, the
Perth-based company said May 19. AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., the
world&#8217;s third-largest gold producer, will also cut exploration
spending in the country if the tax is approved, Chief Executive
Officer Mark Cutifani said today by phone from Canberra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio, based in London, fell 1.4 percent to 3,107.5 pence by
12:31 p.m. in the city and has dropped 7.9 percent since the
plan was announced on May 2. Melbourne-based BHP declined 1.7
percent and is down 8.9 percent from May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio yesterday said it was paying its &#8220;fair share&#8221; of
taxes after contributing more than $20 billion in the past
decade. Xstrata Chief Executive Officer Mick Davis said the
proposed levy may prompt companies to cancel investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immovable Feast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Resources are immovable but diversified mining companies
have a choice of countries in which to invest,&#8221; Davis wrote in
a letter today in the Financial Times. &#8220;Investments in
Australian resources are at risk of being delayed or
cancelled.&#8221; Xstrata is based in Zug, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Kevin Rudd yesterday vowed to push ahead
with his proposals, which will apply to profits on resource
projects above the long-term bond rate, currently about 6
percent. Australia is the biggest exporter of coal and iron ore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission attorney David J. Gottesman, who represented the
agency in a 2005 fraud case against two former America Online
Inc. executives, may join the regulator&#8217;s suit claiming Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. misled investors in mortgage-linked securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC yesterday asked U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones
in Manhattan to admit Gottesman to the case, court documents
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gottesman was the SEC&#8217;s trial attorney in a case against
two former executives at AOL, the Internet advertising company
spun off from Time Warner Inc., and three former executives of
PurchasePro Inc. The SEC accused them of improperly inflating
PurchasePro&#8217;s revenue through fictitious contracts with AOL,
according to SEC documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC dropped its case against one of the former AOL
executives and a civil jury found the other not liable on the
SEC&#8217;s allegations of securities fraud, according to court
documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One former PurchasePro executive was found liable on SEC
claims of aiding and abetting in securities fraud, one was found
not liable and a former chief executive officer was fined $3
million after being found in violation of securities laws,
according to SEC and court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings last year,
and a company executive director, Fabrice Tourre, were sued in
April by the SEC, which alleged that the firm wasn&#8217;t forthcoming
about the role that a hedge fund, Paulson  Co., played in
selecting and betting the mortgage-linked securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Cohrs, co-head of investment
banking at Deutsche Bank AG, is capping a 15-year career at the
German lender just as it becomes a global leader in mergers and
acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, which for years trailed Wall Street
competitors in the mergers business, is the top takeover adviser
in Europe, No. 3 in Asia, and fourth in the U.S., the biggest
MA market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Globally,
the Frankfurt-based bank ranks fourth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working at this for a decade,&#8221; said Cohrs,
53, in an interview at the firm&#8217;s offices in London&#8217;s financial
district. &#8220;It&#8217;s an ongoing build-up, but people are taking us
seriously as someone they trust for advice, not just someone to
turn to for loans, debt, equity or asset finance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohrs, who joined Deutsche Bank from S.G. Warburg in 1995
and has run investment banking with Anshu Jain since 2004, is
planning to retire in coming weeks, Bloomberg Businessweek
reports in its June 7 issue, citing two people with knowledge of
the situation. Jain, 47, head of sales and trading, the bank&#8217;s
biggest moneymaker, is likely to assume his responsibilities,
which also include equity offerings and loan products, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because an announcement
hasn&#8217;t been made. Cohrs declined to discuss his departure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s new motion-
detecting video gaming device, being shown at an electronics
conference this month, may help revive slowing sales of its Xbox
console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code-named Natal, the device will be an add-on to the Xbox
360, which has shipped 40&#160;million units in five years and trails
only Nintendo Co.&#8217;s Wii. Natal sits in front of the TV and has
built-in sensors, letting users play games without a controller.
Natal picks up the motion while gamers drive a pretend car or
swing a virtual baseball bat, Bloomberg Businessweek reports in
its June 7 issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinvigorating Xbox&#160;360 sales may help Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft delay having to field a new machine, which would
lose hundreds of millions of dollars for a few years. Xbox sales
have slowed since Sony Corp. cut the price of the PlayStation 3
console last summer. Natal&#8217;s technology is another step in
Microsoft&#8217;s decade-long push to move beyond PCs and into game
consoles, music players and smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re going to see a bunch of third party games to take
advantage of the Natal technology,&#8221; says Katherine Egbert, an
analyst with Jeffries  Co. in San Francisco. &#8220;This will create
a product cycle for the gaming division without a new console.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer said his company has lost ground in mobile
phone software as rivals Apple Inc. and Google Inc. advanced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We missed a whole cycle,&#8221; Ballmer said today during a
technology conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. He
didn&#8217;t give a timeframe. At the same time, Apple has &#8220;done a
good job&#8221; and Google&#8217;s Android has become a &#8220;real
competitor,&#8221; the executive said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft last week announced the resignation of Robbie Bach as head of the division that sells software for mobile
devices, following the company&#8217;s share losses to Apple and other
new entrants. Microsoft aims to revive growth with its own
mobile phone -- a first for the Redmond, Washington-based
company -- and a new Windows mobile program later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another competitor, Research In Motion Ltd., has done well
expanding the audience for its BlackBerry among consumers,
Ballmer said at the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier during his on-stage interview, the executive said
technology spending by businesses is rebounding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At least for now, we continue to see developed countries&#8217;
business coming back,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in April
that the company is seeing signs of improvement in demand and
businesses had started spending on personal computers again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Ballmer said last week on a trip to Singapore that
any economic problems in Europe will have a &#8220;ripple impact&#8221;
elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 40 cents to $26.86 as of 4 p.m. New York
time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have fallen 12
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy September
Eurodollar futures contracts because the recent increase in the
rate banks say they pay for three-month loans in dollars may
have gone too far, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks&#8217; need for dollar funding in peripheral European
nations such as Spain and Italy is less than the market
understands, according to a note today from JPMorgan strategists
Terry Belton and Alex Roever in New York. They assigned a 99.45
&#8220;near-term target&#8221; price for the September contracts, which
traded today at 99.245. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of borrowing dollars for three months, known as
the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, was 0.5378
percentage point today, according to the British Bankers&#8217;
Association, up from 0.2519 percentage point March 3. It touched
a 10-month high of 0.5384 percentage point on May 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Absent broader contagion of the sovereign-debt crisis
into core Europe, last month&#8217;s move in forward Libor is
overdone,&#8221; Belton and Roever wrote. &#8220;Our base case remains
that this broader contagion is unlikely.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While banks in the U.K., Germany and Switzerland have
combined dollar-funding needs of an estimated $600 billion,
Spanish banks have a negative $100 billion need, Belton and
Roever wrote, citing data from the Bank of International
Settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks in peripheral European countries would respond to
higher Libor rates by seeking funding in euros, limiting the
contagion into the dollar Libor market, Belton and Roever wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s London unit
was fined a record 33.3 million pounds ($48.6 million) by
Britain&#8217;s financial regulator for not properly separating client
money from the firm&#8217;s accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An average of $8.6 billion wasn&#8217;t properly segregated by
JPMorgan Securities Ltd. in an error that went undetected for
seven years, the Financial Services Authority said in a
statement today. As much as $23 billion of client money held by
the bank&#8217;s futures and options business wasn&#8217;t put in separate
overnight customer accounts between 2002 and 2009, the FSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which
roiled financial markets worldwide in 2008, forced the FSA to
put financial companies on notice that they must properly
separate client funds. New York-based Lehman&#8217;s creditors filed
more than $830 billion of claims and regulators worldwide are
trying to unravel how money moved through its global units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FSA has repeatedly emphasized the importance of
ensuring that client money is adequately protected,&#8221; said
Margaret Cole, the FSA&#8217;s enforcement director. &#8220;This penalty
sends out a strong message to firms of all sizes that they must
ensure client money is segregated in accordance with FSA rules.
Firms need to sit up and take notice of this action -- we have
several more cases in the pipeline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had the company gone bankrupt, clients could have lost all
their money because they would have been unsecured creditors
rather than having the right to claim back money from ring-
fenced accounts, according to the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced Fine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman David Wells declined to comment. The New
York-based bank escaped a 47.6 million-pound fine by cooperating
with the regulator, according to the FSA&#8217;s statement. No clients
lost money, and the mistake didn&#8217;t affect the bank&#8217;s financial
reporting, the FSA said. JPMorgan said in August that it may
have mixed 8.5 billion pounds of clients&#8217; money with its own
funds, and that it hired KPMG LLP to review its accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breach was &#8220;regretful,&#8221; according to an internal memo
by JPMorgan Securities Chief Executive Officer Daniel Pinto and
obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlement involves us paying a fine based on a fixed
formula of 1 percent of the average amount of client money held
by our FO business,&#8221; Pinto said in the memo. &#8220;As the FSA
acknowledges, JPMorgan Securities Ltd. is one of the largest
holders of client money in the U.K., and the size of the fine
reflects that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Patently Inconsistent&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error stemmed from the 2000 merger of JPMorgan  Co.
with the Chase Manhattan Corp., according to the FSA&#8217;s
investigative report. After the merger the combined treasury
function didn&#8217;t recognize client money from the futures and
options business, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator said in January that two firms that it didn&#8217;t
identify faced a penalty after the FSA started investigations
into how they held client money. Those inquiries were started at
the same time as a London judge ruled that the FSA&#8217;s client-
money rules were &#8220;patently inconsistent and flawed&#8221; in a case
over the administration of Lehman&#8217;s European unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator said at the time that it would consult on
changes to parts of its rulebook, specifically over transfer
arrangements and on firms keeping buffers that could top up
client-money accounts. Proposals are scheduled later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The client-money regime was neglected by the FSA prior to
the financial crisis,&#8221; said Darren Fox, a regulatory lawyer at
Simmons  Simmons advising a hedge fund in the Lehman case. &#8220;I
wonder whether today&#8217;s fine is symptomatic of the FSA&#8217;s guilty
conscience in relation to the Lehman client-money failings, for
which the FSA received a fair bit of flak.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tougher Approach &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s fine is nearly twice as much the then-record 17
million-pound fine levied against Royal Dutch Shell Plc in 2004
for market abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency has said fines will increase as part of its new
tougher approach following the financial crisis. In some cases,
penalty size will triple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s coalition government has said it will merge some
of the FSA&#8217;s enforcement powers with other prosecutors to form a
white-collar crime agency even in the wake of increased
penalties and criminal cases filed by the FSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA may also lose its independence to the Bank of
England and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is
considering scrapping it, the Guardian newspaper reported today,
citing government sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s good to see they&#8217;re doing their job; they&#8217;ve got to
crack down on abuses,&#8221; Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat
lawmaker who is the coalition government&#8217;s business secretary,
said of today&#8217;s fine in a Bloomberg TV interview. &#8220;The basic
point, which I know the chancellor is trying to ensure, is that
the Bank of England has proper oversight of systemic risk. How
you do it administratively is not an easy task.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the uncertainty, the FSA enforcement team separately
suffered a defeat today with its first loss of an insider-
trading trial. Two lawyers and a former chief financial officer
were cleared today by a London court in the regulator&#8217;s fourth
criminal case of insider dealing to reach jury trial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Henderson, who manages about $7
billion in natural-resource assets at JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
added to his holdings in gold mining companies in the last two
months as the metal advanced to a record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of precious-metal and diamond mining companies now
account for 39 percent of holdings, Henderson said in an
interview from London yesterday. His funds reduced holdings in
companies with links to Australia after the government announced
a mining tax, freeing up cash for the gold purchases, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold climbed to a record $1,249.40 an ounce on May 14 and
is set for a 10th consecutive annual advance, the longest
winning streak since at least 1920. Fund managers including
George Soros and John Paulson bought bullion as investors sought
to protect themselves from plunging stock markets after the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 and this
year&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gold mining stocks are as cheap as they&#8217;ve been for a
long time because for the first time in years they are making
proper profits,&#8221; Henderson said. Gold and precious metals
accounted for 34.1 percent of holdings at the end of April, he
said at a conference in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrick Gold Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest gold mining
company, is trading at 18.9 times earnings, down from as much as
26.6 times in December, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
Toronto-based company in April reported first-quarter profit
that beat analysts&#8217; estimates. Newmont Mining Corp., the largest
U.S. gold producer, trades at 16.4 times earnings, down from
26.7 times in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Strongest Since 1970s&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gold in portfolios is the strongest it&#8217;s been since the
1970s,&#8221; Henderson said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henderson&#8217;s 1.9 billion-euro ($2.3 billion) Gl obal Natural
Resources fund and 1.95 billion-pound ($2.9 billion) U.K.
Natural Resources own shares in both Barrick and Newmont.
Barrick has climbed 8.1 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange
this year and Newmont is up 18 percent in New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henderson also reduced holdings in uranium mining
companies on expectations that supply will continue to outpace
demand, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uranium was at $40.75 a pound this week, according to
Roswell, Georgia-based Ux Consulting Co. The metal, used in
nuclear reactors, reached a record $136 a pound in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investments in energy companies account for about 27
percent of the assets in Henderson&#8217;s funds, with about 29
percent in iron ore and industrial metals and the rest in
fertilizers and agriculture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
forecast for U.S. payrolls in May to 600,000 from a prior
estimate of 500,000, the company&#8217;s chief U.S. economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note today to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government probably hired 450,000 temporary workers to
conduct the census, 100,000 more than the firm&#8217;s previous
estimate, Hatzius said. Goldman&#8217;s estimate for private sector
hiring held at 150,000. It also forecasts the unemployment rate
will fall to 9.7 percent from 9.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast the Labor
Department will report tomorrow that payrolls climbed by 523,000
in May, boosted by census hiring. Estimates ranged from 220,000
to 750,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private payrolls probably rose 178,000 after a gain of
231,000 in April, according to the survey median. The
unemployment rate fell to 9.8 percent, the survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;

analyst at the bank, wrote in an e-mailed report today. The loss
attributable to shareholders comes after a year-earlier profit
of 10 billion dirhams ($2.7 billion), the company said June 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cash generation from hotels and rental portfolio, value
associated with Jumeirah and telecom stakes,&#8221; should enable the
company to refinance near-term debt, Nazim wrote. &#8220;We do not
expect DHCOG to restructure its debt, unlike its sister
entities, Dubai International Capital and Dubai Group.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai International Capital, an investment unit of Dubai
Holding with a $1.25 billion loan due in June, sought a three-
month extension on some of its payments on May 27. Dubai Holding
LLC, Dubai Holding Commercial&#8217;s parent, and its units owe banks
$12 billion and have begun talks to roll over some loans, a
person with knowledge of the matter said on May 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai Holding Commercial, a real-estate and hospitality
company owned by the emirate&#8217;s ruler, reported this week that
impairment charges for the year almost tripled to 22.5 billion
dirhams. The company&#8217;s &#8220;liquidity appears tight&#8221; and it may
have to &#8220;resort to additional borrowing, potentially from its
parent Dubai Holding to plug liquidity gap this year,&#8221; JPMorgan
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s $500 million floating-rate note due February
2012 rose 0.5 cents to 78 cents on the dollar as of 6 p.m. in
Dubai, up from 77.5 cents yesterday, according to Bloomberg bond
trader composite prices. The price has surged about 84 percent
since reaching a low on Dec. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai Holding Commercial has about $4.08 billion of debt
outstanding, according to JPMorgan. The company needs to roll
over a $555 million loan maturing next month, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haemonetics Corp.&#8217;s patent-
infringement victory against a former unit of Baxter
International Inc. over disposable kits used for collecting
blood was reversed yesterday by a U.S. appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington said a trial judge erred in his interpretation of the
Haemonetics patent 6,705,983, and sent the case back for review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haemonetics, based in Braintree, Massachusetts, had won a
$15.7 million verdict against Fenwal Inc., the former Baxter
unit, and an order that halted sales of Fenwal&#8217;s ALYX kits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haemonetics&#8217; case was argued by Thomas J. Parker of
Atlanta&#8217;s Alston  Bird LLP. Gregory A. Castanias of Cleveland&#8217;s
Jones Day argued on behalf of the Baxter unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Haemonetics v. Baxter Healthcare, 09-01557,

&lt;p&gt;Hasbro Sues Buzz Bee, Claims Three Toy Patents Infringed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasbro Inc., the toymaker second in size only to Mattel
Inc., sued a competitor for patent infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buzz Bee Toys Inc. of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, is accused
of infringing patents 5,471,967 and 5,611,322. These patents,
which were issued in December 1995 and March 1997 respectively,
cover a pistol-like device from which donut-shaped disks can be
fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two patents are the property of Toybox Corp. and
licensed exclusively to Hasbro, according to the complaint filed
June 2 in federal court in Springfield, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East Longmeadow, Massachusetts-based Hasbro claims Buzz
Bee&#8217;s Air Zone Ring Accelerator infringed the patent. Buzz Bee
&#8220;knowingly and willfully infringed&#8221; the patent, Hasbro said in
its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buzz Bee is also accused of infringing a third patent, RE
39,947, which covers a toy water gun. That patent, which was
issued in December 2007, was issued to Johnson Research and
Development Co. and is also exclusively licensed to Hasbro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Water Warrior Vanquisher and Water Warrior Vindicator
products made by Buzz Bee infringe this patent, Hasbro said in
its pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts company claims that Buzz Bee &#8220;will not
cease committing the wrongful acts&#8221; without intervention by the
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasbro, which claims it had been damaged by Buzz Bee&#8217;s
&#8220;wrongful acts,&#8221; asked the court to bar further infringement
of the three patents. The company also asked for attorney fees
and money damages &#8220;not limited to a reasonable royalty and/or
lost profits and price erosion,&#8221; and requested the damages be
tripled to punish Buzz bee for its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representing Hasbro are Joshua C. Krumholz, Elizabeth R.
Burkhard and Peter J. Kirk of New York&#8217;s Holland  Knight LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hasbro Inc., v. Buzz Bee, 3:10-cv-10906-MAP,
U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Springfield). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo Recalls Patent Applications After Researcher Is Fired &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo Clinic, a non-profit medical research group based in
Rochester, Minnesota, has withdrawn patent applications and
halted commercialization efforts relating to a cancer-fighting
antibody molecule, the Rochester Post-Bulletin reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent applications were called back after the clinic
found a researcher&#8217;s results couldn&#8217;t be duplicated, accused the
researcher of scientific fraud and fired him, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fired researcher denied the charges, according to the
Post-Bulletin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the patent applications, Mayo is retracting
between 15 and 17 scholarly articles in nine scientific journals
relating to the researcher&#8217;s work, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation Key to Economic Recovery, U.S. Patent Director Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protecting intellectual property, &#8220;the global currency of
innovation,&#8221; is central to the ability of the U.S. to recover
from the recession and create jobs, the nation&#8217;s top patent and
trademark officer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we don&#8217;t wake up, fast-developing competitors will
continue to appropriate American ideas, products, and
services,&#8221; David Kappos, 49, director of the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, said in a speech to the Center for American
Progress in Washington yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kappos, taking a cue from President Barack Obama&#8217;s push to
encourage American ingenuity as a way of reducing unemployment,
said patents protect new ideas and enable companies to hire
workers and invest in their businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We simply must do better to protect America&#8217;s competitive
advantage in innovation before it is too late,&#8221; Kappos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama, since taking office in January 2009 amid the worst
recession since the Great Depression, has repeatedly said the
nation needs to invest more in education, innovation and energy
development to improve the economy. The U.S. has shed about 8
million jobs since the recession began in December 2007, with
almost half those losses occurring after Obama took office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-quarters of U.S. economic growth following World War
II came from technological innovations, Kappos said, and two out
of three American jobs are created from newly patented
inventions. That history makes it important to implement changes
that make the patent office more efficient, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kappos, a former assistant general counsel for
International Business Machines Corp., took over the patent
office in August. At his confirmation hearing in July, he
pledged to tackle the agency&#8217;s budget shortfall because of a
decrease in fees from patents and applications, and deal with a
backlog of more than 700,000 applications awaiting review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency has developed a program to cut 12 months off the
application process for technology that promotes renewable
energy and environmental improvements, and is considering
expanding the program to other industries, Kappos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Gets DMCA Takedown Letter from Porn Site Operator &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazzers Entertainment, which bills itself as &#8220;the world&#8217;s
best porn site,&#8221; sent a notice to Google Inc. demanding content
located at 20 web pages be taken down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter alleges its adult video series -- with titles
that imply a focus on large breasts -- is infringed by a blog
site that has distributed Brazzers&#8217; passwords without
authorization. The offending blog site has several pages headed
&#8220;cracked porn passes, and &#8220;most wanted porn sites,&#8221; according
to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The takedown request is made under the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act, which gives providers immunity for users
copyright infringement if they remove the material
&#8220;expeditiously&#8221; when they get complaints. Under the law,
persons whose information is removed can ask the provider to put
it back if the users believe the complaint is in error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter from counsel for Brazzers is posted on the
Chilling Effects website, which is a joint project of seven law
schools and the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier
Foundation, a digital-rights advocacy group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daddyo&#8217;s Tattoos Sues Daddy-O&#8217;s Tattoos for Infringing Mark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Illinois-based tattoo salon and its proprietor sued a
competitor for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Quidgeon, who does business as Daddyo&#8217;s Tattoos
and Piercings of Centralia, Illinois, has used &#8220;Daddyo&#8217;s
Tattoo&#8221; since May 2003. He registered the mark with the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office in March 2009, according to court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company objects to John Olsen&#8217;s Daddy-O&#8217;s Tattoos Inc.
of Pekin, Illinois-based, which does business as Body Art by
Daddy-O. That company began using the name in June 2009,
Daddyo&#8217;s said in the complaint filed June 1 in federal court in
Peoria, Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having been sent cease and desist letters in August
2009 and February 2010, the Daddy-O&#8217;s continues to use the name,
which is &#8220;nearly identical and confusingly similar to&#8221;
Daddyo&#8217;s, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to confusing the public by its name, Daddy-O&#8217;s
&#8220;faults and imperfections&#8221; in its tattooing and piercing
services &#8220;reflect adversely&#8221; on Daddyo&#8217;s, the company said in
its pleadings. The Centralia-based tattoo business claims the
Pekin tattoo parlor is attempting to deceive potential customers
into thinking that there is an association between the two
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daddyo&#8217;s asked the court to bar the Pekin-based company&#8217;s
use of names that are confusingly similar, and to order removal
of all properties and goods from Daddy-O&#8217;s that contain
infringing trademarks. The company also asked for money damages,
and an award of litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alleging the infringement is deliberate, Daddyo&#8217;s asked
that the damages award be tripled to punish Daddy-O&#8217;s for its
actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daddyo&#8217;s is represented by Christopher W. Byron of Byron
Gerber Petri  Kalb LLC of Edwardsville, Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Quidegeon v. Olsen, 1:10-cv-01168-JBM-BGC, U.S.
District Court, Central District of Illinois (Peoria). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook&#8217;s Muslim Rival Has Similar Features, Designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc.&#8217;s social networking site has a lookalike
aimed at Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based in Lahore, Pakistan, Millatfacebook used the same
shade of blue and a similar font on its pages. It&#8217;s a new social
networking aimed at the &#8220;more than 1.57 billion Muslims and
sweet people from other religions,&#8221; according to the home page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home page bears a copyright notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s Telegraph newspaper reports the Muslim site is
the work of information technology experts who established
MillatFacebook after the country&#8217;s courts banned the original
Facebook for alleged blasphemy for hosting a contest seeking
cartoons of the prophet Mohammed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Trade Secret Claims, Coca-Cola Contracted Released &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coca-Cola Co.&#8217;s 2008 contract with Ohio State
University was released with all the financial information
intact after weeks of negotiations, the school&#8217;s Lantern student
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier both the school and the soft drink company claimed
the financial details were trade secrets, the Lantern reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2008 contract specified that Atlanta-based Coca-cola
would pay $10 in upfront royalty fees, $13.7 million in annual
royalty fees, and $8.5 million in guaranteed vending commissions
in return for its exclusive contract with the school, according
to the Lantern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other schools have also released contract details,
including $38 million from Coca-cola for the University of
Minnesota, and $15 million for the University of Arizona, the
Lantern reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KL Gates Adds NASCAR Licensing Expert to IP Practice Group &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KL Gates LLP added to its IP practice by hiring a lawyer
from the NASCAR racing circuit, the Pittsburgh-based firm said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Chad Warpula joins the firm from Dale Earnhardt
Inc., and Earnhardt Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates LLC where
he was executive vice president and general counsel. He has also
served as general counsel to the Chip Ganassi Racing Teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has served as lead legal adviser to more than a dozen
NASCAR teams to develop an industry licensing trust that
consolidated and restructured the licensing models for National
Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, team, and driver IP
rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the IP elements at his previous jobs,
Warpula was also involved in corporate structuring and
governance, litigation and dispute resolution and real estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will practice from the firm&#8217;s Charlotte, North Carolina
office. Although NASCAR is based in Daytona Beach, Florida, the
association has offices in North Carolina, as are most of the
teams that race on its circuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warpula has an undergraduate degree from Harding University
and a law degree from Wake Forest University. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
analyst who fled while on probation for leading a $6.7 million
insider-trading scheme was ordered to pay a $27.7 million
judgment in a lawsuit filed by federal regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan said David
Pajcin is in default because he failed to respond to three
amended civil complaints filed by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood ruled that Pajcin, one of six men convicted in the
case, should pay $7.7 million in a default judgment and $20
million in civil penalties. She also granted the SEC&#8217;s request
to ban him from the securities industry. A warrant for Pajcin&#8217;s
arrest was issued when he disappeared in 2008 after helping
prosecutors convict his accomplices and serving about two years
in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pajcin, of Clifton, New Jersey, traded on leaks from a
Merrill Lynch  Co. analyst and workers at a factory printing
BusinessWeek magazine, the U.S. said. He cooperated with
prosecutors soon after the U.S. opened a probe in 2005 and
pleaded guilty in 2006, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was sentenced in January 2008 to about two years in
prison -- time he&#8217;d already served -- in light of his
cooperation. He stopped reporting to his probation officer and
the arrest warrant was issued in November 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His lawyer, Jesse Siegel, couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Pajcin,
05-CV-6991, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Loses Minnesota Trial for Nonprofit Investor Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. must pay $30.1 million to four Minnesota
nonprofits that claimed the bank marketed a risky securities-
lending program as safe and blocked them from getting out of the
investments, a jury said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Workers&#8217; Compensation Reinsurance Association
and three charitable foundations sued in St. Paul, Minnesota, in
2008, claiming the bank failed to disclose the deteriorating
value of the investments until it was too late. The nonprofits
sought more than $400 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A St. Paul state court jury yesterday awarded $30.1 million
in compensatory damages, finding Wells Fargo liable for breach
of fiduciary duty and violations of the Minnesota consumer fraud
act. The jury will consider punitive damages in a second phase
set to begin tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is one of multiple complaints alleging U.S. banks
purchased illiquid securities for clients. The U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission said in September it is examining
whether banks that engage in securities lending make adequate
disclosures to pension-fund clients. Wells Fargo denied it made
any misrepresentations or pushed risky investments, blaming any
losses on the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Ciresi, the nonprofits&#8217; lawyer, said he couldn&#8217;t
comment because the trial isn&#8217;t over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ciresi asked the jury yesterday in closing arguments for
$374 million to cover the value of the securities at the time
the plaintiffs demanded their return, and about $30 million
additional damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury rejected the plaintiffs&#8217; claim that Wells Fargo
deprived them of their property, an allegation called
conversion, which could have triggered an award equal to the
worth of the securities. The jury awarded a total of $14.1
million for breach of fiduciary duty and $4 million to each
plaintiff on the consumer fraud claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that the jury denied the plaintiffs the
amount of damages they were seeking, which was radically above
the investment losses incurred, and validated that there was no
breach of contract or conversion by Wells Fargo Securities
Lending,&#8221; said Laura Fay, Wells Fargo spokeswoman, in an e-
mailed message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The investments made by Wells Fargo on behalf of our
clients in the securities lending program were in accordance
with investment guidelines and were prudent and suitable at the
time of purchase,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Workers Compensation Reinsurance Association v.
Wells Fargo Bank, 62-cv-08-10825, District Court, Ramsey County,
Minnesota (St. Paul). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical, Arkema Settle Methacrylate Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical Co., the world&#8217;s largest producer of acrylic
paint ingredients, said it settled a lawsuit filed by a unit of
French business partner Arkema SA over supplies of methyl
methacrylate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arkema Inc. sued Dow Chemical May 10 in Delaware Chancery
Court saying it broke a contract to provide the chemical, used
to make Plexiglas and vehicle tail lights. Dow Chemical blamed
the delivery slowdown on problems at a Deer Park, Texas, plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The matter has been resolved between the parties on
confidential terms and the lawsuit was dismissed,&#8221; Karen
Leinberger, a Dow Chemical spokeswoman, said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Donald Parsons Jr. issued a temporary order last
month to make Dow Chemical continue the supply to Arkema and had
planned further hearings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tight supply of methyl methacrylate continues to be an
industry wide issue,&#8221; Leinberger said. The Texas plant was
fixed and has &#8220;been running at full production rates for more
than a week,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Arkema Inc. v. The Dow Chemical Co., CA5479,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepsi Bottlers Win Judge&#8217;s Approval to Settle Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepsi Bottling Group Inc. and PepsiAmericas Inc. won a
judge&#8217;s permission to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by
investors challenging a buyout bid by PepsiCo Inc., the world&#8217;s
largest snack maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo offered to buy the
remaining shares of its two largest bottlers in April 2009. Six
pension funds sued, seeking more money in the $7.8 billion deal
and agreed to settle for $7.75 million in legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlement is found to be fair, reasonable and
adequate,&#8221; Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine Jr. wrote
in an order June 1. The acquisition was completed in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Dahncke, a PepsiCo spokesman, didn&#8217;t return voice and
e-mail messages seeking comment on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated cases are In re Pepsi Bottling Group Inc.
Shareholders Litigation, CA4526, and In re PepsiAmericas Inc.
Shareholders litigation, CA 4530, Delaware Chancery Court

&lt;p&gt;Former Sequenom Official Lied to Investors, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth A. Dragon, former senior vice president of
research and development at Sequenom Inc., pleaded guilty
yesterday in federal court to conspiracy to commit securities
fraud for lying to investors about the company&#8217;s prenatal test
for Down syndrome, U.S. officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragon admitted to making false claims to investors and
analysts about the effectiveness of the San Diego-based
company&#8217;s test as well as attempting to &#8220;inflate and sustain&#8221;
the price of Sequenom&#8217;s shares, said Laura E. Duffy, the U.S.
Attorney for the Southern District of California in San Diego,
in a statement. Dragon said in a court appearance before U.S.
Magistrate Judge Barbara Major that she and others manipulated
data to make the Down syndrome test appear more accurate than it
was, Duffy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragon also was accused of lying to investors in a civil
complaint filed yesterday in San Diego by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. Dragon settled the claims without
admitting or denying wrongdoing and agreed to be barred from
serving as an officer or director of a public company, according
to the agency&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said a judge will decide a financial penalty for
Dragon. She will be sentenced on the criminal plea on Aug. 30,
according to the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roman E. Darmer, Dragon&#8217;s attorney, did not return a

&lt;p&gt;Former Sucden Financial Broker Fined $146,000 for Market Abuse &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former commodities broker at Sucden Financial Ltd., a
London-based brokerage, was banned and fined by the U.K.
financial regulator for manipulating the coffee futures market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Charles Kerr artificially inflated the price of
coffee futures on the London International Futures and Options
Exchange in 2007, the Financial Services Authority said in a
statement yesterday. The FSA fined Kerr 100,000 pounds
($146,000) and banned him from holding another job at a
financial firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Kerr breached the standards expected of approved persons
and has paid the price,&#8221; Alexander Justham, the FSA&#8217;s director
of markets, said in yesterday&#8217;s statement. &#8220;Participants in the
futures and options markets should be in no doubt about how
seriously the FSA views manipulation which disrupts proper
pricing mechanisms and risks a false market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerr cooperated with the FSA and qualified for a discount
on a fine that would have been 125,000 pounds, the FSA said.
Sucden wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing, according to the regulator.
Kerr stopped working at Sucden in June 2008, according to the
FSA&#8217;s register. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Trial Ordered for Ex-BofA Trader&#8217;s Claim &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of Appeal ordered a trial for former Bank
of America Corp. distressed debt trader Sunny Tadjudin&#8217;s claim
for HK$10.9 million ($1.4 million) in damages over her 2007
firing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lower court&#8217;s decision to strike out her claim that she
was fired by the bank to avoid paying her performance bonus
&#8220;cannot be dismissed offhand,&#8221; Court of Appeal judges Maria
Yuen, William Stone and Azizul Suffiad said yesterday. No trial
date was set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadjudin sued Bank of America in 2008, alleging she was
fired on Aug. 28, 2007, so that her then-manager could avoid
awarding her an annual discretionary bonus and &#8220;thus achieving
a higher bonus for himself,&#8221; according to court documents. The
Court of First Instance in July dismissed her claim and said the
bank wasn&#8217;t bound to pay the bonus under Hong Kong law and the
terms of her contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadjudin, who worked for the bank&#8217;s distressed debt trading
group from June 2000 to August 2007, declined to comment on the
case through her lawyer, William Leung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had argued that the bank had an implied duty to pay
bonuses in a manner that wasn&#8217;t &#8220;irrational, perverse or
arbitrary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very confident that the claim against us will be
held to be without merit,&#8221; said Mark Tsang, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CACV173/2009 in Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of Appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Goes to Trial Over &#8216;Millionaire&#8217; Show Profit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s largest media company, went on
trial over claims it cheated the U.K. creator of the &#8220;Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire&#8221; game show through self-dealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial began yesterday in federal court in Riverside,
California. Celador International Ltd. sued Disney six years
ago, alleging Disney&#8217;s Buena Vista Television unit failed to
negotiate a higher license fee with Disney&#8217;s ABC television
network after the show proved to be a hit, thereby reducing the
profit it was to share with the creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quiz show came on the air in the U.S. in 1999 and
helped boost ABC to first place from third in audience ratings
in 2000, prompting the network to run the program four times a
week. &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; was first broadcast in the U.K. in 1998
and has been carried in 106 countries, including the U.S.,
Australia, India, Japan, Germany and Russia, Celador said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Celador entered into an agreement with Buena
Vista and ABC in 1998 that entitled the creators to a share of
the profit from the show in North America, according to a 2006
amended complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creators said ABC paid below market value for
&#8220;Millionaire&#8221; because Buena Vista, at Disney&#8217;s behest, didn&#8217;t
seek a higher fee after the show became a success. Celador would
have received a share of the higher fee, it said. The creators
also claim Disney, using an affiliated production company,
inflated production costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In essence, Disney sits on both sides of the bargaining
table in any negotiation for the production and distribution
rights to the series, thereby enabling it to manipulate
negotiations in any way that serves its corporate interest,&#8221;
Celador said in its amended complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Burbank, California-
based Disney, declined to comment before the start of the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Celador International Ltd. v. Walt Disney Co.,
04-3541, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Riverside.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Messier, Ex-Vivendi CEO, Admits &#8216;Mistakes&#8217; at Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean-Marie Messier admitted making mistakes while serving
as chief executive officer of Vivendi SA, the water company he
transformed into a global media giant, at the opening of a trial
on charges he misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Did we make mistakes? Yes, and as president I take
responsibility for them,&#8221; Messier said yesterday in Paris,
testifying about his rationale for acquiring companies like
Universal Studios&#8217; owner Seagram Co. for $34 billion in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messier is one of seven defendants at the trial, which
focuses on the $77 billion acquisition spree that almost
bankrupted the 157-year-old company. Messier was ousted by
Vivendi&#8217;s directors in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal probe began after a shareholder group filed a
complaint claiming they were duped into buying or retaining
shares based on overly sanguine financial projections. Messier
faces as much as five years in prison and a fine if found guilty
of disseminating misleading information, misuse of corporate
funds, and share manipulation. He denies the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messier pointed to the success of Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and
Research In Motion Ltd.&#8217;s Blackberry to show he had sound
reasoning for his strategy of uniting content and delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Seagram grew terrifically strongly in the content sector,
it seemed to be an ideal partner,&#8221; Messier said. &#8220;Was this
vision justified? Today, I still don&#8217;t know.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At yesterday&#8217;s opening hearing, Judge Noel Miniconi
reviewed the charges and heard from civil parties including
Vivendi, shareholder lawyers, and defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for former Vivendi Vice Chairman Edgar Bronfman Jr.
and Guillaume Hannezo, former Vivendi chief financial officer,
asked Miniconi to drop insider-trading charges, saying the
evidence didn&#8217;t support the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 200 investors have joined the complaint and another
100 will be added as part of a second list submitted yesterday,
shareholder lawyer Frederik-Karel Canoy said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diebold Executives Accused by SEC of Accounting Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three former senior executives of Diebold Inc. used
fraudulent accounting practices to inflate earnings from at
least 2002 to 2007, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
alleged in a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC also named the company, a maker of bank teller-
machines, in its complaint even as it reached a $25 million
settlement with Diebold, according to an SEC statement. Diebold
said in May 2009 that it had an &#8220;agreement in principle&#8221; to
settle with the SEC, which was completed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diebold&#8217;s financial management received reports comparing
its actual earnings to analyst earnings forecasts and would then
create lists of ways to close the gaps, the SEC said. The
company would improperly recognize revenue or otherwise inflate
Diebold&#8217;s financial performance, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diebold &#8220;regularly manipulated earnings to meet
forecasts,&#8221; the SEC said in the complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC also filed suit in federal court in Ohio against
Gregory Geswein, the company&#8217;s former chief financial officer;
Sandra Miller, the former director of corporate accounting; and
Kevin Krakora, the former controller and later CFO. Only Krakora
is still with the company, said spokesman Michael Jacobsen. The
case against the individuals is continuing, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are deeply disappointed that almost five years after
Mr. Geswein voluntarily left Diebold on his own initiative, the
SEC has made these stale allegations,&#8221; Stephen Scholes, his
attorney, said in a statement. &#8220;Mr. Geswein strongly disputes
the SEC&#8217;s charges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Carney, Krakora&#8217;s attorney at Baker Hostetler LLP in
New York, said Krakora is &#8220;an honest and well-respected
financial professional with an unblemished record for
integrity.&#8221; He disagrees with the SEC&#8217;s allegations, he said in
an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia Davidson, Miller&#8217;s attorney, said her client &#8220;did
nothing wrong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC never should have dragged her into this case,&#8221;
said Davidson. &#8220;We&#8217;re confident the courts will agree.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company hasn&#8217;t admitted or denied any wrongdoing under
its accord, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that the settlement with the SEC is
final,&#8221; said Thomas W. Swidarski, Diebold&#8217;s president and chief
executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walden O&#8217;Dell, Diebold&#8217;s former CEO, agreed to reimburse
the company more than $470,000 in cash bonuses, 30,000 shares of
Diebold stock and 85,000 stock options even though he wasn&#8217;t
accused of misconduct, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Diebold Inc., 10cv908, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pamrapo Bank&#8217;s Campbell Charged With $681,000 Theft &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Campbell, a former managing director of the
investment company of New Jersey-based Pamrapo Savings Bank SLA,
was charged with embezzling more than $681,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campbell, 41, was arrested yesterday and charged with 47
counts of mail fraud and seven counts of money laundering.
Campbell worked for now-defunct Pamrapo Service Corp., a unit
that provided investment services and cleared transactions
through broker-dealers, prosecutors said. He appeared yesterday
in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, where his bail was set
at $250,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campbell offered insurance products and annuities on behalf
of outside companies when he got a &#8220;significant pay cut&#8221; in
August 2006, according to the indictment. In early 2007, he
began to divert fees and commissions to himself that were owed
to Service Corp., according to the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campbell made &#8220;materially false and fraudulent statements
and concealed material facts from the bank, its chief financial
officer, the board, the Service Corporation, and others, to
cover up and conceal his scheme,&#8221; according to the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Campbell indictment accuses him of laundering $90,200
to pay American Express bills. Campbell faces as many as 20
years in prison on each mail fraud count and up to 10 years on
the money laundering charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His attorney, Michael J. Rogers, declined comment outside
of the courtroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Campbell, U.S. District Court, District
of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Examiner Asks Judge to Discharge, Protect Him &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. examiner Anton R. Valukas
asked a judge to discharge him from further duties and protect
him from lawsuits that might arise from his 2,200-page report on
the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ex-federal prosecutor, who was paid $53.5 million for
more than a year&#8217;s work investigating Lehman&#8217;s downfall, also
asked yesterday in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court filing in New York to
be allowed to provide further assistance to Lehman if asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valukas&#8217;s March 11 report spurred lawsuits against Lehman
executives and bankers, just as earlier examiners in
bankruptcies such as Enron Corp. provided ammunition to
litigants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Chief Executive Officer Richard Fuld was sued at
least three times after Valukas said he and other Lehman
executives negligently approved misleading financial statements.
Lehman sued JPMorgan Chase  Co. after Valukas said the bank
helped to make the company illiquid by demanding more
collateral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Fuld and JPMorgan have denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valukas is chairman of the law firm Jenner  Block LLP,
where his clients included David Radler, Hollinger International
Inc.&#8217;s former president. As U.S. attorney in Chicago from 1985
to 1989, he was dubbed the Midwest&#8217;s Rudolph Giuliani for his
hard line on white-collar crime, according to a 1989 New York
Times profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed for bankruptcy in September 2008 listing $639
billion in assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-MAN Turbo Chief Must Stand Trial for Bribery, Court Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former top executive at a MAN SE unit must stand trial
on allegations he paid Kazakh officials more than 9 million
euros ($11 million) in bribes to win orders tied to a gas
pipeline, a Munich court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former chief executive officer of MAN Turbo AG,
identified only as Heinz Juergen M., 66, paid the money to get
access to the Kazakhstan market, according to the indictment.
The bribes were paid in installments between October 2005 and
May 2008. The trial is scheduled to start June 23, the Munich
Regional Court said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN SE, Europe&#8217;s third-largest truckmaker, last year agreed
to pay 150.6 million euros in fines to resolve an investigation
into alleged bribes paid by its truck and turbo units. The
company is 29.9 percent-owned by Volkswagen AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heinz Juergen M.&#8217;s attorneys Thomas Elsner and Sven Thomas
didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC Adds Attorney From AOL Case to Goldman Sachs Subprime Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission attorney David J.
Gottesman, who represented the agency in a 2005 fraud case
against two former America Online Inc. executives, may join the
regulator&#8217;s lawsuit claiming Goldman Sachs Group Inc. misled
investors in mortgage-linked securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC asked U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in
Manhattan June 1 to admit Gottesman to the case, court documents
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gottesman was the SEC&#8217;s trial attorney in a case against
two former executives at AOL, the Internet advertising company
spun off from Time Warner Inc., and three former executives of
PurchasePro Inc. The SEC accused them of improperly inflating
PurchasePro&#8217;s revenue through fictitious contracts with AOL,
according to SEC documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings last year,
and a company executive director, Fabrice Tourre, were sued in
April by the SEC, which alleged that the firm wasn&#8217;t forthcoming
about the role that a hedge fund, Paulson  Co., played in
selecting and betting on the mortgage-linked securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr Gets Public Defender as Conflicted Lawyer Quits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment adviser Kenneth Starr, charged in connection
with a $30 million fraud scheme, was given a public defender
after his private attorney, Joshua Klein, withdrew over a
conflict of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Theodore Katz assigned Peggy Cross to the
case at a hearing yesterday in New York. The magistrate gave
Starr until June 4 to decide if he will hire a new attorney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question is if Mr. Starr has the resources to retain
counsel or get one appointed,&#8221; Katz said. &#8220;He can&#8217;t drag this
matter out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr, 66, the manager of more than $700 million, was
arrested May 27. The adviser, who has represented actors
including Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes, &#8220;systematically
defrauded his clients,&#8221; Robert Beranger, an agent with the
Internal Revenue Service, said in a criminal complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a
court order freezing 23 Starr-related bank accounts, according
to Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klein, who said he was retained to represent Starr in the
criminal case, told Katz that he and his client determined May
28 that his firm, Petrillo Klein LLP, had a conflict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My client is in the process of seeking to retain counsel-
slash-assessing his ability to do so,&#8221; Klein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the hearing, Klein declined to comment on the
conflict. Cross wouldn&#8217;t comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klein asked that the public defender be appointed to help
Starr determine if he qualifies for free court-appointed
counsel, typically used to represent the indigent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr lied to court officials about his net worth after his
arrest, Assistant U.S. Attorney William Harrington told a judge
at a detention hearing. Starr said he only had $350 in cash and
a car worth $1,000, according to Harrington. A condominium
triplex in Manhattan Starr purchased for $7.5 million &#8220;was
bought with other people&#8217;s money,&#8221; Harrington said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Starr, 10-MJ-1135, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
analyst who fled while on probation for leading a $6.7 million
insider-trading scheme was ordered to pay a $27.7 million
judgment in a lawsuit filed by federal regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan said David Pajcin is in default because he failed to respond to three
amended civil complaints filed by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood ruled that Pajcin, one of six men convicted in the
case, should pay $7.7 million in a default judgment and $20
million in civil penalties. She also granted the SEC&#8217;s request
to ban him from the securities industry. A warrant for Pajcin&#8217;s
arrest was issued when he disappeared in 2008 after helping
prosecutors convict his accomplices and serving about two years
in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pajcin, of Clifton, New Jersey, traded on leaks from a
Merrill Lynch  Co. analyst and workers at a factory printing
BusinessWeek magazine, the U.S. said. He cooperated with
prosecutors soon after the U.S. opened a probe in 2005 and
pleaded guilty in 2006, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was sentenced in January 2008 to about two years in
prison -- time he&#8217;d already served -- in light of his
cooperation. He stopped reporting to his probation officer and
the arrest warrant was issued in November 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His lawyer, Jesse Siegel, couldn&#8217;t be immediately reached
for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Wood voided a $5.7 million default judgment she&#8217;d
issued against Pajcin&#8217;s aunt, Sonja Anticevic, a retired
seamstress in Croatia, after receiving a letter from her
Croatian lawyer. The SEC alleged that Anticevic gave Pajcin
permission to execute trades through her account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, bought
BusinessWeek from McGraw-Hill Cos. last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Pajcin,

technology officer of startup Solazyme Inc., examines a beaker
filled with a brown paste made of sugar cane waste. While the
smell brings to mind molasses, this goo, called bagasse, won&#8217;t
find its way into people-pleasing confections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, scientists will empty it into 5-gallon metal
flasks of algae and water. The algae will gorge on the treat --
filling themselves with fatty oils as they double in size every
six hours, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its July issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down the hall, past a rainbow of algae strains arrayed in
Petri dishes, Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Wolfson shows off
a gallon-size bottle of slightly viscous liquid. After drying
the algae, wringing out the oil and shipping it to a refinery,
this is the prize: diesel fuel that Wolfson says is chemically
indistinguishable from its petroleum-based equivalent and which
has already powered a Jeep Liberty and a Mercedes Benz sedan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve produced tens of thousands of gallons, and by the
end of 2010, I hope I can say we&#8217;ve produced hundreds of
thousands,&#8221; Wolfson, 39, says. &#8220;In the next two years, we
should get the cost down to the $60 to $80-a-barrel range.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is facing a
tough operating environment that could affect earnings,
according to two analysts who released notes to investors today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandler O&#8217;Neill  Partners analysts led by Jeff Harte said
Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told them in
a recent meeting that market participants are in a state of
paralysis because of fear and uncertainty regarding economic
challenges in Europe and regulatory changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Bove at Rochdale Securities cut his estimates for
Goldman&#8217;s earnings and stock price because of the debt crisis in
Europe and because &#8220;the current business environment is weak,&#8221;
according to a note he sent investors. Bove cut his estimate for
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 2010 earnings to $17.17 a share from an earlier
estimate of $18.72 and slashed his share price target to $182
from $200. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the bank facing a fraud lawsuit from the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, reported record
earnings in 2009 and its second-best quarter ever in the first
three months of the year. The stock is down $1.09 to $142.95 at
3 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading today and
has dropped 15 percent so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afren Plc, a U.K. oil and gas
explorer focused on West Africa, will expand in the eastern side
of the continent, an area where Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc are paying more attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afren this week agreed to buy Black Marlin Energy Holdings
Ltd. for about $100 million in new shares to secure 12 licenses
in Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar and Seychelles with potential
resources of about 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, said
Chief Executive Officer Osman Shahenshah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will be difficult to do this deal in six months time,
there is so much interest in East Africa,&#8221; Shahenshah said
today in phone interview. &#8220;We have entered just in time at a
reasonable valuation. Prices will go up quite considerably.&#8221;
Exxon and Shell &#8220;are looking at things there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explorer is the latest arrival to East Africa after BG
Group Plc last week bought a stakes in Ophir Energy Plc&#8217;s three
blocks in Tanzania. Tullow Oil Plc, Dominion Petroleum Ltd.,
Aminex Plc, Statoil ASA, and Australia&#8217;s Beach Energy Ltd. are
exploring for oil and gas in the region. In March, Statoil sold
a stake in its Tanzanian block to Exxon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afren &#8220;builds out the Pan African model and provides a
tranche of drilling opportunities to grow the company beyond
2012,&#8221; Richard Griffith, a London-based analyst at Evolution
Securities Ltd., wrote yesterday in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. company will offer Black Marlin shareholders
0.3647 of its shares for each share they own, it said in a
statement June 2. Afren will use about 76.8 million of its new
shares to fund the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Moving Quickly&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By moving quickly we are able to acquire something that
is extremely attractive,&#8221; Shahenshah said.  Black Marlin
management team has &#8220;been approached for farm-in opportunities
from a number of companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wendel Broere, a spokesman at The Hague-based Shell,
couldn&#8217;t immediately comment on the company&#8217;s exploration
interests in East Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;East Africa is interesting. We&#8217;ve looked at some
opportunities there,&#8221; Chariot Oil  Gas Ltd. CEO Paul Welch
said June 1. &#8220;But East Africa from what we&#8217;ve seen is going to
be very gas prone. There are very immature exploration areas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko Petroleum Corp. in February said it found gas in
the Windjammer exploration well drilling in deep water near
Mozambique, the first major discovery off Africa&#8217;s east coast.
It was made about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of the coastline
in the frontier Rovuma Basin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential for Extension &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is the potential of this play fairway extending
around the coast up past Tanzania and to Kenya,&#8221; Peter Hitchens, an analyst at Panmure Gordon  Co. in London, said in
a report May 14. &#8220;It is interesting to note that Anadarko has
acquired offshore acreage in Southern Kenya, indicating that the
company believes this new play type could extend further up the
coast.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windjammer field may hold about four trillion cubic feet of
recoverable gas reserves, according to Hitchens. The East
African nations may develop a local gas-consuming market, which
can make other discoveries economically viable, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clearly there is gas in East Africa&#8221; which possibly
could be sold to the local market depending on the site of the
discoveries, Shahenshan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigerian Plans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-based explorer plans to almost triple oil
production to about 60,000 barrels a day by the middle of next
year, up from about 21,000 barrels a day now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will be producing a lot of cash and we also are
looking at some very serious acquisitions in Nigeria,&#8221;
Shahenshah said. &#8220;There are some opportunities with the
majors,&#8221; which &#8220;could be larger&#8221; than the assets Afren agreed
to buy last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afren acquired a stake in the OML 115 field, which is
located next to its Ebok and Okwok developments, and an interest
in the OPL 310 field last year off Nigeria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year, Afren expects to generate at least $600 million
in cash. The East African exploration program will require about
$95 million in investment through 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The program in Nigeria is fully on track,&#8221; Shahenshah
said. &lt;/p&gt;

Levin" date="Jun 04, 2010 10:40 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-04/mexico-inflation-is-very-controlled-ibm-mexico-s-cfo-gomez-maggi-says.html"><headline>Mexico Inflation Is `Very Controlled,' IBM Mexico's CFO Gomez Maggi Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s inflation is &#8220;very
controlled&#8221; and the peso will end the year little changed,
curbing risk to technology exporting companies such as
International Business Machines Corp., said IBM Mexico&#8217;s chief
financial officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso will finish the year at 12.5 to 13 per U.S.
dollar, the Mexico unit&#8217;s CFO Bernardo Gomez Maggi said,
speaking in an interview in Monterrey, Mexico. IBM Mexico
follows the exchange rate because technology prices are set in
dollars, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t see inflation as a problem today in Mexico,&#8221;
Gomez Maggi said, speaking on the sidelines of a conference
hosted by the Mexican Institute of Finance Executives. &#8220;It&#8217;s
very controlled.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s annual inflation rate fell to 3.93 percent through
the first half of May from 4.27 percent in April. Annual
inflation will slow to the central bank&#8217;s target of 3 percent by
the end of next year, Miguel Messmacher, the Finance Ministry&#8217;s
chief economist, said June 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In trading today, Mexico&#8217;s currency fell for a second day
after a report showed the U.S. added fewer jobs than forecast in
May. The peso dropped 0.6 percent to 12.8589 per dollar at 9:51
a.m. New York time, from 12.7822 yesterday. The peso has
strengthened 1.9 percent against the dollar in 2010, the best
performer among the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Opportunity&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gomez Maggi said the Mexican economy is recovering
&#8220;positively&#8221; from a 6.5 percent contraction last year, the
biggest slump since 1932. The recovery won&#8217;t be derailed by
Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The opportunity to penetrate the information technology
market is very big,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Nowadays you see more
opportunities to do business, people talking about doing
things,&#8221; he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gross domestic product of Latin America&#8217;s second-
biggest economy will expand 4.3 percent this year, according to
the median estimate in a monthly survey of 29 analysts published
June 1 by the central bank. The IT sector represents less than 1
percent of the Mexican economy, according to IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell $1.02, or 0.8 percent, to $126.94 at 9:54
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have fallen 4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is the world&#8217;s third-largest software maker, trailing
Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. arranged a
$450 million collateralized loan obligation, according to people
familiar with the transaction, making it the third widely
syndicated transaction of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week&#8217;s deal marks a reversal for CLO issuance, which
according to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, fell to $26.5 billion in
2009, its lowest level in more than a decade as the credit
crisis and subsequent drop in loan prices made it economically
difficult to arrange new funds. Loan prices on the SP/LSTA US
Leveraged Loan 100 Index ended at 89.07 cents on the dollar
yesterday, gaining 50 percent since Dec. 17, 2008, and helping
lure investors back to these types of investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are still a lot of challenges for the new-issue
market to emerge in a robust form, but it&#8217;s certainly the case
that it has begun to thaw a bit,&#8221; said Vishwanath Tirupattur,
an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. &#8220;The signs are
positive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. priced a $525 million CLO overseen by WCAS
Fraser Sullivan Investment Management LLC in March, the first
new issue backed by widely syndicated loans in a year. The bank
also arranged a $325 million loan package last month for Apollo
Management LP, the first deal of the year backed by new-issue
debt. Both deals were increased from initial plans, bringing
total issuance this year to $1.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attorney Olivier Metzner says
thousands of Societe Generale SA&#8217;s own computer records will
clear his client, Jerome Kerviel, of responsibility for the
bank&#8217;s record 4.9 billion-euro ($6 billion) trading loss,
Bloomberg News&#8217; Alan Katz and Heather Smith report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding through Paris in his chauffeur-driven Jaguar XF,
Metzner, 60, chuckles. He suspects that his success in getting
that data -- more than a year after French investigators had
completed their probe without digging into them -- unnerved
prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ah, yes, I irritate the powers that be,&#8221; said Metzner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metzner took over Kerviel&#8217;s defense more than a year after
the 33-year-old former trader was blamed for Societe Generale&#8217;s
loss. Kerviel goes on trial June 8 for abuse of trust, faking
documents and computer hacking. He faces as many as five years
in jail if found guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial pits him against France&#8217;s second-biggest bank by
market value. The bank&#8217;s former chairman, Daniel Bouton,
described Kerviel as a &#8220;fraudster&#8221; and a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; the day
he announced the loss on Jan. 24, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disclosure came months before Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy and the revelation of the Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC Ponzi scheme. It also turned Kerviel
into a local hero, seen by 77 percent of France as a victim of
the system, according to a poll taken two weeks after the loss
was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metzner has made a career mining case files and legal
technicalities to spring clients from jail and get companies and
executives out of trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he speaks passionately of defending the underdog,
Metzner&#8217;s clients include a lot of big names. About 80 percent
of his practice is corporate. He&#8217;s on retainer for Bouygues SA,
France&#8217;s second-biggest construction company. And he defended
Houston-based Continental Airlines Inc. against manslaughter
charges after a French investigation concluded debris from a
Continental plane brought down the Concorde supersonic jet in
2000. A verdict in the four-month trial, which ended May 28, is
due in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metzner &#8220;can grasp things quickly, keep them all in mind,
and distill them,&#8221; said Carson Seeligson, head of Continental&#8217;s
Concorde crash legal team. &#8220;And he always keeps the bigger
picture in mind.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Wins Minnesota Verdict on Punitive Damages &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. won a jury decision yesterday rejecting
punitive damages above the $30.1 million awarded to four
Minnesota nonprofits that claimed the bank marketed a risky
securities-lending program it portrayed as safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonprofits asked the jury to impose at least $100
million in punitive damages in the second phase of the trial
yesterday. Wells Fargo argued that no punitives were warranted
in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state court jury in St. Paul, Minnesota, found Wells
Fargo liable for breach of fiduciary duty and violations of
Minnesota&#8217;s consumer fraud act on June 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Workers&#8217; Compensation Reinsurance Association
and three charitable foundations sued in 2008, claiming the bank
failed to disclose the deteriorating value of the investments
until it was too late and blocked them from getting out of the
program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Workers Compensation Reinsurance Association v.
Wells Fargo Bank, 62-cv-08-10825, District Court, Ramsey County,
Minnesota (St. Paul). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan London Unit Gets Record Fine From U.K.&#8217;s FSA &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s London unit was fined a record 33.3
million pounds ($48.8 million) by Britain&#8217;s financial regulator
for not properly separating client money from the firm&#8217;s
accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An average of $8.6 billion wasn&#8217;t properly segregated by
JPMorgan Securities Ltd. in an error that went undetected for
seven years, the Financial Services Authority said in a
statement yesterday. As much as $23 billion of client money held
by the bank&#8217;s futures and options business wasn&#8217;t put in
separate overnight customer accounts between 2002 and 2009, the
FSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which
roiled financial markets worldwide in 2008, forced the FSA to
put financial companies on notice that they must properly
separate client funds. New York-based Lehman&#8217;s creditors filed
more than $830 billion of claims and regulators worldwide are
trying to unravel how money moved through its global units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FSA has repeatedly emphasized the importance of
ensuring that client money is adequately protected,&#8221; said
Margaret Cole, the FSA&#8217;s enforcement director. &#8220;This penalty
sends out a strong message to firms of all sizes that they must
ensure client money is segregated in accordance with FSA rules.
Firms need to sit up and take notice of this action -- we have
several more cases in the pipeline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had the company gone bankrupt, clients could have lost all
their money because they would have been unsecured creditors
rather than having the right to claim back money from ring-
fenced accounts, according to the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman David Wells declined to comment. The New
York-based bank escaped a 47.6 million-pound fine by cooperating
with the regulator, according to the FSA&#8217;s statement. No clients
lost money, and the mistake didn&#8217;t affect the bank&#8217;s financial
reporting, the FSA said. JPMorgan said in August that it may
have mixed 8.5 billion pounds of clients&#8217; money with its own
funds, and that it hired KPMG LLP to review its accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-NeuTec Executive, Two Lawyers Cleared in FSA Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NeuTec Pharma Ltd.&#8217;s former chief financial officer and two
lawyers were cleared of insider-trading charges yesterday by a
London court, handing the U.K. financial regulator its first
defeat in a criminal case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew King, the former CFO of Novartis AG&#8217;s NeuTec unit,
and Michael McFall, a former mergers lawyer at McDermott Will 
Emery LLP were cleared by a London jury. The judge told the jury
to find Andrew Rimmington, another lawyer whose case was halted
last month after his brother was killed, not guilty after they
gave their verdicts on the other two men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallace said she was &#8220;delighted&#8221; with the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We always believed the FSA&#8217;s case against him was flawed
but Mr. King has faced a long fight to clear his name and he and
his family have faced years of worry,&#8221; Wallace, a partner at
Irwin Mitchell LLP in London, said in a statement. &#8220;Having
worked with them throughout this, we are very pleased that they
can now move on with their lives.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McFall declined to comment outside the courtroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Insider dealing cases are challenging to prove, but these
were serious charges and we considered that the evidence
provided a proper basis to put the case before a jury for them
to decide,&#8221; Margaret Cole, the FSA enforcement director, said
in a statement. &#8220;Criminal prosecutions are integral to the
FSA&#8217;s long-term strategy of delivering credible deterrence and
combating insider dealing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutor Michael Bowes said during the trial that the two
lawyers made 39,000 pounds each ($57,000) in June 2006 after
King gave McFall an early warning about Basel, Switzerland-based
Novartis&#8217;s plan to purchase NeuTec. McFall gave the information
to Rimmington, Bowes said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladbrokes, Betfair Lose Dutch Betting-Ban EU Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladbrokes Plc, owner of more than 2,700 betting shops, and
Betfair Ltd. lost a European Union court challenge to Dutch
rules blocking them from opening their websites to gamblers in
the Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This prohibition may, on account of the specific features
associated with the provision of games of chance on the
Internet, be regarded as justified by the objective of combating
fraud and crime,&#8221; the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg
said yesterday in a ruling that applies to the EU&#8217;s 27 nations
and can&#8217;t be appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladbrokes and Betfair have been fighting in Dutch courts
for at least seven years seeking to overcome the government&#8217;s
refusal to grant them licenses or allow citizens access to their
services. Dutch courts handling the cases sought guidance from
the EU tribunal on the legality of the policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 11 cases over challenges to German, Austrian and
Swedish gambling restrictions are pending at the EU court.
Germany and Sweden are among countries which have been
threatened by the European Commission to loosen some of their
restrictions and some recently started to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladbrokes said in an e-mailed statement it was
&#8220;confident&#8221; that the ruling will lead to a detailed assessment
in the Dutch courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Ladbrokes and Betfair cases have clearly demonstrated
the fragility of the entire Dutch legal framework in relation to
gambling,&#8221; said John O&#8217;Reilly, a managing director at
Ladbrokes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s ruling &#8220;once again demonstrates the need for
the&#8221; commission &#8220;to take a lead on this issue, so that we can
separate fact from fiction and settle the online gambling debate
once and for all,&#8221; said Tim Phillips, a Betfair spokesman, in
an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are C-203/08 The Sporting Exchange Ltd, trading
under the name &#8216;Betfair&#8217; v. Minister for Justice, Stichting de
Nationale Sporttotalisator and Scientific Games Racing; C-258/08

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Morris, Reynolds Sue New York for Smoking Ads &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. cigarette makers Philip Morris USA and R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. sued New York, alleging the city&#8217;s mandated anti-
smoking ads violate their First Amendment rights and are
preempted by federally mandated warnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cigarette makers and Lorillard Tobacco Co. allege in a
complaint filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
that the city&#8217;s graphic health-warning signs force them to carry
messages they wouldn&#8217;t carry at the point of sale. The signs
show cancerous lungs, a decayed tooth and a brain damaged by
stroke and bear the message &#8220;Quit Smoking Today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies, joined by state retail associations, seek a
court order to stop New York from enforcing the law. The city
resolution, amended in September, requires that any business
selling tobacco &#8220;face-to-face&#8221; to consumers also prominently
display the tobacco health-warning signs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Through words and imagery, the signs urge consumers not
to purchase plaintiffs&#8217; products,&#8221; the cigarette makers said.
&#8220;The mandated signs also restrict plaintiffs&#8217; ability to
communicate about lawful products with their adult customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman with the city&#8217;s Law
Department, said in an e-mailed statement that her office is
reviewing the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;However, while these proposed changes were under
consideration, we carefully considered all of the legal issues,
as well as comments we received from the public,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;We are confident that the health code provisions being
challenged will withstand legal scrutiny.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. New York City Board of
Health, 10-cv-4392, U.S. District Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BanxCorp Sues Dow Jones, New York Times Over Rate Sites &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BanxCorp, operator of the BanxQuote website, sued media
companies including News Corp.&#8217;s Dow Jones  Co. and New York
Times Co., accusing them of forming a cartel to sell information
on bank interest rates on their websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BanxCorp on June 2 added the companies, as well as AOL
Inc., to an antitrust lawsuit filed on May 14 against Tree.com
Inc.&#8217;s LendingTree LLC in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies conspired with BanxQuote competitor Bankrate
Inc. to &#8220;gain an unfair advantage over the plaintiff&#8221; by
fixing the prices banks pay to have rates listed on websites,
according to the complaint. BanxCorp, based in Scarsdale, New
York, estimates damages at more than $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial institutions pay to list their interest rates on
websites run by BanxCorp and Bankrate, then consumers use the
sites to find the most competitive rates for financial products
such as certificates of deposit and mortgages. The media
companies republish the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other defendants named are General Electric Co.&#8217;s CNBC,
Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s Cable News Network, Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s and
GE&#8217;s MSNBC Interactive News LLC, News Corp.&#8217;s Fox News Network
and Move Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Horner, a News Corp. spokesman; Sara Anissipour, an
outside spokeswoman for Microsoft; and Anne Eisele of GE, Alysia
Lew of AOL and Julie Reynolds of Move.com said their companies
had no comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We haven&#8217;t been served and haven&#8217;t seen the complaint,&#8221;
Diane McNulty, a New York Times spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.
Mona Marimow of LendingTree and Christa Robinson of CNN didn&#8217;t
return messages for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BanxCorp also sued Bankrate in federal court in New Jersey.
That suit is pending, BanxCorp Chief Executive Officer Norbert
Mehl said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is BanxCorp v. LendingTree LLC, 10-02467, U.S.
District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miami Beach Hotel Developers Enter Not Guilty Pleas &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Miami Beach hotel developers pleaded not guilty
yesterday to charges of hiding more than $150 million in assets
from the Internal Revenue Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauricio Cohen Assor, 77, and his son, Leon Cohen Levy, 46,
were indicted May 25 on charges of conspiracy and filing false
tax returns. They face as long as 14 years in prison if
convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair is accused of using shell companies such as
American Leisure Resorts Inc. as part of a conspiracy to conceal
their ownership of a $45 million investment portfolio, $55
million in commercial properties in Miami Beach, homes in New
York and Florida, and cars including a Rolls-Royce Phantom, a
Porsche Carrera GT and Ferrari Testarossa. They failed to pay
taxes on their assets, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cohens were arrested April 15 as part of a tax-day
sweep targeting offshore tax evasion. U.S. Magistrate Judge
Lurana Snow in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 20 ordered the
two men held without bail, saying they posed a flight risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cohens developed high-end hotels under the name
Flatotel International. After selling the New York Flatotel in
2000, they used &#8220;numerous nominee and shell corporations&#8221; to
hide $33 million in proceeds from tax collectors, prosecutors
said in the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v. Assor, 10-cr-60159, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infineon Loses Bid to Dismiss Lawsuit in Canada Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infineon Technologies AG and other computer memory
manufacturers lost a bid at Canada&#8217;s top court to throw out a
group lawsuit claiming they fixed prices and overcharged
customers between 1999 and 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of Canada yesterday denied the
chipmakers&#8217; request for a hearing, upholding a British Columbia
Court of Appeal ruling that allowed the suit to proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infineon, Hynix Semiconductor Inc. and Samsung Electronics
Co. were sued in British Columbia after having pleaded guilty in
the U.S. to criminal charges arising from an international
conspiracy to fix prices of dynamic random access memory, or
DRAM, computer chips. The companies weren&#8217;t charged in Canada
and haven&#8217;t paid any fines to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd., a Richmond, British Columbia,
computer consulting company, sued Infineon, Hynix, Samsung and
Micron Technology Inc. on behalf of all buyers of the memory in
the province, claiming it paid more for the memory chips that it
should have because the companies fixed prices. They seek to
recover damages, including restitution for unjust enrichment and
an order for the companies to give up profits earned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies claimed a group, or class-action, suit was
improper because each customer would have to prove damages
individually. Supreme Court of British Columbia Judge David
Masuhara agreed with the companies and dismissed the suit. He
also ruled Pro-Sys wouldn&#8217;t fairly or adequately represent the
interests of the class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeal overturned the decision, unanimously
saying liability can be determined on a common basis &#8220;without
resort to individualized inquiries,&#8221; and a class suit was
preferable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Infineon Technologies AG v. Pro-Sys Consultants
Ltd., 33522, Supreme Court of Canada (Ottawa). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JJ Misled Pennsylvania on Drug&#8217;s Risks, Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Johnson  Johnson unit misled Pennsylvania officials
about the health risks of its Risperdal anti-psychotic drug and
duped the state into paying $289 million more than it should
have for the medicine, a lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania officials wouldn&#8217;t have paid a premium for
Risperdal had they known it was no more effective than existing
anti-psychotic drugs and was found to cause diabetes, Fletch
Trammell, a lawyer for the state, told a Philadelphia jury
yesterday. Pennsylvania is seeking to recover $289 million it
paid for Risperdal prescriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There were a dozen anti-psychotics that were just as good
as Risperdal and cost a fraction&#8221; as much, Trammell said in
opening statements in the trial of the state&#8217;s rebate lawsuit
against JJ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ&#8217;s lawyer contended in his opening statement that the
drugmaker did nothing wrong in marketing Risperdal to state-
sponsored health-care programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no merit in the case that&#8221; the state will
present, Thomas Campion, JJ&#8217;s lawyer, told jurors yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have always been committed to ethical business
practices and we are fully prepared to defend ourselves against
these claims,&#8221; Greg Panico, a JJ spokesman, said in a written
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

Pharmaceutica Inc., 002181, Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas

Merkin in litigation tied to Bernard Madoff&#8217;s fraud scheme, was
named chairman-elect of Philadelphia-based law firm Dechert LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G. Daniel O&#8217;Donnell, a lawyer representing private-equity
groups and financial institutions, will become Dechert&#8217;s chief
executive officer, according to a statement yesterday. Both will

&lt;p&gt;New Orleans Judge Sells Bonds to Avoid Spill Conflict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New Orleans federal judge said he sold his investments in
companies tied to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill to avoid any
conflict of interest in presiding over lawsuits involving spill-
damage claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So there is no perception of a conflict in these cases,
yesterday I instructed my broker to sell the few Transocean and
Halliburton bonds in my account,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Carl
Barbier said in an e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc and Transocean Ltd. oil-spill lawsuits may be
combined before a judge from outside the Gulf Coast states,
because judges in the region are withdrawing from cases, citing
conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six of 12 active judges assigned to the federal judicial
district based in New Orleans already have removed themselves
from spill-damage lawsuits, according to a court official and
public records. The judges found conflicts tied to oil
investments or personal relationships with lawyers or companies
involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several additional federal judges in districts based in
Lafayette, Louisiana; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida,
have also disqualified themselves from oil-spill cases,
according to public records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbier&#8217;s portfolio contained Transocean Sedco Forex notes
and Halliburton Co. debentures, according to financial
disclosure forms posted by Judicial Watch, a self-styled
conservative advocacy group based in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 170 proposed class-action lawsuits, representing
potentially thousands of claims, have been filed in courthouses
from Texas to Florida. BP, the owner of the offshore lease, and
Transocean, the rig owner, are named in virtually all the cases.
Halliburton Energy Services Inc., which provided cementing
services to the well, and Cameron International Corp., which
supplied blowout prevention equipment, are also named in most of
the lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Oil Spill By the Oil Rig &#8220;Deepwater
Horizon&#8221; in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, U.S. Judicial Panel
on Multidistrict Litigation, MDL-2179, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British Telecom will file for a dismissal of the suit it

&lt;p&gt;BackWeb Settles Patent Infringement Case Against Microsoft &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BackWeb Technologies Ltd., a provider of Internet
communication applications and infrastructure, said it settled a
patent-infringement case against Microsoft Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BackWeb, with operations in Rosh Ha&#8217;Ayin, Israel, and Santa
Clara, California, sued Microsoft and three other companies in
March 2009 in federal court in Oakland, California, accusing
them of infringing patents related to the transmission of
digital information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, took a license to
the disputed patents, BackWeb said in a statement. Other terms
of the settlement weren&#8217;t disclosed. BackWeb said it now has
about $10 million in cash, &#8220;which reflects the impact of the
patent litigation&#8221; and the previous year&#8217;s business operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney Applies for U.S. Patent on &#8216;Edutainment&#8217; Guitar Game &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. applied for a patent on a musical computer
game that can be used in connection with a real guitar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application 20100137048, filed in December 2008 and
published in the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office yesterday, is for an interface to an electronic
instrument that has frets and strings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the application, an element of the system is a
display with falling objects to indicate the timing of the
performance. The display also has fret areas corresponding to
the actual frets of the instrument, and game objects to
demonstrate the strings on the instrument that should be
strummed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney characterizes the game as &#8220;musical edutainment,&#8221;
and says that Electronic Arts Inc.&#8217;s &#8220;Guitar Hero&#8221; game
doesn&#8217;t give users the actual experience of playing on a guitar.
Burbank, California-based Disney says that while playing on
simulated instruments such as Guitar Hero&#8217;s &#8220;may be
entertaining,&#8221; it may not help improve the player&#8217;s skill in
playing a real instrument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney was assisted in the patent-application process by
Farjami  Farjami LLP of Mission Viejo, California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leap Wireless Unit Wins Arizona Trademark-Infringement Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leap Wireless International Inc.&#8217;s Cricket Communications
unit won a trademark-infringement lawsuit against a seller of
wireless services in Tucson, Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket sued Abid Nazir and his GSM Cellular for trademark
infringement in federal court in Tucson in May 2009. Nazir was
accused of acting as if his three Arizona stores were authorized
to sell Cricket products and of using Cricket&#8217;s mark on the
stores and vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Nazir was sent cease-and-desist notices beginning
in September 2006, he registered &#8220;Kricket&#8221; and &#8220;Kricket
Cellular&#8221; as business names in Arizona in March 2008, according
to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court awarded Cricket almost $78,0000 in attorney fees
and ordered Nazir to quit using the Cricket marks in any way,
according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket was represented by Liza Martens and Andrew Abrams
of Boston&#8217;s Fish  Richardson, and Shane Olafson of Phoenix&#8217;s
Lewis  Roca LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cricket Communication Inc. v. Nazir, 4:08-cv-

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida Atlantic University Accused of Copyright Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida Atlantic University and one of its professors were
sued for copyright infringement by the head of a Cincinnati-
based organization that offers cultural education and assessment
for health-care workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josepha Campinha-Bacote and her Transcultural C.A.R.E
Associates accused the university and Professor Sandra Gibson of
using and distributing without authorization a survey tool
Campinha-Bagote created. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ohio organization&#8217;s Inventory for Assessing the Process
of Cultural Competence Among Healthcare Professionals was used
by Gibson, her students and other FAU faculty members, according
to the complaint filed June 2 in federal court in West Palm
Beach, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campinha-Bacote said in her pleadings that she learned of
the unauthorized use in a telephone call she received from
Gibson, and that the FAU professor acknowledged she knew it was
copyrighted and that her use was unauthorized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Campinha-Bacote had authorized a different FAU
professor to use the inventory only through 2008, according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being told she was infringing, and that a fee would
have to be paid for unauthorized use and permission would have
to be granted in the future to use the inventory, Gibson refused
to comply, according to the compliant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campinha-Bacote accused the defendants of deliberate
infringement and asked the court for an award of money damages,
attorney fees and litigation costs, and for an order barring
future infringement. She also requested seizure of all allegedly
infringing material in defendants&#8217; possession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is represented by Michael Weeks, of Weeks  Macon LLP
of West Palm Beach, and Nadine Mireille Castillo of Ward Damon 
Posner, also of West Palm Beach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Campinha-Bacote v. Gibson, 9:10-cv-80671-KAM,

intellectual-property practice, the New York-based firm said in
a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of a Georgian cocaine-
smuggling ring that was broken up by police yesterday could be
sentenced to life in prison if convicted, according to the
Tbilisi Municipal Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as five suspects were arrested on suspicion of
smuggling cocaine from South America through Georgia to Europe.
Police discovered about 2 million euros buried in the western
village of Geguti that police believe came from selling as much
as 90 kilograms of cocaine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of the suspects will be held in pre-trial detention
for two months, the Tbilisi court said in a statement on its
website today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Mikheil Saakashvili said the money seized from
the smugglers will be used to buy computer equipment for
preschools, according to his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities suspect that Georgian criminals living abroad
were involved in the cocaine ring. A group of detectives
departed for Spain today to continue their investigation.
Yesterday, Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili said the
drugs came from countries like Panama, Colombia and Peru. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s shocking that narcotics from as far away as Colombia
are moving through Georgia, but since Georgian criminals are
involved the situation is clear,&#8221; said Alexander Rondeli, head
of the Tbilisi-based Georgian Foundation for Strategic and
International Studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All the government can do is secure the borders,
especially since we get extensive assistance from the U.S. to do
just that,&#8221; Rondeli said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
payments network, told banks and merchants to use its system to
process international transactions by Chinese holders of cards
co-branded with China UnionPay Data Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Visa regularly reminds its global clients and partners of
their obligations to adhere to these rules as well as
enforcement actions for non compliance,&#8221; Jeremy Griffith, a
Sydney-based spokesman for Visa, said in e-mailed comments today.
&#8220;This is not a new rule and is not specific to China UnionPay
or any other network.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign banks in China must &#8220;co-brand&#8221; with Chinese
operators on credit cards and execute payments through UnionPay,
the country&#8217;s largest electronic payment network. Visa said
international transactions must be processed over its network
while UnionPay said in a statement yesterday that the U.S.
company doesn&#8217;t have the right to block the use of dual-currency
credit cards abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UnionPay is expanding its global reach, with its cards now
accepted in 90 countries and regions outside China, according to
its website. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in March
the Obama administration is weighing complaints that China is
violating trade rules by shutting out U.S. companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Visa continues to be fully committed to working with
China UnionPay to find areas of common interest that will enable
both companies to meet their respective business objectives,&#8221;
Griffith said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible Penalties &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa has told banks that use UnionPay&#8217;s system to handle
international transactions for co-branded credit cards that it
will start charging penalties from Aug. 1, the Financial Times
said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based company&#8217;s rules require that all
international transactions initiated by Visa-branded cards are
processed through its VisaNet system, according to Griffith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hong Kong and Macau, Visa will continue to allow Chinese
holders of dual-currency cards to use either its network or that
of China UnionPay, Visa said in a statement issued through
public relations firm Ketchum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk told reporters in Brussels on March 26 that the U.S.
hasn&#8217;t decided if it will file a complaint at the World Trade
Organization over the rules, which block companies such as Visa
and MasterCard Inc. from processing credit- and debit-card
transactions in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case between the world&#8217;s largest and third-biggest
economies adds to disputes ranging from currency policy to
import duties to Web censorship. U.S. trade associations
including the Business Software Alliance in January accused
China of developing policies that favor local companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An experimental pill from Pfizer Inc.
shrank tumors in patients with a rare form of lung cancer that
is caused by a defective gene and occurs mostly in nonsmokers, a
study showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine, crizotinib, reduced tumor size in 57 percent
of patients and stopped the progression of the disease in 87
percent of those in a study released today at the meeting of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. Most of the
trial&#8217;s participants never smoked or were former smokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s drug is the only compound in human testing to
target a defect in a gene called ALK, which can turn deadly when
a piece of it breaks away and fuses with a neighboring gene,
causing cells to grow out of control, said Alice Shaw, a
thoracic cancer specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston. The gene flaw occurs in about 5 percent of lung cancer
patients. If effective in larger studies, the drug could be
available in 2013 and generate annual sales of $800 million,
said Barclays Capital analyst Tony Butler, in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The drug has shown remarkable activity against tumors,&#8221;
said Shaw, one of the study&#8217;s researchers. &#8220;As a lung cancer
doctor, you just don&#8217;t see changes like this in patients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crizotinib is among 24 new tumor-fighting medicines that
New York-based Pfizer is developing to help offset the $11
billion in revenue it will start losing next year when generic
copies of its cholesterol pill Lipitor enter the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countering Setbacks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor confidence in Pfizer&#8217;s ability to replace that
revenue with new medicines has waned following some research
failures this year, said Trevor Polischuk, an analyst with
OrbiMed Advisors LLC in New York. Data on crizotinib and at
least four other experimental drugs that Pfizer will report on
at the cancer meeting may help to restore some of that
confidence, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What ASCO can do is remind people that there is a
pipeline there and opportunity there,&#8221; Polischuk said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, the company said its experimental Alzheimer&#8217;s drug
Dimedon, which analysts said could have generated $5 billion in
annual sales, failed to help patients in a late-stage study.
That same month, the company said Sutent, approved for kidney
and stomach cancers, failed in two studies to shrink tumors of
the breast, and its experimental drug figitumumab didn&#8217;t help
lung cancer patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results released today on crizotinib are from the
second of three stages of study required to get U.S. regulatory
clearance. More than 100 patients have been treated with the
drug and Pfizer has evaluated 82 patients for a response. The
drug has now advanced into final testing and the company plans
to seek U.S. approval for crizotinib in the first half of 2011,
Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer Killer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer killed 159,000 people in the U.S. last year and
219,000 new cases were diagnosed, according to the National
Cancer Institute. About 85 percent of people with lung cancer
will die within five years of being diagnosed because the
disease usually isn&#8217;t caught until its late stages and there are
few effective treatments, according to the American Cancer
Society. About 15 percent of lung cancer cases worldwide occur
in patients with no history of smoking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defective gene that crizotinib is designed to thwart
occurs in about 6,000 cancer patients a year in the U.S., said
Shaw. It is believed to be most common in people who have never
smoked and are middle-age, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such patient, Linnea Duff, an artist who lives in New
Hampshire, was among the first to receive the experimental pill.
At age 45, Duff, who had never smoked, was diagnosed with lung
cancer and given a 15 percent chance of living five years.
Available treatments failed to help her and she was preparing to
die when given her first dose of the drug in September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Blew Everyone Away&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later she noticed her cough went away and she
was no longer out of breath. Seven weeks later, a scan showed
that her lung tumor, which had marched through every other
treatment, had disappeared. The results &#8220;blew everyone away,&#8221;
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Before this drug, it was definitely the end of my life. I
was seeing a psychiatrist at the hospital to try to deal with
this and try to prepare,&#8221; Duff recalls. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ve returned to
that state of mind where I think about the future again. I&#8217;ve
gotten back into the habit of making plans and in September I&#8217;m
going to Sweden with my oldest son.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early research that led to the development of
crizotinib was started by Sugen Inc., a Redwood City,
California-based biotechnology company that also discovered the
kidney cancer treatment Sutent. Sugen was acquired by Pharmacia
 Upjohn Inc. in 1999 for $650 million and Pfizer acquired
Pharmacia in 2003 for $58 billion. Pfizer researchers in La
Jolla, California then picked up the research and developed the
compound used in today&#8217;s study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blocking Cell Signals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Pfizer first started developing crizotinib, they knew
it could block the signals from the defective ALK gene and a
protein called c-MET, and they believed it could help patients
with lymphoma and sarcoma. What they didn&#8217;t know was that it
could also be a potential treatment for lung cancer patients.
Then, in August 2007 a study by Japanese researchers found the
defect in a lung cancer patient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That discovery sent Shaw and her team of researchers
scrambling to find lung cancer patients to add to the study and
four months later they started testing the drug in lung cancer.
Duff was one of those that Shaw initially recruited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, has been throwing
its weight behind cancer research since 2008 hoping to grab a
larger share of the $53 billion market for cancer drugs. The
company created a division focused on discovering and selling
medicine for cancer in 2008 and spends about a quarter of its $8
billion research budget on cancer research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Research &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also released data today from a separate study that
found patients taking a lung cancer treatment called PF-299
lived a month longer without their disease worsening than those
taking Roche Holding AG&#8217;s Tarceva. The study followed 188
patients for an average of 12 weeks and was part of the second
of three stages of testing required to get FDA approval.
Patients taking Pfizer&#8217;s drug were more likely to have diarrhea,
acne or a rash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 7, Pfizer will present data at the cancer meeting
showing that leukemia patients who failed to benefit from or
were unable to tolerate Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG&#8217;s
Gleevec responded to its experimental treatment bosutinib. The
drug is being studied in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia
and is now in the final stages of testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been trying to take a more targeted approach to
its cancer research by matching its drugs to a specific tumor&#8217;s
traits. In the case of crizotinib, Pfizer has partnered with
rival drugmaker Abbott Laboratories, based in Abbott Park,
Illinois, to develop a test to detect which patients have the
gene flaw that the drug targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Biological Insights&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are trying to bring more focus to drug development
based on genetic and biological insights from the cancer,&#8221; said
Mace Rothenberg, Pfizer&#8217;s vice president of clinical affairs for
cancer. &#8220;This is what patients will value because the goal will
be to deliver drugs to patients who are most likely to benefit
and patients won&#8217;t be exposed to potentially toxic drugs
unnecessarily.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers for the past decade have been trying to figure
out why certain treatments work in some patients and not in
others. For instance, Tarceva from Basel, Switzerland-based
Roche Holding AG and Iressa from London-based AstraZeneca Plc
work best in patients with a certain mutation called EGFR that
occurs in about 10 percent of lung cancer cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ten years ago, no matter what the type of tumor, patients
were all getting chemo,&#8221; said Mark Kris, a lung cancer
specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New
York. &#8220;Science now tells us that that isn&#8217;t the way it should
be. Just like we are all individuals, cancer is individual too
and we need to treat the cancer in that person.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a Cure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crizotinib isn&#8217;t a cure for most patients as tumors are
expected to eventually develop a resistance to the treatment,
said Shaw. After 19 months on the pill, Duff says that her
cancer is now back. She is still taking the drug in hopes it
will slow progression enough for her to be able to get into a
trial for a similar-acting drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side effects from the drug are mild and less than seen
with other cancer therapies, said Rothenberg. The most common
side effects are loss of appetite and in some cases patients&#8217;
night vision is distorted, according to the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current treatments for lung cancer include surgery,
chemotherapy, radiation and targeted drug therapies, led by
Roche&#8217;s Avastin and Tarceva. &lt;/p&gt;

takes all its income from emerging markets, the Financial Times
reported, without saying where it obtained the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund, to be announced on June 7, is a response to
investor demand for income from outside the U.K., the FT
reported. The trust will pay an initial yield of 4 percent, the
