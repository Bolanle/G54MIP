<p>     June 6 (Bloomberg) -- Walt Disney Co. (DIS) will cut about 200
jobs at its film division, or 5 percent of the workforce, said
two people with knowledge of the plans, as the company realigns
distribution and relies more on production from Marvel and
Steven Spielberg''s DreamWorks Studios. </p>
<p>The reductions at Walt Disney Studios will be made during
the week of June 13, said the people, who asked for anonymity
because the decision hadn''t been made public. The unit has about
5,000 employees, including Marvel and Pixar. </p>
<p>Disney, which makes the Pirates of the Caribbean
movies, is shifting its release slate toward Marvel and films
distributed for Spielberg''s DreamWorks Studios, which makes its
own movies. The company restructured its worldwide distribution
operation last year. </p>
<p>Production, distribution, business development and other
positions are being eliminated, the people said. Some cuts have
already been made, said one of the people. </p>
<p>In November, Disney merged groups responsible for film and
television distribution. The organization is responsible for
physical and digital home-video sales. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank California, acquired Marvel in
January 2010 for $4.2 billion. The company bought back
distribution of two Marvel films from Viacom Inc. (VIA/B)''s Paramount,
the third Iron Man and next year''s Avengers. </p>
<p>DreamWorks, co-founded by Spielberg and Chief Executive
Officer Stacey Snider, hired Disney in 2009 to distribute about
six films a year. </p>
<p>Disney, also owner of theme parks and ESPN, gained 2 cents
to $39.40 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have climbed 5 percent this year. </p>

<p>The Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s
largest soft-drink maker, was recognized by the Corporate Eco
Forum for its efforts to promote sustainability, including using
recyclable plastic bottles, shifting away from refrigerants that
contribute to climate change and supporting the World Wildlife
Fund. </p>
<p>The forum, comprising 80 companies from 18 industries with
combined annual revenue of more than $3 trillion, gave Atlanta-
based Coca-Cola and its Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent the
C.K. Prahalad Award for Global Sustainability Leadership at a
dinner event today in Washington. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola has spent $60 million over the past decade to
phase out the use of refrigerants that contribute to climate
change, according to the Eco Forum. In 2009, it developed its
PlantBottle, which the company said is the first fully
recyclable PET plastic beverage bottle made partially from
plants, and by 2020 it expects to use bottles made completely
from materials that are recyclable and renewable. </p>
<p>If you don''t have measurable goals and hold people
accountable, I don''t think you''ll move the needle, Rick Frazier, Coca-Cola''s vice-president for supply chain, said in an
interview. </p>
<p>The company also wants to offset all the water the company
and its bottlers use for finished beverages, and in 2009 it
replenished 22 percent of that water, helped by 250 partnerships
in 70 countries. The company has been working with the World
Wildlife Fund since 2004 to preserve threatened river basins. </p>
<p>The work of Coke and others delivers a strong message
that these businesses care about natural resources and the
sustainable use of our planet, said World Wildlife Fund
President and Chief Executive Officer Carter Roberts. </p>
<p>Of the eight finalists nominated on the forum''s website one
was chosen by voting for the award by its 19-member advisor
board, including government, academia and non-governmental
organization representatives. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) commercial-
banking chief Todd Maclin and international operations head
Heidi Miller, two of Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon''s top
executives, plan to step down from their posts as early as next
year. </p>
<p>Miller plans to leave the company in the first quarter of
2012, and Maclin has been training his No. 2, Douglas Petno,
since January to replace him as early as next year, Miller and
Maclin said today in separate interviews. JPMorgan also said
today that it hired Glenn Tilton, the former chairman and chief
executive officer of United Airlines parent UAL Corp., to advise
Dimon in the Midwest. </p>
<p>Miller and Maclin are among Dimon''s most senior executives,
serving on the firm''s 15-member operating committee. Miller, a
confidant of Dimon, 55, for two decades, was named to the new
post of president of JPMorgan International last June. She said
her work coordinating operations between JPMorgan''s investment
bank, asset-management division and her previous unit, Treasury
and Security Services, is almost complete, making it time to
look for the next challenge. Miller, 58, said she plans to look
for opportunities elsewhere. </p>
<p>I always said that when that was over, either I find
something else to do that was compelling to me or go do
something else, Miller said. </p>

<p>The IBM Centennial celebration on June 15 is a birthday party for the world. It is not cake, candles, and fancy dress but more of a roll-up-you-sleeves-to-work day. Nearly 300,000 IBMers and family members have pledged at least 8 hours of service in 120 countries through over 3,500 projects that draw on IBM tools and capabilities. And new tools have been developed for ongoing use by social causes. This is not lip service; it''s authentic service. </p>

<p>Perhaps IBM''s massive mobilization of company talent can inspire many more companies, small and large, to see the strategic value of leading with values and taking every opportunity to show how they make a difference. Companies rally for disasters; Procter  Gamble was praised in the New York Times for its Tide Loads of Hope and Duracell Power Relief vans contributing to flood relief efforts in the South. </p>

<p>So why not do good when times are good?  Some already tie their celebrations to service; Novartis celebrates each anniversary of the merger that created the current company with a global day of community service, which I had suggested while a consultant on merger integration in 1996. But IBM''s activities (which I know from my continuing advisory relationship) show how innovative and strategic the outcomes can be when a company commits to service on a large scale, from the top and throughout the organization.</p>

<p>IBMers have signed up for activities reflecting their skills and personal interests to promote ongoing activities and sustainable solutions, some of them custom-built to be launched on the Centennial. For example: Training on privacy and anti-bullying in 100 schools in Germany. A new website developed in India for the visually impaired, with a launch at 50 sites. CEO Sam Palmisano in Baltimore with the Mayor and school head helping Training for students and teachers on careers in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math) in Baltimore, with CEO Sam Palmisano, the Mayor, and the schools'' chief. Access for women entrepreneurs to IBM''s small-and-mid-sized business toolkit to improve business opportunities, along with IBM''s new Supplier Connection website get access to large company contracts, led by Senior VP Ginni Romettty. A marketing toolkit for not-for-profits, with training by chief marketing officer Jon Iwata and others in a workshop convened at Harvard Graduate School of Education for national Boston-based organizations such as City Year and Citizen Schools.. </p>

<p>There are six strategic benefits to celebrating milestones with service to the world:</p>

<p>1. Service expresses identity. It makes purpose and values concrete and tangible. It puts a human face on a company and shows that it is a part of society, ready to contribute to positive outcomes.</p>

<p>2. Employees love it. It is an inspiring chance for involvement in issues that care about off the job that connect to their skills on the job.</p>

<p>3. Customers love it. They can join in. They see what the company stands for, and that its values are real.</p>

<p>4. It builds community inside the organization. Status differences disappear. People from different functions work together. People from many places feel part of something larger than themselves.</p>

<p>5. It builds community outside the organization. New connections are forged in pursuit of common goals for the greater good.</p>

<p>6. It shows that your products and services really can make a difference. When celebrating by serving is also business-strategic, featuring the best and latest products and services, then everyone wins, from inner city schools to women entrepreneurs. Sure, it''s marketing. But societal benefits come first.</p>

<p>IBM is leading  some would say, tapping  an important trend. Service is hot. Holiday parties increasingly feature book collections for schools in Africa or clothing drives to outfit the homeless. I''ve been to birthday celebrations that include a Sunday at an inner city school building a playground and landscaping. Small efforts can accumulate to make a bigger difference, changing a culture from one of self-interest to one imbued with a sense of purpose.  And when a global giant not only champions service but demonstrates it, the immediate impact can grow beyond inspiration to impact.  </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s ABC signed former
CBS News anchor Katie Couric to produce and host an afternoon
talk show, filling a void in the schedule created by Oprah Winfrey''s departure from broadcast TV. </p>
<p>The yet-to-be-named show will begin in September 2012,
Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a statement.
Couric will also join ABC News, anchoring specials, doing
interviews and participating in event coverage. </p>
<p>Many of Disney''s company-owned ABC stations carried
Winfrey''s daily talk show in cities including Chicago, New York,
Los Angeles and Philadelphia. While the show was distributed by
CBS Corp. (CBS), Disney will have to fill the void in those areas and
is in a position to market Couric to other stations that are now
Oprah-less. </p>
<p>Katie Couric is one of television''s iconic figures and we
are thrilled to have forged such an exciting partnership with
her, Anne Sweeney, president of Disney/ABC Television Group
and co-chair of Disney Media Networks, said in the statement. </p>
<p>Couric, 54, left CBS News after five years and declining
ratings. She will share in the talk show''s revenue, two people
with knowledge of the deal said last month. </p>
<p>Jeff Zucker, former head of NBC Universal, will be
executive producer of the new program. He oversaw NBC''s
Today show, where Couric was co-anchor from 1991 to 2006. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
sell Litton Loan Servicing LP to Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) for
$263.7 million in cash, ending the New York-based bank''s 3-1/2
year experiment in processing home-loan payments. </p>
<p>In addition to the cash payment, which may be adjusted at
closing, Ocwen will pay about $337.4 million to retire some of
Litton''s debt, according to a filing by West Palm Beach,
Florida-based Ocwen. The sale of Litton comes two months after
Goldman Sachs wrote down the value of the mortgage-servicing
business by about $200 million. </p>
<p>It really makes sense for them to sell it, and better for
them to sell it sooner rather than later, said David B. Hilder, a New York-based analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group
LP who has a positive rating on Goldman Sachs. They bought it
at a time when the business was easier and it looked like there
might be some insights to be gained in the mortgage market from
having a servicer. </p>
<p>Mortgage servicing firms send out bills, collect payments
and handle foreclosures. Goldman Sachs acquired Litton, based in
Houston, and 1,000 employees at a time when investors including
billionaire Wilbur Ross and Centerbridge Capital Partners LLC
purchased mortgage servicers to help them better understand the
market, and profit from buying discounted loans. Goldman Sachs
said in March that it was considering selling Litton, and a
person familiar with the matter said the firm had failed to find
enough distressed mortgage loans to buy. </p>
<p>$41.2 Billion Portfolio </p>
<p>Ocwen is getting a portfolio of loans with about $41.2
billion in unpaid principal balance as of March 31, most of them
non-prime home mortgages, the filing said. Ocwen agreed to
finance about $2.47 billion of servicing advances associated
with the business, the statement said. Advances include the
principal, interest, taxes and insurance remittances that
servicers must make to securities trusts even when homeowners
fall behind on those payments. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs will remain liable for fines and penalties
that could be imposed by government authorities relating to
Litton''s foreclosure and servicing practices before the deal
closes, the statement said, and Goldman Sachs will share some of
the losses arising out of claims from third parties, such as
investors and borrowers, in connection to servicing agreements. </p>
<p>Fines and Penalties </p>
<p>Litton is among the mortgage-servicing businesses
cooperating with investigations by 50 state attorneys general
into foreclosure practices. The probe began after authorities
discovered some firms used faulty paperwork to seize homes. </p>
<p>The inquiries may result in the imposition of fines or
other regulatory action, Goldman Sachs said in its quarterly
regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission on May 10. As of the date of this filing, the firm
is not aware of foreclosures where the underlying foreclosure
decision was not warranted. </p>
<p>Litton''s value has declined since Goldman Sachs purchased
it in 2007. Most of a $220 million impairment charge that
Goldman Sachs took on assets held for sale in the first quarter
was related to Litton, the bank said. Litton''s mortgage-
servicing rights were not material to Goldman Sachs as of
March, having dropped from $283 million at the end of February
2008, filings show. </p>
<p>Keeping Certain Assets'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs does not expect the sale to have any
material impact on earnings in the second quarter due to the
combination of the sales price and the impairment charge
announced in the first quarter of 2011 primarily related to
Litton, the bank said in a statement today, adding that the
company plans to retain certain assets. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs never disclosed how much it paid to acquire
Litton from Credit-Based Asset Servicing and Securitization LLC,
or C-Bass. Radian Group Inc. (RDN), the second-largest U.S. mortgage
insurer and a part owner of C-Bass, disclosed a month before the
sale was completed that the unit would be sold for about $467.9
million to an unnamed buyer. </p>
<p>Dealing with individual homeowners and individual
borrowers just doesn''t fit the rest of Goldman''s business,
said Susquehanna''s Hilder. The decline in home prices
overwhelmed any benefit. </p>
<p>Ocwen''s Advance </p>
<p>In contrast to Goldman Sachs''s falling stock price this
year, Ocwen''s shares gained more than 30 percent in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading through last week. The shares
gained 7 cents to $12.57 as of 11:52 a.m. in New York. Goldman
Sachs fell 72 cents to $134.61. </p>
<p>Ocwen agreed in May 2010 to buy HomEq Servicing, a
mortgage-servicing business owned by London-based Barclays Plc (BARC),
for about $1.3 billion in cash conditional on the value of
certain assets at completion, according to a statement from
Barclays at the time. Barclays also agreed to provide Ocwen with
about $1 billion in secured financing in connection with the
deal and offered assistance in raising more funds, the statement
said. </p>
<p>Barclays advised Ocwen on the purchase of Litton and is one
of the lenders, along with Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc, providing Ocwen''s new facility to finance
Litton''s servicing advances. Ocwen has also received a
commitment letter from Barclays to provide a senior secured term
loan facility of $575 million to finance the transaction, the
filing said. </p>
<p>Before buying Litton, Goldman Sachs had tried to avoid
businesses that involved the mass-market or retail customer.
David Viniar, Goldman Sachs''s chief financial officer, told
analysts in September 2006, more than a year before the company
bought Litton, that the firm was reluctant to buy a lender
because of the retail concern. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is largely an institutional business,
Viniar said at the time. There are different risks when you''re
touching the retail customer. </p>

<p>Banks in the European Union may have
to raise 29 billion euros ($42 billion) following this year''s
stress tests, according to a survey by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) </p>
<p>Nine of the 91 lenders examined may fail, London-based
analysts Jernej Omahen, Peter Oppenheimer, Christian Mueller- Glissmann and Peter Skoog wrote in a report today, citing the
average response in a survey of 113 participants from the
financial industry. Spanish, German and Greek banks would need
to raise the most new capital, according to the poll. The share
of participants saying they expect results of the stress test to
be credible was smaller than last year. </p>
<p>The European Banking Authority has said banks have to
maintain a core Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 5 percent under
this year''s scenarios. The exams include a review of how lenders
would handle a 0.5 percent economic contraction in the euro area
in 2011 as well as a 15 percent drop in European equity markets.
The publication of the results may be delayed until July, an EBA
official said last week. </p>
<p>A month ahead of the results release, there appears to be
little consensus about how much might have to be raised and what
the impact will be, the Goldman Sachs analysts said. Only 22
percent of respondents signaled they were confident in the
test''s outcome, compared with 35 percent a year ago who said the
results would be a credible reflection of resilience in an
economic slowdown, according to the analysts. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) announced it found
the equivalent of 700 million barrels of oil beneath the Gulf of
Mexico, the biggest discovery in the region in 12 years. </p>
<p>The estimated size of the Hadrian field may increase as
drilling continues, Exxon said in a statement today. The
discovery is about 250 miles (400 kilometers) southwest of New
Orleans in 7,000 feet of water, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said. </p>
<p>Exploratory drilling began in 2009 at the prospect and the
company had finished two wells when a record oil spill from BP
Plc''s Macondo well last year prompted a U.S. moratorium on deep-
water exploration. Exxon confirmed the find with a third well it
began drilling on March 26 under new government safety rules
designed to protect rig workers and the environment. </p>
<p>Exxon''s Hadrian discovery is the biggest in the Gulf since
BP''s 1 billion-barrel Thunder Horse find in 1999, Mohammad
Rahman, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Houston, said
today in a telephone interview. Exxon engineers now are drilling
deeper on the third Hadrian well, which currently extends 23,000
feet beneath the sea surface, because they believe there is more
oil to be found, company spokesman Patrick McGinn said during an
interview today. </p>
<p>This is a very, very significant find, Rahman said.
When a supermajor like Exxon Mobil throws a number like 700
million at you, it indicates they are very confident in what
they''ve got here. </p>
<p>Gulf Crude Production </p>
<p>The Gulf accounted for 29 percent of U.S. crude production
in 2009, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Wells in water 1,000 feet or deeper accounted for 81 percent of
the Gulf''s oil output last year, a 10-fold increase from 1991,
according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy. </p>
<p>Exxon rose as much as 2.3 percent, the most since March 21.
The shares gained 76 cents to $80.76 at 4:09 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Exxon has increased 11 percent
this year, exceeding the 10 percent rise in New York crude
futures during the same period. </p>
<p>This is good news not only for Exxon but for the industry
as a whole because it shows that the deep water still holds
significant promise, Gianna Bern, founder of Brookshire
Advisory and Research Inc., a Chicago-based risk-management
adviser, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>There were 27 rigs drilling wells in Gulf waters deeper
than 1,000 feet as of June 6, according to the Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, the Interior
Department agency that oversees offshore oil and gas activity. </p>
<p>Moratorium Delay </p>
<p>Exxon could have made the discovery sooner if the
administration of President Barack Obama hadn''t been slow to
issue drilling permits after the moratorium was lifted in
October, said Representative Darrell Issa, a California
Republican who leads the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee. The Bureau of Ocean Energy issued the first new deep-
water drilling permit on Feb. 28, 4  months after the ban
formally ended. </p>
<p>Today''s announcement is good news, but it cuts both
ways, Issa said today in an e-mailed statement. Lost time is
lost opportunity and the economic price has been paid by workers
in the Gulf region and consumers at the gap pump. </p>
<p>Mostly Oil </p>
<p>Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson in March
announced plans to spend $100 million a day for the next half
decade to expand the search for oil and natural gas in geologic
formations previously regarded as impenetrable. The company''s
exploration prospects extend from Greenland to Madagascar to
Vietnam. </p>
<p>The Hadrian field is about 85 percent oil, based on data
from three wells, the company said. Eni SpA (ENI) and Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4) also hold stakes in the prospect, according to the
release. </p>
<p>Exxon is leasing A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S''s Maersk Developer
rig to drill into Hadrian. The 2-year-old vessel is equipped to
drill as deep as 40,000 feet beneath the sea surface, according
to RigZone, a research firm that tracks the offshore drilling
industry. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, may eliminate more jobs at its wealth
management unit as Barclays Capital cuts positions in its
equities division worldwide. </p>
<p>As we continue to take actions to improve broker
efficiency we may reduce our broker headcount below previously
announced targets, Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said at the Deutsche Bank Global Financial Services
Conference yesterday. The unit, which had about 17,800 employees
at the end of March, was previously aiming to reduce that figure
to as little as 17,500, according to a spokesman for the bank.
The firm cut 300 brokers at the division in the first quarter. </p>
<p>Barclays Capital, the investment-banking unit of London-
based Barclays Plc (BARC), cut as many as 50 jobs in its equities
division worldwide, a person familiar with the matter said. The
reductions affected employees in sales, trading and research,
said the person, who requested anonymity because the plan isn''t
public. The move, part of a mid-year performance assessment,
wasn''t made because of declining revenue, the person said. </p>
<p>Barclays, the U.K.''s third-largest bank by assets, said in
April that pretax profit at its investment bank fell 33 percent
as revenue from fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading
tumbled. Equities-trading revenue at global investment banks,
including Barclays Capital, will drop an average of 12 percent
in the second quarter, compared with the previous three-month
period, according to an estimate yesterday by Kian Abouhossein,
a JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) analyst. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), one of three banks
that led LinkedIn Corp.''s initial public offering, holds 2.04
million shares of the professional-networking website. </p>
<p>The stake equals 22.7 percent of the stock sold in the IPO,
the investment bank said today in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Mountain View, California-
based LinkedIn''s owners sold less than 10 percent of the company
in the offering. </p>
<p>The majority of shares disclosed in today''s filing were
acquired on the open market after the transaction, according to
a person with direct knowledge of the matter. They are being
held on behalf of clients in the New York-based Morgan Stanley''s
funds, the person said, declining to be identified because the

<p>LinkedIn''s stock, priced at $45 in last month''s offering,
surged to $94.25 amid scarce supply on the first day of trading.
It has since slid 24 percent in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading to close at $72.01 today. Charlotte, North

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) raised a $461.3
million loan fund to be managed by Apollo Global Management LLC,
according to a person with knowledge of the deal. </p>
<p>The collateralized loan obligation, ALM IV, includes a

124 basis points more than the London interbank offered rate,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the terms

<p>The new fund brings CLOs backed by widely syndicated loans
issued this year to more than $4 billion, according to data

in 2009, according to Bloomberg and Morgan Stanley data. </p>
<p>CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return. </p>
<p>The Apollo fund also includes a $58.5 million slice rated
AA that pays a rate of 190 basis points more than the benchmark;
a $29.8 million portion graded A; a $20.3 million piece rated

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s stockpile of
copper and ownership of warehouses for goods traded on the
London Metal Exchange won''t be probed for market violations,
Britain''s antitrust regulator said, citing a lack of evidence
and jurisdiction. </p>
<p>The U.K. parliamentary committee that sought the review
didn''t give proof that certain large dealers on the exchange
were undermining the market by owning warehouses, the U.K.
Office of Fair Trading said in a May 27 letter posted on the
Science and Technology Committee''s website. </p>
<p>In the light of the range of options that appear to be
available to companies that wish to arrange trades on the London
Metal Exchange, we do not consider there to be any obvious
competition issues, the watchdog said in the letter. </p>
<p>The exchange last year handled $11.6 trillion in contracts,
offering trading in metals from copper to cobalt to steel. In
May, the committee said it was concerned about allegations made
by other traders at hearings reviewing the country''s
strategically important metals. </p>
<p>Other allegations that New York-based JPMorgan could
distort commodity markets by owning 50 percent of the stock of
copper as part of a creation of an exchange-traded fund fall
under the jurisdiction of Britain''s Financial Services
Authority, the OFT said. </p>
<p>A JPMorgan spokeswoman, Jennifer Zuccarelli, said in an e-
mail the company declined to comment </p>
<p>LME Response </p>
<p>The suggestions that ownership of a warehousing company
implies anticompetitive behavior is unjustified and completely
out of context, LME spokeswoman Miriam Heywood said today in
an e-mail. The practice is not new and there are clear and
robust regulations in place. </p>
<p>More than 400 warehouses in about 35 countries handle metal
traded on the exchange, and JPMorgan''s Henry Bath unit has
warehouses in 14 locations, the OFT said. </p>
<p>Most reserves of metals from lithium used in batteries to
cobalt for medical implants are unlikely to run out over the
coming decades, according to the committee''s report. The
perception of scarcity may lead to increased speculation. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and the Ritz-
Carlton Hotel Co. are making a run for American Express Co. (AXP)''s
affluent clients with the hotel''s first rewards program targeted
at value-minded luxury customers. </p>
<p>The Ritz-Carlton Rewards card will give points as well as
room upgrades and other services at the hotel''s roughly 75
worldwide locations, according to executives of the two
companies. The card, which carries the Visa Inc. (V) brand, has an
annual fee of $395 and an interest rate of prime plus 11.99
percent. </p>
<p>Perks include access to JPMorgan''s concierge service,
currently available only to the New York-based company''s
wealthiest customers in its private bank, as well as access to
about 600 first-class airport lounges and $200 toward baggage
fees and other incidentals on flights on all major airlines. </p>
<p>We found out in 2008 and 2009 that people wanted more
value, Herve Humler, president and chief operations officer of
Ritz-Carlton, said in an interview before announcing the
program. The hotel company, based in Chevy Chase, Maryland,
started its first rewards program in September and has about
100,000 members who are being offered the card, Humler said. </p>
<p>Applications are also being taken online. The bank is
targeting prime and super-prime customers, those who have
the highest credit scores and incomes among borrowers, said Tina
Chen, who is running the Ritz-Carlton rewards card program for
JPMorgan. Cardholders will be awarded 50,000 Ritz-Carlton points
after their first purchase, which can be redeemed for a one-
night stay. </p>
<p>AmEx, the biggest credit-card issuer by purchases,
dominates the market for affluent consumers. Its customers spend
about three to four times more than those who use Visa and
MasterCard Inc. credit cards, AmEx has said. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s largest computer-services provider, is using
its technology knowledge to help preserve medieval art in a bid
to gain clients seeking to make their buildings more efficient. </p>
<p>IBM is installing sensors at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
in New York that will monitor room temperature, humidity and
chemicals and automatically make adjustments to preserve art,
the company said in a statement. The project is starting in the
museum''s Cloisters branch, which houses medieval art, and will
later expand to the rest of the museum. </p>
<p>The project is part of the Armonk, New York-based company''s
bid to digitally monitor buildings -- and everything from
traffic and utilities to hospitals -- to make them more
efficient. The initiative, coined Smarter Planet, is expected to
generate $10 billion in sales for IBM by 2015. The global market
for managing buildings specifically should more than triple to
$10.2 billion in that time frame, according to Framingham,
Massachusetts-based research firm IDC. </p>
<p>IBM''s sensors at the museum will detect humidity and
temperature, as well as other elements, such as when a door
opens, lights change, or when an air duct starts corroding and
emits chemicals, said Dave Bartlett, who heads the Smarter
Buildings program for IBM. </p>
<p>Years of Preservation'' </p>
<p>It''s immediate, Bartlett said in a telephone interview
yesterday. Every minute you can maintain the optimum
condition, you''re putting years of preservation on that. Every
minute you don''t, you''re adding pressure on that piece of art. </p>
<p>After the project expands to the rest of the museum, the
company expects to work with others on similar technology, he
said. </p>
<p>IBM also announced its building-management software, which
tracks a structure''s boilers, water pipes and outside
temperatures to monitor energy use and predict needed
maintenance. </p>
<p>For example, if the air conditioning and the heat are on,
the software will detect that and determine which needs to be
shut down, Bartlett said. If a fan is working overtime, an alert
will pop up to check the area and see if a nearby fan needs to
be replaced. </p>
<p>It''s like tuning. As we work and live with these
buildings, we can do this in real-time, Bartlett said.
That''s the huge opportunity. </p>
<p>When IBM used it at some of its buildings in Rochester,
Minnesota, it saved 8 percent in energy costs, according to the
statement. The software, which is priced per square-foot, is
available July 1. </p>
<p>IBM rose 50 cents to $164.84 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 12 percent
this year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
pay a $10 million fine and stop holding private meetings of
stock analysts and traders known as huddles to settle an
investigation by Massachusetts''s chief securities regulator. </p>
<p>The settlement ends a two-year probe by William Galvin, the
secretary of the commonwealth, into New York-based Goldman
Sachs''s Asymmetric Service Initiative, in which information
on analysts'' trading ideas was disseminated earlier to favored
clients. The company will permanently discontinue the
practice, Galvin''s office said in a statement today. </p>
<p>The investigation concluded that the dissemination by
equity analysts of unpublished short-term trading ideas was a
dishonest and unethical violation of the Massachusetts Uniform
Securities Act by putting certain clients at an advantage over
others, Galvin''s office said in the statement. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs analysts, who publish stock recommendations
for long-term investments, attended weekly meetings where they
shared short-term trading ideas, the Wall Street Journal
reported in 2009, citing internal company documents. Galvin''s
office sent a subpoena to Goldman Sachs shortly after the
article was published and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which
polices brokerages, also began examining the practice. </p>
<p>Finra''s Probe </p>
<p>The authority, known as Finra, is close to concluding its
investigation of Goldman Sachs''s trading huddles, a person
familiar with the situation said today. The person spoke on
condition of anonymity because the details of the investigation
aren''t public. Michelle Ong, a spokeswoman for Finra, said she
couldn''t comment. John Nester, a spokesman for the SEC, declined
to comment. </p>
<p>We are pleased to have resolved this matter with the
Massachusetts securities division, Stephen Cohen, a Goldman
Sachs spokesman in New York, said in an interview. </p>
<p>While the settlement finds that Goldman Sachs engaged in
dishonorable or dishonest conduct, it adds that nothing in the
settlement shall be construed as a finding or admission of
fraud. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
natural-gas producer, paid $1.69 billion for two closely held
energy explorers to gain shale-gas reserves in Pennsylvania and
neighboring states. </p>
<p>Exxon completed the purchases of Phillips Resources Inc.,
based in Warrendale, Pennsylvania, and TWP Inc. of Butler,
Pennsylvania, on June 2, Alan Jeffers, an Irving, Texas-based
spokesman at Exxon, said in a phone interview yesterday. The 200
employees at the two companies may be retained, he said. </p>
<p>Exxon paid $34.9 billion for XTO Energy last year, making
it the biggest U.S. gas producer. The acquisition of Phillips
Resources and TWP gives Exxon access to 317,000 acres in the
Marcellus Shale, a gas-rich geological formation that stretches
beneath several eastern states including New York, Pennsylvania
and West Virginia. </p>
<p>The fact that Exxon is buying in now is a vote of
confidence in shale in the U.S., Tony Regan, a Singapore-based
consultant at Tri-Zen International, said by telephone today.
There had been a feeling that activity might have peaked a
bit. Exxon is a big, cautious company, and they wouldn''t have
rushed into this. </p>
<p>Global energy producers such as Total SA (FP) and BHP Billiton
Ltd. are investing in shale formations impervious to traditional
drilling methods. In the past 10 years, U.S. drilling engineers
adapted decades-old hydraulic-fracturing techniques to free gas
from dense shale rock, unleashing new supplies that have glutted
the North American market and depressed prices. </p>
<p>U.S. gas futures have lost 69 percent of their value since
peaking at $15.78 per million British thermal units in December
2005, amid a surfeit of supply from shale formations in Texas,
Louisiana and Arkansas. The New York-traded futures closed at
$4.85 per million Btu yesterday. </p>
<p>Shale Exploration </p>
<p>Shares of Exxon rose 31 percent in New York trading in the
past year, beating a 22 percent gain in the Standard  Poor''s
500 Index. The stock climbed 57 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $81.33
at 12:25 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>Exxon''s XTO unit will manage Phillips Resources and TWP,
which held combined reserves equivalent to 228 billion cubic
feet of gas at the end of 2010, Jeffers said. </p>
<p>Rex Tillerson, Exxon''s chief executive officer, said in
March that the company plans to export XTO''s expertise in shale
drilling to under-explored areas of Europe such as Poland. </p>
<p>Shale formations have the potential to more than double the
world''s gas reserves, the U.S. Energy Information Agency said in
an April 5 assessment. The U.S. has an estimated 827 trillion
cubic feet of shale gas and it may account for 47 percent of the
nation''s production of the fuel by 2035, the agency said. </p>
<p>Acquisitions in the shale industry are set to continue,
with vulnerable smaller guys being taken out as they face
higher costs and increased regulation, Tri-Zen''s Regan said. </p>

<p>BSI Group, the Swiss private bank
owned by insurer Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), plans to boost
assets under management through inflows from Asian customers and
more than double the number of bankers it employs in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>We want to recover relatively fast, from the lag with
other banks that have moved to Asia more quickly than BSI, Chief
Executive Officer Alfredo Gysi said at a press conference in
Zurich today. The Lugano-based company''s total assets dropped by
1.9 billion Swiss francs ($2.3 billion) to 76.2 billion francs
last year, while net new money in 2010 was 3.8 billion francs. </p>
<p>The firm opened an office in Singapore in 2007 where it
employs 210 people, and has a smaller office in Hong Kong where
it plans to get a banking license by September. The bank seeks
to keep the headcount in Singapore stable and increase the
number of bankers in Hong Kong to about 120 from 50 by the end
of next year, Gysi said. </p>
<p>We will break even in Singapore by the end of next year
and Hong Kong will follow a year later, the CEO said. Assets
under management in Singapore were about $9 billion at the end
of 2010. </p>
<p>The bank plans to attract more wealthy Russian clients and
other eastern Europeans with its office in Zurich, where it
employs 120 bankers, up from 25 five years ago. The Geneva unit,
where BSI has about 140 bankers, mainly focuses on clients from
the Middle East. </p>

<p>Lobby groups representing some of
the world''s biggest financial companies want U.S. regulators to
delay rules that would govern resolutions of systemically risky
firms to allow more time to review and revise the proposal. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
must clarify what constitutes a credible plan for unwinding
a complex firm before requiring companies to file so-called
living wills, six groups including the Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association and the Institute of International
Bankers said in a letter to the regulators, according to a copy
obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>There are potentially severe business-model and
competitive consequences to any financial firm if the Federal
Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. were to jointly
determine that the company''s resolution plan is not
credible,'' the groups said in the letter, which they plan to
send to the agencies today. Supervisors should not create a
system that manages for failure rather than for success. </p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Act requires firms deemed systemically
important to file plans with the Fed and the FDIC for how they
could be unwound in event of their failure. Lawmakers gave the
FDIC resolution authority for shutdowns of complex firms aiming
to prevent a repeat of the market tumult that followed the
September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>The groups, representing firms including JPMorgan Chase 
Co (JPM), BlackRock Inc. (BLK), Bank of New York Mellon, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group PLC and Deutsche Bank AG, urged regulators to
push back implementation of the rules from next month to as late
as January of next year. </p>
<p>Workable Plans </p>
<p>Under the living-wills provision, companies with at least
$50 billion in assets will have to provide information on their
debt, funding, capital and cash flows. Firms that fail to file
workable plans for unwinding their business could be subject to
increased capital, leverage or liquidity requirements as well as
restrictions on their growth, activities or operations. </p>
<p>One of the challenges in the resolution-planning process
is that a financial business should be managed to optimize
capital information, prudent maturity transformation and
economic growth as a going concern, rather than for failure as a
gone concern, the organizations wrote in the 53-page letter
addressed to the Fed and the FDIC. </p>
<p>In addition to Sifma and IIB, signers included the Clearing
House Association, the American Bankers Association, the
Association for Financial Markets in Europe and the Financial
Services Roundtable. </p>
<p>Broader Pushback </p>
<p>Financial-industry criticism of the living-wills measure is
part of a broader pushback against Dodd-Frank, the regulatory
overhaul enacted in response to the worst financial crisis since
the Great Depression. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon questioned Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke at a public forum
on June 7 over whether new rules may threaten economic growth. </p>
<p>In today''s letter, the industry groups cited concerns about
confidentiality of the information companies will have to give
regulators as part of the resolution plans. </p>
<p>We realize that the Freedom of Information Act or FOIA
will apply to data submitted in resolution plans and credit-
exposure reports, making it critical that the information
submitted be treated as an integral part of the examination
process and subject to similar protections, the organization
said in the letter. Resolution plans and credit-exposure
reports should therefore be made subject to the strongest FOIA
protection available. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, could shut down its trading businesses and
the firm would be worth 40 percent more than yesterday''s share
price, according to Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.
analyst. </p>
<p>An analysis of the liquidation of the sales and trading
operations, which constitute 80 percent of the firm''s balance
sheet, shows that the equity market is overreacting to
impatience in the firm''s turnaround, Hintz wrote in a note to
investors today. Hintz said he isn''t endorsing a dismantling of
the trading operations. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley shares have dropped 27 percent from their
recent peak in February as investors express concern over new
regulations and capital rules. After accounting for the planned
conversion of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.''s preferred
stake in the New York-based firm, the shares are trading at a 13
percent discount to tangible book value, Hintz said. </p>
<p>We have long argued that absent a liquidity crisis, the
mark-to-market balance sheets of Wall Street trading firms
support a trough valuation at tangible book value, Hintz
wrote. This is because at low valuations, an acquirer could
simply liquidate the trading balance sheet, pay off the
liabilities and walk away with more cash than they paid for the
company. Thus, at certain P/TB levels, such as today, a broker
is worth more dead than alive. </p>
<p>Outperform'' Recommendation </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley fell 26 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $22.25 at
12:34 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares yesterday touched their lowest level since April 2009,
and this week are headed for the 14th decline in 16 weeks. </p>
<p>Hintz maintained his outperform recommendation on the
stock, and he expects the share price to reach $35, according to
the note. </p>
<p>The current share price is undervalued even under the most
pessimistic outlooks for regulation and retail investor trading,
barring a major liquidity run similar to 2008, Hintz wrote.
Morgan Stanley should pay off handsomely for long-term
investors that buy now, he said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is unlikely
to face charges from investigations into the firm''s mortgage
practices before the financial crisis, according to Richard X. Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities LLC. </p>
<p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that a terrible
wrong may have been done to Goldman Sachs, Bove wrote in a
note to investors dated June 8. </p>
<p>Bove suggested less than a month ago that clients sell the
firm''s stock because the U.S. Department of Justice was under
pressure to bring claims, based on a report from the U.S.
Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations accusing
Goldman Sachs of misleading buyers of mortgage-linked
investments. </p>
<p>The firm, which paid $550 million to settle Securities and
Exchange Commission charges related to its marketing of mortgage
securities, was subpoenaed by the Manhattan District Attorney''s
office for information on business practices leading into the
credit crisis, two people familiar with the matter said last
week. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and
other executives at the firm have said that its traders placed
short bets, which profited when prices of mortgage-linked
securities fell, to hedge against losses. Blankfein also said in
last year''s hearing that Goldman Sachs didn''t have a "massive
short" against the housing market, and was acting as a market
maker in selling collateralized debt obligations and other
mortgage-backed investments to clients. </p>
<p>Senate Findings </p>
<p>The Senate subcommittee said that documents uncovered in
its two-year investigation of the financial crisis show that
Goldman Sachs''s mortgage traders did have a large short position
during 2007 and the sales team aggressively sought clients to
buy CDOs that the traders expected would decline in value. </p>
<p>Evidence is now mounting that the company did not have a
net short position" during the time in question, Bove said in
his note. "The Senate committee may have misread the numbers. </p>
<p>Bove also said it was "becoming apparent" that Blankfein
"did not misrepresent to the Senate Committee because Goldman
was not net short at the time the firm was accused of
misrepresenting its position.'''' </p>
<p>Bove maintained his sell rating on Goldman Sachs and
lowered his earnings estimates for 2011, 2012 and 2013, citing a
relatively bleak second quarter and a weakened secular
outlook. </p>
<p>AG''s Review </p>
<p>U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder, testifying before the
House Judiciary Committee on May 3, confirmed that his
department is reviewing the report from the Senate committee,
which was led by Michigan Democrat Carl M. Levin. Oklahoma''s
Thomas A. Coburn is the ranking Republican on the panel. </p>
<p>The bank rose 14 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $133.67 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading at 10:24 a.m., two days
after it touched the lowest value in almost a year. The shares
are down 21 percent this year, and have fallen in 12 of the last
15 weeks. </p>
<p>Bove, who is based in Lutz, Florida, is one of two analysts
with a negative rating on Goldman Sachs, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The other is Christopher Wheeler, a
London-based analyst for Mediobanca SpA. Of 28 analysts
surveyed, 18 recommend that investors buy the stock and eight
call for holding it. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
pay a $10 million fine and stop holding private meetings of
stock analysts and traders known as huddles to settle an
investigation by Massachusetts''s chief securities regulator. </p>
<p>The settlement ends a two-year probe by William Galvin, the
secretary of the commonwealth, into New York-based Goldman
Sachs''s Asymmetric Service Initiative, in which information
on analysts'' trading ideas was disseminated earlier to favored
clients. The company will permanently discontinue the
practice, Galvin''s office said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs analysts, who publish stock recommendations
for long-term investments, attended weekly meetings where they
shared short-term trading ideas, the Wall Street Journal
reported in 2009, citing internal company documents. Galvin''s
office sent a subpoena to Goldman Sachs shortly after the
article was published. The Securities and Exchange Commission
and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority also began examining
the practice. </p>
<p>Finra is close to concluding its investigation of Goldman
Sachs''s trading huddles, a person familiar with the situation
said yesterday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity
because the details of the investigation aren''t public. </p>
<p>Michelle Ong, a spokeswoman for Finra, said she couldn''t
comment. John Nester, a spokesman for the SEC, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>We are pleased to have resolved this matter with the
Massachusetts securities division, Stephen Cohen, a Goldman
Sachs spokesman in New York, said in an interview. </p>
<p>While the settlement finds that Goldman Sachs engaged in
dishonorable or dishonest conduct, it adds that nothing in the
settlement shall be construed as a finding or admission of
fraud. </p>
<p>Compliance Policy </p>
<p>Dodd-Frank Deadline May Create Black Hole,'' Roberts Says </p>
<p>Swaps users may face a black hole when Dodd-Frank Act
rules take effect next month because too much remains unresolved
for markets to operate properly, the Senate Agriculture
Committee''s top Republican said. </p>
<p>We don''t even know what a swap is under the financial
overhaul, Senator Pat Roberts said in an interview yesterday at
Bloomberg''s office in Washington. The Kansas Republican said the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission needs to outline what
provisions will apply when Dodd-Frank takes effect, and which
will require rule-making that will delay implementation. </p>
<p>The CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission are
writing new regulations required by the legislation enacted last
July, after largely unregulated swaps helped fuel the 2008
credit crisis. </p>
<p>Roberts joined Republican Senators Saxby Chambliss of
Georgia and Richard Lugar of Indiana in a letter to CFTC
Chairman Gary Gensler on May 27 asking for a list of Dodd-Frank
provisions that would become effective on July 16. They also
asked the CFTC''s view of how swaps transitions would be governed
while new regulations are put in place and how the commission
would provide greater legal certainty for the transactions
during the transition. </p>

<p>AEP Says New Air Rules May Cost Up to $8 Billion, 600 Jobs </p>
<p>American Electric Power Co. said it would have to spend as
much as $8 billion through the end of the decade to comply with
proposed federal regulations aimed at curbing carbon-dioxide
emissions from coal-fueled power plants. </p>
<p>The company estimated it would cut about 600 jobs and
shutter five coal-fueled power plants in Virginia, West Virginia
and Ohio if proposed federal rules are enacted, American
Electric said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Unrealistic timelines in the Environmental Protection
Agency proposals would force the company to prematurely shut
about 25 percent of its current coal-fueled generating capacity,
or 6,000 megawatts, said Michael Morris, American Electric''s
chairman and chief executive officer. </p>
<p>Business will face electricity price increases of 10
percent to more than 35 percent, Morris said in the statement. </p>
<p>Coal-fueled generation accounts for about 65 percent of
American Electric''s total generating capacity. The company has
spent more than $7.2 billion since 1990 to reduce emissions from
its coal power plants. </p>
<p>PCAOB to Weigh Inspection Program for Broker-Dealers'' Auditors </p>
<p>The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board will meet
next week to consider establishing an interim inspection program
for registered public accounting firms'' audits of brokers and
dealers. </p>
<p>The measure, which would be part of the adoption of the
nonprofit corporation''s expanded oversight responsibilities
under the Dodd-Frank Act, will be weighed at a June 14 meeting
in Washington, the PCAOB said yesterday in a statement. </p>
<p>U.K. Regulator Defends Liquidity Rules Against Bank Criticism </p>
<p>The U.K. Financial Services Authority defended rules
requiring lenders to hold increased liquidity buffers after
banks complained that the rules were tougher than international
standards. </p>
<p>The FSA disagrees with claims that banks must hold more
liquidity than is likely to be required under the implementation
of global rules proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, and to date have not seen any evidence from firms
to suggest otherwise, Liam Parker, an FSA spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement today. </p>
<p>The rules proposed by the FSA requiring banks to have
enough high-quality assets to survive a temporary liquidity
crisis could cause disruption in the payment systems as banks
delay payments in an attempt to reduce liquidity usage,
according to a paper published by Bank of England officials last
week. </p>
<p>The liquidity rules may require U.K. banks to buy as much
as 110 billion pounds ($161 billion) of government bonds. </p>

<p>Autoliv Raided as EU Probes Automotive-Parts Price Fixing </p>
<p>Autoliv Inc. (ALIV), the world''s biggest producer of seatbelts and
air bags, was raided by European Union authorities as part of an
antitrust investigation into car-parts suppliers. </p>
<p>The commission, the 27-nation EU''s competition authority,
said on its website yesterday that raids at producers of car
safety systems began on June 7. Stockholm-based Autoliv said
it''s cooperating with investigators. </p>
<p>The relationship between suppliers and automakers has
tightened as development times shorten and car companies insist
components be delivered shortly before assembly to reduce
inventory costs. Component manufacturers are critical to the
automotive industry, accounting for about 75 percent of the
value of an average car, up from 65 percent 10 to 15 years ago,
according to the Center of Automotive Management at the
University of Applied Sciences in Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany. </p>
<p>Autoliv said two of its facilities in Germany were visited
by EU officials. The commission didn''t say which companies it
inspected. </p>
<p>Cartels are the top priority for antitrust regulators,
the EU''s competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in April.
The commission said last year it is investigating companies that
make automotive electrical distribution systems as part of a
joint probe with the U.S. into possible price fixing. The
commission said there is no deadline to complete its
investigations. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Warehouses Won''t Get LME Investigation, U.K. OFT Says </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s stockpile of copper and ownership of
warehouses for goods traded on the London Metal Exchange won''t
be probed for market violations, Britain''s antitrust regulator
said, citing a lack of evidence and jurisdiction. </p>
<p>The U.K. parliamentary committee that sought the review
didn''t give proof that certain large dealers on the exchange
were undermining the market by owning warehouses, the U.K.
Office of Fair Trading said in a May 27 letter posted on the
Science and Technology Committee''s website. </p>
<p>The exchange last year handled $11.6 trillion in contracts,
offering trading in metals from copper to cobalt to steel. In
May, the committee said it was concerned about allegations made
by other traders at hearings reviewing the country''s
strategically important metals. </p>
<p>Other allegations that New York-based JPMorgan could
distort commodity markets by owning 50 percent of the stock of
copper as part of a creation of an exchange-traded fund fall
under the jurisdiction of Britain''s Financial Services
Authority, the OFT said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti didn''t immediately
return a call for comment. </p>
<p>LME spokeswoman Miriam Heywood said yesterday in an e-mail
that is it unjustified to suggest that ownership of a
warehousing company implies anticompetitive behavior. </p>
<p>More than 400 warehouses in about 35 countries handle metal
traded on the exchange, and JPMorgan''s Henry Bath unit has
warehouses in 14 locations, the OFT said. </p>
<p>SEC Cautions Investors on Buying Reverse-Merger Stocks </p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cautioned
investors about buying stakes in companies that gain listings on
U.S. exchanges through so-called reverse mergers, saying they
may be prone to fraud and other abuses. </p>
<p>Many of the companies, often overseas operations that
access U.S. markets by acquiring publicly traded firms with few
or no operations, either fail or struggle to remain viable
and may use small audit firms that don''t verify financial
statements, the SEC said yesterday in an investor bulletin. </p>
<p>Lori Schock, head of the SEC''s investor education office,
said in a statement that investors should be especially
careful when considering investing in the stock of reverse
merger companies. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s warning comes more than a year after the SEC
formed a task force to examine China-based reverse-merger
companies and their auditors. The SEC and exchanges have halted
trading in more than a dozen such firms in recent months, citing
missing financial information, according to the release. Several
such companies have seen their share prices plummet amid
allegations that their financial statements were inaccurate. </p>
<p>In a reverse merger, a closely held firm buys a so-called
shell company and becomes able to sell shares without the
scrutiny that would surround an initial public offering. </p>
<p>Goldman, U.S. Banks Probed by SEC on Libya Deals, WSJ Reports </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is among financial firms being
examined by U.S. regulators to determine if transactions with
Libya''s sovereign fund may have violated bribery laws, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing people it didn''t identify. </p>
<p>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission officials are
reviewing documents including those related to a $50 million fee
Goldman Sachs agreed to pay the Libyan fund to help recoup
losses, the newspaper said yesterday. The payment, which was to
be passed on by the Libyan Investment Authority to a firm run by
a local official''s son-in-law, was never made, it said. </p>
<p>HSBC Holdings Plc (5) and Goldman Sachs are among banks that
held funds for the Muammar Qaddafi-controlled Libyan sovereign
wealth fund, London-based advocacy group Global Witness said
last month. Talks between Goldman Sachs and the wealth fund
stalled before violent protests broke out in Libya in February,
the newspaper said, citing people it didn''t identify. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said it was confident it hadn''t violated any
rules or regulations, according to the Journal, citing spokesman
Lucas van Praag. An SEC spokesman declined to comment, the
newspaper said. The agency''s interest doesn''t mean that a formal
investigation will be started, the Journal said. </p>
<p>Connie Ling, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs, and Vinh Tran, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for HSBC,

<p>Ex-UBS Adviser Pleads Guilty to Fraud, Agrees to Prison </p>
<p>Steven Kobayashi, a former UBS AG (UBSN) financial adviser in
California, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and agreed to serve
more than five years in prison for improperly transferring
client funds to his bank accounts, U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag
said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Kobayashi, 39, of Livermore, California, was charged in
March with taking money from his clients'' UBS accounts and
putting it into his accounts, sometimes gaining customer
authorization to withdraw their money by telling them it would
be used to purchase investments, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>Between 2006 and 2009, Kobayashi transferred more than
$5.4 million in client funds to his bank accounts, prosecutors
said. In March, he settled a lawsuit brought by U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission alleging misappropriation of $3.3
million. He didn''t admit or deny wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Kobayashi pleaded guilty yesterday in federal court in
northern California to one count each of money laundering and
wire fraud. In a plea agreement with prosecutors, he agreed to
serve 65 months in prison and pay $5.4 million in restitution,
Haag said. </p>
<p>Kobayashi''s attorney, Joyce Leavitt, didn''t immediately
return a voice-mail message. </p>
<p>The criminal case is U.S. v Kobayashi, 11-106 and the SEC
case is U.S. v Kobayashi, 11-981, in U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (Oakland). </p>
<p>UBS Madoff Claims Must Wait for Luxembourg Court Ruling </p>
<p>UBS AG lost its bid to dismiss outright claims by LuxAlpha
Sicav-American Selection Fund''s French investors, who must wait
on related Luxembourg court cases before their claims can be
addressed, a Paris court said. </p>
<p>A commercial court in Paris said in an opinion June 9 that
while their case is admissible, it will wait to issue a final
ruling until the Luxembourg-based LuxAlpha liquidators'' claims
are resolved by judges there. </p>
<p>The suit is one of many over UBS''s role as custodian for
LuxAlpha, which invested 95 percent of its assets with Bernard
Madoff and is being liquidated. Irving H. Picard, the trustee
liquidating Madoff''s firm, sued the bank for $2.6 billion last
year, claiming UBS aided the fraud partly by setting up feeder
funds like LuxAlpha. </p>
<p>Dominique Gerster, a UBS spokesman, said the Zurich-based
bank welcomes the court''s overall conclusions. </p>
<p>UBS lawyer Denis Chemla told the Paris court at a March
hearing that LuxAlpha was created at the request of wealthy
clients who wanted a fund that allowed them to continue
investing with Madoff and that UBS didn''t issue any false
information. </p>
<p>Murdoch''s Sun Can''t Identify Ex-RBS CEO Goodwin''s Mistress </p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch''s Sun newspaper can''t identify a woman who
had an affair with former Royal Bank of Scotland Group Chief
Executive Officer Fred Goodwin, a judge ruled in a case
involving privacy and corporate governance. </p>
<p>Justice Michael Tugendhat at the High Court in London today
refused to allow the paper to name the woman, but modified a
court order to allow more details about her job description to
be published. </p>
<p>RBS posted the largest loss in U.K. corporate history in
2008 and required a 45 billion-pound ($74 billion) bailout
following its acquisition of ABN Amro Holding NV. Goodwin was
cleared of responsibility in December. The RBS rescue may
explain why the paper considers articles about Goodwin to be of
interest to readers, Tugendhat said in the ruling. He noted that
what is of interest to the public is not the same as what it
is in the public interest to publish. </p>
<p>The Sun''s lawyer, Richard Spearman, said at a June 1
hearing that an anonymity order was stifling public debate about
corporate governance at the bank before its 2008 bailout. Hugh
Tomlinson, the lawyer representing the woman, said at the same
hearing that there was no need to change the order because there
isn''t any evidence the affair contributed to the collapse of
RBS. </p>
<p>Tomlinson said he planned to challenge the judgment at the
Court of Appeal. Tugendhat said the Sun shouldn''t publish the
woman''s job description for 14 days to allow time for the appeal
to be filed. </p>
<p>The case is one of dozens involving so-called super
injunctions or privacy injunctions that ban newspapers from
printing stories about people''s sex lives. </p>
<p>German Top Court Schedules Hearing in Euro Bailout Suits </p>
<p>Germany''s top constitutional court scheduled a hearing on
lawsuits against the nation''s participation in the euro-area
rescue fund and the aid package for Greece. </p>
<p>The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe will hear
oral arguments in three cases over the issue on July 5, the
court said in an e-mailed statement today. The cases were
brought by a group of academics and lawmaker Peter Gauweiler. </p>
<p>The German high court has drawn criticism for not acting
swiftly on the suits, which were filed in the first half of
2010. The judges declined to issue emergency orders blocking the
aid package for Greece in May 2010 and the euro-area rescue fund
in June 2010 and didn''t schedule a hearing on the main legal
questions in the cases until yesterday. </p>
<p>The court is expected to consider whether the case can be
dismissed for procedural reasons as well as substantive
questions. The court normally takes a few months after a hearing
before it issues a ruling. </p>
<p>The cases are BVerfG, 2 BvR 987/10, 2 BvR 1099/10 and 2 BvR
1485/10. </p>
<p>Interviews/Speeches </p>
<p>Bair Says U.S. Must Avoid Amnesia in Response to Crisis </p>
<p>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair
strongly defended higher capital buffers for the biggest banks
and said U.S. regulators must guard against pressure to be less
vigilant in financial-industry oversight as the nation recovers
from the 2008 credit crisis. </p>
<p>I see a lot of amnesia setting in now, Bair said
yesterday during a question-and-answer session at the Council on
Foreign Relations in New York, where she discussed her tenure at
the FDIC and the government''s response to the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression. </p>
<p>Bair was asked to respond after JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, head of the most profitable U.S.
bank, pressed Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in a
public forum on June 7 on whether regulators have risked slowing
growth by going too far in reining in the U.S. banking system. </p>
<p>Regulators must look at the relationships among different
rules and may have to phase in regulations on derivatives, Bair
said in an acknowledgement of some agreement with Dimon. In
other areas, such as a 3 percent equity capital buffer for
systemically important firms, the new rules will help protect
the financial system while allowing large banks to earn a
reasonable return, she said. </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court upheld a
patent-infringement verdict that will cost Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) $300
million and already has forced changes in its Word software. </p>
<p>The justices yesterday unanimously rejected calls from
Microsoft and its allies, including Apple Inc. and Google Inc. (GOOG),
to overturn the award and make some patents more vulnerable to
legal challenge. </p>
<p>The ruling is a victory for closely held I4i LP, which
claimed in its 2007 lawsuit that its patented technology had
been incorporated into Word, the word-processing program used by
500 million people. The award is the largest ever upheld on
appeal in a patent case. </p>
<p>Microsoft, which had $5.2 billion in profit in the first
quarter of 2011, hasn''t yet paid I4i any damages. </p>
<p>While the outcome is not what we had hoped for, we will
continue to advocate for changes to the law that will prevent
abuse of the patent system and protect inventors who hold
patents representing true innovation, said Kevin Kutz, a
Microsoft spokesman, in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Microsoft contended that the disputed patent was based on
technology already in the marketplace. The question for the
Supreme Court was whether, as a lower court concluded, Microsoft
needed to make that showing by clear and convincing evidence
to overcome the longstanding presumption that patents approved
by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are valid. </p>
<p>Microsoft argued that a less-demanding standard should
apply when a jury is presented with evidence about pre-existing
technology that the patent examiner didn''t consider. </p>
<p>Writing for the Supreme Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said
that the clear-and-convincing standard is a decades-old rule
that Congress has repeatedly declined to revisit. </p>
<p>Any recalibration of the standard of proof remains in its
hands, Sotomayor said. </p>
<p>The case is Microsoft v. I4i Limited Partnership, 10-290. </p>

<p>Apple Seeks Patent on Movie-Finding Application for IPhone </p>
<p>Apple Inc. (AAPL), maker of the iPad and iPhone, applied for a

<p>Application 20110137690, published in the database of the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office yesterday, covers an
application for an electronic device that can search variables
before presenting movie information. </p>
<p>The variables include geographic proximity of the theater,
the show start time closest to the current time of day, show
finish time, and traffic conditions, according to the
application. The variables also could be factored into use of
the mobile electronic device to buy tickets for the movie or
other event. </p>

<p>Copyright </p>
<p>Mohawk Seeks Declaration of Non-Infringement of Rug Design </p>
<p>Mohawk Industries Inc. (MHK), a rug manufacturer based in
Calhoun, Georgia, asked a federal court to declare it isn''t
infringing the copyright of a Maine-based design and licensing
company. </p>
<p>In the complaint filed June 7 in federal court in Atlanta,
Mohawk said it received notice from counsel for Angela Adams
Licensing LLC that one of its carpets is substantially
similar to an Adams design. </p>
<p>Included in the court filing is a letter from Margaret
Minister O''Keefe of Portland, Maine''s Pierce Atwood, suggesting
that any potential dispute can be resolved amicably. </p>
<p>Mohawk''s response to that letter, also included in the
court filing, was sent by Michael D. Hobbs Jr. of Atlanta''s
Troutman Sanders LLP. Mohawk takes Angela Adams'' claims
seriously and carefully analyzed her design and the design of
the carpet that allegedly infringes, he said. </p>
<p>He said that the geometric elements in Adams''s design
date back thousands of years and are not original to Angela
Adams. In the 1950s and 1960s, designers commonly adopted
those ancient geometric designs into mod'' mid-century decor,
rugs and fabrics. The Mohawk rug at issue is a retro
design based on mid-century elements that have been popular
for at least the last ten years, he said. </p>
<p>Mohawk asked the court to declare that it doesn''t infringe
the Adams design, and for awards of attorney fees and litigation
costs. It also seeks a declaration that the Adams design does
not contain protectable originality. </p>

<p>Nu Image''s Delay in Serving Subpoenas Wins Scolding from Judge </p>
<p>Nu Image Inc., a Los Angeles-based film studio, received a
setback in a copyright-infringement case it filed against more
than 23,000 unnamed defendants. </p>
<p>In an order issued June 7, a federal judge in Washington
scolded the company for failing to serve not a single
subpoena in the case more than two months after the court
granted a request for the subpoenas </p>
<p>Nu Image filed the case Feb. 11, accusing the unnamed
defendants of illegally downloading copies of its film The
Expendables using the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol. </p>
<p>The film company had asked the court for permission to
serve subpoenas on Internet service providers, seeking the
identities of customers who allegedly did the unauthorized
downloading. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Robert L. Wilkins wrote that the delay
was inexcusable. If the studio was seeking information on
claims that couldn''t properly be pursued in his court, it was
inappropriate and a waste of scarce judicial resources, he
said. </p>
<p>If his court isn''t the proper venue for the case, then it
should either be dismissed or transferred to any district or
division in which it could have been brought, Wilkins said. </p>
<p>The judge ordered Nu Image to show him why his court was
the proper venue to serve all 23,433 defendants. He told the
studio it must respond to his order by June 21. </p>
<p>He noted that at a June 2 conference, counsel for Nu Image
said the subpoenas hadn''t been served because of issues the
judge raised about venue and jurisdiction. Wilkins hadn''t raised
those issued until May 25, he said. </p>
<p>Nu Image is represented by Nicholas A. Kurtz and Thomas
Mansfield Dunlap of Washington''s Dunlap, Grubb  Weaver PLLC. </p>
<p>The case is Nu Image Inc., v. Does 1-23,322, U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia (Washington). </p>

<p>U.K. Swine Breeders Win Meatpacker''s Trademark Cancellation </p>
<p>Axle Associates, a Selkirkshire, U.K.-based meat-marketing
company, lost its Bramley Old Spot Pork trademark following
an action by that country''s Intellectual Property Office, the

<p>The Gloucestershire Old Spots Pig Breeders'' Club argued for
the invalidation of the trademark, claiming the meat Axle used
for the product didn''t come from purebred swine, according to
the BBC. </p>
<p>Gloucestershire Old Spots was added to the European Union''s

<p>Pink Lady'' Growers Seek Consumer Reports of Bogus Labels </p>
<p>An association of growers of the Pink Lady variety of
apples is developing a program to encourage consumers to report
bogus stickers on apples that aren''t of that variety, according
to the produce industry publication the Packer. </p>
<p>Pink Lady apples are of the cripps pink variety
originating in Australia, and if the apple doesn''t bear a label
with the Pink Lady trademark, it doesn''t come with that
trademark protection, Alan Taylor, Pink Lady America LLC
marketing director, told the Packer. </p>
<p>The Yakima, Washington-based trade group is using the

promote the trademark and explain the quality conditions it
represented, the Packer reported. </p>

<p>(Corrects recommendation in fourth paragraph of story
published June 13.) </p>
<p>Investors should sell October
natural gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange because
a 12 percent rally in prices over the past three weeks is
unsustainable, according to Goldman Sachs Group. </p>
<p>The fuel''s discount to coal has narrowed 35 percent
compared with March and a smaller amount of substitution of coal
with natural gas may take place at current prices, Goldman''s
London-based analysts, Samantha Dart and Johan Spetz, said in a
report e-mailed today. Producers switch between gas-fired
generators and coal units depending on fuel costs. </p>
<p>Natural gas for July delivery in New York rose 0.1 percent
to $4.761 per million British thermal units at 3:45 p.m.
Singapore time. Prices are 8.1 percent higher this year and have
gained 13 percent from May 20. </p>
<p>Prices above $5 per million British thermal units will also
prompt producers to raise output, increasing U.S. supplies, the
analysts said. The bank recommended selling New York gas futures
at an initial price of $4.84 per million British thermal units. </p>
<p>Goldman also recommended purchasing fourth-quarter 2012
U.K. gas contracts, as a tightening of global LNG markets may
result in a reconnection between spot prices and oil-indexed
prices in Europe, according to the report. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX)''s Lagavulin well west
of the U.K. Shetland Islands in the Atlantic Ocean has been
plugged and abandoned after failing to find a reservoir of oil
and gas, partner Faroe Petroleum Plc (FPM) said today. </p>
<p>Faroe, which owns 10 percent of the well that Chevron
operated, fell as much as 14.6 percent in London trading, the
most in 2 1/2 years, after the announcement. The well reached a
depth of 1,567 meters (5,000 feet) on June 10 and, while it
found some hydrocarbons, no workable reservoir system was
found, Faroe said. The project also took longer and was more
expensive than expected. </p>
<p>The Lagavulin well, the deepest yet attempted on the U.K.''s
Atlantic Margin, attracted protests from Greenpeace last year
after the disaster at BP Plc''s deepwater well in the Gulf of
Mexico. Results are still being evaluated and will increase
explorers'' knowledge of the geology of the region, Faroe said. </p>
<p>Lagavulin was a true high risk frontier exploration well,
offering material upside in a success case, Faroe Chief
Executive Officer Graham Stewart said in a statement. Whilst
the outcome of the well is a disappointment, the presence of
hydrocarbons has however now been proven and offers
encouragement to continue our deepwater exploration plans in the
region. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
largest U.S. bank, ousted mortgage chief David Lowman after it
overcharged active-duty military personnel on loans and
improperly foreclosed on other borrowers. </p>
<p>Dave Lowman and I have decided he will leave the firm,
Frank Bisignano, the head of home-lending, said today in an
internal employee memo obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has been taking steps this year to repair its
mortgage unit, which posted at least $3.3 billion in losses
during the first quarter. Lowman, 54, who ran home-lending since
leaving Citigroup Inc. (C) in 2006, was directed in February to
start reporting to Chief Administrative Officer Bisignano, 51.
The New York-based bank then hired Cindy Armine, Citigroup''s
chief compliance officer, last month to increase oversight as
chief control officer of home-lending. </p>
<p>We thank Dave for his five years of service to our
firm, Bisignano said in the memo. He worked here during
extraordinary times and has said he will take some much needed
time off.  A message left at Lowman''s office wasn''t
immediately returned. </p>
<p>U.S. banks are dealing with the backlash from a bust in
housing as mortgage losses and related litigation suppress
earnings. Home prices in 20 U.S. cities fell 5.1 percent in the
first quarter, the largest decline since the first quarter of
2009, according to the SP/Case-Shiller index. </p>

<p>The record discount of West Texas
Intermediate crude to North Sea Brent is widening because of
flows of light, sweet crude to Europe and Asia instead of the
U.S. Gulf Coast, Goldman Sachs said in a note. </p>
<p>The growing price gap has been primarily driven by the
weakening of U.S. Gulf Coast light-sweet crude oil prices
relative to Brent crude, not a Cushing bottleneck, Goldman
analysts including David Greely said today, referring to the
delivery point for the WTI contract in Cushing, Oklahoma. </p>
<p>The arbitrage between the U.S. Gulf Coast and Europe has
flipped, and the market is now directing light-sweet crude oil
away from the U.S. Gulf Coast and toward Europe and Asia,
Goldman said. That caused Brent''s premium to widen in June and
reach a record close of $21.80 a barrel yesterday, the bank
said. </p>
<p>Downside risk for the WTI-Brent spread is limited in
the near term, Goldman said. The analysts expect the difference
to narrow and said they would not make a trading recommendation
on it because the risk associated with the fundamental
uncertainty is too high. </p>
<p>The reversal of the arbitrage was caused by lower prices
for Louisiana Light Sweet grade relative to Brent crude, which
makes it more attractive for traders to ship top-quality oils to
Europe and Asia than the U.S. </p>
<p>WTI crude moved into discount versus North Sea Brent in
August amid a glut of stockpiles at Cushing. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) accused
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) of harassment by making a
baseless demand for documents as part of an investigation
the failed investment bank is conducting. </p>
<p>Lehman''s effort to force Goldman Sachs to hand over
documents related to a probe of events leading up to its
collapse in September 2008 is improper, Goldman Sachs said in a
court filing yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>Lehman''s move to obtain a court order is designed purely
to harass Goldman Sachs and should be denied as baseless,
unnecessary and unwarranted, Goldman Sachs said. </p>
<p>Lehman has said it is investigating third parties that may
have taken actions before its bankruptcy that interfered with
and damaged its business, according to court papers. In a
request to Goldman Sachs, Lehman sought information related to
alleged false rumors and the short-selling of Lehman
securities, Goldman Sachs said in its filing. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is deliberately moving at glacial pace in
handing over information, Lehman said. Lehman wants U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James Peck to order Goldman Sachs to produce
documents it seeks within two weeks of approving the request. </p>
<p>Slightest Bit'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, based in New York, has already provided
documents, previously given to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the U.S. Attorney''s Office, that don''t support
allegations that Goldman Sachs was spreading rumors about
Lehman, it said. Lehman also hasn''t provided the slightest bit
of evidence that Goldman Sachs was involved in any improper
activity affecting Lehman, Goldman Sachs said in its filing. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs made diligent progress in preparing to
respond to Lehman''s request for additional documents, and the
timeline Lehman has proposed is burdensome, the company said. It
has proposed producing documents by July 22. </p>
<p>Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,

Indian stocks. He spoke at a press conference in Mumbai today. </p>
<p>In next 3 to 5 years, we expect India to be able to
generate 20 plus percent earnings-per-share growth. We had a
modest downgrading of our medium-term, earnings-per-share
forecast. The downgrade was modest as compared to the rest of
Asia and certainly the rest of the world. </p>
<p>We still retain infrastructure beneficiaries, industrials
and cement stocks in our portfolio. Themes we have been playing
in last five years include power equipment, cement, consumption,
and bank stocks. </p>
<p>We see stalling of infrastructure building a short-term
phenomenon. Infrastructure is still the most important growth
driver in India over the next 5 to 10 years. We are bullish on
coal. </p>
<p>We''d like to see inflation starting to abate. We are
seeing evidence inflation starting to tail off in India. We''d
like to see wage price inflation moderating in India and China. </p>
<p>China is better than India on valuation perspective. We
are overweight on China as it got cheap. Twelve months back,
everybody was worried consumer price index will creep to 5
percent to 6 percent. But government stimulus packages and
administrative mechanism controlled CPI and growth started to
moderate. Investors are now talking about a hard landing in
China. Investors never seem to be satisfied with China''s GDP
growth.'''' </p>

<p>Hans Redeker, who was hired as
Morgan Stanley (MS)''s head of foreign-exchange strategy in March,
said he plans to revise the bank''s euro forecast substantially
lower on weak demand for European bonds and equities. </p>
<p>Net flows into the longer-term bond segment are near
historical lows and at odds with the current value of the euro
amid the Greek debt crisis, Redeker wrote in a research report
dated yesterday. European equity markets have lost ground. The
relative underperformance compared to the U.S. market indicates
that long-term capital flows should remain euro-negative. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s current estimates for the euro are that
the 17-nation currency will rise to $1.52 by the end of the
third quarter, then trade at $1.49 and $1.47 at the end of the
fourth quarter and the first quarter next year respectively.
We will take these numbers substantially lower, Redeker said
in an e-mailed response to questions today. </p>
<p>The euro was 0.3 percent stronger at $1.4452 as of 8:50
a.m. in London. </p>
<p>While short-term yield differentials correlate best with
euro-dollar, we regard it as a mistake to ignore messages sent
out by other market segments, he wrote in the report. Should
nervous euro money-market investors turn around, the euro will
fall. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said on March 31 that it hired Redeker from
BNP Paribas SA as managing director and global head of foreign-
exchange strategy. The bank also hired Ian Stannard from BNP
Paribas as head of European foreign-exchange strategy. Both will
be based in London. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s Xbox 360 was the
top-selling video-game console in the U.S. last month, bucking a
software-led decline that saw industry sales slump to their
lowest since October 2006. </p>
<p>Xbox 360 sales increased 39 percent to 270,000 units from a
year earlier, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said yesterday
in an e-mailed statement, citing industry tracker NPD Group Inc.
Sony Corp. (6758), maker of the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable,
said its hardware sales rose 14 percent. </p>
<p>Microsoft sold more Xbox 360 consoles than any other
platform 11 of the past 12 months in the U.S, according to NPD
data. Xbox 360 is likely to be number one worldwide by the end
of this year with the biggest blockbuster games, Kinect games
and experiences, NPD said. </p>
<p>Industrywide, a light slate of new game software and
Nintendo Co.''s aging Wii console contributed to a 14 percent
decline in overall retail sales to $743.1 million in May, Port
Washington, New York-based NPD said in an e-mailed statement.
The figure doesn''t include digital sales of games. </p>
<p>Overall, the Xbox 360 platform has contributed 34 percent
of year-to-date revenues across hardware, content and
accessories, said Anita Frazier, an analyst with NPD. The
platform has gained 7 percentage points of market share, she
said. </p>
<p>Industry hardware sales dropped 5 percent to $228.9
million, and software declined 19 percent to $375.8 million, NPD
reported. </p>
<p>Sony''s PS3 and PSP both showed unit-sales growth, NPD
reported, without citing exact figures. </p>
<p>Sony, based in Tokyo, suffered an almost monthlong outage
to its PlayStation Network and Qriocity online services
following a hacker attack in April. More than 100 million
accounts were illegally accessed, resulting in the second-
largest data breach in U.S. history. </p>
<p>Sales of Nintendo''s 3DS handheld, which lets users play 3-D
games without the need for special glasses, remained light,
Frazier said. Games featuring Nintendo characters such as Zelda
should help increase sales of the hardware in coming months, she
said. </p>

account last month to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) from Bank America
Corp., where she has been a customer for more than 35 years. </p>
<p>Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan''s chief executive officer, had people
like Smedley in mind when he announced plans in February to open
as many as 2,000 branches, more than half of them in Florida and
California, expanding the New York-based bank''s network by
almost 40 percent. He''s targeting states dominated by Bank of
America, the biggest U.S. bank by deposits, and Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC), which has the largest branch network. </p>
<p>The strategy runs counter to Bank of America''s plan to
close 10 percent of its offices as analysts question whether the
industry needs a bank on every corner. Doubts about the expense
of branches have arisen as customers cut back on borrowing and
mobile and online banking take hold. </p>
<p>Two thousand is a mind-bending number, even for a bank
the size of JPMorgan Chase, said Bob Meara, a senior analyst
with Boston-based consulting firm Celent. Branch building on a
large scale seems tough to justify. </p>
<p>Dimon, 55, is hoping to lure more customers like Smedley,
who said she was fed up with extra costs, as local and national
competitors retreat. </p>
<p>More Fees'' </p>
<p>The service at Bank of America was okay, but they just
kept adding more and more fees, Smedley, 74, said in an
interview outside the sleek, gray JPMorgan branch that opened
last July on Town Center Boulevard. </p>
<p>It''s one of 18 JPMorgan outlets in Orlando and a five-
minute walk from where Smedley used to bank. The $150 JPMorgan
offered to put in her account helped seal the deal, she said. </p>
<p>Dimon''s plan is based on the theory that having more
branches enables the bank to attract deposits, which provide a
cheap source of funding in a post-crisis era, as well as to sell
investment products to customers and offer banking services to
businesses, analysts said. The strategy could add $2 billion a
year in profit, according to company calculations. </p>
<p>It also allows JPMorgan to expand its brand in markets such
as Florida and California where it gained a foothold by buying
Washington Mutual Inc., said Ryan McInerney, CEO of the firm''s
consumer bank and a member of its executive committee. </p>
<p>We don''t have nearly the density or branch presence we
think we need to serve our current customers or acquire new
customers in those markets, McInerney said in an interview.
We view it as a very big opportunity. </p>
<p>California, Florida </p>
<p>Analysts said the opportunity may be overstated. Banks with
large branch networks like JPMorgan may gain little benefit from
deposits since they have few options for the funds amid a
decline in borrowing and historically low yields on fixed-income
securities, they said. </p>
<p>I would love to know what advantage they see in their
retail-banking model, said Nancy Bush, a contributing editor
at SNL Financial, a bank-research firm in Charlottesville,
Virginia. It''s good, but is it wildly superior? </p>
<p>With consumers trying to pay off debt and avoid new loans,
the macro trend would be for the entire financial sector to
contract, and that means fewer branches, not more, Bush said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s five-year strategy calls for 525 to 700 new
outlets in California, 375 to 500 in Florida, and an additional
800 elsewhere, according to an investor presentation. California
and Florida are among the top five U.S. states by deposits. </p>
<p>The bank had 5,268 retail branches at the end of 2010,
making it the third-largest network in the U.S. behind San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo with 6,314 and Bank of America with
5,856, according to year-end filings. </p>
<p>BofA Closings </p>
<p>Bank of America is closing unprofitable branches, Joseph Price, head of the lender''s consumer and card-banking business,
said at a conference for investors in March. The Charlotte,
North Carolina-based company shut 200 branches in the last five
quarters through March, CEO Brian T. Moynihan said in April. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo, still digesting its 2008 purchase of Wachovia
Corp., has chosen to add resources rather than hundreds of new
outlets. The bank, which opened 47 branches last year, placed
about 5,000 more bankers into former Wachovia offices, CEO John Stumpf said June 3. Forty-six percent of U.S. households are
within two miles of a Wells Fargo branch or automated-teller
machine, according to Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for the bank. </p>
<p>We continuously adjust our store network, and as a result
we add stores in some markets and reduce them in others to make
sure we have the right number to help us serve our customers,
Eshet said. </p>
<p>Dimon Turnaround </p>
<p>Bank of America already has a fully developed branch
network in Florida and California, said Walter Elcock, the
executive responsible for branches. The bank has plans to add
bankers to about 1,500 branches to sell more investment,
mortgage and small-business products, he said. </p>
<p>Our strategy is much more focused on strengthening
relationships with existing customers, Elcock said. It''s not
about customer acquisition. </p>
<p>Dimon may have the advantage and experience to make his
plan work, said Jason Goldberg, senior analyst at Barclays
Capital Inc. in New York. </p>
<p>From 2000 to 2004, Dimon was CEO of Bank One Corp., where
he staged a turnaround that included opening more branches and
overhauling compensation. He required branches to stay open
longer after realizing competitors were closing an average of
two hours later, according to Last Man Standing: The Ascent of
Jamie Dimon and JPMorgan Chase, by Duff McDonald. Results at
the Chicago-based lender swung from a $511 million loss in 2000
to a $3.5 billion profit by 2003. </p>
<p>WaMu Branches </p>
<p>When JPMorgan merged with Bank One in 2004 and Dimon was
named president and chief operating officer, he shuttered
lagging businesses and started monthly management reviews in
local branches. The bank, now the largest in the U.S. by market
valuation, was one of the few to navigate the credit crisis
without a quarterly loss. </p>
<p>That period included the September 2008 purchase of
Seattle-based Washington Mutual, the largest bank to fail in
U.S. history. JPMorgan bought the thrift for $1.9 billion,
acquiring 2,200 branches in 12 states. Three hundred were closed
in the first six months and another 100 by the end of the first
year in markets where the two banks overlapped, according to a
person familiar with the consolidation. </p>
<p>Dimon estimated at an investor conference June 2 that on
average each branch makes about $1 million a year in profit,
meaning that the new outlets may contribute $2 billion to annual
profit once they''ve been open for several years. </p>
<p>Absence of Profit </p>
<p>Over the last nine years, JPMorgan has opened 1,000
branches and expects them to contribute $1 billion by 2018,
according to a February presentation from Charles Scharf, head
of the retail business. </p>
<p>In the early years, opening and operating expenses outrun
costs, with the 117 branches that opened in 2009 reducing 2010
pretax earnings by an average of $600,000 an outlet, or $70
million, Scharf said. </p>
<p>It cost between $2 billion and $3 billion to build the
1,000 branches, Deutsche Bank AG''s Matt O''Connor estimated in a
May 19 report, and JPMorgan added 6,200 salespeople between 2006
and 2010, according to Scharf''s presentation. </p>
<p>The new branches aren''t going to contribute a lot to
profit over the next several years, Scharf said in February. </p>
<p>Last year, JPMorgan''s retail division reported $31.8
billion in revenue, 30 percent of the bank''s total, and $2.53
billion in profit, or 15 percent of the total, according to the
year-end filing. That compares with revenue of $14.8 billion and
net income of $3.43 billion in 2005, or 27 percent and 40
percent, respectively. </p>
<p>Strip Malls </p>
<p>Branches typically need about $40 million of deposits to be
profitable, Paul Miller, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets in
Arlington, Virginia, said in an interview. About 15 percent of
bank branches in the U.S. hold less than $15 million in
deposits, said Brian Foran, an analyst with Nomura Securities
International Inc. in New York. </p>
<p>Nationwide, JPMorgan ranks second in deposits with $996
billion, behind Bank of America''s $1.02 trillion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan ranks fourth in California,
with $61 billion in deposits, and sixth in Florida, with $10.5
billion. It lags behind Bank of America, which has $222 billion
in California and $74.8 billion in Florida, and Wells Fargo,
which has $162.1 billion in California and $66.6 billion in
Florida. JPMorgan holds the top spot in New York and Texas. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s new branches may bring an added $90 billion in
deposits, Miller wrote in a Feb. 16 report. To do so, they''ll
have to draw customers from competitors with well-placed
branches, attractive promotions and good customer service,
analysts said. New outlets must be located in high-traffic
areas, not hidden in strip malls, as many of WaMu''s branches
were, Miller said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Soaking Up Deposits </p>
<p>Dimon''s wager is that JPMorgan can soak up deposits from
shuttered community banks or beat-up regional lenders forced to
trim their footprint, Nomura''s Foran said. </p>
<p>SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) and Regions Financial Corp. (RF), the third-
and fourth-biggest banks by deposits in Florida, are pulling
back, and Bank of America may close branches in the state, he
said. On top of that, 34 banks failed in Florida since the end
of 2009, and 15 have been shut by regulators in California as of
May 6, leaving a void for JPMorgan to fill. </p>
<p>They see blood in the water, Foran said. </p>
<p>The largest banks aren''t the only ones targeting those
states. Competitors include BankUnited Inc., the Miami Lakes,
Florida-based lender brought back from collapse in 2009 by John Kanas, and OneWest Bank, the successor to IndyMac Bancorp after
the California-based lender failed in 2008. </p>
<p>Michael McCoy, a spokesman for Atlanta-based SunTrust, said
his bank has 500 branches in Florida and is very committed
to the market. Tim Deighton, a spokesman for Birmingham,
Alabama-based Regions, which has about 400 branches in Florida,
said the state remains a core market for us. </p>
<p>Online and Mobile </p>
<p>Some customers are shunning branches. A 2010 survey by the
Washington-based American Bankers Association found that 36
percent of respondents preferred banking online compared with 25
percent who said they would rather bank in person. Even so, a
March 2011 research paper by Elif Nilay Yilmaz, a doctoral
candidate at Boston University, used Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. data to show that a 1 percent increase in the number of
branches raised a bank''s market share by 0.72 percent. </p>
<p>The banks have figured out they need to be able to
deliver their products through multiple channels, and branches
are one of those that will be here to stay, said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst with RBC Capital Markets in Portland,
Maine. Banking has yet to find the killer app to make
branching obsolete. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will pay a $2
million fine to the Comptroller of the Currency and $25 million
to reimburse customers after using high pressure tactics to
sell credit insurance on car loans. </p>
<p>The bank''s customer-service representatives deceived
borrowers about costs and terms of credit protection offered to
cover missed payments in 2008 and 2009, the OCC said in a
settlement document released today. </p>
<p>Chase Auto used written scripts together with oral high-
pressure sales tactics that included statements which were
materially false, deceptive or otherwise misleading in violation
of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the regulator said in a
statement. </p>
<p>JPMorgan didn''t admit or deny wrongdoing. In consultation
with the OCC, the firm developed a plan to reimburse customers
and fix deficiencies in credit protection linked to Chase auto,
home and credit-card loans, the OCC said. Chase advertised the
car-loan product, known as the Chase Payment Assurance plan, as
a way to cancel some or all monthly payments in case of
accidental death, disability, involuntary unemployment or a
leave of absence. </p>
<p>We have reimbursed affected customers and have revised
our sales scripts and marketing materials for our payment
protection products, Patrick Linehan, a JPMorgan spokesman,
said in an e-mailed statement. We''ve implemented enhanced and
more extensive controls to ensure that we are treating our
customers fairly. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon reassigned retail bank
CEO Charles Scharf''s duties and removed Scharf from the firm''s
15-person operating committee in a shakeup of top management
yesterday. Scharf''s responsibilities for overseeing auto and
student lending were given to card services CEO Gordon Smith. </p>
<p>The bank will take appropriate remedial actions to fully
address and correct the violations of the law, according to
the OCC. </p>

Moore" date="Jun 15, 2011  2:14 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-15/jpmorgan-s-zubrow-will-tell-congress-bank-rules-risk-hobbling-recovery.html"><headline>JPMorgan''s Zubrow Will Tell Congress Bank Rules Risk Hobbling'' Recovery</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Risk
Officer Barry Zubrow will tell Congress that regulators risk
impeding the economic recovery by going too far in tightening
bank rules and raising capital requirements. </p>
<p>The regulatory pendulum clearly has now begun to swing to
a point that risks hobbling our financial system and our
economic growth, Zubrow said in testimony prepared for
delivery tomorrow to the House Financial Services Committee. </p>
<p>A capital surcharge on the largest global banks combined
with higher U.S. margin requirements for certain trading
accounts currently risks doing more harm than good, Zubrow
said. It also puts U.S. firms at a distinct and unnecessary
competitive disadvantage, he said. </p>
<p>The remarks echo concerns expressed by JPMorgan Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon earlier this month, when he asked
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke whether he''s concerned
that overzealous regulation will stymie an economic rebound. </p>
<p>Zubrow is scheduled to testify along with Stephen O''Connor,
a managing director at New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS), and
regulators including Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman
Sheila Bair and Fed board member Daniel Tarullo. </p>
<p>Zubrow also said he opposes proposed rules that require
companies to post extra margin against certain derivatives
contracts, which are used to hedge interest-rate, currency and
other risks. The rules restrict the types of collateral that may
be posted to U.S. cash, Treasuries or agency securities. They
also would require U.S. banks to demand collateral from foreign
clients while European competitors don''t, he said. </p>
<p>Too Late'' </p>
<p>In addition, we are not permitted to accept margin in the
form of, for example, Euro Cash and G7 Sovereign Debt, Zubrow
said. This effect will be to kill our overseas swaps
activities; even if Europe and other regulators were to
subsequently adopt similar rules, it would be too late. </p>
<p>O''Connor, chairman of the International Swaps  Derivatives
Association, also will tell Congress tomorrow that policy and
timing disparities between U.S. and international derivatives
rules will disadvantage the nation''s financial markets. </p>
<p>The differences will hurt the U.S. by driving up costs
and reducing liquidity, O''Connor said in prepared remarks.
They do so without demonstrating any clear benefit to equal or
outweigh the considerable costs. </p>
<p>Race to the Bottom'' </p>
<p>Michael Gibson, senior associate director of the Federal
Reserve, told the Senate Agriculture Committee today that global
regulators should harmonize rules on derivatives to prevent
financial risks from migrating to the least-supervised
economies. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said earlier
this month that he favored having global authorities agree on a
minimum level of regulation to avoid a race to the bottom
among countries. </p>
<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, required by
the Dodd-Frank Act to write new regulations for the $601
trillion over-the-counter swaps market, may enter agreements
with foreign officials to recognize comparable rules, Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, told the Agriculture Committee today. </p>
<p>Dimon, who''s also chairman of New York-based JPMorgan,
questioned Bernanke at a June 7 conference of bankers in Atlanta
on whether regulators have gone too far in reining in the
banking system and are slowing economic growth. The U.S.
unemployment rate rose to 9.1 percent in May as the SP/Case-
Shiller index of property values in 20 cities showed that home
prices slumped in March to their lowest since 2003. </p>
<p>I have a great fear someone''s going to try to write a
book in 20 years, and the book is going to talk about all the
things that we did in the middle of the crisis to actually slow
down recovery, Dimon, 55, told the Fed chairman. </p>
<p>Proposed global capital standards would impose a 3 percent
surcharge on top of a 7 percent minimum requirement on the
largest systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs.
The rules are being drafted by a group of bank regulators who
are scheduled to decide on a preliminary plan this month and
present a final proposal to the G-20 group of nations in July. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s biggest
software maker, said corporate customers adopted the Office 2010
product five times faster than the previous version. </p>
<p>Sales to businesses outpaced those of Office 2007 through
the first nine months of product availability, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said today. The 2010 software suite
is the fastest selling update among regular consumers, and
almost 50 million of them are using the Web-based versions of
Office programs Microsoft released to combat Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Apps. </p>
<p>The company is announcing the numbers in a blog on the one-
year anniversary of the product''s release, Takeshi Numoto, an
Office vice president, said in an interview. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Business Division unit, mostly sales from
Office, has been exceeding analysts'' estimates, helping revenue
growth as the Windows operating-system business loses some
consumers to Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad. Mountain View, California-based
Google has been trying to steal corporate and government
customers from Office with online word-processing and
spreadsheet software. </p>
<p>The Office business is the one business people feel
pretty good about, said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at
Pacific Crest Securities Inc. in Portland, Oregon, who rates the
shares sector perform. It''s not really coming under the
same kind of attacks as Windows and mobile software. </p>
<p>Google Apps has been out for several years and there hasn''t
been mass defections, he said in an interview. </p>
<p>Cloud Computing </p>
<p>Deployments of Office 2010 are also beating those of Office
2003 by a pretty significant margin, Numoto said. Nine of 10
customers in a Microsoft satisfaction survey said 2010 was the
best Office release ever, he said. </p>
<p>Sales in the business division, the company''s biggest, rose
to $5.27 billion last quarter, exceeding the $4.9 billion
average of analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The Office business is being challenged by the growing
popularity of so-called cloud software delivered over the
Internet, which is allowing companies to choose from more
options, Barnicle said. Delivering software as a service over
the Internet may squeeze Microsoft''s profit margins, he said. </p>

<p>A lawyer for Goldman Sachs announced the settlement today

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) drilled 84 wells to a
depth of two miles beneath the Indonesian rainforest to tap
steam, not oil and gas, that''s trapped in the world''s richest
store of volcanic energy. </p>
<p>The oil driller''s geothermal plant, set among wild orchids
and bamboo trees, uses 315 degree Celsius (600 degree
Fahrenheit) heat to spin turbines 24 hours a day, generating
electricity for Jakarta, a four-hour drive to the north.
Chevron, which pioneered geothermal energy 20 years ago in
Southeast Asia''s biggest economy, is about to see competition. </p>
<p>Companies from General Electric Co. (GE) to India''s Tata Corp.
are leading an investment boom in Indonesia that may climb to
more than $30 billion, anticipating President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono will honor his promise in February to boost clean-
energy subsidies. The pledge has spurred the biggest geothermal
spending spree in Asia and the largest outside of the U.S. </p>
<p>There''s great momentum in Indonesia''s geothermal market,
and demand for power is there, Mark Taylor, a geothermal
analyst in Washington at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said in
an interview. But there are regulatory risks for developers. </p>
<p>Chevron was burned by Indonesia in the late 1990s, when the
state-owned utility forced it to renegotiate a power-purchase
accord. The San Ramon, California-based oil company is now
planning to expand its geothermal operations, helping Yudhoyono
eliminate energy shortages that threaten his target for as much
as 6.6 percent economic growth through his term''s end in 2014. </p>
<p>Geothermal Superpower'' </p>
<p>Geothermal is central to Indonesia''s push for alternatives
to fossil fuels such as oil, which the country once exported and
now must import, driving up costs and curbing growth. Brownouts
are frequent on the main island of Java, and 35 percent of the
nation''s 245-million population doesn''t have access to
electricity, the International Energy Agency has said. </p>
<p>The nation, described by clean-energy investor Al Gore in
January as the first potential geothermal superpower, plans
9.5 gigawatts of capacity by 2025. That''s more than triple the
U.S.''s geothermal use and about 33 percent of Indonesia''s
electricity demand, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. </p>
<p>Indonesia''s 17,000 islands straddle the Pacific Ocean''s
volcanic ring of fire, making the country to geothermal
power what the Middle East is to oil -- the world''s largest
potential resource with 40 percent, or about 28 gigawatts, of
the total. </p>
<p>4% of Potential </p>
<p>Geothermal currently provides about 0.3 percent of global
electricity and 0.2 percent of energy for heat, and with better
policy incentives those levels could climb to 3.5 percent and
3.9 percent, respectively, the Paris-based International Energy
Agency said yesterday. </p>
<p>Indonesia has tapped about 4 percent of its potential and
has orders for 2.3 gigawatts of plants, second only to the U.S.,
New Energy Finance data show. A gigawatt, about equal to the
output of a new atomic reactor, needs $2 billion to $4 billion
of investment, Taylor said. In comparison, Iceland, also a
volcanic island, got 27 percent of the country''s electricity
from geothermal, according to government figures. </p>
<p>There''s a remarkable opportunity for Indonesia to
increase the amount of power generated from geothermal, said
Stephen Green, former head of Chevron''s Indonesia and
Philippines operations and now its vice president of policy,
government and public affairs. There are synergies between oil
and geothermal and it makes sense for us to exploit that, he
said in an interview Chevron''s Jakarta office. </p>
<p>Indonesia hasn''t always appealed to foreign investors, and
skepticism still goes beyond questions of how to uncork the
boiling water that''s trapped miles below the surface. </p>
<p>Obama''s Stepfather </p>
<p>After the Asian financial crisis, state-owned utility PT
Perusahaan Listrik Negara canceled power purchase agreements
with companies including PT Paiton Energy, 40 percent owned by
Irvine, California-based Edison Mission Energy, because it
couldn''t afford the contracts after the collapse of the rupiah. </p>
<p>Unocal Inc., which built the plant in the rainforest and
was acquired by Chevron in 2005, was forced to renegotiate a
deal to sell its power at 4 to 5 U.S. cents a kilowatt-hour
instead of 6 cents to 7 cents. Unocal negotiated Indonesia''s
first foreign-partnership geothermal license in 1982 with the
help of U.S. President Barack Obama''s late stepfather, Lolo
Soetoro, who worked for Unocal as a government liaison. </p>
<p>The rainforest plant was opened in Mount Halimum Salak
National Park in 1992. Together with another about 100 miles
west in Dajarat, Chevron lights homes for 4 million people. To
capitalize on the new tariffs for geothermal electricity, the
company is planning new plants including a potential 200-
megawatt facility in South Sumatra. </p>
<p>Investment Interest </p>
<p>Geothermal investors are again starting to look at
Indonesia as a place where they can do business, Ravi
Krishnaswamy, a Singapore-based director for energy consultancy
Frost  Sullivan, said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Indonesia began consuming more oil than its domestic
production capacity in 2004 as economic growth surged. It
suspended membership in the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries, or OPEC, in 2008. </p>
<p>Higher oil prices give the government more incentive to
promote geothermal power, Chevron''s Green said. </p>
<p>The generators use wells to tap underground deposits of
scalding water. At Salak, hot water and steam are pumped from as
deep as 3,211 meters (10,535 feet) below the surface through 54
kilometers (34 miles) of pipes to turn turbines to make power.
Each well takes as much as 90 days to drill and costs up to $7
million, Chevron says. </p>
<p>Oil Dependence </p>
<p>There''s no shortage of foreign interest. Sumitomo Corp. (8053),
Japan''s third-biggest trading company, is building a 110-
megawatt plant in nearby Ulubelu. Australia''s Origin Energy Ltd.
is partnering with power company Tata in northern Sumatra. </p>
<p>It''s good for the environment and good for reducing our
dependence on oil, Widhyawan Prawiraatmadja, General Electric
Co.''s Indonesia company executive, said in a phone interview
from Jakarta. It also frees up tradable resources such as oil
and gas and coal to be exported. </p>
<p>Yet geothermal deals in Indonesia remain very
difficult, according to BNEF. The government''s decision to
raise the price that state-owned utility PLN pays for geothermal
power to up to 9.7 cents per kilowatt-hour may backfire, Vandana Gombar, a geothermal analyst at BNEF, wrote in a February
report. </p>
<p>The utility usually opts for cheaper coal power that
enables it to sell electricity to consumers at the government-
mandated 6-7 cents per kilowatt-hour. The policy hinges on
whether the government will continue to subsidize PLN at the
higher prices because the increase can''t yet be passed on to

<p>The government''s plan is a pipe dream until it''s
prepared to force consumers to pay more for their electricity,
Ari Soemarno, former president of Indonesia''s state-owned oil
company PT Pertamina, said in an interview. The government can''t
afford to keep subsidizing power yet isn''t brave enough to force
consumers to buy at cost, he said. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s smoking cessation aid
Chantix, already carrying a warning it raises risks of suicide,
may be tied to higher heart danger in patients with
cardiovascular disease, U.S. regulators said. </p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration found infrequent chest
pain, heart attacks and other adverse reactions in a study of
700 people with cardiovascular disease, the agency said today in
a statement. The information will be added to the warnings and
precautions section of the prescribing information for Chantix. </p>
<p>The FDA is requiring New York-based Pfizer, the world''s
biggest drugmaker, to further evaluate the heart risks with an
analysis of existing studies. Chantix, approved in 2006,
generated $755 million in sales last year. The revenue has
fallen since the FDA warned in 2009 that the medicine may
increase the chance of suicide or erratic behavior. </p>
<p>The known benefits of Chantix should be weighed against
its potential risks when deciding to use the drug in smokers
with cardiovascular disease, the FDA said in its statement. </p>
<p>The overall cardiovascular event rates reported in the
study were low, Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The company plans to discuss the analysis of existing
studies and the product labeling with FDA. </p>
<p>Pfizer rose 5 cents to $20.24 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>Chantix affects dopamine, a chemical in the brain involved
in controlling mood and behavior. Because dopamine triggers a
positive mood response, regulating its levels can remove some of
the pleasure derived from smoking. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, added Debora L. Spar, president of
the women-only liberal arts school Barnard College, to its board
at a meeting today in London. </p>
<p>Spar, who turned 48 today, will sit on the audit, risk,
compensation and corporate governance and nominating committees,
New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a statement. She joined New
York''s Barnard College in July 2008 after 17 years on the
faculty of Harvard Business School. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which was the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history before the 2008 financial collapse,
has been a target of regulatory and political investigations
since then. The firm paid $550 million last year to settle a
civil fraud suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission and
has denied claims by a U.S. Senate subcommittee this year that
the firm misled clients into buying mortgage-linked securities. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein''s
wife, Laura, is a Barnard College alumna and is listed on the
school''s website as a member of the board of trustees. She has
resigned that post, Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, said today. The Lloyd  Laura Blankfein Foundation
donated $50,000 to Barnard College in fiscal 2010, which ended
Jan. 31, 2010, and $25,000 in the previous year, according to
the nonprofit''s federal tax filings. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, will open a physical commodities
sales and trading office in Houston, according to a person
familiar with the plans. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs expects to hire about a dozen sales and
trading professionals for the office by the end of the year,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the
information isn''t public. Some of the new hires for the office
will come from outside the firm and some will relocate from New
York and London. </p>
<p>Trey Griggs, who is currently a managing director in energy
sales in New York, will relocate to Houston to be the head of
commodities for the office, the person said. Ben Freeman, a
trader based in London, will relocate to lead commodities
trading in Houston. </p>
<p>The New York-based company wants to establish a local
trading and sales presence for clients in Houston, according to
the person. Physical commodities trading will include crude,
refined products, natural gas liquids and coal, the person said.
The office is expected to open this summer. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs doesn''t disclose how much money it makes from
commodities trading. The business is folded into a larger unit
known as fixed-income, currencies and commodities, or FICC, that
is Goldman Sachs''s largest by revenue, accounting for 35 percent
of the firm''s revenue in 2010. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) are the top firms
among traders of over-the-counter commodity derivatives,
according to a recent report by Greenwich Associates. </p>
<p>The bank''s plan to open a Houston office was reported
earlier on the SparkSpread website. </p>

<p>Pablo J. Salame, one of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s four sales and trading chiefs, plans to move
to New York from London this summer and may take a new
assignment, according to three people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Salame, a 45-year-old Ecuadorian, joined Goldman Sachs in
1996 and has worked in London since 2002. A Goldman Sachs
partner since 2000, Salame was co-manager of global credit,
mortgages, emerging markets trading and equity derivatives
before he became co-head of the securities unit in 2008 with
David B. Heller, Edward K. Eisler and Harvey M. Schwartz. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s securities division, which includes sales
and trading of equities, fixed-income, currencies and
commodities, is the New York-based firm''s biggest and most
profitable unit. It produced 56 percent of the company''s revenue
in 2010 and both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, and his top deputy, President and Chief Operating
Officer Gary D. Cohn, 50, helped lead securities trading before
rising to their current roles. </p>
<p>While Salame may keep his position as a co-head of the
securities unit, he''s also considering new roles, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the negotiations
aren''t public. Salame''s move to New York would put three of the
four global heads of securities trading in the city, with
Eisler, 41, remaining in London. </p>
<p>Salame started his career at Goldman Sachs, the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, in emerging markets currency
trading and later helped lead the global emerging debt markets
group. The experience in developing markets may lead him to work
more closely with J. Michael Evans, 53, who was named global
head of growth markets in January, two of the three people said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, like many rivals, is aiming to do more
business in fast-growing economies like Brazil, Russia, India
and China. Cohn told investors earlier this month that China,
India and Brazil are three places where Goldman Sachs is doing
the most hiring. </p>
<p>Salame didn''t return a call seeking comment and Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, said Salame
wouldn''t comment. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s second-
quarter profit estimate was reduced 40 percent by an analyst at
Atlantic Equities LLP, who said the firm''s trading and investing
revenue is declining, making job cuts more likely. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs will likely earn $2.17 per share, down from a
previous estimate of $3.49, Richard Staite wrote today in a note
to investors. Staite expects trading revenue to tumble to $4.9
billion, a 27 percent decrease from the first quarter, and
investing and lending gains to narrow to $200 million from $2.7
billion, he wrote. </p>
<p>About half the cut is due to weaker trading revenues
while the other half is driven by lower investment gains,
wrote Staite, who has a neutral recommendation on Goldman
Sachs stock. Given the weak environment we expect jobs to be
cut across the industry. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
dropped 19 percent in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
so far this year on concern about weaker revenue and increased
regulation. Staite''s estimate for Goldman Sachs''s second-quarter
earnings per share puts the London-based analyst below the $3.56
average forecast of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs earned $4.38 per share in the first quarter
of this year and $0.78 per share in the second quarter of 2010.
Staite wrote that he expects the New York-based firm''s second-
quarter return on tangible equity, or ROTE, will be 8 percent,
while the full-year ROTE will be 13 percent. </p>
<p>Staite said he expects Goldman Sachs''s fixed-income,
currencies and commodities trading revenue to drop 33 percent
from the first quarter to $2.9 billion in the second quarter,
while equity trading revenue may fall 15 percent to $2 billion. </p>
<p>Investment-banking revenue, which includes fees from merger
advice and underwriting, will probably rise to $1.3 billion, or
4 percent, from the first quarter, he wrote. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is advising
clients to avoid delaying investment decisions for Russia until
it becomes clear who will be the next president in elections in
March. </p>
<p>There''s not a lot of wisdom to wait, said Christopher Barter, co-chief executive officer for Goldman''s Russia unit, at
a conference in St. Petersburg today. Our advice to clients
who think there could be a dramatic change is not to wait. The
opportunities are enormous and valuations are very attractive. </p>
<p>President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
have yet to announce whether either will run for the presidency
next year and political uncertainty before parliamentary
elections in December and the 2012 vote are spurring capital
flight from Russia, German Gref, chief executive officer at OAO
Sberbank, the nation''s largest lender, said April 15. Russia''s
central bank posted $30 billion of outflows in the first four
months of the year, near the $35.3 billion for all of 2010. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
jumped to fourth place in handling equity sales for Russian
companies last year, its highest position ever, behind VTB
Capital and Renaissance Capital, both based in Moscow, and
Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>The old perception of Goldman Sachs in Russia is that we
haven''t been consistent in our efforts in this country, Barter
said in an interview in Moscow May 12. This is not the reality
today. </p>
<p>Sberbank, Yandex </p>
<p>Goldman was one of the four banks chosen by the central
bank June 14 to manage a sale of part of its stake in Sberbank,
a transaction that may be worth as much as $7 billion. It also
helped sell 300 million pounds ($487 million) of sterling-
denominated bonds issued by OAO Russian Railways June 15 and
assisted with Russian search engine owner Yandex NV''s $1.3
billion initial public offering in May. </p>
<p>Last year was the biggest for Russian mergers and
acquisitions since 2007, helped by 96 deals worth $50.9 billion
in the fourth quarter alone, Bloomberg data show. Russia has
seen deals worth $36 billion in the first half, up from $26
billion for the same period a year earlier. </p>
<p>A large part of why these banks are coming to St.
Petersburg is because of this MA and privatization business,
said Clemens Grafe, chief economist for Goldman in Russia, at
the conference in St. Petersburg on June 16. The old corporate
landscape is changing. </p>
<p>Stocks Still Cheap </p>
<p>Russian stocks are still cheap, Jim O''Neill, chairman of
Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television in Hong Kong, broadcast May 13. A global
stock rally could start in China, he said. </p>
<p>Russia''s benchmark Micex Index has risen 21 percent over
the last year, advancing to a three-year high on April 6. The
30-stock gauge slid 2.3 percent last week as oil, the country''s
main export earner, tumbled 6.3 percent on concern Greece''s debt
crisis will hobble a global recovery. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) units were sued by the federal agency that
regulates credit unions, seeking to recover money lost on
mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>The National Credit Union Administration Board, or NCUA,
accused the institutions of packaging and selling mortgage bonds
with loans that didn''t meet underwriting guidelines. The bonds,
sold to federally chartered credit unions, caused more than
$800 million in losses, according to the agency. </p>
<p>A material percentage amount of the loans included in the
bonds were all but certain to become delinquent or default
shortly after origination, the regulator said in two
complaints filed in federal court in Kansas City, Kansas. It
didn''t specify the amount of money sought. </p>
<p>Five so-called wholesale credit unions failed because they
purchased mortgage-backed securities that lost about $50
billion, David Small, an NCUA spokesman, said in an interview.
After repackaging about $28 billion worth of the bonds and
selling $10 billion worth, the final loss to the entire federal
credit union system will be between $7 billion and $9 billion,
Small said. </p>
<p>The agency plans to sue between five and 10 additional
banks related to the mortgage bonds, Small said. Agency
officials are in settlement talks with the banks, he said. </p>
<p>Untrue Statements </p>
<p>JPMorgan sold credit unions almost $213 million of mortgage
bonds using sale documents that contained untrue statements or
lacked important information, according to one complaint. RBS
used documents with the same flaws to sell credit unions about
$138 million of bonds, the NCUA said in the other complaint. </p>
<p>The NCUA wants the banks to help cover losses caused by the
failures of the credit unions, including U.S. Central Federal
Credit Union, which was placed into conservatorship in 2009. The
agency is liquidating the wholesale credit unions. Wholesale
credit unions provide services to retail credit unions, which
serve consumers. </p>
<p>The prospectuses for the bond sales contained untrue
statements of material fact or omitted material facts, in
violation of U.S. securities laws, according to the NCUA. </p>
<p>Michael Geller, a spokesman for Edinburgh-based RBS, and
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
didn''t immediately return calls for comment today. </p>
<p>The cases are National Credit Union Administration Board v.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, 11-cv-02341, and National Credit
Union Administration Board v. RBS Securities Inc., 11-cv-02340,
U.S. District Court, District Of Kansas (Kansas City). </p>

<p>Acura Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ACUR), a maker
of technology to deter drug abuse, rose the most in 11 weeks in
Nasdaq trading after U.S. regulators approved its short-acting
painkiller Oxecta. </p>
<p>The Palatine, Illinois-based company climbed 63 cents, or
16 percent, to $4.50 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market composite trading. It was the stock''s biggest percentage
increase since April 4. </p>
<p>Acura said in a regulatory filing today that it will
receive $20 million from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) as a result of the Food and
Drug Administration approval. Pfizer, the world''s biggest
drugmaker, acquired marketing rights to the pain medicine,
formerly known as Acurox, in its $3.3 billion purchase of King
Pharmaceuticals in March. Sales of the pills may be limited to
$30 million a year because they don''t guard against intentional
overdose, according to Ian Sanderson, an analyst at Cowen  Co. </p>
<p>While the Acura technology does prevent them from being
crushed and snorted and chewed, the primary means of abuse is
still wide open, Sanderson said in a telephone interview from
Boston. It really does not have a lot of commercial
potential. </p>
<p>The FDA in 2009 rejected the original Acurox formulation
that included niacin, a vitamin that causes redness and
irritation of the face when taken in excess. </p>

<p>Egol ran a desk at New York-based Goldman Sachs that

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
hear a Pfizer Inc. (PFE) unit''s appeal of a $58 million award to three
Nevada women who contracted breast cancer after taking the
company''s Premarin and Prempro menopause drugs. </p>
<p>The rebuff leaves the award as the largest to be upheld on
appeal in thousands of hormone-replacement drug suits. More than
6 million women took Prempro and other menopause drugs before a
2002 study highlighted their links to cancer. Pfizer and its
units at one point faced more than 10,000 claims, according to
lawyers for former users. </p>
<p>The Nevada Supreme Court concluded jurors properly held
Pfizer''s Wyeth unit responsible for hiding the breast-cancer
risks of Premarin and Prempro. The original 2007 award totaled
$134.1 million to Arlene Rowatt, Jeraldine Scofield and Pamela
Forrester. The trial judge later reduced the verdict to $57.6
million. </p>
<p>While we are disappointed with the Supreme Court''s
decision, it does nothing to change the fact that hormone
therapy medicines are an important treatment option for many
women with debilitating symptoms of menopause, Chris Loder, a
Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>At the U.S. Supreme Court, Wyeth argued the Nevada judge
should have ordered a new trial rather than reduce the award.
The company argued the jury was swayed by an improper and
inflammatory closing argument by the women''s lawyer. </p>
<p>False Reassurances'' </p>
<p>Attorneys for the women urged the Supreme Court not to get
involved, saying the award was warranted in light of the
company''s mishandling of the drug and misleading marketing
campaign. </p>
<p>Wyeth refused to accept responsibility for what it did to
these brave women, Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer for Rowatt,
Scofield and Forrester, said in an e-mailed statement. Wyeth
can''t hide any more. These women will finally see justice. </p>
<p>Annual sales of Wyeth''s hormone-replacement drugs exceeded
$2 billion before a 2002 study, sponsored by the U.S. National
Institutes of Health, suggested that women using the medicines
had a 24 percent higher risk of breast cancer. </p>
<p>Until 1995, many patients combined Premarin, Wyeth''s
estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made by
Pfizer''s Pharmacia  Upjohn unit. Wyeth then combined the two
hormones in Prempro. The drugs are still on the market. </p>
<p>Largest Drugmaker </p>
<p>New York-based Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker,
acquired Wyeth in 2009. The company, which has settled a third
of the pending cases over its Prempro menopause drug, said last
month that it set aside $772 million to resolve claims over the
medicine. </p>
<p>Rowatt, Scofield, Forrester were all in their 60s at the
time of the verdict. Forrester and Rowatt have since died of
causes unrelated to the litigation. </p>
<p>In April 2008, a judge awarded the women''s lawyers more
than $1.6 million in fees and expenses, Littlepage said in a
statement. That brings the total award to more than $59 million. </p>
<p>The case is Wyeth LLC v. Scofield, 10-1177, U.S. Supreme
Court (Washington). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) is seeking to raise a
$688 million loan fund to be managed by GSO Capital Partners LP,
the credit investment arm of Blackstone Group LP (BX), according to
people with knowledge of the deal. </p>
<p>The collateralized loan obligation, Central Park CLO,
includes a $428 million piece rated AAA by Standard  Poor''s,
said one of the people, who declined to be identified because
the terms are private. It may price by June 30, the person said. </p>
<p>CLOs, a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return, are increasing even as prices on the
underlying debt tumble to the lowest since January on concern
that the U.S. economy is slowing and Greece''s fiscal crisis
roils credit markets. </p>
<p>The CLO machine is revving its engines, Barclays
Capital analysts led by Bradley Rogoff wrote in a June 17
report. </p>
<p>More than $4 billion of CLOs backed by widely syndicated
loans have already been issued this year, surpassing the $3.4
billion raised in the U.S. in 2010, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. GSO priced a $400 million CLO with Bank of America
Corp. in December, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Heather Lucania, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Blackstone, didn''t immediately return a call seeking comment. </p>
<p>GSO had fee-earning assets under management of $25.8
billion, as of March 31, according to its website. </p>
<p>The Central Park CLO also includes a $91 million piece
rated AA; a $38 million slice graded A; a $36 million portion
rated BBB; and a $33 million segment rated BB, the person said.
There is also $7 million of Class F debt and $54.95 million of
subordinated notes, the person said. </p>
<p>The SP/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index declined 0.35

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was fined
25,000 pounds ($40,000) by the ICE Futures Europe exchange for
disorderly oil trading, the London-based exchange said. </p>
<p>An ICE committee that investigated the trades found no
evidence of intentional manipulation of the market; nevertheless
it considered the breach to be of a serious nature, ICE said
in a circular on its website dated June 17. </p>
<p>Kelly Loeffler, Atlanta-based spokeswoman for
IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE), which owns ICE Futures Europe,
said the company doesn''t comment on investigations. Joanna Carss, a London-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, said
she couldn''t comment on the matter immediately. </p>
<p>The penalty relates to price spikes on the April 2011
Brent-WTI crude spread that occurred on Jan. 28 from 2:26 p.m.
U.K. time to 2:31 p.m., according to the circular. The moves
were found to be the result of several large market orders
placed in quick succession by a Goldman trader, ICE said. </p>
<p>The ICE committee considered the behavior of Goldman
Sachs and its client to be a clear case of disorderly trading,
in that the distorting price impact of the placement of such

<p>In the current environment we warn that the krona is

oil prices to rise further this year, on the back of both strong
demand and tight supply. </p>
<p>Investors should bet the krone will strengthen to 1.20

<p>Hong Kong property prices may fall
as much as 15 percent by the end of the year, said Walter Kwok,
former chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16), the world''s
biggest developer by market value. </p>
<p>Lukewarm demand at an auction on June 9 for a parcel of
land near the Peak district, about a 10-minute drive from the
Central business district, will lead to a softening of prices of
finished properties, said Kwok in an interview in the western
Chinese city of Chongqing on June 18. </p>
<p>I wouldn''t be surprised they will fall 10 to 15
percent, Kwok said. We have already seen the peak. </p>
<p>Government officials including Chief Executive Donald Tsang
have warned of an asset bubble in the Chinese city, where home
prices have surged more than 70 percent since the beginning of
2009. In the most recent measures to curb prices, announced on
June 10, the government raised up-front payments for properties
costing more than HK$6 million ($770,000) and required borrowers
whose income is primarily from outside Hong Kong to deposit an
extra 10 percent when they buy properties unless they can
demonstrate a close connection to the city. </p>
<p>The government will add more than 20,000 homes this year
and may offer more land for residential projects, Tsang said in
an interview in Melbourne on June 17. </p>
<p>Prices may drop 10 percent to 20 percent in 2012 and a
further 10 percent in 2013 on rising interest rates, Andrew Lawrence, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Barclays Capital, said in
a June 7 Bloomberg Television interview. </p>
<p>Property Shares Fall </p>
<p>The Hang Seng Property Index, which includes Sun Hung Kai,
has declined 12 percent this year, while the benchmark Hang Seng
Index is down 6.2 percent. Sun Hung Kai fell 16 percent this
year and dropped 2 percent to HK$108.90 to close at its lowest
since September. </p>
<p>Rising prices should not be entirely blamed on mainland
Chinese, and the measures making it more difficult for non-
residents to buy property will not solve the problem, Kwok said. </p>
<p>Hong Kong should not give the impression to the outside
world that it practices discrimination; this is open door, he
said. </p>
<p>Mainland Chinese buyers of property in Hong Kong are
exacerbating the territory''s shortage of land for development,
Tsang said on June 17. Mainland China doesn''t include Hong Kong,
Macau or Taiwan. </p>
<p>Reasonable'' Level </p>
<p>Buyers from other Chinese cities account for 20 percent to
30 percent of sales, a level Kwok called reasonable,
especially when compared with London and New York where foreign
ownership is larger. </p>
<p>Overseas buyers and those from other Chinese cities
accounted for about a third of luxury home transactions in Hong
Kong in the first quarter of this year, according to Centaline
Property Agency Ltd., the city''s biggest privately held realtor.
Savills Plc ranks Hong Kong as the most expensive place to buy
an apartment.
     Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., controlled by billionaire Li Ka-shing paid about HK$26,763 per square foot, according to
Centaline. That is considerably less than the HK$35,000 per
square foot the market expected, said Kwok. </p>
<p>Kwok is the eldest son of Sun Hung Kai''s late co-founder
Kwok Tak Seng. He was stripped of the company''s chairmanship in
2008 by brothers Thomas and Raymond Kwok, who replaced him with
their mother. Walter remains a non-executive director of the
company. The family''s combined wealth of $20 billion is second
on Forbes Magazine''s list of Hong Kong richest. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s deal to
settle a U.S. regulator''s claims that the bank misled buyers of
mortgage-linked securities before the housing market collapsed
echoed a case brought last year against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) </p>
<p>JPMorgan agreed to pay $153.6 million to end a Securities
and Exchange Commission suit. The SEC alleged that the New York-
based bank failed to tell investors in 2007 that a hedge fund
helped pick, and bet against, underlying securities in the
collateralized debt obligation they purchased. In July, Goldman
Sachs paid a record $550 million for failing to inform clients
in 2007 that it allowed a hedge fund that also bet against
housing to help formulate the CDOs. </p>
<p>It''s the same general allegation of wrongdoing, Robert Khuzami, enforcement chief of the SEC, said yesterday in a
Bloomberg Television interview. The message in both cases is
if you engage in this kind of wrongdoing, if you mislead
investors, you''re going to pay a fine. </p>
<p>The SEC is targeting mortgage-industry firms from loan
originators including Countrywide Financial Corp. to Wall Street
CDO underwriters. The regulator has looked at Citigroup Inc. (C),
Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG and Morgan Stanley, a person with
knowledge of the matter has said. </p>
<p>Like Goldman, JPMorgan''s brokerage unit, JPMorgan
Securities LLC, didn''t admit or deny wrongdoing in settling.
Unlike Goldman, the claims against the firm relied solely on a
section of the Securities Act of 1933 that connotes a lesser
violation, said Ed B. Horahan, a Washington-based securities
lawyer. </p>
<p>Messed Up'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs settled under a section of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 that says the accused firm knew what it was
doing, while JPMorgan''s case is closer to negligence, Horahan
said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment yesterday. </p>
<p>JPMorgan simply admitted that it messed up'' the
documentation, said Brad Hintz, an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. The bank pays a fine, announces a public mea
culpa and has no more liability. This looks like a win for
JPMorgan. JPMorgan rose 1.1 percent to close at $40.91
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>The customers misled by the two banks also differed,
according to the SEC suits. JPMorgan sold about $150 million of
notes in the CDO, known as Squared, to about 15 firms including
a not-for-profit Lutheran insurer, Thrivent Financial, and a New
York City-based manager of General Motors Co. pensions. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, one of the biggest investors in Goldman Sachs''
Abacus CDO was Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG. The German bank was aware of the risk
associated with the securities and was among the most
sophisticated mortgage investors in the world, Goldman Sachs
said in April 2010. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, Magnetar </p>
<p>The facts of JPMorgan''s case, which involve hedge fund
Magnetar Capital LLC, look worse than Goldman Sachs''s, said
Charles Whitehead, an associate professor at Cornell Law School
in New York. Magnetar, betting housing prices would fall, stood
to profit if assets defaulted. </p>
<p>Goldman was able to point to a number of cases where the
Abacus collateral manager refused to take suggestions made by
the hedge fund, Whitehead said. In this case, the SEC''s
complaint goes out of its way to highlight the fact that the
collateral manager was taking direction very much from
Magnetar. </p>
<p>Magnetar had a significant role in picking the assets
linked to the CDO, known as Squared, during February 2007,
according to e-mails between the hedge fund, JPMorgan and the
collateral manager, a unit of GSC Capital Corp., the SEC said.
That month, the hedge fund bet against 18 of 19 securities
inserted into the investment, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Magnetar''s Bets </p>
<p>Magnetar didn''t control the asset-selection process and its
bets were part of a market-neutral portfolio, Steve Lipin, a
spokesman for the hedge fund, said yesterday in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Magnetar is not a party to the settlement nor a defendant
in this case, and was not involved in the marketing of the
securities, Lipin said. The SEC staff issued a closing
letter to Magnetar stating that it does not intend to recommend
any enforcement action'' against Magnetar, any of its funds or
any current or former Magnetar personnel. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said in a statement that the bank booked $900
million in losses on the CDO and, after an internal review,
voluntarily made $56 million in payments to investors of a
separate CDO called Tahoma I. </p>
<p>The SEC has not charged the firm with intentional or
reckless misconduct, JPMorgan said in the statement. </p>
<p>Losses on CDOs </p>
<p>CDOs package assets such as mortgage bonds into new
securities with varying risks. A surge in U.S. home loan
defaults undermined the instruments, helping lead financial
companies to record $1.82 trillion in losses and writedowns
during the housing crisis, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>The SEC''s claim focuses on JPMorgan''s disclosures about
Squared CDO 2007-1. Marketing materials said the instrument''s
portfolio was selected by GSC, which had experience analyzing
CDO credit risk. Magnetar also played a role in the selection
and stood to benefit if CDOs tied to the instrument defaulted,
according to the agency''s complaint. </p>
<p>In the months before the deal closed in May 2007, the bank
made a frantic global sales effort to sell the Squared
securities amid signs of distress in the housing market, the SEC
said in a statement. </p>
<p>We are soooo pregnant with this deal, we need a wheel-
barrel to move around, wrote a JPMorgan employee in charge of
distributing the CDO in a March 2007 e-mail meant to encourage
the sales staff, according to the SEC complaint. Let''s
schedule the cesarian, please! </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and the World
Bank will provide as much as $400 million to developing nations
for hedging their trade in agricultural supplies after record
global food prices pushed 44 million more people into poverty. </p>
<p>The credit will come equally from New York-based JPMorgan
and the World Bank''s International Finance Corp. and allow for
as much as $4 billion of hedging, the World Bank said in a
statement today. The funds are available to producers,
consumers, cooperatives and local banks. </p>
<p>High, uncertain and volatile food prices are the single
gravest threat facing the most vulnerable in the developing
world, World Bank President Robert Zoellick said in the
statement. People are hungry for food and for action on a
global level. </p>
<p>Group of 20 farm ministers meet in Paris this week to
discuss proposals to share information on stockpiles, eliminate
export restrictions, create emergency food stocks for the
poorest nations and reduce commodity price swings. World food
output will have to rise 70 percent by 2050 as the global
population climbs to 9.2 billion from an estimated 6.9 billion
in 2010, the United Nations says. </p>
<p>The World Bank wants to get other lenders involved in its
Agriculture Price Risk Management product, extending credit to
those in emerging markets who would not normally be able to pay
for hedging. Stable prices will help farmers get financing to
expand output and ensure reasonable access to food for
consumers, the Washington-based bank said. </p>
<p>Central Database </p>
<p>The G-20 ministers should agree to establish a central
database on the quality and quantity of global grain stocks,
which would reduce price swings by avoiding panic-buying,
Zoellick said in the statement. They should also exempt
humanitarian aid from export bans, he said. </p>
<p>Growth in rice and wheat yields in developing countries,
representing about 80 percent of the global population, has
slowed to 1 percent a year, from 3 percent in the 1970s,
Zoellick said. Unless action is taken to mitigate climate
change, agricultural yields may drop 16 percent over the next
half century, he said. </p>
<p>We need to be creative about farming, so there are not
only more crops but more resilient crops, Zoellick said. There
are almost 1 billion hungry people in the world, he said. </p>
<p>World food prices rose 37 percent in the past 12 months,
reaching a record in February, according to an index of 55
commodities from the UN''s Food and Agriculture Organization.
That helped push 44 million people into poverty in the past
year, defined as those living on less than $1.25 a day. </p>

<p>Regions Financial Corp. (RF) said it will
consider strategic alternatives for its Morgan Keegan
division after the unit resolved claims by federal, state and
industry regulators over subprime mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>The bank, based in Birmingham, Alabama, hired Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) to evaluate options for Morgan Keegan, ways to manage
capital and increase shareholder value, it said today in a
statement. Two Morgan Keegan units reached a package of
settlements with regulators that may total $210 million in
payments, the company said. </p>
<p>A sale would be the main alternative at this point only
because it''s a unit that''s got a considerable franchise in the
Southeast, Kevin Fitzsimmons, an analyst with Sandler O''Neill
 Partners, said today in a phone interview. It''s in a number
of different businesses within capital markets and I''m sure
there are some players out there who are looking to expand into
that or get into that specific geography. </p>
<p>The accord resolves claims brought last year by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority and state regulators, the SEC said today in
a separate statement. Regulators last year said the firm misled
clients about asset values and risks of bond funds that caused
investor losses during the mortgage crisis. The company settled
the SEC''s complaints without admitting or denying wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Fund manager James Kelsoe told employees in 2007 to make
price adjustments that were arbitrary and did not reflect
fair value, the SEC said in an order today. Kelsoe also
determined whether third-party price confirmations were to be
used or ignored, the SEC said. </p>
<p>States Involved </p>
<p>Kelsoe fraudulently prevented the Morgan Keegan fund
accounting department from reducing the net asset value of the
funds during the deterioration in the subprime market, William Hicks, associate regional director for the SEC, said today on a
call with reporters. Morgan Keegan''s actions may have resulted
in $1.5 billion of losses, Joseph Borg, director of the Alabama
Securities Commission, said on the call. </p>
<p>The SEC and Finra said the settlement amounts to $200
million. Regions, Alabama''s biggest bank, said it may also have
to pay as much as $10 million to states that join the accord.
Five states involved in the case initially included Alabama,
Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee, according
to the company. Regions said it already set aside funds to cover
the settlement payments. </p>
<p>Regions acquired Morgan Keegan in 2001. The Memphis,
Tennessee-based subsidiary has more than 300 offices in 20
states and provides brokerage and investment-banking services.
Founded with five workers in 1969, Morgan Keegan now has more
than 4,000 employees, according to its website. </p>
<p>TARP Funds </p>
<p>Regions holds $3.5 billion in government bailout funds, and
investors are expecting that the bank will need to raise capital
to exit the Troubled Asset Relief Program, Fitzsimmons said. A
sale of Morgan Keegan would help raise that capital, he said. </p>
<p>For the company as a whole, it''s not a huge earnings
driver, he said. Any kind of unlocking of value or capital
boost it can get from the sale of a unit like this might be
viewed as essentially reducing what they would have to raise,
reducing the dilution that would come with such a raise. </p>
<p>Regions fell 9 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $6.21 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
declined 11 percent this year. </p>

<p>Bank investors may have to wait at
least another quarter for trading to rebound as analysts expect
lower trading revenue in the current period, the fifth straight
year-over-year drop, amid weaker volume and market declines. </p>
<p>Fixed-income trading revenue at U.S. banks likely will fall
30 percent from the first quarter, while equities trading will
drop 15 percent, Keith Horowitz, a Citigroup Inc. (C) analyst, wrote
in a report this week. Seven analysts have cut their earnings
estimates for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley in the
past four weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Wall Street faced lower trading volumes as clients stepped
back amid concerns that the Greek debt crisis will spread to
other European nations and evidence that U.S. economic growth is
slowing. Declining trading revenue expectations have fueled
share declines of more than 10 percent at each of the six
largest U.S. banks since March 31. </p>
<p>There are a number of headwinds and the markets haven''t
really been cooperating, said James Ellman, president of San
Francisco-based hedge fund Seacliff Capital LLC. This trend
can turn around in a moment if clients become more active, and
you get more volume and volatility in generally rising markets,
but we haven''t seen that yet. </p>
<p>Total trading revenue at the five biggest Wall Street banks
-- Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. (BAC),
Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley -- may drop to $21.7 billion, a
4.4 percent decline from the second quarter of 2010 and 17
percent from last quarter, according to estimates by Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York. Trading
accounted for almost a quarter of the firms'' revenue last year. </p>
<p>Sluggish'' Environment </p>
<p>The second quarter likely saw a continuation of the
sluggish risk-on/risk-off environment that we have had for the
past four quarters, Kotowski wrote in a report this week. His
figures exclude charges tied to the firms'' own debt. </p>
<p>Revenue from fixed-income, currencies and commodities, or
FICC, has been hindered this quarter by weak trading volumes,
low levels of client leverage, widening credit spreads in high-
yield and sovereign assets, and declining volatility, Horowitz
said. Banks also are starting to see the effects of the absence
of proprietary-trading groups that were shut down to comply with
new rules, Ellman said. </p>
<p>It''s not just the trading activity, it''s the shrinking of
these prop businesses, Ellman said. As you shut those areas
down, you lose some of the more profitable areas of FICC. </p>
<p>Fixed-income trading revenue at the five banks fell 25
percent in the first quarter, compared with the first three
months of 2010, according to company filings. Equities trading
revenue dropped 4.5 percent. </p>
<p>Jefferies''s Profit Falls </p>
<p>Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF), the New York-based investment bank
that''s been expanding its advisory and fixed-income businesses,
yesterday reported that profit fell 3.8 percent in the fiscal
second quarter ended May 31 as trading revenue decreased. </p>
<p>The general climate pretty much throughout the quarter
was one of clients being uncertain of direction of positions and
basically not being very active on the trading side, Jefferies
Chief Executive Officer Richard Handler, 50, said during a
conference call with investors. As a result, you just do not
get the natural flow that we enjoyed during the first quarter. </p>
<p>David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities, has cut his
second-quarter earnings estimates for all five banks over the
last two weeks. Fixed-income trading likely will fall 16 percent
from the first three months of the year, while equities trading
will probably fall 14 percent, he wrote in a note today. </p>
<p>Turbulent Macro Environment'' </p>
<p>Overall, cash equities trading volume is expected to
decline in the second quarter compared to a seasonally strong
first quarter, Trone said in the note. The decline will be
challenged further by the turbulent macro environment which
should further dampen investor activity as the appetite for risk
decreases. </p>
<p>Banks are turning to cost-cutting measures amid the lack of
revenue growth. Morgan Stanley (MS) Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said earlier this month that the firm has commenced a
three-year program to reduce expenses by $1 billion. Morgan
Stanley may also cut 300 brokers in its wealth-management unit. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is aiming to reduce $1 billion in non-
compensation expenses over the next 12 months, according to a
person familiar with the matter who declined to be identified
because the plan hasn''t been publicly announced. </p>
<p>Wall Street Cuts </p>
<p>Weak trading revenue so far this year is likely to lead to
cuts on Wall Street, analysts including Meredith Whitney and
Nomura Holdings Inc.''s Glenn Schorr have said. U.S. banks may
accelerate announced job reductions after eliminating 11,400
positions in the first five months of the year, a 21 percent
increase over 2010, according to Challenger, Gray  Christmas
Inc. </p>
<p>Managing directors in the fixed-income trading divisions
are likely to be cut, Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. in New York, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview last week. The ratio of managing directors on staff at
investment banks is going to drop to about 10 percent from 15
percent at well-run firms and from 20 percent at those that are
poorly run, Hintz said. </p>
<p>You don''t have to fire lots of people, you just need to
fire expensive people, said Hintz, adding that the 40 percent
of compensation that goes to managing directors isn''t
sustainable. You are going to change the shape of the
pyramid. </p>
<p>Fixed-Income Revenue </p>
<p>After reporting record investment-banking and trading
revenue for 2009, banks have had declines in those businesses
for four straight quarters compared with year-earlier periods. A
fall in fixed-income trading revenue, the biggest capital-
markets business for the banks, largely spurred the decreases. </p>
<p>Aggregate fixed-income revenue for the five U.S. banks and
four international rivals -- UBS AG (UBSN), Credit Suisse Group AG,
Barclays Plc, and Deutsche Bank AG -- dropped to $101 billion
last year, from a record $146 billion in 2009, according to
Schorr, a Nomura analyst in New York. </p>
<p>Commodities trading revenue for 10 of the largest U.S. and
European banks rose about 55 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, according to a report last month by London-based
research firm Coalition Development Ltd. That led commodities to
contribute 7 percent of overall fixed-income trading revenue in
the quarter, up from 4 percent in the first quarter of 2010,
Coalition said. </p>
<p>Commodities trading probably won''t provide the same boost
in the second quarter, Citigroup''s Horowitz said. That may lead
to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which have large commodity
businesses, reporting larger FICC revenue declines than their
competitors, he wrote. </p>
<p>Crude Oil </p>
<p>Crude oil has fallen 12 percent to $93.65 so far this
quarter, which would be the largest drop since the fourth
quarter of 2008. Silver prices dropped 28 percent in a week in
May as CME Group Inc., owner of Comex, raised margin
requirements. </p>
<p>Average daily equity-trading volume on the largest U.S.
exchanges is down 32 percent from the second quarter of 2010,
and is on pace to fall 9.8 percent from last quarter. Dollar
volume of high-yield corporate bonds has declined 17 percent
from a year earlier, while volume of investment-grade bonds rose
6.1 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>Trading volume, an indicator of performance, may not

<p>U.S. equity research and related
services from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-largest American
bank by assets, was voted the most valuable to asset managers
surveyed by Greenwich Associates, a report yesterday said. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) won the most U.S. equity trading
volume based on commissions spent, the survey from the Stamford,
Connecticut-based research firm said. The two brokers, along
with Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), placed in the top five in both categories. The
responses from 217 fund managers and 304 equity traders were
weighted by the dollar value of the commissions spent. </p>
<p>Asset managers decided how much to pay brokers from a
commission pool that shrank 12 percent in the year that ended in
mid-February to $11.6 billion, Greenwich said in another report
on U.S. equities earlier this month. The contraction occurred as
trading volume on American exchanges declined about 14 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Customers depend on research for their investment
decisions, said Joseph Cangemi, managing director at BNY
ConvergEx Group LLC and chairman of the Security Traders
Association, both based in New York. If there''s less trading
commissions available, firms will be forced to spend a greater
percentage of their commission dollars on research. </p>
<p>Commissions paid for research and advisory services,
including access to executives at companies, rose to a 10-year
high of 59 percent of the total from 53 percent a year earlier,
Greenwich said. The dollar amount spent remained about the same
at $6.8 billion, compared with $7 billion a year earlier,
according to John Feng, Jay Bennett and John Colon of Greenwich. </p>
<p>Protecting Access </p>
<p>Firms spent more proportionally for research services
because they needed to protect their access to that advice,
Feng, a managing director at Greenwich, said in an interview.
Commissions are the currency to access those insights. </p>
<p>Institutional brokerage commissions shrank and trading
volume slowed as the U.S. stock market produced smaller gains.
The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index, the benchmark measure of U.S.
equities, surged 32 percent between Feb. 13, 2009, and Feb. 16,
2010, recovering from the subprime-mortgage crisis that saddled
banks worldwide with $2.06 trillion in losses and writedowns. In
the next year, it gained 21 percent. </p>
<p>Greenwich said the nine biggest brokers, which it didn''t
identify, got 68 percent of U.S. equity commissions, up from 65
percent last year, while mid-size and regional brokers got 18
percent. Securities firms that execute orders for institutional
clients without engaging in proprietary trading or offering
investment banking services received 13 percent. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs </p>
<p>The largest brokers, including Goldman Sachs in New York
and Bank of America in Charlotte, North Carolina, offer more
services than other securities companies. They can provide
access to initial public offerings, company research and
analysis, meetings with management, capital to help clients
execute larger trades without swaying stock prices, and
investment services. </p>
<p>When the commission pool shrinks, firms often concentrate
their commissions with the bigger firms to remain valued clients
and get the services they deem important. That puts more
pressure on smaller brokers that struggle to maintain their
level of trading and commissions to help fund their businesses. </p>
<p>The best brokers providing research and related services
according to votes by fund managers aren''t necessarily the ones
that get the most commissions in trading volume, Feng said.
Factors such as the willingness to commit capital for a firm''s
transactions and traders'' assessment of how well the securities
company handles orders play into the decision. </p>
<p>Correlations </p>
<p>There is a push-pull between the vote a broker earns and
the commissions paid, Feng said. The results are highly
correlated but not proportional. </p>
<p>Of the amount paid for research and advisory services, 21
percent was used to compensate brokers for access to management
at companies the firms may want to buy or sell, up from 19 the
previous year, the Greenwich report said. Payment for analyst
services decreased to 24 percent from 27 percent. </p>
<p>Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley (MS),
all based in New York, were ranked the top brokers based on the
quality of their U.S. research. The ranking based on research
and advisory votes includes the quality and breadth of a firm''s
offering, Feng said. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse in Zurich was also the top broker for North
American trading of baskets of stock. That result was based on
interviews with 109 firms, weighted by the dollar amount they
trade, the Greenwich report said. </p>
<p>May 2010 Crash </p>
<p>In addition to needing to pay for research and investment
services, asset managers and hedge funds became more concerned
about electronic trading after the May 6, 2010, plunge that
briefly erased $862 billion in equity value, Feng said. </p>
<p>That prompted them to pare back the use of electronic
trading, including algorithms that break up orders into smaller
pieces and dark pools, to 40 percent of the total dollar value
of transactions from 45 percent the previous year, he said.
Algorithmic trading claimed 19 percent of dollar volume, the
same as the prior year. For dark pools, or private venues, the
proportion slipped to 8 percent from 10 percent. </p>
<p>The average commission paid to brokers for algorithmic
trading was 1.3 cents a share across asset managers, with hedge
funds paying 1 cent, Greenwich said. Dark pools charged an
average 1.4 cents. For direct market access, in which clients
trade on exchanges themselves, brokers charged 1.2 cents on
average, the report said. </p>
<p>Picking Brokers </p>
<p>The share of U.S. asset managers using so-called client
commission arrangements increased to 64 percent from 54 percent
the previous year, Greenwich said. These offerings allow mutual
funds and asset managers to trade with brokers they want and add
money to the commission paid to compensate other firms whose
research they use. Nomura Holdings Inc.''s Instinet Inc., Capital
Institutional Services Inc. and BNY ConvergEx have offered
access to research from other firms for years. </p>
<p>The results of the U.S. equities survey may not indicate a
shift in the longer-term trend toward more electronic trading by
mutual funds, pensions and hedge fund clients, Feng said. </p>
<p>If the commission pool goes back up next year, the
percentage spent for research may revert to a historical norm,
he said. </p>

<p>Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai''s party rejected accusations by an army brigadier
general that he is a threat to the southern African nation''s
security. </p>
<p>Brigadier-General Douglas Nyikayaramba said Tsvangirai,
leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, takes orders from
Western leaders, the state-controlled Herald said today. It
quoted him as saying the security forces would die to keep
President Robert Mugabe, 87, in power and that Tsvangirai would
never rule. </p>
<p>The only threat to Zimbabwe comes from the military,
which is interfering in politics, MDC spokesman Douglas Mwonzora said today by phone from the capital, Harare. The MDC
won the March 2008 election and by any measure, the army should
respect that. </p>
<p>Nyikayaramba''s comments followed statements by Tsvangirai
urging officials in the security services to quit their posts
and enter politics instead of using their positions to back
Mugabe. Tsvangirai''s MDC and Mugabe''s Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front party agreed to share power after disputed
elections in 2008 that the MDC narrowly won. </p>
<p>The MDC insists that Zimbabwe''s security sector be reformed
before a new vote is held. </p>
<p>I don''t see that happening fast because the security
sector is Mugabe''s guarantee of power, political analyst Alois Masepe said in a telephone interview from Harare. Zanu-PF
equates security reform with defeat. </p>
<p>Under the terms of the power-sharing agreement, Zimbabwe
must vote on a new constitution before fresh elections can be
held. Mugabe has repeatedly said a vote should be held this
year, while the MDC insists no election can take place until at
least 2012. </p>
<p>Zimbabwe''s army and Zanu-PF are inseparable, the Herald
today quoted Nyikayaramba as saying. </p>
<p>It shows how government is being perverted by a
politicized security sector, Mwonzora said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will return
$800 million in cash and securities belonging to customers of
bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)''s brokerage under a
settlement approved by a judge. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James M. Peck today approved the
accord, struck in April between the second-biggest U.S. bank and
the trustee liquidating the remains of the brokerage, Lehman
Brothers Inc. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was the main clearing bank for the Lehman
brokerage, processing billions of dollars of transactions and
lending it tens of billions of dollars daily, according to court
filings. While some loans were secured by securities in the
brokerage''s accounts, the bank didn''t have a valid lien on the
$800 million in customer property that is being returned,
according to filings. </p>
<p>Customer property held by the LBI estate available for
distribution will increase by more than $800 million, the
trustee, James Giddens, said in an e-mailed statement today.
This is a significant and positive result from two years of
investigation and close cooperation with JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Consenting to return the assets in April, the bank said the
settlement would have no material financial impact, as most
of the assets had already been set aside to satisfy potential
claims by the trustee. </p>
<p>Separately, JPMorgan is seeking dismissal of an $8.6
billion lawsuit by the Lehman parent. </p>
<p>The brokerage bankruptcy case is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Lehman Brothers Inc., 08-01420, U.S.

<p>On June 16, the U.S. senate passed an amendment to repeal
the existing tax credit of 45 cents per gallon to ethanol
blenders and a tariff of 54 cents per gallon on imported

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-biggest
U.S. energy company, bought a 50-story office tower that it
occupies in downtown Houston (BHTX) from Brookfield Office Properties
Inc. (BPO) for $340 million. </p>
<p>Brookfield paid about $120 million for the skyscraper at
1400 Smith St. in 2006, the New York-based real estate company
said in a statement today. It leased the entire building, the
former headquarters of Enron Corp., to Chevron soon after. </p>
<p>The sale price is a coup for Brookfield, said Dan Fasulo, managing director at Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New
York-based real estate research firm. Houston added 50,700 jobs,
a 2 percent increase, in the 12 months through February, helping
stabilize a property market where 2.1 million square feet
(195,000 square meters) of new offices will be completed by year
end, brokerage Cushman  Wakefield Inc. reported in April. </p>
<p>It''s a win-win for both parties, Fasulo said in a phone
interview. For Chevron, obviously they''re a cash-rich
corporation. They have the money to buy their own property, </p>
<p>The deal for the 1.3 million-square-foot building made
economic sense, Mickey Driver, a spokesman for San Ramon,
California-based Chevron, said in a phone interview. He declined
to discuss the financial benefits. </p>
<h2>Owning Buildings </h2>
<p>Chevron owns and operates most of its office buildings,
according to Driver. The company has about 9,000 employees in
the Houston area, in offices in downtown Houston, Bellaire and
Briarpark, he said. </p>
<p>It owns 1500 Louisiana St., across from the Smith Street
tower, and a nearby 1,100-space parking garage, Driver said. </p>
<p>Brookfield owned 1400 Smith St. in a joint venture with
Blackstone Group LP (BX), the world''s largest private-equity firm,
said Kristin Calmes, a Brookfield spokeswoman. The companies
together acquired seven other Houston properties in 2006 through
their buyout of Trizec Properties Inc. </p>
<p>A call to Peter Rose, a spokesman for New York-based
Blackstone, wasn''t immediately returned. </p>
<p>This sale is reflective of our ongoing strategy of
recycling capital from mature assets into more accretive
opportunities, said Richard Clark, Brookfield''s chief
executive officer, in the statement today. </p>
<p>The sale is Brookfield''s second multi-million-dollar
transaction in Houston in the last seven months. The company
paid $321.5 million in December for Heritage Plaza, a 53-story
skyscraper. </p>
<p>The Chevron deal equals about $260 a square foot. That''s
roughly consistent with what Brookfield paid for the 1.2
million-square-foot Heritage Plaza, Real Capital''s Fasulo said. </p>
<p>Chevron also renewed a 311,000-square-foot lease at the
neighboring 1600 Smith St. for seven years, Brookfield said. </p>
<p>Brookfield, which owns New York''s World Financial Center,
has 78 million square feet of office buildings in the U.S.,
Canada and Australia. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s pensions
buyout unit, Rothesay Life, mistakenly told U.K. regulators it
had entered into derivatives contracts valued at 151 billion
pounds ($242 billion). </p>
<p>The bank overstated the position by a factor of a thousand
in its annual return to the Financial Services Authority, signed
by the unit''s chief executive, Addy Loudiadis, and audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The unit has 151 million pounds of
inflation and interest-rate swaps outstanding, spokeswoman Fiona Laffan said by e-mail today. The firm told the FSA about the
typographical error after filing in March and wasn''t required to
resubmit it, Laffan said. PwC declined to comment. </p>
<p>Goldman, which set up Rothesay in 2007, manages about 4.3
billion pounds of pensions liabilities for companies including
British Airways and RSA Insurance Group Plc. (RSA) Firms such as
Rothesay promise to pay pensions if retirees live beyond a
certain age. They typically receive a portion of the pension
plan''s assets in return and try to hedge the risk they take on
with derivatives. </p>
<p>Rothesay has total capital of 161 million pounds, 350
percent more than the regulatory minimum required by the FSA,
according to the filing, and more than competitors including
Pension Insurance Corp., Prudential Plc (PRU), and Legal  General
Group Plc (LGEN), according to Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs also disclosed in the filing it assumes
pensioners will live longer than their employers assume. London-
based RSA said in 2009 it expected 65-year-old men to live a
further 22.5 years on average, while Rothesay, which reinsured
the fund the same year, says that these men will live for 25
more years. Rothesay expects a woman aged 45 today to pass their
95th birthday, five years more than RSA''s assumptions. </p>
<p>The more conservative these assumptions are, the better
capitalised and solvent the insurance company is, Goldman
Sachs said by e-mail. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
hasn''t arranged a debt or equity sale in Ukraine since at least
1999, will advise the government of the former Soviet republic
free of charge. </p>
<p>The bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein,
will advise the administration of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov
on managing its investments, state debt and other issues of
financial-policy implementation, the government said in a
statement dated June 20 and published on its website today. </p>
<p>The selection follows Goldman''s third attempt in 17 years
to crack the neighboring Russian market where it has been
ramping up presence and wooing the Kremlin for roles in asset
sales. The bank, once the most profitable securities firm in
Wall Street history, wasn''t involved in a single deal since 1999
as the Ukrainian government and companies raised $41.4 billion
in stock and debt sales during the period, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Monika Schaller, a Goldman spokeswoman in Frankfurt, didn''t
immediately respond to two telephone calls and a written request
seeking comment. </p>
<p>Second Bailout </p>
<p>Ukraine''s government, which in July obtained a $15.6
billion loan from the International Monetary Fund for its second
bailout in two years, expects its debt servicing payments to
peak between 2012 and 2016. The nation resumed Eurobond sales in
2010 after a three-year break and has sold $2.75 billion of debt
so far this year. The government may issue as much as $4.5
billion in bonds in 2011, according to the budget plan. </p>
<p>Ukraine has also twice extended a $2 billion six-month loan
from VTB Group, Russia''s second-largest bank, which it received
last year. </p>
<p>The IMF has so far released $3.4 billion in two tranches,
helping the government cover its deficit and boost foreign-
currency reserves. The third disbursement, initially planned for
March, has been delayed after the authorities failed to raise
the retirement age and increase household utility prices. </p>
<p>Ukraine may receive $3 billion from the IMF in September,
Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Tigipko said June 22. </p>
<p>The government will have to repay 153.3 billion hryvnia
($19.2 billion) between 2012 and 2016, the Finance Ministry said
Dec. 28. Ukraine''s state debt, including guarantees, more than
tripled since the beginning of 2008, surging to $57.8 billion as
of May 31, according to the ministry. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley (MS) </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Morgan Stanley and VTB organized the
government''s $1.25 billion sale of five-year bonds this month.
UBS AG (UBSN), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Morgan Stanley were the top
three of the 67 underwriters of Ukrainian share and bond sales
between Jan. 1 1999 and now, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>In Russia, by contrast, Goldman jumped to fourth place in
handling equity sales for Russian companies last year, its
highest position ever, behind VTB Capital and Renaissance
Capital, both based in Moscow, and Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Goldman, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, was one of
the four banks chosen by Russia''s central bank June 14 to manage
a sale of part of its stake in OAO Sberbank, a transaction that
may be worth as much as $7 billion. It also helped sell 300
million pounds ($480 million) of sterling-denominated bonds
issued by OAO Russian Railways June 15 and assisted with Russian
search engine owner Yandex NV''s $1.3 billion initial public
offering in May. </p>

<p>Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) and NYSE Euronext
settled shareholder lawsuits challenging the $9.53 billion
buyout of the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange by
offering to pay $910 million in dividends earlier this month,
court papers show. </p>
<p>The agreement to pay the dividends helped to resolve suits
in Delaware and New York alleging the all-stock deal provided
too little for investors, according to a filing in Delaware
Chancery Court. The payout totals about 620 million euros, equal
to 2 euros a Deutsche Boerse share or $1.37 a NYSE share,
company officials said June 7. </p>
<p>We are pleased with the result here, because this
dividend will give shareholders a quantifiable and immediate
payment, Mark Lebovitch, a New York-based lawyer for NYSE
shareholders, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Deutsche Boerse agreed to buy NYSE Euronext (NYX), owner of the
New York Stock Exchange and the Liffe derivatives market, for
$9.53 billion in February. IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) and
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) dropped a competing bid last month after
the U.S. Justice Department threatened an antitrust lawsuit. </p>
<p>Rich Adamonis, spokesman for New York-based NYSE Euronext,
didn''t return a phone call for comment yesterday. Tim Lynch, a
spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>The exchanges agreed to pay the dividends and settle the
suit in hopes of winning support for the deal in a vote next
month. Deutsche Boerse needs 75 percent of shareholders to
approve its purchase of NYSE Euronext by July 13. </p>
<p>Investors can opt to terminate the settlement if the
exchanges decide against paying the dividends, according to
court papers. </p>
<p>NYSE Euronext investors sued in Delaware in February,
calling Deutsche Boerse''s offer grossly inadequate. The
shareholders alleged the bid valued NYSE Euronext at less than
targets in similar deals, such as London Stock Exchange Group
Plc''s purchase of Canada''s TMX Group Inc. </p>
<p>Deutsche Boerse officials acknowledged that the lawsuits
were a factor in the decision to pay the dividends, lawyers
for NYSE Euronext investors said in court papers. The suits also
helped persuade NYSE officials to give investors an opportunity
to have the value of their shares appraised, according to the
June 17 filing. </p>
<p>Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine must decide
whether to give the accord final approval. </p>
<p>The case is In re NYSE Euronext Shareholders Litigation, CA
No. 6220, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>

<p>Drug Marketing Curbs Voided by Top Court on Speech Grounds </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court, invoking free-speech grounds,
overturned a Vermont law aimed at limiting the ability of brand-
name drugmakers to target doctors with individual sales pitches. </p>
<p>The 6-3 ruling is a victory for the pharmaceutical industry
and so-called data-mining companies that sell information to
drugmakers about the prescription-writing practices of
individual doctors. The invalidated measure barred use of that
data for marketing without the doctor''s consent. </p>
<p>The Vermont law targeted detailing, the industry
practice of one-on-one marketing to doctors to persuade them to
prescribe particular drugs. Companies spend more than $8 billion
a year on detailing, according to trial testimony in the case. </p>
<p>The state may not burden the speech of others in order to
tilt public debate in a preferred direction, Justice Anthony
Kennedy wrote for the majority. </p>
<p>Vermont is one of three New England states that restricted
the use of prescription records for marketing, and similar
legislation has been introduced in two dozen other states. </p>
<p>Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena
Kagan dissented. Breyer said the law was part of the state''s
legitimate efforts to protect public health. </p>
<p>The case is Sorrell v. IMS Health, 10-779, U.S. Supreme
Court (Washington). </p>
<p>Generic-Drug Makers Shielded From Lawsuits, Top Court Says </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court gave a new legal shield to the
generic-drug industry, ruling that companies can''t be sued for
failing to warn patients about the risk of dangerous side
effects. </p>
<p>The 5-4 ruling bars two women from suing units of Mylan
Inc. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) over
metoclopramide, a stomach drug they say caused them to contract
a severe neurological disorder. </p>
<p>The decision limits the reach of a 2009 Supreme Court
ruling that required brand-name drugmakers to defend against
failure-to-warn suits filed under state product liability law.
Generic-drug companies successfully argued that they shouldn''t
held to the same standard because federal law requires them to
copy the packaging inserts used by brand-name manufacturers. </p>
<p>If the manufacturers had independently changed their
labels to satisfy their state-law duty, they would have violated
federal law, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court. </p>
<p>The ruling divided the court along familiar lines, with
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony
Kennedy and Samuel Alito joining Thomas in the majority. </p>
<p>In dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the ruling leads
to so many absurd consequences that I cannot fathom that
Congress would have intended to preempt state law in these

<p>GlaxoSmithKline, SB Pharmco to Settle With 37 States, D.C. </p>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline LLC and SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc. entered
into a $40.8 million accord with 37 U.S. states and the District
of Columbia to resolve allegations they breached drug
manufacturing standards, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan
said. </p>
<p>Madigan, in a press statement issued yesterday, said that
between 2001 and 2004 the companies made bad batches of the
anti-nausea drug Kytril, which is used by chemotherapy patients;
Avandamet, a drug used to treat diabetes; the antidepressant
Paxil CR and the antibiotic topical treatment Bactroban. </p>
<p>Consumers put their faith in drug companies that the
medications they purchase are safe, the attorney general said.
My office will not tolerate pharmaceutical companies cutting
corners at the potential expense of consumer health. </p>
<p>Madigan, in a complaint and settlement agreement she said
was filed yesterday at the Illinois state courthouse in Chicago,
accused the drug companies of unfair and deceptive practices. </p>
<p>There is no current cause for concern for patients, she
said, adding that the products in question had previously been
recalled or have since expired and the manufacturing facility
has closed. </p>
<p>The company chose to settle the matter, which it
initially disclosed in its 2010 fourth quarter results and its
2010 annual report, to avoid the expense and uncertainty of
protracted litigation and trial, according to a
GlaxoSmithKline statement issued yesterday. </p>
<p>The drugmaker, which has offices in Philadelphia and
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, didn''t admit to any
wrongdoing or liability. The company is a unit of London-based
GlaxoSmithKline Plc. (GSK) </p>
<p>Railroads Lose Supreme Court Fight Over Worker Suits </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court, ruling against a CSX Corp. (CSX) unit,
made it easier for railroad industry workers to win lawsuits
blaming their company for injuries they suffered on the job. </p>
<p>The justices, voting 5-4, yesterday upheld a $184,250 award
to a locomotive engineer who said CSX Transportation Inc. was
responsible for a hand injury he suffered while at the helm of a
train. </p>
<p>The case centered on the test for determining whether a
railroad''s negligence was the cause of an employee''s injury. The
federal judge overseeing the CSX trial in Benton, Illinois, told
the jury that the railroad was responsible if its negligence
played a part -- no matter how small -- in bringing about the
injury. </p>
<p>CSX contended workers should have to meet the more
demanding standard, known as proximate cause, that applies in
other types of personal-injury suits. </p>
<p>In upholding the award, the Supreme Court said the Federal
Employers'' Liability Act, which governs railroad industry suits,
lets workers recover damages without meeting the proximate cause
test. </p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the court''s majority
opinion. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia,
Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito dissented. </p>
<p>The case is CSX Transportation v. McBride, 10-235, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). </p>

<p>Viacom Sues Cablevision Over Distribution of Shows on IPad </p>
<p>Viacom Inc. (VIA/B) sued Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) in federal court
in New York over the distribution of its programming on Apple
Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad. </p>
<p>Viacom seeks a court order directing the Bethpage, New
York-based cable provider to halt unauthorized distribution
of its copyrighted entertainment programming via wireless
portable devices using an iPad application. </p>
<p>New York-based Viacom also seeks unspecified damages
stemming from Cablevision''s April 2 launch of the computer
application which allows its users to get live streaming feeds
of what Viacom says is its copyrighted entertainment. </p>
<p>On April 2, 2011, despite Viacom''s repeated objections,
Cablevision launched the iPad to its cable television
subscribers, and included nineteen of Viacom''s programming
channels, in violation of the parties'' agreements and Viacom''s
intellectual property rights, Viacom said in the complaint. </p>
<p>Viacom said that both sides have since engaged in
discussions to resolve the dispute without success, while
Cablevision continues to refuse to remove Viacom''s programming
from its iPad services. </p>
<p>James Maiella, a spokesman for Cablevision, said the
company was preparing a statement and that he didn''t have an
immediate comment on the litigation. </p>
<p>The case is Viacom Inc. v. Cablevision Systems Corp. 11-CV-
4265, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Nakheel''s Ex-CEO Sues the Developer for Breach of Contract </p>
<p>Nakheel PJSC''s former chief executive officer, Chris
O''Donnell, is suing the company for breach of contract in the
Dubai World Special tribunal. </p>
<p>The CEO, who quit earlier this month after five years at
the developer''s helm, filed a lawsuit June 22 without saying how
much he''s seeking, according to court records. Nakheel has 14
days to acknowledge the claim. </p>
<p>Nakheel, which built palm tree-shaped islands off Dubai''s
coast, is restructuring $10.5 billion of debt after the global
credit crisis caused property demand in Dubai to evaporate. Home
prices slid by more than 60 from their peak in mid-2008, forcing
developers to cancel and delay projects. </p>
<p>The tribunal''s website lists 33 cases involving Nakheel and
contractors, buyers and developers including Kleindienst
Properties Limited. The Austrian developer, which bought six
islands on Nakheel''s man-made archipelago shaped as a world map,
was sued by Nakheel on June 12 for breach of contract, the
court''s website shows. Nakheel is seeking $199 million. </p>
<p>There is a difference of opinion between ourselves and
Nakheel on the amount due for the islands purchased by the
Kleindienst Group, and the time frame in which this is due,
Kleindienst said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Josef Kleindienst, CEO at the family-owned company, has
acknowledged the claim and the case will go to court, the
company said. Meanwhile, work on Kleindienst''s 3.1 billion-
dirham ($840 million) project has been suspended. </p>

<p>HSBC Seeks Dismissal of $9 Billion Madoff Trustee Lawsuit </p>
<p>HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), seeking dismissal of a $9 billion
lawsuit by the trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff''s firm, said
he isn''t allowed by law to bring such cases on behalf of the
confidence man''s former customers. </p>
<p>Irving Picard, the trustee, sued HSBC and a dozen so-called
feeder funds for $9 billion in December, accusing them of aiding
Madoff''s fraud. Yesterday, Picard and HSBC, which acted as
custodian for the funds, argued in front of U.S. District Judge
Jed Rakoff in Manhattan over whether the case should be
dismissed. </p>
<p>Picard is mistakenly suing HSBC for damages on the theory
that it had a duty to investigate the Madoff fraud and that it
hurt all of the con man''s investors by not doing so, said Thomas
Moloney, a lawyer for the bank. </p>
<p>HSBC owes no duty to these customers, Moloney said.
HSBC was not the watchman for all Madoff investors, he said. </p>
<p>Rakoff said he will rule on HSBC''s request by the end of
July. The dispute pits Europe''s biggest lender against the
lawyer liquidating Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC,
which perpetrated the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.
Picard has filed 1,000 lawsuits in bankruptcy court to recover
$90 billion from banks and former Madoff investors who allegedly
profited from the fraud. </p>

Plc, 11-cv-0763, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New

<p>Carl Icahn Suit Against Raynor, R2 Investments Dismissed </p>
<p>Carl Icahn''s lawsuit seeking at least $100 million from
Texas hedge-fund promoter Geoffrey Raynor, his R2 Investments
LDC and others was dismissed by a New York state judge. </p>
<p>In the suit, filed in February 2010, Icahn said Raynor
interfered with a $2 billion bond offering by Icahn Enterprises
LP and other Icahn companies. Justice Eileen Bransten in
Manhattan yesterday dismissed the case, which included claims of
tortious interference with contract, libel and abuse of process. </p>
<p>Raynor and Icahn formed a partnership in 2001 to acquire
debt securities issued by Federal Mogul Corp., which was in
bankruptcy at the time, Bransten said in her decision. After a
dispute over the right to purchase some Federal Mogul stock,
Raynor made a securities filing in January 2010 disclosing a
suit commenced the same day by Raynor-affiliated Nineteen
Eighty-Nine LLC seeking to impose a constructive trust on
the shares, Bransten said. </p>
<p>Icahn, 75, said the timing of the regulatory filing and
suit lowered demand for the bond offering. He sued Raynor, R2,
Nineteen Eighty-Nine and five other defendants. </p>
<p>A message left with Icahn''s secretary wasn''t returned. A
message left with attorneys for Raynor also wasn''t returned. </p>

<p>Anglo Irish Says U.S. Assets Sale, Merger Are Sovereign'' Acts </p>
<p>Anglo Irish Bank Corp. defended a sale of its U.S. loan
portfolio that was ordered by the Irish government and its
acquisition of Irish Nationwide Building Society, calling them
non-commercial, sovereign acts. </p>
<p>Anglo Irish Bank made the statement in a letter June 22 to
U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe in Manhattan, who had
directed the bank to disclose whether it has sold substantial
commercial assets in the U.S. and whether a sale of its
remaining U.S. assets was imminent. The letter was obtained by
Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Fir Tree Partners, a New York investment firm, sued Anglo
Irish Bank in February, claiming it owns $200 million of notes
the bank issued in the U.S. Fir Tree seeks an order blocking
Anglo Irish Bank from transferring any U.S. assets out of the
country so it can force the bank to honor its debt obligations. </p>
<p>Fir Tree sent a letter to the judge on June 20 asking for
an expedited hearing on the issue. </p>
<p>Anglo Irish Bank said the sale of its U.S. assets and its
acquisition of Irish Nationwide Building Society in the next
week or two weeks had been reported in the global press and
were consistent with and anticipated in statements it has made
to the court, according to yesterday''s letter. </p>
<p>Paul Smith, a lawyer for Fir Tree, and Walter Stuart, a
lawyer for Anglo Irish Bank, didn''t return calls for comment
after regular business hours yesterday. </p>
<p>The case is Fir Tree Capital Opportunity Master Fund LP v.
Anglo Irish Bank Corp., 11-CV-0955, Southern District of New

<p>Strauss-Kahn Accuser Hires French Lawyer to Find Other Victims </p>
<p>The woman who accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn of attempted
rape and sexual assault in New York hired a Paris lawyer to look
for women in France who may have been victimized by the former
International Monetary Fund chief. </p>
<p>Kenneth P. Thompson, a former federal prosecutor who is
representing the accuser in New York, hired Thibault de

yesterday. </p>
<p>I am working with him, I am the contact for his firm in
France, notably to see if there exist other victims of Mr.
Strauss-Kahn, de Montbrial said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Strauss-Kahn, 62, was arrested May 14 and later indicted on
seven counts, including criminal sex act, attempted rape, sexual
abuse, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. If convicted
of the top charges, he faces as long as 25 years in prison. He
has pleaded not guilty. </p>
<p>He allegedly attacked a housekeeper, a 32-year-old from
Guinea, at the Midtown Manhattan Sofitel on May 14, grabbing her
breasts and trying to pull down her pantyhose, prosecutors said
in court papers. The former IMF chief attempted to rape her and
forced her to perform oral sex, according to the indictment. </p>
<p>De Montbrial represented former Renault SA employee
Matthieu Tenenbaum in his wrongful-firing case over false claims
he sold information on the automaker''s electric-car program. De
Montbrial declined to say when he was hired or comment on how
information he uncovers would be used. </p>

<p>A hearing officer recommended the state issue permits to
haul the equipment from the port of Lewiston to the Montana

<p>The hearing officer found no errors were made in granting
the initial permit to haul the equipment through the state,
according to the statement. The recommendation can be appealed
to the hearing officer within 14 days and then appealed to the

Dodgers Will Pay 10% for Bankruptcy Loan From JPMorgan''s Highbridge</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, which asked
at least seven lenders for money before filing for bankruptcy
today, will pay 10 percent interest on a loan from JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)''s Highbridge Capital Management LLC, plus fees. </p>
<p>The one-year $150 million loan from Highbridge, a New York-
based hedge fund, sets interest at the London interbank offered
rate, or Libor, plus 7 percent, providing that Libor is no lower
than 3 percent, according to a court filing today. </p>
<p>The team can draw $60 million initially and $90 million
later. Highbridge, which will have first claim on the Dodgers''
assets, gets a $4.5 million deferred commitment fee, plus 0.5
percent of the unused part of the loan, payable monthly. </p>
<p>This is a very expensive loan for an entity like the
Dodgers, said Lynn LoPucki, a bankruptcy-law professor at the
University of California at Los Angeles. If the assets are
worth the $500 million the debtor claims, repayment is virtually
certain. </p>
<p>The team listed assets of $500 million to $1 billion in its
Chapter 11 petition. </p>
<p>Darin Oduyoye, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment.
Dodgers assistant treasurer Jeffrey Ingram said in a court
filing that the team had no adequate alternative, as only
Highbridge was willing to provide a commitment for financing
of a sufficient amount and within the debtors'' time
constraints. </p>
<p>Coyotes Loan </p>
<p>The Phoenix Coyotes paid 7 percent for a bankruptcy loan in
2009 with no fees to the lenders, said Chip Bowles, a bankruptcy
lawyer at Greenebaum Doll  McDonald PLLC in Louisville,
Kentucky. </p>
<p>Companies in some industries paid more than the Dodgers for
bankruptcy loans. Borders Group Inc. this year paid as much as
13.5 percent for some loans, and Trico Marine Services Inc. last
year paid 14 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Sbarro Inc. and Great Atlantic  Pacific Tea Co. paid 8.75
percent for some loans in the past two years, according to
Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Highbridge may be charging a higher interest rate because
of the special nature of a sports team, said Stephen Lubben,
a bankruptcy professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in
Newark, New Jersey. </p>
<p>The assets are not worth as much to a lender, because the
league can veto sales, he said. </p>
<p>The Texas Rangers, sold last year to a group including Hall
of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan, needed approval of its bankruptcy
auction from owners of at least 23 of the 30 Major League
Baseball teams, as well as Commissioner Bud Selig. </p>
<p>Auction Delayed </p>
<p>The Coyotes had to delay the team''s 2009 auction after the
National Hockey League said Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf
and another bidder needed more time to improve their offers. The
NHL was the buyer in the end, paying $140 million. </p>
<p>The Coyotes'' owner wanted to sell against the will of the
league, Bowles said. Similarly, the Dodgers, in  discussions
in court filings of a television-rights deal with News Corp. (NWS)''s
Fox Sports that was rejected by the league, were clearly
saying between the lines the Fox contract was a good deal, he
said. </p>
<p>The Dodgers, which lost money last year as attendance
dropped and the team failed to reach the playoffs, have $40
million in payroll obligations on June 30 and July 1, according
to Ingram. At least four potential lenders of the seven
approached reviewed the team''s finances, and only Highbridge
agreed to provide all it needed, he said in the filing. </p>
<p>Deal Rejected </p>
<p>After the TV rights deal with Fox Sports fell through on
June 20, the team stepped up its effort to find other sources of
money, Ingram said. </p>
<p>Selig last week said the 17-year deal with Fox, which
Dodgers owner Frank McCourt said would have assured financial
stability for the team, would harm the franchise in the long
term. Baseball took over the team''s business operations about
two months ago. </p>
<p>The Dodgers have five bank accounts with Bank of America
Corp. (BAC), according to filings. Manny Ramirez, a former Dodgers
player, is the largest unsecured creditor with about $21 million
owing on a contract, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Andruw Jones is owed $11.1 million and Hiroki Kuroda $4.5
million. Rafael Furcal has a claim of $3.7 million. The Chicago
White Sox team is owed $3.5 million. </p>
<p>McCourt, a Boston real-estate developer who unsuccessfully
bid for the Boston Red Sox, bought the Dodgers from Rupert Murdoch''s News Corp. (NWSA) in 2004 for $430 million. He is fighting
with his ex-wife, Jamie, over ownership of the team. A judge
last year invalidated an agreement that Frank McCourt claimed
made him the sole owner of the Dodgers, leaving the team''s
ownership in limbo. </p>
<p>The case is In re Los Angeles Dodgers LLC, 11-12010, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is
increasing its Brazil workforce by about 20 percent this year to
expand in an economy that''s growing more than twice as fast as
the company''s home market. </p>
<p>The Brazilian unit, which raised headcount to about 300
from 200 last year, plans to invest during 2011 in research,
asset management, private banking, sales, investment banking and
trading, the group''s president, Valentino D. Carlotti, said in a
video-conference interview last week from Goldman Sachs''s
headquarters in New York. </p>
<p>We have been growing a lot in Brazil over the past couple
of years, but we still see significant opportunities to continue
to build, said Carlotti, 45, who plans to hand leadership of
the unit to Alejandro Vollbrechthausen, 42, over the next
several months. We have robust growth plans for every product
and division. </p>
<p>U.S. and international banks are competing against Brazil-
based companies such as Banco Itau BBA SA and Banco BTG Pactual
SA, which have used their stronger local contacts to squeeze out
foreign firms. Investment-banking fees in Brazil were about $1
billion to $1.5 billion last year industrywide, two dealmakers
said last month, asking not to be identified because they aren''t
authorized to speak publicly. </p>
<p>Full Service </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs only completed its strategy to become a full-
service bank in Brazil in late 2009, after two failed attempts
to buy local firms. In 1998, Goldman Sachs tried to purchase
Banco de Investimentos Garantia SA, which was acquired by Credit
Suisse Group AG. (CSGN) Seven years later it sought to purchase Banco
Pactual SA, a top investment bank later acquired by UBS AG.
Pactual was sold back to BTG Partners in 2009 and is now BTG
Pactual. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse has continued to grow in Brazil, and in 2007
acquired a majority stake in Brazilian asset manager Hedging-
Griffo for 358 million Swiss francs ($427 million). </p>
<p>Investment banks are turning to emerging markets to tap
faster growth. After expanding 7.5 percent last year, the
highest growth in more than two decades, Brazil''s economy is
expected to grow 4 percent this year, according to central bank
estimates. U.S. central bankers said the economy will expand 2.7
percent to 2.9 percent this year, down from forecasts ranging
from 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent in April. </p>
<p>Convertible Debt </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs didn''t make the top 10 in any Brazil
investment-banking categories in 2009 and 2010, excluding
international bonds, according to Bloomberg data. The firm,
which doesn''t separately disclose Brazil revenue or profits,
said its strategy in the country is to focus on more complex
products that generate higher profit margins, such as
convertible debt and receivables securitization. </p>
<p>They''re going to have a hard time getting market share
from us because we have long-term, well-established
relationships and we have a big balance sheet locally, Renato Lulia-Jacob, Banco Itau BBA International SA''s head of corporate
banking for North America, Europe and Asia, said in an interview
in London today. </p>
<p>Itau BBA is the leading adviser of equity sales so far this
year in Brazil, and ranks fifth in mergers and acquisitions,
according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>We are not planning to do plain-vanilla credit, Daniel
Wainstein, who heads investment banking for Goldman Sachs in
Brazil, said in a joint interview with Carlotti from Brazil. </p>
<p>Banking Team </p>
<p>Wainstein''s team grew to 40 bankers this year after the
firm hired 10 people, including managing director Rodolfo Soares, previously head of fixed income at Banco J. Safra SA.
Soares is the head of a new division of structured credit. The
bank also hired Marcelo Bernal from HSBC Holdings Plc, where he
was responsible for bond and syndicated-loan transactions. </p>
<p>Zurich-based Credit Suisse has about 36 investment bankers
in the country, and Banco BTG has 49. </p>
<p>Compared with Goldman Sachs''s 300 total employees in
Brazil, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-biggest U.S. bank, has
630, including its investment bankers, and plans to almost
double that figure. Bank of America Corp. (BAC), No. 1 in the U.S.,
employs about 400 in Brazil. </p>
<p>Among Goldman Sachs''s current deals in Brazil is a 300
million reais ($189 million) convertible-bond sale by Minerva
SA, Brazil''s fourth-largest meat producer. The structure allows
the company to sell debt without increasing leverage because the
securities become equity when they mature. Investors receive a
set coupon until the conversion, and then can benefit if the
shares gain. </p>
<p>Private Equity </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is also betting that its advisory work for
private-equity clients who want to get into Brazil will generate
investment-banking business and help boost fees from initial
public share sales and acquisitions, Wainstein, 41, said. </p>
<p>The volume of MA transactions reached 85 billion reais so
far this year, compared with 97 billion reais in the same period
last year, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn said
earlier this month that China was the No. 1 country for new
hiring at the firm, and the top three would also include India
and Brazil. </p>
<p>Brazil, Latin America''s biggest economy, is key for Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein''s strategy to be Goldman
Sachs in more places, said Wainstein, who along with Andre
Laport, head of equities for Latin America, became the first
Brazilian partners at Goldman Sachs last year. </p>
<p>Brazilian Shares </p>
<p>With Brazilian stocks underperforming comparable shares in
most other emerging markets, some medium-sized Brazilian
companies are looking instead to private-equity companies for
financing. </p>
<p>The Carlyle Group, one of the world''s largest private-
equity managers, raised $1 billion to invest in South American
companies with an emphasis on Brazil, according to a June 15
statement. The leveraged-buyout firm closed a $776 million fund
that will target deals across South America with a focus on
Brazil, and a 360 million real pool raised with Banco do Brasil
SA dedicated to Brazilian deals. </p>
<p>We have seen a number of private-equity firms setting up
platforms in Brazil and actively looking at opportunities,
Wainstein said in a phone interview on June 1. Given our
global relationships with these firms and other long-term
oriented investors, we have been close to this dynamic and we''ve
been providing them with opportunities and ideas and liaising
them with our clients in Brazil. </p>
<p>Initial Share Sales </p>
<p>The bank is currently managing two initial public offerings
of companies that are controlled by private-equity firms.
Technos SA, a watchmaker, hired Goldman Sachs as joint lead-
manager and bookrunner with Credit Suisse. Itau BBA is leading
the group. Private-equity firm DLJ South American Partners owns
39.9 percent of Technos, while local asset manager firm Dynamo
has a 32 percent stake. Switzerland-based private-equity firm
Partners Group owns about 5.6 percent of the company and
executives and other investors own the remaining stake. </p>
<p>Qualicorp SA, a Brazilian health-insurance broker
controlled by Carlyle, is also listing shares. Goldman Sachs and
Banco Bradesco BBI are the bookrunners, and Bank of America
Merrill Lynch is leading the group. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is climbing in investment-banking rankings in
Brazil, and is back among the top 10 advisers of mergers and
acquisitions and equity sales so far this year for the first
time since 2008, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Telefonica Deal </p>
<p>The firm''s role in the second-biggest transaction so far
this year was to advise Telefonica SA (TEF), a longtime client that
simplified its corporate structure in Brazil in a deal that
included a merger between its fixed and mobile-phone assets. The
assets involved in the restructuring were valued at nearly 9
billion reais, according to Bloomberg data. Banco Santander SA
and HSBC also worked with Telefonica. </p>
<p>The bank worked on only one of the 20 equity sales that
have been priced this year, though it has been hired by two
companies to work on offerings that are expected to be priced in
the second half and would be among the biggest this year,
according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>In the first quarter, Goldman Sachs rose to the top of
Brazil''s MA rankings. It''s in fourth place year-to-date,
compared with 20th for all of last year. Banco Santander SA is
the top-ranked bank. Goldman Sachs climbed to ninth among
underwriters of equity offerings, from 11th last year. </p>

<p>NYSE Amex''s sale of almost 53
percent of its options market to seven brokers won regulatory
approval more than 21 months after it was first announced. </p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the
joint venture that gives 52.8 percent of that options market to
brokers including units of Citadel LLC and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) in exchange for sending orders to the venue, according to a
notice dated June 24. NYSE Amex is owned by exchange operator
NYSE Euronext, which also runs another options market. </p>
<p>This will allow Amex to attract more order flow, said
Bob Fitzsimmons, Chicago-based head of derivatives for
Investment Technology Group Inc. Those large broker-dealers
now have an incentive to direct more order flow to Amex. </p>
<p>NYSE Amex''s share of total U.S. options trading rose to
13.4 percent in May from 6.1 percent in August 2009, the month
before the joint venture was announced, according to data
compiled by Chicago-based OCC. Amex is now the fourth-largest
individual market. The OCC clears all options volume. </p>
<p>The seven broker-dealer owners must send a minimum number
of options contracts to the exchange for five years and three
months, according to the agreement. NYSE Amex will adjust the
brokers'' share of the 52.8 percent each year based on whether
they meet targets tailored to each firm. No brokerage will own
more than 19.9 percent, the limit allowed by the SEC. </p>
<p>Best Owners'' </p>
<p>Our best customers are potentially our best owners,
Steve Crutchfield, chief executive officer of NYSE Amex Options,
said in an interview. This consolidates our relationship with
seven of the best order-providing firms in the industry and
allows us to work more closely with them to understand their
needs and the needs of their clients as we structure the
business. </p>
<p>Crutchfield said he expects to see additional growth in
Amex''s market share once the joint venture is completed, and
expects the deal to close in the coming days. </p>
<p>Their collective leverage in some of the businesses in
which we operate is not to be trivialized, NYSE Euronext (NYX) Chief
Executive Officer Duncan Niederauer said about the importance of
brokers to exchanges'' trading volume at a UBS conference on May
10, according to a transcript. Increasing trading volume
requires being a little creative in terms of organizational
construct, business model, et cetera, he said. </p>
<p>Citadel and Goldman Sachs will initially own 14.95 percent
each, followed by Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Citigroup Inc. (C) and TD
Ameritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD) at 5 percent each, with UBS AG (UBSN) at 4.9
percent and Barclays Plc (BARC) at 3 percent. </p>
<p>Revenue From Trading </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is the U.S. bank that
makes the most revenue from trading. Chicago-based Citadel runs
a brokerage as well as a hedge fund. Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America is the nation''s biggest bank by assets,
and Citigroup of New York is No. 3. TD Ameritrade of Omaha,
Nebraska, is the third-largest U.S. retail brokerage by client
assets. Zurich-based UBS AG (UBS) is Switzerland''s biggest bank, and
London-based Barclays is the U.K.''s third-largest lender. </p>
<p>New York-based NYSE Euronext submitted its proposal, which
it has worked on with the SEC since 2009, as competition in the
options industry intensified. Nine exchanges now trade equity
options, compared with five a decade ago. CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE)
runs the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which began trading
equity derivatives in 1973 and is now the second-largest market
operator after New York-based Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ), whose two
venues had almost 29 percent of total volume last month. </p>
<p>Selling Stakes </p>
<p>Bats Global Markets, Direct Edge Holdings LLC and Chi-X
Europe Ltd. have sold stakes in their markets in the past few
years to groups of brokers that could send them orders. Bats,
owned in part by Bank of America, Tradebot Systems Inc. and
Getco LLC, said in February it would buy Chi-X Europe and
operate it on the same technology platform as its current
European venue. Bats is based in Lenexa, Kansas. </p>
<p>The owners of Direct Edge, which is based in Jersey City,
New Jersey, include options market International Securities
Exchange, Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG), Citadel and Goldman Sachs.
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse AG, which owns ISE, said in
February it plans to buy NYSE Euronext in a deal currently
valued at $9.02 billion, according to Bloomberg data. NYSE
Euronext hasn''t said what it plans to do with ISE''s stake in
Direct Edge after the acquisition by Deutsche Boerse. </p>
<p>Vying for Business </p>
<p>Options exchanges are vying for business in an increasingly
competitive market that''s growing faster than equities. U.S.
options volume rose 8 percent last year to 3.9 billion
contracts, for an eighth-straight annual record, OCC said.
Average daily U.S. equities volume last year was 8.5 billion
shares, down from 9.8 billion in 2009, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>NYSE Amex will retain regulatory control over the options
market and will have the right to buy some or all of the equity
stakes of the seven brokers in 10 years. The deal with the
brokers doesn''t affect the ownership of NYSE Amex''s equities
market, although they use the same regulatory license to operate
their exchanges. </p>
<p>We''re very pleased with the market share growth we''ve
seen on Amex over the last 18 months, Crutchfield said. We
hope it turns out to be a good investment for our partner
firms. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is updating its
online corporate software offerings to include a full Internet-
based version of Office 2010 for the first time, an effort to
stave off competition from Google Inc. (GOOG) for business accounts. </p>
<p>The Office 365 suite of programs is available today in 40
markets, Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said at an event
in New York. Software will cost small businesses $6 a user each
month for a package with programs like Office Web Apps and
Exchange e-mail software, Microsoft said. For an additional $12
a month, companies can add a full version of Office, including
Word and Excel programs. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is trying to keep
Google''s office-productivity software, called Apps for Business,
from making further inroads with corporate and government
clients. The two companies are fighting for customers who want
more applications hosted in the so-called cloud -- on a network
rather than a hard drive. The full online version of Office
follows last year''s release of the more basic Office Web Apps. </p>
<p>Financially, it will be a while before Office in the
cloud becomes meaningful, but it provides another delivery
mechanism for some of Microsoft''s mainstream products and brings
them on par with Google Apps, said Sid Parakh, an analyst at
McAdams Wright Ragen in Seattle, who recommends buying Microsoft
shares. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s Eric Kirsch plans to retire as global head of insurance asset
management, a position that involved overseeing $75 billion for
clients, according to a company spokesman. </p>
<p>Kirsch plans to leave the New York-based Goldman Sachs in
September after four years on the job, Ed Canaday, a spokesman,
said in a telephone interview. John Melvin, global head of
insurance fixed-income portfolio management, and Ellen Cooper,
global head of insurance strategy, are among executives who will
take over Kirsch''s responsibilities. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs tripled insurance general account client
assets under management while Kirsch was at the firm, according
to Canaday. The bank said this month that Mark Oldcorn and
Etienne Comon will be joining its asset-management group in
London as it looks to expand services in Europe overseeing funds
for insurers. </p>
<p>We are fully committed to the insurance asset-management
business and have a strong leadership team in place, said
Canaday. We will continue to invest in additional resources
and infrastructure to serve this very important client

<p>Kirsch joined Goldman Sachs in 2007 after overseeing about
$140 billion at Deutsche Bank AG''s insurance asset-management

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), this year''s
top adviser on corporate takeovers, appointed Jeff Urwin to be
global head of investment banking as it seeks to coordinate
operations across regions. </p>
<p>Urwin, co-head of North American investment banking since
July, will lead investment-banking coverage, capital markets and
mergers and acquisitions, wrote Jes Staley, chief executive
officer of JPMorgan''s investment bank, in an employee memo
obtained by Bloomberg News and confirmed by Tasha Pelio, a
company spokeswoman. JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. lender,
hasn''t had a global head of investment banking in years. </p>
<p>We interact in a global marketplace at a pace and along
dimensions not possible as recently as a few years ago,
Staley, 56, wrote in the memo. The opportunities to serve are
enormous, as are the challenges, and it is important that
JPMorgan''s coverage model conform to this global paradigm. </p>
<p>Urwin, 55, is among the highest-ranking JPMorgan executives
to join the New York-based firm through its 2008 acquisition of
Bear Stearns Cos. Reporting to Staley, he will help run a
business that ranks No. 1 in U.S. debt underwriting and
syndicated-loan underwriting and that has advised on $269.2
billion in takeovers this year, ahead of Morgan Stanley and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Dimon''s Expansion Goals </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has made expanding
overseas a priority as emerging markets like Brazil grow at two
and three times the pace of developed nations like the U.S. and
U.K. Investment bank head Staley laid out ambitious plans early
last year to double the bank''s market share in Asia in
the next few years. </p>
<p>We''re adding bankers, branches, and products to serve the
multinationals where they want to be served, Dimon, 55, told
investors June 2 at a conference held by Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co. in New York. If we go to China or India or Indonesia or
Malaysia, it''s not just for the business there. We''re helping
Italian companies go to Indonesia. We''re helping Indonesian
companies go to America. </p>
<p>In the memo, Staley described Urwin as a highly
experienced banker, manager and leader. </p>
<p>He has played a pivotal role in building our Americas
investment-banking franchise over the past three years, Staley
wrote. A successor for the post Urwin is vacating will be named
shortly, Staley said. </p>
<p>Urwin was co-head of investment banking at Bear Stearns,
which he joined in 1996, and head of global emerging markets at
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in New York. He and Kevin Willsey
replaced Doug Braunstein as co-heads of investment banking for
the U.S. and Canada last year when Braunstein became chief
financial officer. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, plans to cut 230 jobs in New York,
according to a filing the firm submitted to the state''s
Department of Labor. </p>
<p>The positions, which weren''t identified, will be eliminated
for economic reasons between Sept. 26 and March 31, today''s
filing shows. David Wells, a spokesman for the company in New
York, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms including Barclays Capital and Credit
Suisse Group AG have begun cutting staff as they grapple with
reduced revenue from trading stocks and bonds. In the past four
weeks, 10 analysts have lowered second-quarter profit estimates
for Goldman Sachs. The company is scheduled to report results on
July 19. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs employed 35,400 people globally at the end of
March, 300 fewer than at the end of December. While the firm''s
headquarters and biggest office are in downtown Manhattan,
Goldman Sachs doesn''t disclose how many workers are based in New
York. </p>
<p>The bank is doing most of its hiring in China, India and
Brazil, President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn told
investors on June 2. He said that the company has hired a lot
of people in Singapore and in Bangalore, India. </p>
<p>The New York State Workers Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, known as the WARN Act, became effective on
Feb. 1, 2009. The law requires private employers with 50 or more
workers in New York state to provide 90 days'' notice of a plant
closing, mass layoff, relocation, or reduction in work hours. </p>
<p>In a separate filing yesterday, Bank of New York Mellon
Corp. (BK) notified the labor department of plans to start cutting
124 jobs in its treasury services operations lockbox. The cuts
will take place in stages beginning July 1 and continue through
March 31, the filing said. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Femsa SAB agreed to pay
6.55 billion pesos ($555 million) in stock for the Coke bottling
operations of Grupo Tampico SA, marking the company''s first all-
share transaction. </p>
<p>Mexico''s largest soft-drink bottler will give closely held
Grupo Tampico 63.5 million newly issued Coca-Cola Femsa shares
valued at 103.20 pesos each, it said yesterday in a statement.
Mexico City-based Coca-Cola Femsa will also assume 2.75 million
pesos in net debt. The stock fell the most in two months. </p>
<p>The transaction would be Coca-Cola Femsa''s largest since
2003 and follows a 27.7 billion-peso share merger of Mexico''s
second- and third-largest bottlers this year to form Arca
Continental SAB. Using shares instead of cash may help persuade
more small bottlers to be acquired, Chief Financial Officer
Hector Trevino said in a telephone interview yesterday. </p>
<p>There are a lot of bottlers in Mexico and Latin America
that don''t want to get out of the business, Trevino said. On
the other hand, they are small and they see the advantages of
having bigger scale and geographic diversification. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa fell 93 centavos, or 0.8 percent, to 109.01
pesos at 4 p.m. New York time in Mexico City trading, the
biggest decline since April 26. The shares have gained 6.7
percent this year, compared with a 27 percent advance for
Monterrey, Mexico-based Arca Continental. </p>
<p>Grupo Tampico Outlook </p>
<p>Grupo Tampico expects revenue of 4.4 billion pesos and
shipments of 154 million unit cases in 2011. Coca-Cola Femsa had
2010 revenue of 103 billion pesos. Tampico-based Grupo Tampico,
in Tamaulipas state, will have earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization -- a measure of cash flow known as
Ebitda -- of 967 million pesos in 2011. </p>
<p>We believe it''s a geographical area of the country that
will have important growth and we have plans to continue growing
the business, Trevino said. </p>
<p>The acquisition boosts Coca-Cola Femsa''s leading position
in the Mexican beverage market, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Salazar said today in a conference call. Trevino told analysts
the deal may close by the end of next quarter, and will require
approval from Mexican regulators as well as from the board of
Coca-Cola Co. (KO), which owns almost a third of Coca-Cola Femsa. </p>
<p>Annual synergies should reach 180 million pesos to 220
million pesos from the Grupo Tampico deal in the next 24 months,
Trevino said today. He said in the interview that using cash to
pay off the bottler''s debt is an option. </p>
<p>Accretive to Earnings </p>
<p>The acquisition will be accretive to earnings in a year to
18 months, said Jose Castro, chief of investor relations, in a
telephone interview. </p>
<p>After purchasing Panamerican Beverages Inc. for $3.6
billion in 2003, Coca-Cola Femsa hadn''t struck a deal greater
than $100 million in three years. Investors such as Jose Miguel Garaicochea, who helps manage about $1 billion for a Banco
Santander SA unit in Mexico City, had said last month that the
company should consider acquisitions. </p>
<p>With the creation of new shares to pay for Grupo Tampico,
Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB''s ownership of Coca-Cola Femsa
will drop to 51.9 percent from 53.7 percent now and Coca-Cola
Co.''s ownership will decline to 30.6 percent from 31.6 percent.
The amount of shares traded publicly will increase to 17.5
percent from 14.7 percent, Trevino said. </p>
<p>The owners of Grupo Tampico will gain a seat on Coca-Cola
Femsa''s board, which will be expanded to 19 seats from 18. </p>
<p>Grupo Tampico became the first Coca-Cola bottler in Mexico
in 1912, according to the company website. It has 25
distribution centers in six Mexican states, including
Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosi and Veracruz. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the firm targeting a
2 percent market-share gain in fixed-income trading this year,
was burned by a wager on U.S. inflation expectations in the
second quarter, three people informed of the dealings said. </p>
<p>The bank''s interest-rates trading group lost at least tens
of millions of dollars on the trade, which the firm has been
unwinding, two of the people said, declining to be identified
because the transaction isn''t public. Mary Claire Delaney, a
Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Traders at the bank bet that inflation expectations for the
next five years would rise in Treasury markets, while forecasts
for the next 30 years would fall, according to two of the
people. Such wagers on so-called breakeven rates involve paired
purchases and short sales of Treasuries and Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities, or TIPS, in both maturities. </p>
<p>The loss is a setback for Morgan Stanley as it seeks to
boost revenue at its fixed-income trading unit, which last year
posted less than half the amount of U.S. rivals including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief Executive Officer James Gorman,
52, said in February that improving fixed-income trading
performance is his top priority. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) plans to
increase the number of private bankers in Asia by about 70
percent by the end of 2012 to tap rising wealth in the region. </p>
<p>The second-biggest U.S. bank by assets is hiring 100
advisers to wealthy Asians this year and next, adding to the 140
employed at the end of 2010, Andrew Cohen, the Hong Kong-based
chief executive officer of JPMorgan''s private banking for ultra-
high net worth individuals in Asia, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. These include bankers, global investment
specialists, wealth advisers and capital advisers. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, based in New York, joins competitors in expanding
offices in the region to win a share of the growing number of
rich Asians. Wealth in Asia, excluding Japan, is expected to
rise at about double the global rate of almost 6 percent through
the next five years, the Boston Consulting Group said in a May
31 report. Millionaires in Asia outnumbered those in Europe for
the first time in 2010, according to a report by Capgemini SA
and Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management. </p>
<p>Getting the right talent, training them and retaining
them are the biggest challenges in Asia, said Cohen, who has
been heading the Asian business since June 2010. JPMorgan is
hiring private bankers, as well as people from corporate banking,
hedge funds, private equity and consulting firms with a focus on
banking, he said. The bank is also hiring from outside Asia. </p>
<p>Asian Growth </p>
<p>The wealth of 3.3 million high-net-worth individuals in the
Asia-Pacific region climbed 12.1 percent last year to $10.8
trillion, exceeding the $10.2 trillion accumulated by 3.1
million people in Europe, according to the Capgemini/Merrill
Lynch World Wealth Report released on June 23. </p>
<p>Cohen said he''s committed to the goal given last year of
tripling the size of the Asian business in five years. </p>
<p>The forecast is for JPMorgan''s entire private banking
business, including the private wealth management unit, which
caters to individuals with investable assets of $10 million to
$30 million, and the private bank for ultra-high net worth
individuals with assets exceeding $30 million. </p>
<p>Cohen didn''t disclose the size of the private banking arm''s
assets in the region. Globally, JPMorgan''s private banking
operations manage a total of $750 billion. </p>

<p>Endemol NV investors, including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), are facing losses of more than 60
percent as the Dutch producer of the Big Brother television 
show reorganizes 2.8 billion euros ($4.1 billion) of debt amid 
the Greek crisis. </p>
<p>Endemol''s enterprise value has fallen to no more than 1.2
billion euros from 3.1 billion euros four years ago, with its
equity and junior debt becoming worthless, said two people with
knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified because
talks with creditors are confidential. </p>
<p>Shareholders such as Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi''s Mediaset SpA (MS) and Goldman Sachs are in negotiations
with lenders complicated by last week''s departure of Chief
Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz amid disagreements over Amsterdam-
based Endemol''s strategy. Concerns that Greece will default on
its debt and the slowing economic recovery have pushed up
funding costs as investors shun risky assets. </p>
<p>The market is already discounting the breach of the
covenants, said Saverio Papagno, an analyst at AZ Fund
Management in Luxembourg. All the options on the table right
now, including a debt-for-equity swap. </p>
<p>Endemol, the world''s largest independent TV producer, said
in its 2010 annual report that widening losses would cause the
company to breach its loan covenants. Marco Giordani, Mediaset''s
chief financial officer, said yesterday that the results of a
test on the latest debt ratios would be available in 45 days.
Los Angeles-based investment bank Houlihan Lokey is advising
Endemol on the reorganization. </p>

<p>Gregory Peters, head of global
fixed-income economic research at Morgan Stanley, said the
operator of the world''s largest brokerage continues to expect
inflation to rise over the next year. </p>
<p>Oil prices slid, easing market-based gauges of inflation
expectations, after the Paris-based International Energy Agency
announced on June 23 the release of 60 million barrels of oil
over 30 days from member nations'' emergency stockpiles as
fighting in Libya pares global supplies. Oil futures fell 4.6
percent on the day the announcement was made. </p>
<p>The IEA''s surprise announcement is temporary and you are
seeing that getting re-priced already, Peters said in a radio
interview on Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. It''s more of a temporary phenomenon than anything
else and we still think inflation is on the rise. </p>
<p>Bloomberg News reported yesterday that Morgan Stanley was
burned by a wager on U.S. inflation expectations in the second
quarter, citing three people informed of the dealings. The
bank''s interest-rates trading group lost at least tens of
millions of dollars on the trade, two of the people said,
declining to be identified because the transaction isn''t public.
Mary Claire Delaney, a Morgan Stanley (MS) spokeswoman, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Traders at the bank bet that inflation expectations for the
next five years would rise in Treasury markets, while forecasts
for the next 30 years would fall, according to two of the
people. Such wagers on so-called break-even rates involve paired
purchases and short sales of Treasuries and Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities, or TIPS, in both maturities. </p>
<p>Consumer Price Index </p>
<p>That is not really my area of expertise and there has
obviously been a lot of negative press, Peters said, referring
to the New York-based firm''s forecast for rates in the TIPS
market. We still believe that inflation is on the rise. </p>
<p>The consumer-price index increased 0.2 percent in May,
compared with the 0.1 percent median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News, figures from the Labor Department
showed on June 15. The so-called core measure, which excludes
more volatile food and energy costs, climbed 0.3 percent. </p>
<p>Brent oil for August settlement fell 18 cents to $112.22 a
barrel today. The European benchmark has fallen 3.5 percent in
June. It traded today at a premium of $17.18 to New York-traded
West Texas Intermediate. Crude oil in New York added 0.1 percent
to $94.88 a barrel. </p>
<p>TIPS Payments </p>
<p>The decline in crude oil prices disproportionately hurt the
value of TIPS maturing within five years because they have fewer
remaining interest payments that can benefit from a rebound in
prices. The five-year break-even rate dropped to as low as 1.76
percentage points this month on June 24 from 2.04 percentage
points at the end of May, indicating underperformance by five-
year TIPS relative to nominal Treasuries. The rate increased to
2.04 points today. </p>
<p>Despite some softer-than-expected U.S. economic data,
you''ve seen a steady rise in both core and headline
inflation, Peters said. We see that continuing throughout
the course of this year, abating somewhat next year. </p>
<p>U.S. employers in May added the fewest workers in eight
months and unemployment unexpectedly rose to 9.1 percent,
underscoring the concern of policy makers that the expansion is
failing to boost the labor market. The Federal Reserve today
completed its second round of asset purchases, known as QE2,
after buying $1.7 trillion in securities through last year,
increasing the amount of money in circulation. The Fed bought
$600 billion in Treasuries in the most recent program. </p>
<p>The Fed has kept its target rate for overnight lending
between banks at a record low range of zero to 0.25 percent
since December 2008. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is among 62

<p>The rule waiver allows Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S.
Inc., based in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, and other operators of
July 4 displays to keep drivers on duty more than the federal
maximum of 14 hours a day, according to a June 28 notice in the
Federal Register. </p>
<p>We have a very narrow window of opportunity to do our
business, said Julie Heckman, executive director of the
American Pyrotechnics Association, a Bethesda, Maryland-based
trade group for fireworks operators. We don''t get July 5. </p>
<p>Disney is the only publicly traded company getting an
exemption. Most others are small, family-owned businesses that
rely on seasonal workers to make the shows happen, Heckman said. </p>
<p>The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which
grants the exemptions, gave them to nine companies for the first
time. Disney and 52 others had them renewed. </p>
<p>One company on the list, Zambelli Fireworks of New Castle,
Pennsylvania, has staged fireworks displays in New York harbor,
Mt. Rushmore, major league baseball games and state fairs,
according to the company website. It''s producing July 4th
celebrations in Philadelphia, Phoenix, Cleveland, Kansas City,
Missouri and 16 other cities. </p>

credit. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer in Chicago today
ruled the homeowners could go forward on some of their claims
against the lender while dismissing allegations that JPMorgan
had engaged in fraudulent practices. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs'' allegations that defendant reduced or
suspended their HELOCs without adequate justification are
sufficient to state claims for breach of contract under
Minnesota, California, Texas and Delaware law, Pallmeyer said
in a 42-page decision. </p>
<p>The ruling comes in a consolidated class action, or group
lawsuit, alleging that the lender had retracted or crimped those
lines of credit without any justification for doing so. The bank
had sought to dismiss the action in its entirety. </p>

<p>Using mobile phones may not increase
the risk of brain cancer, according to a new analysis of
scientific evidence published a month after a World Health
Organization agency said the technology may cause tumors. </p>
<p>Studies from several countries have failed to show an
increase in brain tumors as many as 20 years after mobile phones
were introduced and 10 years after the technology became
widespread, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing
Radiation Protection''s committee on epidemiology wrote in
Environmental Health Perspectives, a monthly journal of the U.S.
National Institute of Environmental Sciences. </p>
<p>The findings undermine those of an International Agency for
Research on Cancer review. Concerns that the technology might be
harmful to the health of the 4.6  billion people who use cell
phones aren''t likely to be put to rest soon, because data is
limited and researchers can''t prove the complete absence of an
impact, the panel said. </p>
<p>This is a really difficult issue to research, David
Spiegelhalter, the University of Cambridge''s Winton professor of
the public understanding of risk, said in an e-mailed statement.
Even given the limitations of the evidence, this report is
clear that any risk appears to be so small that it is very hard
to detect, even in the masses of people now using mobile
phones. </p>
<p>The committee included scientists from the U.K., Sweden,
Australia and the U.S. The International Commission on Non-
Ionizing Radiation Protection sets guidelines for exposure
limits to radiation including radio-frequency fields emitted by
mobile phones. </p>
<p>Interphone Study </p>
<p>The panel reviewed all published studies that have examined
the potential link between mobile-phone use and brain tumors,
including the largest epidemiological study to date, known as
Interphone. Anthony Swerdlow, a professor of epidemiology at the
Institute of Cancer Research in London who led the review, also
oversaw one of the U.K. teams involved in the Interphone study,
which was published last year and failed to find a definite link
between mobile-phone use and certain types of brain tumors. </p>
<p>Other studies in people and animals, along with trends in
the incidence of brain tumors, suggest no increase in the risk,
although the possibility can''t be ruled out, Swerdlow said in a
statement. </p>
<p>Possibly'' Carcinogenic </p>
<p>Exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from
handsets is greater than that from phone towers and base
stations, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part
of the Geneva-based WHO, said in June. The fields are
possibly carcinogenic, the same category as diesel fuel,
chloroform and working as a firefighter, according to the IARC,
based in Lyon, France, which classifies cancer risks. </p>
<p>The IARC didn''t issue guidelines for cell-phone use and
said more study is needed, after finding some evidence for an
increased risk of glioma, or brain cancer. </p>
<p>If there are no apparent effects on trends in the next
few years, after almost universal exposure to mobile phones in
Western countries, it will become increasingly implausible that
there is a material causal effect, Swerdlow said. If there
are unexplained rising trends, there will be a case to answer. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google Inc. (GOOG) were
accused of violating a Louisiana company''s patent covering
mapping technology that helps computer users see locations in
three dimensions. </p>
<p>Officials of Transcenic Inc. contend in a lawsuit that
executives of Google, owner of the world''s biggest search
engine, and Microsoft, the world''s biggest software maker,
misappropriated technology that helps capture 3-D images of map
locations. </p>
<p>The companies'' misuse of the mapping technology has
injured Transcenic and Transcenic is entitled to recover damages
adequate to compensate for such infringement, the closely held
Lake Charles, Louisiana-based company said today in a suit filed
in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. </p>
<p>Patents covering computer-mapping software have sparked
litigation against Google, Microsoft and other companies in
federal courts around the U.S. GeoTag Inc. has filed patent-
infringement suits against 300 entities, many of which use
mapping technology made by Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
or Mountain View, California-based Google to show store
locations. </p>
<p>Katelin Todhunter-Gerberg, a Google spokeswoman, and Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman, both said they couldn''t comment on
the suit because they hadn''t yet received a copy of it. </p>
<p>Street View Targeted </p>
<p>Transcenic argues computer programs such as Google''s Street
View and Microsoft''s Streetside allow users to see 3-D images of
their destination rather than the traditional birds-eye view of
a map grid. </p>
<p>Google''s Street View system also has become a target for
lawsuits alleging the company is violating residents'' privacy
rights by collecting data from individual Wi-Fi networks. A
federal judge in California yesterday said a wiretapping suit
over the system could proceed. </p>
<p>Both Google and Microsoft have placed infringing systems
into action or service and obtain beneficial use of those
systems, lawyers for Transcenic said in the suit. </p>
<p>The patent-infringement suit also names AOL Inc. (AOL) and its
MapQwest unit as defendants. Sandy Drayton, an AOL spokeswoman,
didn''t immediately return a phone call for comment on the suit. </p>
<p>The case is Transcenic Inc. v. Google Inc., 11-cv-582, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). </p>
