&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director
Rajat Gupta was sued by a shareholder to recover &#8220;short-swing&#8221;
profit on trades allegedly based on inside tips from Gupta that
were made by Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor James Mercer, in a complaint filed today in
federal court in Manhattan, seeks to recover profit Galleon made
from trading Goldman shares within a six-month period based on
information from Gupta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Gupta was beneficial owner of these securities
because he had a pecuniary interest in the profits generated by
this trading activity,&#8221; Mercer, a resident of Kirkland,
Washington, said in the complaint. &#8220;Mr. Rajaratnam undoubtedly
paid Mr. Gupta for the Goldman Sachs inside information on which
these trades were made.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercer is seeking a judgment requiring Gupta to pay the
short-swing profits from Galleon&#8217;s trading, from June to October
of 2008. Mercer didn&#8217;t specify the amount he&#8217;s seeking in the
suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This lawsuit is completely without merit, and we will
vigorously defend against it,&#8221; Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for
Gupta, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed
an administrative proceeding accusing Gupta of passing tips to
Rajaratnam. Naftalis called those allegations totally baseless
at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Nothing Illegal&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Gupta has done nothing illegal and is confident that
these unfounded allegations will be rejected by any fair and
impartial fact finder,&#8221; Naftalis said in a statement responding
to the SEC allegations. &#8220;There is no allegation that Mr. Gupta
traded in any of these securities or shared in any profits as
part of any quid pro quo.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Canaday, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his suit, Mercer claimed he sent three letters to
Goldman Sachs, informing it of the allegations against Gupta and
demanding that the firm sue its former director. He filed his
suit after Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t respond to the letters, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC claims Gupta passed Rajaratnam information in 2008
about Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s $5 billion investment in the
firm and details of quarterly earnings at Goldman Sachs and
Procter  Gamble Co., where Gupta was also a board member. The
commission said the tips generated more than $18 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who hasn&#8217;t been charged criminally, was mentioned
many times in the Manhattan trial of Rajaratnam, which ended May
11 with his conviction on all 14 criminal counts against him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive officer of Goldman
Sachs, testified in the Rajaratnam trial that Gupta had violated
the company&#8217;s confidentiality policies by allegedly passing the
information to Rajaratnam. Gupta was also heard on recordings of
wiretapped conversations with Rajaratnam that were introduced in
the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mercer v. Gupta, 11-cv-03828, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     June 6 (Bloomberg) -- Walt Disney Co. (DIS) will cut about 200
jobs at its film division, or 5 percent of the workforce, said
two people with knowledge of the plans, as the company realigns
distribution and relies more on production from Marvel and
Steven Spielberg&#8217;s DreamWorks Studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reductions at Walt Disney Studios will be made during
the week of June 13, said the people, who asked for anonymity
because the decision hadn&#8217;t been made public. The unit has about
5,000 employees, including Marvel and Pixar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, which makes the &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8221;
movies, is shifting its release slate toward Marvel and films
distributed for Spielberg&#8217;s DreamWorks Studios, which makes its
own movies. The company restructured its worldwide distribution
operation last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production, distribution, business development and other
positions are being eliminated, the people said. Some cuts have
already been made, said one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Disney merged groups responsible for film and
television distribution. The organization is responsible for
physical and digital home-video sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank California, acquired Marvel in
January 2010 for $4.2 billion. The company bought back
distribution of two Marvel films from Viacom Inc. (VIA/B)&#8217;s Paramount,
the third &#8220;Iron Man&#8221; and next year&#8217;s &#8220;Avengers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DreamWorks, co-founded by Spielberg and Chief Executive
Officer Stacey Snider, hired Disney in 2009 to distribute about
six films a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, also owner of theme parks and ESPN, gained 2 cents
to $39.40 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have climbed 5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s
largest soft-drink maker, was recognized by the Corporate Eco
Forum for its efforts to promote sustainability, including using
recyclable plastic bottles, shifting away from refrigerants that
contribute to climate change and supporting the World Wildlife
Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum, comprising 80 companies from 18 industries with
combined annual revenue of more than $3 trillion, gave Atlanta-
based Coca-Cola and its Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent the
C.K. Prahalad Award for Global Sustainability Leadership at a
dinner event today in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has spent $60 million over the past decade to
phase out the use of refrigerants that contribute to climate
change, according to the Eco Forum. In 2009, it developed its
&#8220;PlantBottle,&#8221; which the company said is the first fully
recyclable PET plastic beverage bottle made partially from
plants, and by 2020 it expects to use bottles made completely
from materials that are recyclable and renewable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you don&#8217;t have measurable goals and hold people
accountable, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll move the needle,&#8221; Rick Frazier, Coca-Cola&#8217;s vice-president for supply chain, said in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also wants to offset all the water the company
and its bottlers use for finished beverages, and in 2009 it
replenished 22 percent of that water, helped by 250 partnerships
in 70 countries. The company has been working with the World
Wildlife Fund since 2004 to preserve threatened river basins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The work of Coke and others delivers a strong message
that these businesses care about natural resources and the
sustainable use of our planet,&#8221; said World Wildlife Fund
President and Chief Executive Officer Carter Roberts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the eight finalists nominated on the forum&#8217;s website one
was chosen by voting for the award by its 19-member advisor
board, including government, academia and non-governmental
organization representatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IBM Centennial celebration on June 15 is a birthday party for the world. It is not cake, candles, and fancy dress but more of a roll-up-you-sleeves-to-work day. Nearly 300,000 IBMers and family members have pledged at least 8 hours of service in 120 countries through over 3,500 projects that draw on IBM tools and capabilities. And new tools have been developed for ongoing use by social causes. This is not lip service; it's authentic service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps IBM's massive mobilization of company talent can inspire many more companies, small and large, to see the strategic value of leading with values and taking every opportunity to show how they make a difference. Companies rally for disasters; Procter  Gamble was praised in the New York Times for its Tide Loads of Hope and Duracell Power Relief vans contributing to flood relief efforts in the South. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why not do good when times are good?  Some already tie their celebrations to service; Novartis celebrates each anniversary of the merger that created the current company with a global day of community service, which I had suggested while a consultant on merger integration in 1996. But IBM's activities (which I know from my continuing advisory relationship) show how innovative and strategic the outcomes can be when a company commits to service on a large scale, from the top and throughout the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBMers have signed up for activities reflecting their skills and personal interests to promote ongoing activities and sustainable solutions, some of them custom-built to be launched on the Centennial. For example: Training on privacy and anti-bullying in 100 schools in Germany. A new website developed in India for the visually impaired, with a launch at 50 sites. CEO Sam Palmisano in Baltimore with the Mayor and school head helping Training for students and teachers on careers in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math) in Baltimore, with CEO Sam Palmisano, the Mayor, and the schools' chief. Access for women entrepreneurs to IBM's small-and-mid-sized business toolkit to improve business opportunities, along with IBM's new Supplier Connection website get access to large company contracts, led by Senior VP Ginni Romettty. A marketing toolkit for not-for-profits, with training by chief marketing officer Jon Iwata and others in a workshop convened at Harvard Graduate School of Education for national Boston-based organizations such as City Year and Citizen Schools.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are six strategic benefits to celebrating milestones with service to the world:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Service expresses identity. It makes purpose and values concrete and tangible. It puts a human face on a company and shows that it is a part of society, ready to contribute to positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Employees love it. It is an inspiring chance for involvement in issues that care about off the job that connect to their skills on the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Customers love it. They can join in. They see what the company stands for, and that its values are real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. It builds community inside the organization. Status differences disappear. People from different functions work together. People from many places feel part of something larger than themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. It builds community outside the organization. New connections are forged in pursuit of common goals for the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. It shows that your products and services really can make a difference. When celebrating by serving is also business-strategic, featuring the best and latest products and services, then everyone wins, from inner city schools to women entrepreneurs. Sure, it's marketing. But societal benefits come first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM is leading &#8212; some would say, tapping &#8212; an important trend. Service is hot. Holiday parties increasingly feature book collections for schools in Africa or clothing drives to outfit the homeless. I've been to birthday celebrations that include a Sunday at an inner city school building a playground and landscaping. Small efforts can accumulate to make a bigger difference, changing a culture from one of self-interest to one imbued with a sense of purpose.  And when a global giant not only champions service but demonstrates it, the immediate impact can grow beyond inspiration to impact.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC signed former
CBS News anchor Katie Couric to produce and host an afternoon
talk show, filling a void in the schedule created by Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s departure from broadcast TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yet-to-be-named show will begin in September 2012,
Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a statement.
Couric will also join ABC News, anchoring specials, doing
interviews and participating in event coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of Disney&#8217;s company-owned ABC stations carried
Winfrey&#8217;s daily talk show in cities including Chicago, New York,
Los Angeles and Philadelphia. While the show was distributed by
CBS Corp. (CBS), Disney will have to fill the void in those areas and
is in a position to market Couric to other stations that are now
Oprah-less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Katie Couric is one of television&#8217;s iconic figures and we
are thrilled to have forged such an exciting partnership with
her,&#8221; Anne Sweeney, president of Disney/ABC Television Group
and co-chair of Disney Media Networks, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couric, 54, left CBS News after five years and declining
ratings. She will share in the talk show&#8217;s revenue, two people
with knowledge of the deal said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Zucker, former head of NBC Universal, will be
executive producer of the new program. He oversaw NBC&#8217;s
&#8220;Today&#8221; show, where Couric was co-anchor from 1991 to 2006. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
sell Litton Loan Servicing LP to Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) for
$263.7 million in cash, ending the New York-based bank&#8217;s 3-1/2
year experiment in processing home-loan payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the cash payment, which may be adjusted at
closing, Ocwen will pay about $337.4 million to retire some of
Litton&#8217;s debt, according to a filing by West Palm Beach,
Florida-based Ocwen. The sale of Litton comes two months after
Goldman Sachs wrote down the value of the mortgage-servicing
business by about $200 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It really makes sense for them to sell it, and better for
them to sell it sooner rather than later,&#8221; said David B. Hilder, a New York-based analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group
LP who has a positive rating on Goldman Sachs. &#8220;They bought it
at a time when the business was easier and it looked like there
might be some insights to be gained in the mortgage market from
having a servicer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage servicing firms send out bills, collect payments
and handle foreclosures. Goldman Sachs acquired Litton, based in
Houston, and 1,000 employees at a time when investors including
billionaire Wilbur Ross and Centerbridge Capital Partners LLC
purchased mortgage servicers to help them better understand the
market, and profit from buying discounted loans. Goldman Sachs
said in March that it was considering selling Litton, and a
person familiar with the matter said the firm had failed to find
enough distressed mortgage loans to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$41.2 Billion Portfolio &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocwen is getting a portfolio of loans with about $41.2
billion in unpaid principal balance as of March 31, most of them
non-prime home mortgages, the filing said. Ocwen agreed to
finance about $2.47 billion of servicing advances associated
with the business, the statement said. Advances include the
principal, interest, taxes and insurance remittances that
servicers must make to securities trusts even when homeowners
fall behind on those payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will remain liable for fines and penalties
that could be imposed by government authorities relating to
Litton&#8217;s foreclosure and servicing practices before the deal
closes, the statement said, and Goldman Sachs will share some of
the losses arising out of claims from third parties, such as
investors and borrowers, in connection to servicing agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fines and Penalties &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litton is among the mortgage-servicing businesses
cooperating with investigations by 50 state attorneys general
into foreclosure practices. The probe began after authorities
discovered some firms used faulty paperwork to seize homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inquiries &#8220;may result in the imposition of fines or
other regulatory action,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in its quarterly
regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission on May 10. &#8220;As of the date of this filing, the firm
is not aware of foreclosures where the underlying foreclosure
decision was not warranted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litton&#8217;s value has declined since Goldman Sachs purchased
it in 2007. Most of a $220 million impairment charge that
Goldman Sachs took on assets held for sale in the first quarter
was related to Litton, the bank said. Litton&#8217;s mortgage-
servicing rights were &#8220;not material&#8221; to Goldman Sachs as of
March, having dropped from $283 million at the end of February
2008, filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping &#8216;Certain Assets&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs does not expect the sale to have any
material impact on earnings in the second quarter due to the
combination of the sales price and the impairment charge
announced in the first quarter of 2011 primarily related to
Litton,&#8221; the bank said in a statement today, adding that the
company plans to retain &#8220;certain assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs never disclosed how much it paid to acquire
Litton from Credit-Based Asset Servicing and Securitization LLC,
or C-Bass. Radian Group Inc. (RDN), the second-largest U.S. mortgage
insurer and a part owner of C-Bass, disclosed a month before the
sale was completed that the unit would be sold for about $467.9
million to an unnamed buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dealing with individual homeowners and individual
borrowers just doesn&#8217;t fit the rest of Goldman&#8217;s business,&#8221;
said Susquehanna&#8217;s Hilder. &#8220;The decline in home prices
overwhelmed any benefit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocwen&#8217;s Advance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s falling stock price this
year, Ocwen&#8217;s shares gained more than 30 percent in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading through last week. The shares
gained 7 cents to $12.57 as of 11:52 a.m. in New York. Goldman
Sachs fell 72 cents to $134.61. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocwen agreed in May 2010 to buy HomEq Servicing, a
mortgage-servicing business owned by London-based Barclays Plc (BARC),
for about $1.3 billion in cash conditional on the value of
certain assets at completion, according to a statement from
Barclays at the time. Barclays also agreed to provide Ocwen with
about $1 billion in secured financing in connection with the
deal and offered assistance in raising more funds, the statement
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays advised Ocwen on the purchase of Litton and is one
of the lenders, along with Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc, providing Ocwen&#8217;s new facility to finance
Litton&#8217;s servicing advances. Ocwen has also received a
commitment letter from Barclays to provide a senior secured term
loan facility of $575 million to finance the transaction, the
filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before buying Litton, Goldman Sachs had tried to avoid
businesses that involved the mass-market or retail customer.
David Viniar, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief financial officer, told
analysts in September 2006, more than a year before the company
bought Litton, that the firm was reluctant to buy a lender
because of the &#8220;retail concern.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs is largely an institutional business,&#8221;
Viniar said at the time. &#8220;There are different risks when you&#8217;re
touching the retail customer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks retreated for a fourth
straight day as banks led losses amid concern that economic
growth is slowing and the Federal Reserve will increase capital
requirements for the nation&#8217;s largest lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co., the largest U.S. home lender, slumped
1.3 percent after Rochdale Securities LLC&#8217;s Richard Bove cut his
recommendation on the stock. Apple Inc. (AAPL) rose 0.5 percent before
Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs may announce a new way to
access digital songs and information on smartphones and
computers. Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc. (FCX) added 0.7 percent
as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reiterated its &#8220;buy&#8221;
recommendation for the largest publicly traded copper producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell 0.3 percent to 1,296.44 at 11:42 a.m.
today. The benchmark gauge for American equities is trading at
about 12.4 times its companies&#8217; estimated operating earnings,
the cheapest valuation since September, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid
10.52 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,140.74 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The markets are getting concerned that economic growth is
not sustainable,&#8221; said Mark Bronzo, who helps manage $26
billion at Security Global Investors in Irvington, New York. &#8220;I
am surprised that the bank sector continues to underperform as
they have been laggards all year. Concerns over what the new fin
regulations will require, and no real loan growth, continue to
hold back these names.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weak Economic Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell for five weeks as slower-than-estimated
growth in jobs fueled concern that earnings forecasts are too
optimistic. Labor Department figures last week showed that
payrolls grew at the slowest pace in eight months and the U.S.
jobless rate unexpectedly climbed to 9.1 percent in May. A
separate report showed that manufacturing expanded at the
slowest pace in more than a year. Still, the SP 500 rose 3.4
percent this year through June 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial shares had the biggest decline in the SP 500
within 10 groups today, falling 1 percent. The group is the
worst-performing of the 10 main industries in the index this
year, down almost 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said on June 3 that
regulators should use capital surcharges to discourage mergers
by large banks that would increase risk without yielding
significant public benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Systemically Important&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarullo also signaled the Fed aims to use tougher capital
standards correlated to the size of a firm to curb risks posed
by &#8220;systemically important financial institutions,&#8221; or
&#8220;SIFIs.&#8221; The Fed is developing a metric for banks with more
than $50 billion in assets that gradually increases capital
requirements according to measures of systemic importance,
Tarullo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo slumped 1.3 percent to $26.50. Rochdale&#8217;s Bove
cut his recommendation to &#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;neutral,&#8221; citing a
poor economic environment, weak housing prices, slowing
manufacturing indicators and negative regulatory environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other banks retreated. Bank of America Corp. fell 2 percent
to $11.05. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) declined 1.5 percent to $40.93. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple added 0.5 percent to $345.12. CEO Jobs, on medical
leave since Jan. 17, will make his second public appearance of
2011 at Apple&#8217;s conference in San Francisco. He will preview
software updates for Apple&#8217;s iPhone, iPad and Mac, as well the

&lt;p&gt;The five-week drop in U.S. stocks has driven technology
company valuations to the lowest level in more than a decade,
making them too cheap to pass up for some of the nation&#8217;s
biggest money managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Largest Group&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group in the benchmark gauge for American
equities lost 7 percent, or about $190 billion in value, since
the market peaked on Feb. 18, falling more than any industry
outside financials. Computer stocks trade for 9.3 times reported
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
1.3 times the index&#8217;s multiple, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The ratio is the smallest since at least 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While signs of a slowing recovery and the initial public
offering of LinkedIn Corp. have spurred concern the industry has
entered a speculative bubble, the numbers show something
different. Profits will rise 35 percent faster than the SP 500
in 2011, and executives are boosting computer and software
spending, data from Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see the best supply-demand trend in technology,&#8221; said
Michael Sansoterra, a money manager at RidgeWorth Capital
Management in Atlanta, which oversees $48.5 billion including
Broadcom Corp. and Google Inc. shares. &#8220;You can measure it
pretty much every way you want and it looks attractive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeport-McMoRan gained 0.7 percent to $50.29. Goldman
Sachs reiterated its &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendation for the largest
publicly traded copper producer, saying that the company should
benefit from higher copper prices amid strong demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG) climbed 4.8 percent to $37.60. The
largest motorcycle manufacturer in the U.S. posted &#8220;solid&#8221;
sales in April and May even amid weather disruptions and an
economic slowdown, and investors should buy the stock on
weakness, Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is
recommending clients sell Mexico&#8217;s peso against the Chilean
currency because Mexico will post a &#8220;subdued pace of growth&#8221;
in the second quarter of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth in the two Latin American countries is diverging as
the slowing U.S. economy undermines Mexico&#8217;s industries,
analysts led by Robin Brooks wrote in a note to clients today.
In Chile, &#8220;favorable&#8221; credit growth and &#8220;strong&#8221; industrial
and retail sales suggest robust &#8220;growth momentum,&#8221; the
analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mexican currency may fall to 38 per Chilean peso from
39.99 today, according to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks in the European Union may have
to raise 29 billion euros ($42 billion) following this year&#8217;s
stress tests, according to a survey by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine of the 91 lenders examined may fail, London-based
analysts Jernej Omahen, Peter Oppenheimer, Christian Mueller- Glissmann and Peter Skoog wrote in a report today, citing the
average response in a survey of 113 participants from the
financial industry. Spanish, German and Greek banks would need
to raise the most new capital, according to the poll. The share
of participants saying they expect results of the stress test to
be &#8220;credible&#8221; was smaller than last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Banking Authority has said banks have to
maintain a core Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 5 percent under
this year&#8217;s scenarios. The exams include a review of how lenders
would handle a 0.5 percent economic contraction in the euro area
in 2011 as well as a 15 percent drop in European equity markets.
The publication of the results may be delayed until July, an EBA
official said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A month ahead of the results release, there appears to be
little consensus about how much might have to be raised and what
the impact will be,&#8221; the Goldman Sachs analysts said. Only 22
percent of respondents signaled they were confident in the
test&#8217;s outcome, compared with 35 percent a year ago who said the
results would be a &#8220;credible reflection&#8221; of resilience in an
economic slowdown, according to the analysts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said it hired
Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)&#8217;s Michal Szwarc to head the company&#8217;s
investment-banking unit in Poland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Szwarc, 38, who had worked at Credit Suisse since 1999,
will take up the post in Warsaw on Sept. 15, JPMorgan said today
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan seeks to expand in Poland as it
expects &#8220;further privatization, an increase of activity among
Polish clients as well as expansion of big Polish companies
abroad,&#8221; Walter Schuster, head of the bank&#8217;s central and
eastern European operations, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks including JPMorgan, Credit Suisse and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expanded equity coverage in Poland last
year as share sales reached a record $10 billion and trading
volumes increased. The Warsaw Stock Exchange has been the
fastest-growing market in central Europe in the past 10 years,
more than doubling the number of traded companies and almost
tripling daily turnover, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, a brokerage of Poland&#8217;s largest bank PKO Bank
Polski SA hired Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Wlodzimierz Giller, Erste Group
Bank AG&#8217;s Artur Iwanski and ING Groep NV&#8217;s Stanislaw Ozga as
equity analysts, doubling its research team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which has three people in its Warsaw office,
also plans to add analysts to create a local research team, the
bank said in May. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peru&#8217;s financial assets may offer a
buying opportunity if markets tumble after a victory by Ollanta
Humala in presidential elections, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humala, the former army rebel who advocates greater state
control of the country&#8217;s natural resources, claimed victory
after initial results showed he won more votes than
Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori. Local investors expect markets to
retreat if Humala wins, Ben Ramsey, an analyst at JPMorgan in
New York, wrote in a research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would see a sharp selloff in Peru as a buying
opportunity,&#8221; Ramsey wrote. &#8220;Humala would be more moderate
than expected if elected -- if anything because he can ill
afford to see Peru&#8217;s growth collapse given his intention to
fight poverty more aggressively.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declines in Peruvian assets may be limited because local
pension funds already have &#8220;underweight&#8221; holdings of bonds,
while global investors have historically low positions in the
country&#8217;s local and foreign-currency debt, Ramsey wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we acknowledge that local investors in Peru
expected a sharp selloff in the case of a Humala victory and
they are the main drivers of Peruvian assets, we do not believe
that the correction would be so severe,&#8221; Ramsey wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharp Corp., Japan&#8217;s largest liquid-
crystal-display maker, fell the most in three weeks in Tokyo
trading after JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its estimate for profit
on costs related to panel factories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp dropped as much as 3 percent, the biggest intraday
decline since May 16, to 716 yen, before trading 1.5 percent
lower at 727 yen at the 11 a.m. break on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Osaka, Japan-based company on June 3 forecast an 87
percent gain in operating profit this year to 32 billion yen
($399 million) for its LCD business as it shifts some output to
smaller panels to meet demand for smartphones and tablet
computers. Sharp&#8217;s estimate doesn&#8217;t include utilization losses
related to suspending operations at two plants in Japan as it
reallocates production, Yoshiharu Izumi, an analyst at JPMorgan,
wrote in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We revise our forecast because we count utilization
losses as an operating expense, since overseas LCD companies do
not record utilization losses as extraordinary losses,&#8221; Izumi
wrote in the report. He cut his estimate for operating profit
for the year started April 1 to 11 billion yen from an earlier
prediction of 42 billion yen. The company has a forecast of 97
billion yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Izumi also reduced his six-month price estimate for Sharp
shares by 8 percent to 690 yen. He estimated utilization losses
would be 27 billion yen at the Sakai plant and 15 billion yen at
the Kameyama facility, as the company temporarily halts output
to shift to smaller panels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp on June 3 forecast a 69 percent drop in net income to
6 billion yen this fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, formerly
Bear, Stearns  Co., was accused in a lawsuit by Syncora
Guarantee Inc. of making false and misleading statements about
loans pooled into a 2007 mortgage-backed securities transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction, known as GreenPoint Mortgage Funding Trust
2007-HE1 and insured by Syncora, resulted in more than
$168.6 million in unreimbursed insurance claims after about two
years, according to the complaint, filed yesterday in New York
state Supreme Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syncora, based in New York, won part of a federal court
lawsuit against Bear Stearns affiliate EMC Mortgage Corp. on
March 1 in an earlier case involving the transaction. Bear
Stearns and EMC are now part of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Each day the evidence continues to mount of the
egregious, widespread fraud perpetrated by Bear Stearns in
connection with its mortgage securitization business and the
catastrophic consequences for the participants in the
securitizations,&#8221; Syncora said in its new state court
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns was the underwriter of the transaction while
EMC was the sponsor. U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty in New
York ruled March 25 that Syncora notified EMC of 1,300 mortgages
with defects and asked EMC to cure them. EMC agreed to cure only
20 of the mortgages, according to that ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejected Combination &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crotty separately rejected a bid by Syncora to add
JPMorgan&#8217;s Bear Stearns unit to the federal lawsuit because that
request wasn&#8217;t filed in a timely fashion, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns securitized 9,871 GreenPoint loans in the
transaction with an aggregate principal balance of about
$666 million, according to the state court complaint. All except
for two of those were second mortgages obtained by borrowers as
revolving lines of credit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third-party consultant hired to re-underwrite samples of
the securitized loans found a 92 percent breach rate, Syncora
said in the complaint. That conclusion was based on an analysis
of 1,431 mortgage loans included in the transaction involving a
combined outstanding principal of $131 million, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer is seeking equitable and punitive damages over
claims it was fraudulently induced to participate in the
transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Syncora Guarantee Inc. v. J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC, 651566/2011, New York state Supreme Court
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naspers Ltd. (NPN), Africa&#8217;s biggest media
company, advanced to the strongest level in almost three months
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. rated it a &#8220;buy&#8221; in new
coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock increased 1 percent to 404 rand at 10:23 a.m. in
Johannesburg, the highest since March 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analysts, including Alexander Balakhnin, put
a price estimate of 528 rand on the company, which has
television and Internet interests in Africa, Brazil, Russia and
China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe investors are underestimating the value of
Naspers&#8217; Internet and pay-TV assets,&#8221; the analysts wrote in the
note dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naspers&#8217;s pay-television business is well-positioned to
remain a dominant operator in South Africa and will be able to
build up leadership in sub-Saharan Africa over the long term,
according to the analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the shares will benefit from a re-rating of
core assets and a narrowing of the holding company discount.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naspers indirectly owns 39.3 percent of Mail.ru and about
35 percent of Tencent. Goldman Sachs sees a 35 percent upside
for Mail.ru Group (MAIL), the Russian Internet service, and 4 percent
upside for China&#8217;s biggest social media Internet service Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700), according to the research note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. (AIG)&#8217;s
prospects for boosting its share price may be limited by
pressure on investments and concerns about the sufficiency of
insurance reserves, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stock could be range-bound as risks offset
opportunities in the near term,&#8221; Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Michael Nannizzi said today in a note to clients. He initiated coverage
on the bailed-out insurer with a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG Chief Executive Officer Robert Benmosche has been
seeking higher-yielding investments as low interest rates limit
returns on fixed-income holdings. He named Peter Hancock to head
the property-casualty business in March after the division said
the month before that it would take a charge of about $4 billion
because reserves were insufficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG fell 10 cents to $27.32 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The insurer has plunged 43 percent
this year, the second-biggest drop in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index. Nannizzi said the price may climb to $31 in 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility that AIG will again have to increase
reserves is among the risks facing the company, the analyst
said. Low interest rates and &#8220;credit-market volatility&#8221; may
also pressure the stock, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department has a majority stake in the
New York-based insurer, an &#8220;overhang&#8221; that may reduce the
stock&#8217;s value by 15 percent, he said. The Treasury, led by
Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, cut its stake last month to 77
percent by selling 200 million shares for $29 each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One analyst tracked by Bloomberg has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on
AIG, Paul Newsome at Sandler O&#8217;Neill  Partners LP. Three have a
&#8220;hold&#8221; rating and two advise selling the company&#8217;s shares. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) announced it found
the equivalent of 700 million barrels of oil beneath the Gulf of
Mexico, the biggest discovery in the region in 12 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimated size of the Hadrian field may increase as
drilling continues, Exxon said in a statement today. The
discovery is about 250 miles (400 kilometers) southwest of New
Orleans in 7,000 feet of water, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploratory drilling began in 2009 at the prospect and the
company had finished two wells when a record oil spill from BP
Plc&#8217;s Macondo well last year prompted a U.S. moratorium on deep-
water exploration. Exxon confirmed the find with a third well it
began drilling on March 26 under new government safety rules
designed to protect rig workers and the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Hadrian discovery is the biggest in the Gulf since
BP&#8217;s 1 billion-barrel Thunder Horse find in 1999, Mohammad
Rahman, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Houston, said
today in a telephone interview. Exxon engineers now are drilling
deeper on the third Hadrian well, which currently extends 23,000
feet beneath the sea surface, because they believe there is more
oil to be found, company spokesman Patrick McGinn said during an
interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a very, very significant find,&#8221; Rahman said.
&#8220;When a supermajor like Exxon Mobil throws a number like 700
million at you, it indicates they are very confident in what
they&#8217;ve got here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gulf Crude Production &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulf accounted for 29 percent of U.S. crude production
in 2009, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Wells in water 1,000 feet or deeper accounted for 81 percent of
the Gulf&#8217;s oil output last year, a 10-fold increase from 1991,
according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon rose as much as 2.3 percent, the most since March 21.
The shares gained 76 cents to $80.76 at 4:09 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Exxon has increased 11 percent
this year, exceeding the 10 percent rise in New York crude
futures during the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is good news not only for Exxon but for the industry
as a whole because it shows that the deep water still holds
significant promise,&#8221; Gianna Bern, founder of Brookshire
Advisory and Research Inc., a Chicago-based risk-management
adviser, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 27 rigs drilling wells in Gulf waters deeper
than 1,000 feet as of June 6, according to the Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, the Interior
Department agency that oversees offshore oil and gas activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moratorium Delay &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon could have made the discovery sooner if the
administration of President Barack Obama hadn&#8217;t been slow to
issue drilling permits after the moratorium was lifted in
October, said Representative Darrell Issa, a California
Republican who leads the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee. The Bureau of Ocean Energy issued the first new deep-
water drilling permit on Feb. 28, 4 &#189; months after the ban
formally ended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement is good news, but it cuts both
ways,&#8221; Issa said today in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Lost time is
lost opportunity and the economic price has been paid by workers
in the Gulf region and consumers at the gap pump.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly Oil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson in March
announced plans to spend $100 million a day for the next half
decade to expand the search for oil and natural gas in geologic
formations previously regarded as impenetrable. The company&#8217;s
exploration prospects extend from Greenland to Madagascar to
Vietnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hadrian field is about 85 percent oil, based on data
from three wells, the company said. Eni SpA (ENI) and Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4) also hold stakes in the prospect, according to the
release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is leasing A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S&#8217;s Maersk Developer
rig to drill into Hadrian. The 2-year-old vessel is equipped to
drill as deep as 40,000 feet beneath the sea surface, according
to RigZone, a research firm that tracks the offshore drilling
industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catchlight Energy LLC, a joint
venture of Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Weyerhaeuser Co. (WY), will supply
forest products that Kior Inc. will convert into biofuels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal announced today expands an agreement made in April
for Catchlight to purchase gasoline and diesel fuel blendstocks
from Kior&#8217;s first commercial plant, in Columbus, Mississippi.
Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Kior processes wood products to make biofuels
that can be converted at standard refineries into gasoline,
diesel or jet fuel. The $190 million Columbus facility is
expected to produce about 11 million gallons (42 million liters)
a year, and successive plants may be larger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pasadena, Texas-based company is planning to build
other plants in Mississippi, Texas and Georgia that may cost
$350 million each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kior, which is backed by backed by renewable energy
investor Vinod Khosla, filed in April to raise as much as $100
million in an initial share sale on the Nasdaq Global Market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil  Natural Gas Corp., India&#8217;s
biggest energy explorer, and GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL) are in talks to buy
part of Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s stake in Kazakhstan&#8217;s Kashagan
field, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state-owned companies have made a non-binding offer and
will evaluate the oil and gas field in the Caspian Sea before
making a final bid, one of the people said, asking not to be
identified before an official announcement. The investment needs
approval from India&#8217;s Cabinet, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONGC is searching for energy assets worldwide to make up
for a fuel shortfall at home, where Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh has targeted economic growth of more than 8 percent. The
start of production from Kashagan has been delayed to the end of
2012 from the original 2005 deadline to allow for technical
challenges in the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The field has been a non-starter,&#8221; said Sandeep Randery,
an analyst with Brics Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. &#8220;All that
investment would only make sense if production can start very
soon. Significant amounts of ONGC&#8217;s cash and resources could get
blocked if they go ahead with this large deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONGC Videsh Ltd., the explorer&#8217;s overseas unit, and GAIL,
India&#8217;s biggest gas distributor, plan jointly to buy an 8.4
percent stake from Exxon in Kashagan, valued at $5 billion, the
Hindustan Times reported today, citing an unidentified person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash in Hand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explorer had 224.5 billion rupees ($5 billion) of cash
and near cash and GAIL had 21.3 billion rupees as of March 31,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONGC fell as much as 2.2 percent to 270.40 rupees and was
at 272.15 rupees at 12:02 p.m. in Mumbai trading. The stock has
declined 15 percent this year compared with a 10 percent drop in
the benchmark Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONGC Videsh Managing Director Joeman Thomas didn&#8217;t answer
two calls to his mobile phone. GAIL Chairman B.C. Tripathi&#8217;s
mobile phone was switched off and he couldn&#8217;t be reached for
comment on his office telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon executives couldn&#8217;t be reached at the company&#8217;s press
office in Kazakhstan and a voice mail left at its Singapore
office wasn&#8217;t immediately answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, partners in the Kashagan venture led by Eni SpA (ENI)
agreed to pay higher royalties and cede shares to state-run
KazMunaiGaz National Co. after the government criticized cost
overruns and delays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production Target &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KazMunaiGaz holds a 16.8 percent stake in Kashagan, as do
Eni, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), Exxon and Total SA (FP), according to the
website of their North Caspian Operating Co. venture.
ConocoPhillips (COP) holds 8.4 percent and Japan&#8217;s Inpex Corp. (1605) has
7.56 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kashagan, operated by Eni, is expected to produce 109.5
million barrels a year, or 300,000 barrels a day, by 2014,
according to KazMunaiGaz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONGC lost a bid to buy Exxon&#8217;s stake in an Angolan oil
field in March and has lagged behind its Chinese rivals as the
world&#8217;s most populous nations seek overseas assets to boost
energy security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explorer plans to increase investments in Kazakhstan
after agreeing to buy a 25 percent stake in the Satpayev
exploration block there, Chairman A.K. Hazarika said May 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONGC Videsh lost 11.8 billion rupees in the 15 months ended
March 2010 because of lower production from its Russian fields
operated by unit Imperial Energy Corp., the government auditor
said March 24. Production of 15,803 barrels a day of oil from
the Imperial fields was less than the estimated 35,000 barrels a
day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial was bought by ONGC for 1.4 billion pounds ($2.3
billion) in a transaction completed in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s stockpile of
copper and ownership of warehouses for goods traded on the
London Metal Exchange won&#8217;t be probed for market violations,
Britain&#8217;s antitrust regulator said, citing a lack of evidence
and jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. parliamentary committee that sought the review
didn&#8217;t give proof that certain &#8220;large dealers&#8221; on the exchange
were undermining the market by owning warehouses, the U.K.
Office of Fair Trading said in a May 27 letter posted on the
Science and Technology Committee&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the light of the range of options that appear to be
available to companies that wish to arrange trades on the London
Metal Exchange, we do not consider there to be any obvious
competition issues,&#8221; the watchdog said in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange last year handled $11.6 trillion in contracts,
offering trading in metals from copper to cobalt to steel. In
May, the committee said it was concerned about allegations made
by other traders at hearings reviewing the country&#8217;s
&#8220;strategically important metals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other allegations that New York-based JPMorgan &#8220;could
distort commodity markets&#8221; by owning 50 percent of the stock of
copper as part of a creation of an exchange-traded fund fall
under the jurisdiction of Britain&#8217;s Financial Services
Authority, the OFT said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokeswoman, Jennifer Zuccarelli, said in an e-
mail the company declined to comment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LME Response &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggestions that &#8220;ownership of a warehousing company
implies anticompetitive behavior is unjustified and completely
out of context,&#8221; LME spokeswoman Miriam Heywood said today in
an e-mail. The practice &#8220;is not new and there are clear and
robust regulations in place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 400 warehouses in about 35 countries handle metal
traded on the exchange, and JPMorgan&#8217;s Henry Bath unit has
warehouses in 14 locations, the OFT said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most reserves of metals from lithium used in batteries to
cobalt for medical implants are &#8220;unlikely to run out over the
coming decades,&#8221; according to the committee&#8217;s report. &#8220;The
perception of scarcity may lead to increased speculation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM) President
David Kenny said U.S. companies need to be more vigilant with
network security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such businesses should be investing more time and money
into security measures to keep pace with the growth of the
Internet and the explosion of cloud technology, he said in an
interview at Bloomberg&#8217;s New York headquarters. Security is a
&#8220;very fast-growing&#8221; part of Akamai, and most cyber attacks on
the U.S. are coming from outside the country, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not sexy,&#8221; Kenny said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like buying
insurance. Really smart hackers have had a decade to figure out
how to hack firewalls.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai, which provides server space that helps websites
load faster, is striving to reach annual sales of $10 billion,
Kenny said. The company is focusing on cloud security, or
monitoring data delivered over the Internet. Akamai doesn&#8217;t have
enough developers to keep up with the growth in cloud and the
increasing customer demand, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, fell 22 cents to
$30.04 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares have declined 36 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and the Ritz-
Carlton Hotel Co. are making a run for American Express Co. (AXP)&#8217;s
affluent clients with the hotel&#8217;s first rewards program targeted
at value-minded luxury customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ritz-Carlton Rewards card will give points as well as
room upgrades and other services at the hotel&#8217;s roughly 75
worldwide locations, according to executives of the two
companies. The card, which carries the Visa Inc. (V) brand, has an
annual fee of $395 and an interest rate of prime plus 11.99
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perks include access to JPMorgan&#8217;s concierge service,
currently available only to the New York-based company&#8217;s
wealthiest customers in its private bank, as well as access to
about 600 first-class airport lounges and $200 toward baggage
fees and other incidentals on flights on all major airlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We found out in 2008 and 2009 that people wanted more
value,&#8221; Herve Humler, president and chief operations officer of
Ritz-Carlton, said in an interview before announcing the
program. The hotel company, based in Chevy Chase, Maryland,
started its first rewards program in September and has about
100,000 members who are being offered the card, Humler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications are also being taken online. The bank is
targeting prime and &#8220;super-prime&#8221; customers, those who have
the highest credit scores and incomes among borrowers, said Tina
Chen, who is running the Ritz-Carlton rewards card program for
JPMorgan. Cardholders will be awarded 50,000 Ritz-Carlton points
after their first purchase, which can be redeemed for a one-
night stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AmEx, the biggest credit-card issuer by purchases,
dominates the market for affluent consumers. Its customers spend
about three to four times more than those who use Visa and
MasterCard Inc. credit cards, AmEx has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan rose 59 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $40.98 at 4:15
p.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, is using
its technology knowledge to help preserve medieval art in a bid
to gain clients seeking to make their buildings more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is installing sensors at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
in New York that will monitor room temperature, humidity and
chemicals and automatically make adjustments to preserve art,
the company said in a statement. The project is starting in the
museum&#8217;s Cloisters branch, which houses medieval art, and will
later expand to the rest of the museum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is part of the Armonk, New York-based company&#8217;s
bid to digitally monitor buildings -- and everything from
traffic and utilities to hospitals -- to make them more
efficient. The initiative, coined Smarter Planet, is expected to
generate $10 billion in sales for IBM by 2015. The global market
for managing buildings specifically should more than triple to
$10.2 billion in that time frame, according to Framingham,
Massachusetts-based research firm IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s sensors at the museum will detect humidity and
temperature, as well as other elements, such as when a door
opens, lights change, or when an air duct starts corroding and
emits chemicals, said Dave Bartlett, who heads the Smarter
Buildings program for IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Years of Preservation&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s immediate,&#8221; Bartlett said in a telephone interview
yesterday. &#8220;Every minute you can maintain the optimum
condition, you&#8217;re putting years of preservation on that. Every
minute you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re adding pressure on that piece of art.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the project expands to the rest of the museum, the
company expects to work with others on similar technology, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also announced its building-management software, which
tracks a structure&#8217;s boilers, water pipes and outside
temperatures to monitor energy use and predict needed
maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if the air conditioning and the heat are on,
the software will detect that and determine which needs to be
shut down, Bartlett said. If a fan is working overtime, an alert
will pop up to check the area and see if a nearby fan needs to
be replaced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s like tuning. As we work and live with these
buildings, we can do this in real-time,&#8221; Bartlett said.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the huge opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When IBM used it at some of its buildings in Rochester,
Minnesota, it saved 8 percent in energy costs, according to the
statement. The software, which is priced per square-foot, is
available July 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 50 cents to $164.84 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 12 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks advanced, snapping a six-
day decline, as the trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed amid
record exports and consumer confidence improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
economic growth rose 1 percent. Mosaic Co. (MOS) and CF Industries
Holdings Inc. (CF) paced gains among fertilizer producers, climbing
at least 4.1 percent, after the government reduced its corn-crop
estimate. American International Group Inc. (AIG) advanced 2.9 percent
as Deutsche Bank AG recommended buying the shares. Brown-Forman
Corp. (BF/A) added 2 percent after the maker of Jack Daniel&#8217;s whiskey
reported earnings that beat analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index gained 0.7 percent to
1,289.02 at 4 p.m. in New York. The benchmark gauge yesterday
fell to 12.1 times its companies&#8217; forecast operating earnings,
the cheapest valuation since August, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 75.42
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,124.63 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stock market got oversold,&#8221; said James Dunigan,
chief investment officer in Philadelphia for PNC Wealth
Management, which oversees $110 billion. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got some
positive news against the string of poor economic data of the
last few weeks. Earnings are still pretty strong. There&#8217;s value
out there if you want to build a long-term position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 yesterday completed its longest slump since
February 2009 on concern the economy is slowing. A report last
week showed that payrolls grew at the slowest pace in eight
months. The benchmark equity index doubled from its March 2009
low to 1,363.61 on April 29, its highest level since June 5,
2008, as earnings topped estimates for nine straight quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade Deficit Narrows &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks rose today as a report showed that the U.S. trade
deficit unexpectedly narrowed in April, reflecting a plunge in
auto and oil imports combined with record exports. The gap
shrank 6.7 percent to $43.7 billion, the lowest since December,
Commerce Department figures showed. Exports increased 1.3
percent to $175.6 billion, boosted by sales of fuel oil,
petroleum products and computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate report showed that consumer confidence rose last
week for the third consecutive time as lower gasoline prices
lifted Americans&#8217; outlook on their finances. The Bloomberg
Consumer Comfort Index climbed to minus 45.9 in the period to
June 5, the best showing since the end of April, from the prior
week&#8217;s minus 47.1. Across income groups, sentiment improved the
most among those making less than $50,000 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark indexes advanced even as initial jobless claims
unexpectedly rose by 1,000 to 427,000 last week, the Labor
Department said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected
a drop to 419,000, according to the median forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;200-Day Average &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s rally in stocks also happened after the SP 500
yesterday got close to its average price of the last 200 days, a
level monitored by analysts and traders who study charts to make
forecasts. The index yesterday closed at 1,279.56, about 2
percent above its 200-day moving average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s a very significant level,&#8221; said Ryan Detrick,
senior technical strategist at Schaeffer&#8217;s Investment Research
in Cincinnati. &#8220;That&#8217;s where we expect some buyers to step in
to defend the longer-term trend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
pay a $10 million fine and stop holding private meetings of
stock analysts and traders known as &#8220;huddles&#8221; to settle an
investigation by Massachusetts&#8217;s chief securities regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement ends a two-year probe by William Galvin, the
secretary of the commonwealth, into New York-based Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s &#8220;Asymmetric Service Initiative,&#8221; in which information
on analysts&#8217; trading ideas was disseminated earlier to favored
clients. The company will &#8220;permanently discontinue&#8221; the
practice, Galvin&#8217;s office said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation concluded that the dissemination by
equity analysts of unpublished short-term trading ideas was &#8220;a
dishonest and unethical violation of the Massachusetts Uniform
Securities Act by putting certain clients at an advantage over
others,&#8221; Galvin&#8217;s office said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analysts, who publish stock recommendations
for long-term investments, attended weekly meetings where they
shared short-term trading ideas, the Wall Street Journal
reported in 2009, citing internal company documents. Galvin&#8217;s
office sent a subpoena to Goldman Sachs shortly after the
article was published and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which
polices brokerages, also began examining the practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finra&#8217;s Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authority, known as Finra, is close to concluding its
investigation of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s trading huddles, a person
familiar with the situation said today. The person spoke on
condition of anonymity because the details of the investigation
aren&#8217;t public. Michelle Ong, a spokeswoman for Finra, said she
couldn&#8217;t comment. John Nester, a spokesman for the SEC, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to have resolved this matter with the
Massachusetts securities division,&#8221; Stephen Cohen, a Goldman
Sachs spokesman in New York, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the settlement finds that Goldman Sachs &#8220;engaged in
dishonorable or dishonest conduct,&#8221; it adds that nothing in the
settlement &#8220;shall be construed as a finding or admission of
fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
natural-gas producer, paid $1.69 billion for two closely held
energy explorers to gain shale-gas reserves in Pennsylvania and
neighboring states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon completed the purchases of Phillips Resources Inc.,
based in Warrendale, Pennsylvania, and TWP Inc. of Butler,
Pennsylvania, on June 2, Alan Jeffers, an Irving, Texas-based
spokesman at Exxon, said in a phone interview yesterday. The 200
employees at the two companies may be retained, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon paid $34.9 billion for XTO Energy last year, making
it the biggest U.S. gas producer. The acquisition of Phillips
Resources and TWP gives Exxon access to 317,000 acres in the
Marcellus Shale, a gas-rich geological formation that stretches
beneath several eastern states including New York, Pennsylvania
and West Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that Exxon is buying in now is a vote of
confidence in shale in the U.S.,&#8221; Tony Regan, a Singapore-based
consultant at Tri-Zen International, said by telephone today.
&#8220;There had been a feeling that activity might have peaked a
bit. Exxon is a big, cautious company, and they wouldn&#8217;t have
rushed into this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global energy producers such as Total SA (FP) and BHP Billiton
Ltd. are investing in shale formations impervious to traditional
drilling methods. In the past 10 years, U.S. drilling engineers
adapted decades-old hydraulic-fracturing techniques to free gas
from dense shale rock, unleashing new supplies that have glutted
the North American market and depressed prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. gas futures have lost 69 percent of their value since
peaking at $15.78 per million British thermal units in December
2005, amid a surfeit of supply from shale formations in Texas,
Louisiana and Arkansas. The New York-traded futures closed at
$4.85 per million Btu yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shale Exploration &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon rose 31 percent in New York trading in the
past year, beating a 22 percent gain in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index. The stock climbed 57 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $81.33
at 12:25 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s XTO unit will manage Phillips Resources and TWP,
which held combined reserves equivalent to 228 billion cubic
feet of gas at the end of 2010, Jeffers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rex Tillerson, Exxon&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in
March that the company plans to export XTO&#8217;s expertise in shale
drilling to under-explored areas of Europe such as Poland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shale formations have the potential to more than double the
world&#8217;s gas reserves, the U.S. Energy Information Agency said in
an April 5 assessment. The U.S. has an estimated 827 trillion
cubic feet of shale gas and it may account for 47 percent of the
nation&#8217;s production of the fuel by 2035, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquisitions in the shale industry are set to continue,
with &#8220;vulnerable smaller guys being taken out&#8221; as they face
higher costs and increased regulation, Tri-Zen&#8217;s Regan said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romania and Bulgaria need to do more
to overcome crime and corruption before joining the Schengen
zone, which allows passport-free travel, the European Union
Justice and Home Affairs Ministers Council decided today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council will reconsider the two Black Sea countries&#8217;
bids in September, after the European Commission, the bloc&#8217;s
executive arm, releases its next report on efforts to fight
graft and organized crime, Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said. The decision came a day after the European
Parliament recommended the two countries&#8217; applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I hope the commission&#8217;s report will contribute to a
positive decision in September,&#8221; Tsvetanov told reporters today
in Luxembourg. &#8220;We have covered all the Schengen membership
criteria.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulgaria and Romania, which joined the EU in 2007, aspire
to join eight other former communist countries that are already
Schengen members. Their bids coincide with discussions in France
and Denmark to reintroduce passport checks at their borders on
concern about an influx of North African migrants through Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries hoping to join in the Schengen system, named for
the Luxembourg village where the treaty allowing border-free
travel was signed in 1985, need the unanimous endorsement of
existing members, based on an assessment by the commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, voted 487 to
77 in favor of the Bulgarian and Romanian applications before
passing the recommendation on to the ministerial council.
The assembly urged Bulgaria &#8220;to take additional measures,&#8221;
including a special action plan with Greece and Turkey, to cope
with a possible surge in migration pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Illegal migration makes Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece one
of the EU&#8217;s most sensitive external border areas,&#8221; the assembly
said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two former Soviet-bloc countries spent 1.16 billion
euros ($1.69 billion) to beef up their border police and equip
them with patrol boats, helicopters, scanners and night-vision
cameras to ensure the security of borders with Turkey, Serbia,
Moldova and Ukraine and a stretch of the Black Sea coast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft already provides the main successor agency to the

won&#8217;t be able to listen to individual Skype calls with only the

Vedomosti said.                &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) is interested in
working with OAO Rosneft, Russia&#8217;s biggest oil producer, to
explore for Arctic resources and it may exit a Black Sea
venture, the head of the Moscow-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will probably pull out of the West Chernomorsky
project in the Black Sea because of disagreements about the
area&#8217;s potential, Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Eduard Khudainatov told reporters today in Krasnodar, southern Russia.
The companies signed an exploration accord a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our geologists categorically disagree,&#8221; Khudainatov said
of the West Chernomorsky project. Chevron believed the block,
held by Rosneft&#8217;s Val Shatskogo unit, has the same
characteristics as an area in Turkey&#8217;s Black Sea waters where it
drilled a dry well, Khudainatov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft&#8217;s plans to tap international technology and
experience to develop offshore fields have gotten off to a shaky
start. A deal to swap $7.8 billion stakes with BP Plc and
explore the Arctic Kara Sea collapsed amid a challenge from the
U.K. producer&#8217;s billionaire partners in a Russian venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron continues to work closely with Rosneft on
opportunities to collaborate in business ventures,&#8221; Kurt Glaubitz, a spokesman for the San Ramon, California-based
company, said in an e-mailed message. &#8220;We do not discuss
ongoing business negotiations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft may consider new partners for the Black Sea
project, Khudainatov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukoil Partner? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord called for Chevron to invest an initial $1
billion to drill wells in West Chernomorsky. A final agreement
on the venture wasn&#8217;t signed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lukoil has experience in the Caspian and the Baltic
Seas,&#8221; he said, referring to Russia&#8217;s second-largest oil
producer. &#8220;There may be three partners, or four, let&#8217;s see.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft and Chevron are looking to work together on
offshore projects, Khudainatov said. Chevron is interested in
resources in the Laptev Sea, in Russia&#8217;s eastern Arctic, he
said. Laptev is less explored than the Pechora and Barents seas
to the west, according to the government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lobby groups representing some of
the world&#8217;s biggest financial companies want U.S. regulators to
delay rules that would govern resolutions of systemically risky
firms to allow more time to review and revise the proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
must clarify what constitutes a &#8220;credible&#8221; plan for unwinding
a complex firm before requiring companies to file so-called
living wills, six groups including the Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association and the Institute of International
Bankers said in a letter to the regulators, according to a copy
obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are potentially severe business-model and
competitive consequences to any financial firm if the Federal
Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. were to jointly
determine that the company&#8217;s resolution plan is &#8216;not
credible,&#8217;&#8221; the groups said in the letter, which they plan to
send to the agencies today. &#8220;Supervisors should not create a
system that manages for failure rather than for success.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act requires firms deemed systemically
important to file plans with the Fed and the FDIC for how they
could be unwound in event of their failure. Lawmakers gave the
FDIC resolution authority for shutdowns of complex firms aiming
to prevent a repeat of the market tumult that followed the
September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The groups, representing firms including JPMorgan Chase 
Co (JPM), BlackRock Inc. (BLK), Bank of New York Mellon, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group PLC and Deutsche Bank AG, urged regulators to
push back implementation of the rules from next month to as late
as January of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workable Plans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the living-wills provision, companies with at least
$50 billion in assets will have to provide information on their
debt, funding, capital and cash flows. Firms that fail to file
workable plans for unwinding their business could be subject to
increased capital, leverage or liquidity requirements as well as
restrictions on their growth, activities or operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the challenges in the resolution-planning process
is that a financial business should be managed to optimize
capital information, prudent maturity transformation and
economic growth as a going concern, rather than for failure as a
gone concern,&#8221; the organizations wrote in the 53-page letter
addressed to the Fed and the FDIC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Sifma and IIB, signers included the Clearing
House Association, the American Bankers Association, the
Association for Financial Markets in Europe and the Financial
Services Roundtable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broader Pushback &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial-industry criticism of the living-wills measure is
part of a broader pushback against Dodd-Frank, the regulatory
overhaul enacted in response to the worst financial crisis since
the Great Depression. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon questioned Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke at a public forum
on June 7 over whether new rules may threaten economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&#8217;s letter, the industry groups cited concerns about
confidentiality of the information companies will have to give
regulators as part of the resolution plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We realize that the Freedom of Information Act or FOIA
will apply to data submitted in resolution plans and credit-
exposure reports, making it critical that the information
submitted be treated as an integral part of the examination
process and subject to similar protections,&#8221; the organization
said in the letter. &#8220;Resolution plans and credit-exposure
reports should therefore be made subject to the strongest FOIA
protection available.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

member of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe.

Moore" date="Jun 10, 2011 10:49 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-10/goldman-sachs-is-unlikely-to-face-charges-from-senate-report-bove-says.html"><headline>Goldman Is Unlikely to Face Charges Stemming From Senate Report, Bove Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is unlikely
to face charges from investigations into the firm&#8217;s mortgage
practices before the financial crisis, according to Richard X. Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is becoming increasingly apparent that a terrible
wrong may have been done to Goldman Sachs,&#8221; Bove wrote in a
note to investors dated June 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bove suggested less than a month ago that clients sell the
firm&#8217;s stock because the U.S. Department of Justice was under
pressure to bring claims, based on a report from the U.S.
Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations accusing
Goldman Sachs of misleading buyers of mortgage-linked
investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, which paid $550 million to settle Securities and
Exchange Commission charges related to its marketing of mortgage
securities, was subpoenaed by the Manhattan District Attorney&#8217;s
office for information on business practices leading into the
credit crisis, two people familiar with the matter said last
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and
other executives at the firm have said that its traders placed
&#8220;short&#8221; bets, which profited when prices of mortgage-linked
securities fell, to hedge against losses. Blankfein also said in
last year&#8217;s hearing that Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t have a "massive
short" against the housing market, and was acting as a &#8220;market
maker&#8221; in selling collateralized debt obligations and other
mortgage-backed investments to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Findings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate subcommittee said that documents uncovered in
its two-year investigation of the financial crisis show that
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s mortgage traders did have a large short position
during 2007 and the sales team aggressively sought clients to
buy CDOs that the traders expected would decline in value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Evidence is now mounting that the company did not have a
net short position" during the time in question, Bove said in
his note. "The Senate committee may have misread the numbers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bove also said it was "becoming apparent" that Blankfein
"did not misrepresent to the Senate Committee because Goldman
was not net short at the time the firm was accused of
misrepresenting its position.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bove maintained his sell rating on Goldman Sachs and
lowered his earnings estimates for 2011, 2012 and 2013, citing a
&#8220;relatively bleak second quarter&#8221; and a &#8220;weakened&#8221; secular
outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AG&#8217;s Review &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder, testifying before the
House Judiciary Committee on May 3, confirmed that his
department is reviewing the report from the Senate committee,
which was led by Michigan Democrat Carl M. Levin. Oklahoma&#8217;s
Thomas A. Coburn is the ranking Republican on the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank rose 14 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $133.67 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading at 10:24 a.m., two days
after it touched the lowest value in almost a year. The shares
are down 21 percent this year, and have fallen in 12 of the last
15 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bove, who is based in Lutz, Florida, is one of two analysts
with a negative rating on Goldman Sachs, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The other is Christopher Wheeler, a
London-based analyst for Mediobanca SpA. Of 28 analysts
surveyed, 18 recommend that investors buy the stock and eight
call for holding it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romania still hopes to achieve its
goal of joining the Schengen zone, which allows passport-free
travel, this year, President Traian Basescu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union Justice and Home Affairs Ministers
Council said yesterday it will reconsider the bids of Romania
and Bulgaria in September, if it sees an improvement from both
Black Sea countries in the battle to overcome crime and
corruption. The decision came a day after the European
Parliament recommended the two countries&#8217; applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are maintaining our goal to enter the Schengen area in
2011 and we&#8217;re waiting for a decision from the Council of
Justice and Home Affairs in September on the entry timetable,&#8221;
Basescu said in a speech today in Bucharest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulgaria and Romania, which joined the EU in 2007, aspire

practice, Galvin&#8217;s office said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analysts, who publish stock recommendations
for long-term investments, attended weekly meetings where they
shared short-term trading ideas, the Wall Street Journal
reported in 2009, citing internal company documents. Galvin&#8217;s
office sent a subpoena to Goldman Sachs shortly after the
article was published. The Securities and Exchange Commission
and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority also began examining
the practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finra is close to concluding its investigation of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s trading huddles, a person familiar with the situation
said yesterday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity
because the details of the investigation aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelle Ong, a spokeswoman for Finra, said she couldn&#8217;t
comment. John Nester, a spokesman for the SEC, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to have resolved this matter with the
Massachusetts securities division,&#8221; Stephen Cohen, a Goldman
Sachs spokesman in New York, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the settlement finds that Goldman Sachs &#8220;engaged in
dishonorable or dishonest conduct,&#8221; it adds that nothing in the
settlement &#8220;shall be construed as a finding or admission of
fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank Deadline May Create &#8216;Black Hole,&#8217; Roberts Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps users may face a &#8220;black hole&#8221; when Dodd-Frank Act
rules take effect next month because too much remains unresolved
for markets to operate properly, the Senate Agriculture
Committee&#8217;s top Republican said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t even know what a swap is&#8221; under the financial
overhaul, Senator Pat Roberts said in an interview yesterday at
Bloomberg&#8217;s office in Washington. The Kansas Republican said the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission needs to outline what
provisions will apply when Dodd-Frank takes effect, and which
will require rule-making that will delay implementation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission are
writing new regulations required by the legislation enacted last
July, after largely unregulated swaps helped fuel the 2008
credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts joined Republican Senators Saxby Chambliss of
Georgia and Richard Lugar of Indiana in a letter to CFTC
Chairman Gary Gensler on May 27 asking for a list of Dodd-Frank
provisions that would become effective on July 16. They also
asked the CFTC&#8217;s view of how swaps transitions would be governed
while new regulations are put in place and how the commission
would provide greater legal certainty for the transactions
during the transition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AEP Says New Air Rules May Cost Up to $8 Billion, 600 Jobs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Electric Power Co. said it would have to spend as
much as $8 billion through the end of the decade to comply with
proposed federal regulations aimed at curbing carbon-dioxide
emissions from coal-fueled power plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company estimated it would cut about 600 jobs and
shutter five coal-fueled power plants in Virginia, West Virginia
and Ohio if proposed federal rules are enacted, American
Electric said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unrealistic timelines&#8221; in the Environmental Protection
Agency proposals would force the company to prematurely shut
about 25 percent of its current coal-fueled generating capacity,
or 6,000 megawatts, said Michael Morris, American Electric&#8217;s
chairman and chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business will face electricity price increases of &#8220;10
percent to more than 35 percent,&#8221; Morris said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal-fueled generation accounts for about 65 percent of
American Electric&#8217;s total generating capacity. The company has
spent more than $7.2 billion since 1990 to reduce emissions from
its coal power plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCAOB to Weigh Inspection Program for Broker-Dealers&#8217; Auditors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board will meet
next week to consider establishing an interim inspection program
for registered public accounting firms&#8217; audits of brokers and
dealers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure, which would be part of the adoption of the
nonprofit corporation&#8217;s expanded oversight responsibilities
under the Dodd-Frank Act, will be weighed at a June 14 meeting
in Washington, the PCAOB said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Regulator Defends Liquidity Rules Against Bank Criticism &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Financial Services Authority defended rules
requiring lenders to hold increased liquidity buffers after
banks complained that the rules were tougher than international
standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA disagrees with claims that banks must &#8220;hold more
liquidity than is likely to be required under the implementation
of&#8221; global rules proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, &#8220;and to date have not seen any evidence from firms
to suggest otherwise,&#8221; Liam Parker, an FSA spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules proposed by the FSA requiring banks to have
enough high-quality assets to survive a temporary liquidity
crisis could &#8220;cause disruption in the payment systems as banks
delay payments in an attempt to reduce liquidity usage,&#8221;
according to a paper published by Bank of England officials last
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidity rules may require U.K. banks to buy as much
as 110 billion pounds ($161 billion) of government bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autoliv Raided as EU Probes Automotive-Parts Price Fixing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autoliv Inc. (ALIV), the world&#8217;s biggest producer of seatbelts and
air bags, was raided by European Union authorities as part of an
antitrust investigation into car-parts suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission, the 27-nation EU&#8217;s competition authority,
said on its website yesterday that raids at producers of car
safety systems began on June 7. Stockholm-based Autoliv said
it&#8217;s cooperating with investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between suppliers and automakers has
tightened as development times shorten and car companies insist
components be delivered shortly before assembly to reduce
inventory costs. Component manufacturers are critical to the
automotive industry, accounting for about 75 percent of the
value of an average car, up from 65 percent 10 to 15 years ago,
according to the Center of Automotive Management at the
University of Applied Sciences in Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autoliv said two of its facilities in Germany were visited
by EU officials. The commission didn&#8217;t say which companies it
inspected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartels are &#8220;the top priority&#8221; for antitrust regulators,
the EU&#8217;s competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in April.
The commission said last year it is investigating companies that
make automotive electrical distribution systems as part of a
joint probe with the U.S. into possible price fixing. The
commission said there is no deadline to complete its
investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Warehouses Won&#8217;t Get LME Investigation, U.K. OFT Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s stockpile of copper and ownership of
warehouses for goods traded on the London Metal Exchange won&#8217;t
be probed for market violations, Britain&#8217;s antitrust regulator
said, citing a lack of evidence and jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. parliamentary committee that sought the review
didn&#8217;t give proof that certain &#8220;large dealers&#8221; on the exchange
were undermining the market by owning warehouses, the U.K.
Office of Fair Trading said in a May 27 letter posted on the
Science and Technology Committee&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange last year handled $11.6 trillion in contracts,
offering trading in metals from copper to cobalt to steel. In
May, the committee said it was concerned about allegations made
by other traders at hearings reviewing the country&#8217;s
&#8220;strategically important metals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other allegations that New York-based JPMorgan &#8220;could
distort commodity markets&#8221; by owning 50 percent of the stock of
copper as part of a creation of an exchange-traded fund fall
under the jurisdiction of Britain&#8217;s Financial Services
Authority, the OFT said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LME spokeswoman Miriam Heywood said yesterday in an e-mail
that is it &#8220;unjustified&#8221; to suggest that ownership of a
warehousing company implies anticompetitive behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 400 warehouses in about 35 countries handle metal
traded on the exchange, and JPMorgan&#8217;s Henry Bath unit has
warehouses in 14 locations, the OFT said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Cautions Investors on Buying Reverse-Merger Stocks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cautioned
investors about buying stakes in companies that gain listings on
U.S. exchanges through so-called reverse mergers, saying they
may be prone to &#8220;fraud and other abuses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the companies, often overseas operations that
access U.S. markets by acquiring publicly traded firms with few
or no operations, &#8220;either fail or struggle to remain viable&#8221;
and may use small audit firms that don&#8217;t verify financial
statements, the SEC said yesterday in an investor bulletin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lori Schock, head of the SEC&#8217;s investor education office,
said in a statement that investors &#8220;should be especially
careful&#8221; when considering investing in the stock of reverse
merger companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s warning comes more than a year after the SEC
formed a task force to examine China-based reverse-merger
companies and their auditors. The SEC and exchanges have halted
trading in more than a dozen such firms in recent months, citing
missing financial information, according to the release. Several
such companies have seen their share prices plummet amid
allegations that their financial statements were inaccurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a reverse merger, a closely held firm buys a so-called
shell company and becomes able to sell shares without the
scrutiny that would surround an initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, U.S. Banks Probed by SEC on Libya Deals, WSJ Reports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is among financial firms being
examined by U.S. regulators to determine if transactions with
Libya&#8217;s sovereign fund may have violated bribery laws, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing people it didn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission officials are
reviewing documents including those related to a $50 million fee
Goldman Sachs agreed to pay the Libyan fund to help recoup
losses, the newspaper said yesterday. The payment, which was to
be passed on by the Libyan Investment Authority to a firm run by
a local official&#8217;s son-in-law, was never made, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (5) and Goldman Sachs are among banks that
held funds for the Muammar Qaddafi-controlled Libyan sovereign
wealth fund, London-based advocacy group Global Witness said
last month. Talks between Goldman Sachs and the wealth fund
stalled before violent protests broke out in Libya in February,
the newspaper said, citing people it didn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it was confident it hadn&#8217;t violated any
rules or regulations, according to the Journal, citing spokesman
Lucas van Praag. An SEC spokesman declined to comment, the
newspaper said. The agency&#8217;s interest doesn&#8217;t mean that a formal
investigation will be started, the Journal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connie Ling, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs, and Vinh Tran, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for HSBC,
didn&#8217;t immediately return a call or e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-UBS Adviser Pleads Guilty to Fraud, Agrees to Prison &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Kobayashi, a former UBS AG (UBSN) financial adviser in
California, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and agreed to serve
more than five years in prison for improperly transferring
client funds to his bank accounts, U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag
said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kobayashi, 39, of Livermore, California, was charged in
March with taking money from his clients&#8217; UBS accounts and
putting it into his accounts, sometimes gaining customer
authorization to withdraw their money by telling them it would
be used to purchase investments, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 2006 and 2009, Kobayashi transferred more than
$5.4 million in client funds to his bank accounts, prosecutors
said. In March, he settled a lawsuit brought by U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission alleging misappropriation of $3.3
million. He didn&#8217;t admit or deny wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kobayashi pleaded guilty yesterday in federal court in
northern California to one count each of money laundering and
wire fraud. In a plea agreement with prosecutors, he agreed to
serve 65 months in prison and pay $5.4 million in restitution,
Haag said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kobayashi&#8217;s attorney, Joyce Leavitt, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a voice-mail message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v Kobayashi, 11-106 and the SEC
case is U.S. v Kobayashi, 11-981, in U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (Oakland). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS Madoff Claims Must Wait for Luxembourg Court Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG lost its bid to dismiss outright claims by LuxAlpha
Sicav-American Selection Fund&#8217;s French investors, who must wait
on related Luxembourg court cases before their claims can be
addressed, a Paris court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commercial court in Paris said in an opinion June 9 that
while their case is admissible, it will wait to issue a final
ruling until the Luxembourg-based LuxAlpha liquidators&#8217; claims
are resolved by judges there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is one of many over UBS&#8217;s role as custodian for
LuxAlpha, which invested 95 percent of its assets with Bernard
Madoff and is being liquidated. Irving H. Picard, the trustee
liquidating Madoff&#8217;s firm, sued the bank for $2.6 billion last
year, claiming UBS aided the fraud partly by setting up feeder
funds like LuxAlpha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominique Gerster, a UBS spokesman, said the Zurich-based
bank welcomes the court&#8217;s &#8220;overall conclusions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS lawyer Denis Chemla told the Paris court at a March
hearing that LuxAlpha was created at the request of wealthy
clients who wanted a fund that allowed them to continue
investing with Madoff and that UBS didn&#8217;t issue any false
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murdoch&#8217;s Sun Can&#8217;t Identify Ex-RBS CEO Goodwin&#8217;s Mistress &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s Sun newspaper can&#8217;t identify a woman who
had an affair with former Royal Bank of Scotland Group Chief
Executive Officer Fred Goodwin, a judge ruled in a case
involving privacy and corporate governance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Michael Tugendhat at the High Court in London today
refused to allow the paper to name the woman, but modified a
court order to allow more details about her job description to
be published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS posted the largest loss in U.K. corporate history in
2008 and required a 45 billion-pound ($74 billion) bailout
following its acquisition of ABN Amro Holding NV. Goodwin was
cleared of responsibility in December. The RBS rescue may
explain why the paper considers articles about Goodwin to be of
interest to readers, Tugendhat said in the ruling. He noted that
&#8220;what is of interest to the public is not the same as what it
is in the public interest to publish.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sun&#8217;s lawyer, Richard Spearman, said at a June 1
hearing that an anonymity order was stifling public debate about
corporate governance at the bank before its 2008 bailout. Hugh
Tomlinson, the lawyer representing the woman, said at the same
hearing that there was no need to change the order because there
isn&#8217;t any evidence the affair contributed to the collapse of
RBS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomlinson said he planned to challenge the judgment at the
Court of Appeal. Tugendhat said the Sun shouldn&#8217;t publish the
woman&#8217;s job description for 14 days to allow time for the appeal
to be filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is one of dozens involving so-called super
injunctions or privacy injunctions that ban newspapers from
printing stories about people&#8217;s sex lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German Top Court Schedules Hearing in Euro Bailout Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s top constitutional court scheduled a hearing on
lawsuits against the nation&#8217;s participation in the euro-area
rescue fund and the aid package for Greece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe will hear
oral arguments in three cases over the issue on July 5, the
court said in an e-mailed statement today. The cases were
brought by a group of academics and lawmaker Peter Gauweiler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German high court has drawn criticism for not acting
swiftly on the suits, which were filed in the first half of
2010. The judges declined to issue emergency orders blocking the
aid package for Greece in May 2010 and the euro-area rescue fund
in June 2010 and didn&#8217;t schedule a hearing on the main legal
questions in the cases until yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court is expected to consider whether the case can be
dismissed for procedural reasons as well as substantive
questions. The court normally takes a few months after a hearing
before it issues a ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are BVerfG, 2 BvR 987/10, 2 BvR 1099/10 and 2 BvR
1485/10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviews/Speeches &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bair Says U.S. Must Avoid Amnesia in Response to Crisis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair
strongly defended higher capital buffers for the biggest banks
and said U.S. regulators must guard against pressure to be less
vigilant in financial-industry oversight as the nation recovers
from the 2008 credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I see a lot of amnesia setting in now,&#8221; Bair said
yesterday during a question-and-answer session at the Council on
Foreign Relations in New York, where she discussed her tenure at
the FDIC and the government&#8217;s response to the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bair was asked to respond after JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, head of the most profitable U.S.
bank, pressed Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in a
public forum on June 7 on whether regulators have risked slowing
growth by going too far in reining in the U.S. banking system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators must look at the relationships among different
rules and may have to phase in regulations on derivatives, Bair
said in an acknowledgement of some agreement with Dimon. In
other areas, such as a 3 percent equity capital buffer for
systemically important firms, the new rules will help protect
the financial system while allowing large banks to earn a
reasonable return, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany Risks Losing Manager Post at EU Stress-Test Agency &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s financial supervisor risks losing its seat on the
managing committee of the European Banking Authority, days after
Bafin&#8217;s chairman criticized the &#8220;legitimacy&#8221; of the agency
overseeing stress tests on lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank watchdogs from across the European Union are scheduled
to vote as soon as this month on a replacement for Bafin&#8217;s
Sabine Lautenschlaeger, who must step down from her role at the
EBA because she agreed to join the Bundesbank. The EBA&#8217;s six-
person managing committee helps decide the agency&#8217;s annual work
plan and includes supervisors from the Czech Republic, Finland,
France, Hungary and Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bafin spokesman Ben Fischer said that Lautenschlaeger &#8220;now
loses her seat&#8221; and it won&#8217;t automatically go to a new German
candidate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest stock-market tumble
worldwide hasn&#8217;t dented Mark Mobius&#8217;s optimism for Thailand,
even as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG
advise cutting holdings on concern next month&#8217;s election will
spur political turmoil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to believe that the market looks
attractive,&#8221; Mobius, whose $17.5 billion Templeton Asian Growth
Fund beat 92 percent of peers in the past 12 months and held 21
percent of its assets in Thai stocks at the end of April, said
in e-mailed comments to Bloomberg News yesterday. &#8220;We must
remember that Thailand has been the subject of political
turmoil&#8221; for eight decades, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark SET Index lost 5.3 percent in June through
yesterday as foreign investors sold $602 million of shares on
concern the July 3 national elections will revive political
tension that sparked violent protests last year. Goldman Sachs
cut its rating on Thai stocks to &#8220;underweight&#8221; on June 7,
while Credit Suisse advised reducing lenders and tourism-related
holdings the same day. Both banks cited the election, along with
stock valuations and faster inflation in Southeast Asia&#8217;s
second-biggest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SET index climbed 0.3 percent to 1,020.37 today for the
biggest gain among emerging markets in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court upheld a
patent-infringement verdict that will cost Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) $300
million and already has forced changes in its Word software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday unanimously rejected calls from
Microsoft and its allies, including Apple Inc. and Google Inc. (GOOG),
to overturn the award and make some patents more vulnerable to
legal challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling is a victory for closely held I4i LP, which
claimed in its 2007 lawsuit that its patented technology had
been incorporated into Word, the word-processing program used by
500 million people. The award is the largest ever upheld on
appeal in a patent case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which had $5.2 billion in profit in the first
quarter of 2011, hasn&#8217;t yet paid I4i any damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the outcome is not what we had hoped for, we will
continue to advocate for changes to the law that will prevent
abuse of the patent system and protect inventors who hold
patents representing true innovation,&#8221; said Kevin Kutz, a
Microsoft spokesman, in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft contended that the disputed patent was based on
technology already in the marketplace. The question for the
Supreme Court was whether, as a lower court concluded, Microsoft
needed to make that showing by &#8220;clear and convincing&#8221; evidence
to overcome the longstanding presumption that patents approved
by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are valid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft argued that a less-demanding standard should
apply when a jury is presented with evidence about pre-existing
technology that the patent examiner didn&#8217;t consider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing for the Supreme Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said
that the clear-and-convincing standard is a decades-old rule
that Congress has repeatedly declined to revisit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any recalibration of the standard of proof remains in its
hands,&#8221; Sotomayor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft v. I4i Limited Partnership, 10-290. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Seeks Patent on Movie-Finding Application for IPhone &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL), maker of the iPad and iPhone, applied for a
patent on a technology that will make it easier for an iPhone
user to find a movie at the right time and place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application 20110137690, published in the database of the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office yesterday, covers an
application for an electronic device that can search variables
before presenting movie information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variables include geographic proximity of the theater,
the show start time closest to the current time of day, show
finish time, and traffic conditions, according to the
application. The variables also could be factored into use of
the mobile electronic device to buy tickets for the movie or
other event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohawk Seeks Declaration of Non-Infringement of Rug Design &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohawk Industries Inc. (MHK), a rug manufacturer based in
Calhoun, Georgia, asked a federal court to declare it isn&#8217;t
infringing the copyright of a Maine-based design and licensing
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint filed June 7 in federal court in Atlanta,
Mohawk said it received notice from counsel for Angela Adams
Licensing LLC that one of its carpets is &#8220;substantially
similar&#8221; to an Adams design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in the court filing is a letter from Margaret
Minister O&#8217;Keefe of Portland, Maine&#8217;s Pierce Atwood, suggesting
that any potential dispute can be resolved amicably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohawk&#8217;s response to that letter, also included in the
court filing, was sent by Michael D. Hobbs Jr. of Atlanta&#8217;s
Troutman Sanders LLP. Mohawk &#8220;takes Angela Adams&#8217; claims
seriously&#8221; and carefully analyzed her design and the design of
the carpet that allegedly infringes, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the geometric elements in Adams&#8217;s design
&#8220;date back thousands of years and are not original to Angela
Adams.&#8221; In the 1950s and 1960s, designers &#8220;commonly adopted
those ancient geometric designs into &#8216;mod&#8217; mid-century decor,
rugs and fabrics.&#8221; The Mohawk rug at issue is a &#8220;retro&#8221;
design based on &#8220;mid-century elements that have been popular
for at least the last ten years,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohawk asked the court to declare that it doesn&#8217;t infringe
the Adams design, and for awards of attorney fees and litigation
costs. It also seeks a declaration that the Adams design &#8220;does
not contain protectable originality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Georgia is represented in the case by Sara Beth Myers
of Nashville, Tennessee&#8217;s Riley Warnock  Jacobson Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Bloomberg data, Angela Adams Licensing has
filed 10 copyright-infringement cases since 2005. Mohawk is one
of the defendants in a case filed June 8 in federal court in
Portland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That case is Angela Adams Licensing LLC v. Target Corp.,
2:11-cv-00229-DBH, U.S. District Court, District of Maine
(Portland). The Atlanta case is Mohawk Industries Inc., v.
Angela Adams Licensing LLC, 4:11-cv-00155-HLM, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nu Image&#8217;s Delay in Serving Subpoenas Wins Scolding from Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nu Image Inc., a Los Angeles-based film studio, received a
setback in a copyright-infringement case it filed against more
than 23,000 unnamed defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an order issued June 7, a federal judge in Washington
scolded the company for failing to serve &#8220;not a single
subpoena&#8221; in the case more than two months after the court
granted a request for the subpoenas &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nu Image filed the case Feb. 11, accusing the unnamed
defendants of illegally downloading copies of its film &#8220;The
Expendables&#8221; using the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film company had asked the court for permission to
serve subpoenas on Internet service providers, seeking the
identities of customers who allegedly did the unauthorized
downloading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Robert L. Wilkins wrote that the delay
was &#8220;inexcusable.&#8221; If the studio was seeking information on
claims that couldn&#8217;t properly be pursued in his court, it was
&#8220;inappropriate and a waste of scarce judicial resources,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If his court isn&#8217;t the proper venue for the case, then it
should either be dismissed or transferred to &#8220;any district or
division in which it could have been brought,&#8221; Wilkins said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge ordered Nu Image to show him why his court was
the proper venue to serve all 23,433 defendants. He told the
studio it must respond to his order by June 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted that at a June 2 conference, counsel for Nu Image
said the subpoenas hadn&#8217;t been served because of issues the
judge raised about venue and jurisdiction. Wilkins hadn&#8217;t raised
those issued until May 25, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nu Image is represented by Nicholas A. Kurtz and Thomas
Mansfield Dunlap of Washington&#8217;s Dunlap, Grubb  Weaver PLLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Nu Image Inc., v. Does 1-23,322, U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Swine Breeders Win Meatpacker&#8217;s Trademark Cancellation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axle Associates, a Selkirkshire, U.K.-based meat-marketing
company, lost its &#8220;Bramley Old Spot Pork&#8221; trademark following
an action by that country&#8217;s Intellectual Property Office, the
BBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gloucestershire Old Spots Pig Breeders&#8217; Club argued for
the invalidation of the trademark, claiming the meat Axle used
for the product didn&#8217;t come from purebred swine, according to
the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gloucestershire Old Spots was added to the European Union&#8217;s
list of protected agricultural names last year, according to the
BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Ironside, director of Axle Associates, criticized the
IP Office&#8217;s decision, telling the BBC that the country&#8217;s
trademark law is inconsistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Pink Lady&#8217; Growers Seek Consumer Reports of Bogus Labels &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An association of growers of the Pink Lady variety of
apples is developing a program to encourage consumers to report
bogus stickers on apples that aren&#8217;t of that variety, according
to the produce industry publication the Packer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink Lady apples are of the &#8220;cripps pink&#8221; variety
originating in Australia, and if the apple doesn&#8217;t bear a label
with the Pink Lady trademark, &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t come with that
trademark protection,&#8221; Alan Taylor, Pink Lady America LLC
marketing director, told the Packer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yakima, Washington-based trade group is using the
social media sites run by Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. to
promote the trademark and explain the quality conditions it
represented, the Packer reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the raw materials stocks are undervalued in

Oppenheimer said. &lt;/p&gt;

percent over the next six months and 15 percent over 12 months,

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chairman Bill Gates
and Robin Li, chief executive officer of China&#8217;s most popular
search engine Baidu Inc., said they will form a global alliance
for public health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first initiative by the alliance, between the Bill 
Melinda Gates Foundation, the world&#8217;s richest charitable fund,
and the Baidu Charitable Foundation, will be a program
encouraging smokers to quit the habit, the foundations announced
at a press conference in Beijing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When we think of the creativity and the connection to so
many people that Baidu has, that may be a real asset in getting
out these health-related messages,&#8221; Gates said at the briefing.
&#8220;We&#8217;re hoping that other people will join in, but there&#8217;s no
one I&#8217;d rather be partnering with than Robin Li and the Baidu
Foundation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the second charity trip to China for Gates in nine
months after a September visit in which he and Warren Buffett
met with 50 Chinese leaders in business and philanthropy to
discuss charitable giving. Gates, 55, is pressing the world&#8217;s
rich to give away more of their money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates started the Giving Pledge last June with Buffett for
billionaires who agree to commit half their fortunes to charity.
The two traveled to India in March to discuss giving with
business leaders there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects recommendation in fourth paragraph of story
published June 13.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should sell October
natural gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange because
a 12 percent rally in prices over the past three weeks is
&#8220;unsustainable,&#8221; according to Goldman Sachs Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fuel&#8217;s discount to coal has narrowed 35 percent
compared with March and a smaller amount of substitution of coal
with natural gas may take place at current prices, Goldman&#8217;s
London-based analysts, Samantha Dart and Johan Spetz, said in a
report e-mailed today. Producers switch between gas-fired
generators and coal units depending on fuel costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural gas for July delivery in New York rose 0.1 percent
to $4.761 per million British thermal units at 3:45 p.m.
Singapore time. Prices are 8.1 percent higher this year and have
gained 13 percent from May 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices above $5 per million British thermal units will also
prompt producers to raise output, increasing U.S. supplies, the
analysts said. The bank recommended selling New York gas futures
at an initial price of $4.84 per million British thermal units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman also recommended purchasing fourth-quarter 2012
U.K. gas contracts, as a tightening of global LNG markets may
result in a &#8220;reconnection between spot prices and oil-indexed
prices in Europe,&#8221; according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry groups representing U.S.
companies such as Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said they
support a new round of negotiations to expand a 1996 agreement
that established free trade in technology goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That deal, the Information Technology Agreement, now allows
$4 trillion a year in duty-free trade from 73 nations in items
such as cordless telephones, video cameras, optical-fiber cables
and chemicals used to make semiconductors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the information and communications technology
sector has exploded with new and improved products since the ITA
came into force, the product scope of the agreement has never
been expanded,&#8221; groups led by the Information Technology
Industry Council wrote in a document filed today with the U.S.
Trade Representative&#8217;s office. &#8220;ITA members have been trying to
chip away at the ITA by attempting to remove products from
coverage simply because they have been improved upon with
increased functionality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposals to expand the accord would eliminate tariffs on
$800 billion a year in trade, including $122 billion for the
U.S., the groups said in their letter. Among the products that
should be added are web cameras, global-positioning system
controllers, circuit breakers, digital scales, microwave
amplifiers, video monitors and DVD vending kiosks, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama&#8217;s trade office requested comments
last month on whether and how the technology trade agreement
could be revamped. That inquiry represents doubts that a broader
deal in the World Trade Organization that has been under
discussion for more than a decade would come to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information technology accord has the benefit of being
a grouping of only those nations that want to eliminate their
tariffs, and so doesn&#8217;t need all 153 WTO members to agree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the industry letter, individual companies
such as Honeywell International Inc. (HON), Entegris Inc. (ENTG), Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc. and Agilent Technologies Inc. (A) asked for
specific expansions of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors in Europe are using cash
reserves to add to holdings of top-rated high-yield bonds,
according to a JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) survey of money managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 70 percent of investors say they are overweight
junk debt, meaning they hold more of it as a proportion of their
portfolio than indicated by the indexes they follow, the survey
showed. Just 14 percent are underweight and an equal number are
neutral. That compares to more than half saying they were
neutral in April, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While investors are increasing their holdings of the
securities overall, they are steering clear of the lowest-rated
bonds, with just 14 percent overweight CCC categories, down from
29 percent in the previous survey, according to London-based
strategists Daniel Lamy, Stephen Dulake and Tina T. Zhang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash holdings at 72 percent of respondents are &#8220;average,&#8221;
with only 15 percent reporting low or very low cash holdings,
according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High yield, or junk, bonds are rated lower than BBB- at

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s Lagavulin well west
of the U.K. Shetland Islands in the Atlantic Ocean has been
plugged and abandoned after failing to find a reservoir of oil
and gas, partner Faroe Petroleum Plc (FPM) said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faroe, which owns 10 percent of the well that Chevron
operated, fell as much as 14.6 percent in London trading, the
most in 2 1/2 years, after the announcement. The well reached a
depth of 1,567 meters (5,000 feet) on June 10 and, while it
found some hydrocarbons, &#8220;no workable reservoir system was
found,&#8221; Faroe said. The project also took longer and was more
expensive than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lagavulin well, the deepest yet attempted on the U.K.&#8217;s
Atlantic Margin, attracted protests from Greenpeace last year
after the disaster at BP Plc&#8217;s deepwater well in the Gulf of
Mexico. Results are still being evaluated and will increase
explorers&#8217; knowledge of the geology of the region, Faroe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lagavulin was a true high risk frontier exploration well,
offering material upside in a success case,&#8221; Faroe Chief
Executive Officer Graham Stewart said in a statement. &#8220;Whilst
the outcome of the well is a disappointment, the presence of
hydrocarbons has however now been proven and offers
encouragement to continue our deepwater exploration plans in the
region.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. (INTC) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) may
have help in their multiyear effort to bring more high-skill
workers from overseas into the U.S. under a bill Representative
Zoe Lofgren introduced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lofgren, a Democrat from California, introduced a bill that
would provide green cards, or permanent residence, to more
foreign students who earn at least a master&#8217;s degree in science
or engineering at U.S. universities. It also gives green cards
to foreign entrepreneurs who start companies employing five or
more U.S. citizens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies, from Intel and Microsoft to
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), have backed efforts to
make it easier for scientists and engineers from abroad to come
to the U.S. Many scientists come to the U.S. for their post-
graduate education and leave when they can&#8217;t get a visa to stay,
said Peter Cleveland, Intel&#8217;s vice president of global public
policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We drop the ball when we let these individuals take this
education elsewhere,&#8221; he said in a phone interview. &#8220;We should
have them stay here and work for Apple, work for Facebook, work
for Intel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduates with master&#8217;s degrees and higher in science,
technology, engineering and math who get jobs related to their
degrees would qualify for green cards under Lofgren&#8217;s bill.
Entrepreneurs from abroad would get a temporary residence and
could petition to stay permanently after two years if their
businesses are still open and employing U.S. citizens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican Co-Sponsor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lofgren is looking for a Republican to co-sponsor the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I hope we will have Republican support,&#8221; she said in a
phone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill is broader than past efforts, said Ron Hira, an
associate professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute
of Technology, citing other bills that haven&#8217;t been passed. In
2009, Representative Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona,
introduced a bill that would have allowed in more foreign
graduates with doctorate degrees. It never left the House
Judiciary Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot more master&#8217;s than Ph.Ds,&#8221; Hira said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current laws cap the number of employment-based green cards
at 140,000 per year. Under the bill, the green cards for
graduates and entrepreneurs wouldn&#8217;t count against the quotas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill also would keep workers&#8217; spouses and children from
counting against caps and reclassify some workers, such as
fashion models, to other visas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel&#8217;s Support &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill &#8220;would not only make it easier for U.S. companies
to hire the workforce they need but will address the concerns of
foreign-born workers who must deal with the challenges and
uncertainties of the immigration system,&#8221; Intel said in an e-
mailed statement.&#160;About 6 percent of Intel&#8217;s 45,000 domestic
employees are on visas, Cleveland said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies would pay a fee of about $2,000 to get graduates
the green cards, which would fund the visa program, as well as
scholarships for U.S. students in science, technology,
engineering and math. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We ought to keep the best and brightest and we ought to
educate the American students,&#8221; Lofgren said. &#8220;The two are not
in opposition to each other.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel and other companies have lobbied for green cards for
foreign scientists and engineers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re highly dependent on very, very high-skilled
engineers,&#8221; said Brian Toohey, president of the Semiconductor
Industry Association, which represents companies such as IBM and
Texas Instruments Inc. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have enough engineers at the
right skill level in this country.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temporary Visas &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When graduates from abroad find jobs at U.S. companies,
they often first apply for temporary visas, such as H1-Bs. The
process of turning that into a green card can often take up to a
decade, during which employees can&#8217;t leave their jobs, Cleveland
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies abuse the H-1B program by using it to import
cheap labor in place of local workers, Lofgren said at a
Congressional hearing in March. The bill gives the Department of
Labor more oversight to ensure companies pay the prevailing
wages, she said. It also keeps them from charging fees to
recruit workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These individuals get frustrated,&#8221; Cleveland said.
&#8220;They think to themselves, &#8216;Why not go back to Chengdu or go
back to New Delhi and create the next big company there?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
largest U.S. bank, ousted mortgage chief David Lowman after it
overcharged active-duty military personnel on loans and
improperly foreclosed on other borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dave Lowman and I have decided he will leave the firm,&#8221;
Frank Bisignano, the head of home-lending, said today in an
internal employee memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been taking steps this year to repair its
mortgage unit, which posted at least $3.3 billion in losses
during the first quarter. Lowman, 54, who ran home-lending since
leaving Citigroup Inc. (C) in 2006, was directed in February to
start reporting to Chief Administrative Officer Bisignano, 51.
The New York-based bank then hired Cindy Armine, Citigroup&#8217;s
chief compliance officer, last month to increase oversight as
chief control officer of home-lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We thank Dave for his five years of service to our
firm,&#8221; Bisignano said in the memo. &#8220;He worked here during
extraordinary times and has said he will take some much needed
time off.&#8221;  A message left at Lowman&#8217;s office wasn&#8217;t
immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks are dealing with the backlash from a bust in
housing as mortgage losses and related litigation suppress
earnings. Home prices in 20 U.S. cities fell 5.1 percent in the
first quarter, the largest decline since the first quarter of
2009, according to the SP/Case-Shiller index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The record discount of West Texas
Intermediate crude to North Sea Brent is widening because of
flows of light, sweet crude to Europe and Asia instead of the
U.S. Gulf Coast, Goldman Sachs said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing price gap &#8220;has been primarily driven by the
weakening of U.S. Gulf Coast light-sweet crude oil prices
relative to Brent crude, not a Cushing bottleneck,&#8221; Goldman
analysts including David Greely said today, referring to the
delivery point for the WTI contract in Cushing, Oklahoma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The arbitrage between the U.S. Gulf Coast and Europe has
flipped, and the market is now directing light-sweet crude oil
away from the U.S. Gulf Coast and toward Europe and Asia,&#8221;
Goldman said. That caused Brent&#8217;s premium to widen in June and
reach a record close of $21.80 a barrel yesterday, the bank
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downside risk for the WTI-Brent spread is &#8220;limited&#8221; in
the near term, Goldman said. The analysts expect the difference
to narrow and said they would not make a trading recommendation
on it because &#8220;the risk associated with the fundamental
uncertainty is too high.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reversal of the arbitrage was caused by lower prices
for Louisiana Light Sweet grade relative to Brent crude, which
makes it more attractive for traders to ship top-quality oils to
Europe and Asia than the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI crude moved into discount versus North Sea Brent in
August amid a glut of stockpiles at Cushing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Central Bank Governing
Council member Mario Draghi said he &#8220;knew nothing&#8221; about
Greece using off-market swaps with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I had nothing to do with this deal whatsoever,&#8221; Draghi
told lawmakers in Brussels at his confirmation hearing for the
ECB Presidency today. &#8220;The deals between the Greek government
and Goldman Sachs had been undertaken before my joining of
Goldman Sachs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece hid 5.3 billion euros ($7.7 billion) of debt using
currency swaps, the biggest of which were with Goldman Sachs,
Eurostat, the European Union&#8217;s statistics office, said Nov. 15.
Greece entered into a number of arrangements from 2001 through
2007 and their use, which it hadn&#8217;t previously reported as debt,
helped push up borrowings, leading to the nation needing a
bailout last year and triggering Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draghi, who worked at Goldman Sachs as a vice chairman from
2002 to 2005, said that &#8220;even though Goldman Sachs expected me
to work with the public sector, I had no interest and taste to
work with the public sector,&#8221; adding that &#8220;I knew nothing
about these things, nor had I done anything later on about these
things, you can ask anybody.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draghi, 63, is the only candidate to take over from ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet when he steps down in October. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) accused
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) of harassment by making a
&#8220;baseless&#8221; demand for documents as part of an investigation
the failed investment bank is conducting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s effort to force Goldman Sachs to hand over
documents related to a probe of events leading up to its
collapse in September 2008 is improper, Goldman Sachs said in a
court filing yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s move to obtain a court order &#8220;is designed purely
to harass Goldman Sachs and should be denied as baseless,
unnecessary and unwarranted,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman has said it is investigating third parties that may
have taken actions before its bankruptcy that &#8220;interfered with
and damaged&#8221; its business, according to court papers. In a
request to Goldman Sachs, Lehman sought information related to
&#8220;alleged false rumors&#8221; and the short-selling of Lehman
securities, Goldman Sachs said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is &#8220;deliberately moving at glacial pace&#8221; in
handing over information, Lehman said. Lehman wants U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James Peck to order Goldman Sachs to produce
documents it seeks within two weeks of approving the request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Slightest Bit&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, has already provided
documents, previously given to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office, that don&#8217;t support
allegations that Goldman Sachs was spreading rumors about
Lehman, it said. Lehman also hasn&#8217;t provided &#8220;the slightest bit
of evidence&#8221; that Goldman Sachs was involved in any improper
activity affecting Lehman, Goldman Sachs said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs made &#8220;diligent progress&#8221; in preparing to
respond to Lehman&#8217;s request for additional documents, and the
timeline Lehman has proposed is burdensome, the company said. It
has proposed producing documents by July 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian oil flowing into the
central U.S. should continue to swell stockpiles, widening the
record differential between New York and London futures,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening of an extension of the 591,000-barrel-a-day
Keystone pipeline to Cushing, Oklahoma, will lower the relative
value of West Texas Intermediate oil, JPMorgan analysts led by
New York-based Lawrence Eagles said today in the report.
Canadian producers cut output earlier this year because of lower
prices and full tanks in the central U.S, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One factor that helped provide a floor to the North
American market earlier this year was the cutback in Canada as a
result of full inventories and steep discounts,&#8221; the analysts
said. &#8220;Now that WTI is hovering near $100 a barrel, a greater
discount will be needed to shut-in production, especially
considering the augmented transit on the Keystone system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TransCanada Corp. completed filling the extension of the
pipeline to the hub in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil for July delivery rose 85 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $98.15 a barrel at 10:31 a.m. on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, while Brent oil for July delivery climbed $1.49, or
1.3 percent, to $120.59 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The spread between the grades widened to a record
$22.44 a barrel today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam Matthews, managing director at
JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd., comments on the outlook for
Indian stocks. He spoke at a press conference in Mumbai today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In next 3 to 5 years, we expect India to be able to
generate 20 plus percent earnings-per-share growth. We had a
modest downgrading of our medium-term, earnings-per-share
forecast. The downgrade was modest as compared to the rest of
Asia and certainly the rest of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;We still retain infrastructure beneficiaries, industrials
and cement stocks in our portfolio. Themes we have been playing
in last five years include power equipment, cement, consumption,
and bank stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;We see stalling of infrastructure building a short-term
phenomenon. Infrastructure is still the most important growth
driver in India over the next 5 to 10 years. We are bullish on
coal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;We&#8217;d like to see inflation starting to abate. We are
seeing evidence inflation starting to tail off in India. We&#8217;d
like to see wage price inflation moderating in India and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;China is better than India on valuation perspective. We
are overweight on China as it got cheap. Twelve months back,
everybody was worried consumer price index will creep to 5
percent to 6 percent. But government stimulus packages and
administrative mechanism controlled CPI and growth started to
moderate. Investors are now talking about a hard landing in
China. Investors never seem to be satisfied with China&#8217;s GDP
growth.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Xbox 360 was the
top-selling video-game console in the U.S. last month, bucking a
software-led decline that saw industry sales slump to their
lowest since October 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xbox 360 sales increased 39 percent to 270,000 units from a
year earlier, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said yesterday
in an e-mailed statement, citing industry tracker NPD Group Inc.
Sony Corp. (6758), maker of the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable,
said its hardware sales rose 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sold more Xbox 360 consoles than any other
platform 11 of the past 12 months in the U.S, according to NPD
data. Xbox 360 is likely to be number one worldwide by the end
of this year with the biggest blockbuster games, Kinect games
and experiences, NPD said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrywide, a light slate of new game software and
Nintendo Co.&#8217;s aging Wii console contributed to a 14 percent
decline in overall retail sales to $743.1 million in May, Port
Washington, New York-based NPD said in an e-mailed statement.
The figure doesn&#8217;t include digital sales of games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Overall, the Xbox 360 platform has contributed 34 percent
of year-to-date revenues&#8221; across hardware, content and
accessories, said Anita Frazier, an analyst with NPD. The
platform has gained 7 percentage points of market share, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry hardware sales dropped 5 percent to $228.9
million, and software declined 19 percent to $375.8 million, NPD
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony&#8217;s PS3 and PSP both showed unit-sales growth, NPD
reported, without citing exact figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony, based in Tokyo, suffered an almost monthlong outage
to its PlayStation Network and Qriocity online services
following a hacker attack in April. More than 100 million
accounts were illegally accessed, resulting in the second-
largest data breach in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of Nintendo&#8217;s 3DS handheld, which lets users play 3-D
games without the need for special glasses, remained light,
Frazier said. Games featuring Nintendo characters such as Zelda
should help increase sales of the hardware in coming months, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlsey Smedley, a retired
schoolteacher in Orlando, Florida, started moving her checking
account last month to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) from Bank America
Corp., where she has been a customer for more than 35 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief executive officer, had people
like Smedley in mind when he announced plans in February to open
as many as 2,000 branches, more than half of them in Florida and
California, expanding the New York-based bank&#8217;s network by
almost 40 percent. He&#8217;s targeting states dominated by Bank of
America, the biggest U.S. bank by deposits, and Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC), which has the largest branch network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy runs counter to Bank of America&#8217;s plan to
close 10 percent of its offices as analysts question whether the
industry needs a bank on every corner. Doubts about the expense
of branches have arisen as customers cut back on borrowing and
mobile and online banking take hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Two thousand is a mind-bending number, even for a bank
the size of JPMorgan Chase,&#8221; said Bob Meara, a senior analyst
with Boston-based consulting firm Celent. &#8220;Branch building on a
large scale seems tough to justify.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 55, is hoping to lure more customers like Smedley,
who said she was fed up with extra costs, as local and national
competitors retreat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;More Fees&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The service at Bank of America was okay, but they just
kept adding more and more fees,&#8221; Smedley, 74, said in an
interview outside the sleek, gray JPMorgan branch that opened
last July on Town Center Boulevard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s one of 18 JPMorgan outlets in Orlando and a five-
minute walk from where Smedley used to bank. The $150 JPMorgan
offered to put in her account helped seal the deal, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s plan is based on the theory that having more
branches enables the bank to attract deposits, which provide a
cheap source of funding in a post-crisis era, as well as to sell
investment products to customers and offer banking services to
businesses, analysts said. The strategy could add $2 billion a
year in profit, according to company calculations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also allows JPMorgan to expand its brand in markets such
as Florida and California where it gained a foothold by buying
Washington Mutual Inc., said Ryan McInerney, CEO of the firm&#8217;s
consumer bank and a member of its executive committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t have nearly the density or branch presence we
think we need to serve our current customers or acquire new
customers in those markets,&#8221; McInerney said in an interview.
&#8220;We view it as a very big opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California, Florida &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the opportunity may be overstated. Banks with
large branch networks like JPMorgan may gain little benefit from
deposits since they have few options for the funds amid a
decline in borrowing and historically low yields on fixed-income
securities, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would love to know what advantage they see in their
retail-banking model,&#8221; said Nancy Bush, a contributing editor
at SNL Financial, a bank-research firm in Charlottesville,
Virginia. &#8220;It&#8217;s good, but is it wildly superior?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With consumers trying to pay off debt and avoid new loans,
&#8220;the macro trend would be for the entire financial sector to
contract, and that means fewer branches, not more,&#8221; Bush said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s five-year strategy calls for 525 to 700 new
outlets in California, 375 to 500 in Florida, and an additional
800 elsewhere, according to an investor presentation. California
and Florida are among the top five U.S. states by deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank had 5,268 retail branches at the end of 2010,
making it the third-largest network in the U.S. behind San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo with 6,314 and Bank of America with
5,856, according to year-end filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BofA Closings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America is closing unprofitable branches, Joseph Price, head of the lender&#8217;s consumer and card-banking business,
said at a conference for investors in March. The Charlotte,
North Carolina-based company shut 200 branches in the last five
quarters through March, CEO Brian T. Moynihan said in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, still digesting its 2008 purchase of Wachovia
Corp., has chosen to add resources rather than hundreds of new
outlets. The bank, which opened 47 branches last year, placed
about 5,000 more bankers into former Wachovia offices, CEO John Stumpf said June 3. Forty-six percent of U.S. households are
within two miles of a Wells Fargo branch or automated-teller
machine, according to Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continuously adjust our store network, and as a result
we add stores in some markets and reduce them in others to make
sure we have the right number to help us serve our customers,&#8221;
Eshet said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon Turnaround &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America already has a fully developed branch
network in Florida and California, said Walter Elcock, the
executive responsible for branches. The bank has plans to add
bankers to about 1,500 branches to sell more investment,
mortgage and small-business products, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our strategy is much more focused on strengthening
relationships with existing customers,&#8221; Elcock said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
about customer acquisition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon may have the advantage and experience to make his
plan work, said Jason Goldberg, senior analyst at Barclays
Capital Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2000 to 2004, Dimon was CEO of Bank One Corp., where
he staged a turnaround that included opening more branches and
overhauling compensation. He required branches to stay open
longer after realizing competitors were closing an average of
two hours later, according to &#8220;Last Man Standing: The Ascent of
Jamie Dimon and JPMorgan Chase,&#8221; by Duff McDonald. Results at
the Chicago-based lender swung from a $511 million loss in 2000
to a $3.5 billion profit by 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WaMu Branches &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When JPMorgan merged with Bank One in 2004 and Dimon was
named president and chief operating officer, he shuttered
lagging businesses and started monthly management reviews in
local branches. The bank, now the largest in the U.S. by market
valuation, was one of the few to navigate the credit crisis
without a quarterly loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That period included the September 2008 purchase of
Seattle-based Washington Mutual, the largest bank to fail in
U.S. history. JPMorgan bought the thrift for $1.9 billion,
acquiring 2,200 branches in 12 states. Three hundred were closed
in the first six months and another 100 by the end of the first
year in markets where the two banks overlapped, according to a
person familiar with the consolidation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon estimated at an investor conference June 2 that on
average each branch makes about $1 million a year in profit,
meaning that the new outlets may contribute $2 billion to annual
profit once they&#8217;ve been open for several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absence of Profit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last nine years, JPMorgan has opened 1,000
branches and expects them to contribute $1 billion by 2018,
according to a February presentation from Charles Scharf, head
of the retail business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early years, opening and operating expenses outrun
costs, with the 117 branches that opened in 2009 reducing 2010
pretax earnings by an average of $600,000 an outlet, or $70
million, Scharf said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cost between $2 billion and $3 billion to build the
1,000 branches, Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s Matt O&#8217;Connor estimated in a
May 19 report, and JPMorgan added 6,200 salespeople between 2006
and 2010, according to Scharf&#8217;s presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new branches &#8220;aren&#8217;t going to contribute a lot to
profit over the next several years,&#8221; Scharf said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, JPMorgan&#8217;s retail division reported $31.8
billion in revenue, 30 percent of the bank&#8217;s total, and $2.53
billion in profit, or 15 percent of the total, according to the
year-end filing. That compares with revenue of $14.8 billion and
net income of $3.43 billion in 2005, or 27 percent and 40
percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strip Malls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branches typically need about $40 million of deposits to be
profitable, Paul Miller, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets in
Arlington, Virginia, said in an interview. About 15 percent of
bank branches in the U.S. hold less than $15 million in
deposits, said Brian Foran, an analyst with Nomura Securities
International Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, JPMorgan ranks second in deposits with $996
billion, behind Bank of America&#8217;s $1.02 trillion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan ranks fourth in California,
with $61 billion in deposits, and sixth in Florida, with $10.5
billion. It lags behind Bank of America, which has $222 billion
in California and $74.8 billion in Florida, and Wells Fargo,
which has $162.1 billion in California and $66.6 billion in
Florida. JPMorgan holds the top spot in New York and Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s new branches may bring an added $90 billion in
deposits, Miller wrote in a Feb. 16 report. To do so, they&#8217;ll
have to draw customers from competitors with well-placed
branches, attractive promotions and good customer service,
analysts said. New outlets must be located in high-traffic
areas, not hidden in strip malls, as many of WaMu&#8217;s branches
were, Miller said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soaking Up Deposits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s wager is that JPMorgan can soak up deposits from
shuttered community banks or beat-up regional lenders forced to
trim their footprint, Nomura&#8217;s Foran said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) and Regions Financial Corp. (RF), the third-
and fourth-biggest banks by deposits in Florida, are pulling
back, and Bank of America may close branches in the state, he
said. On top of that, 34 banks failed in Florida since the end
of 2009, and 15 have been shut by regulators in California as of
May 6, leaving a void for JPMorgan to fill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They see blood in the water,&#8221; Foran said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest banks aren&#8217;t the only ones targeting those
states. Competitors include BankUnited Inc., the Miami Lakes,
Florida-based lender brought back from collapse in 2009 by John Kanas, and OneWest Bank, the successor to IndyMac Bancorp after
the California-based lender failed in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael McCoy, a spokesman for Atlanta-based SunTrust, said
his bank has 500 branches in Florida and is &#8220;very committed&#8221;
to the market. Tim Deighton, a spokesman for Birmingham,
Alabama-based Regions, which has about 400 branches in Florida,
said the state &#8220;remains a core market for us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online and Mobile &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some customers are shunning branches. A 2010 survey by the
Washington-based American Bankers Association found that 36
percent of respondents preferred banking online compared with 25
percent who said they would rather bank in person. Even so, a
March 2011 research paper by Elif Nilay Yilmaz, a doctoral
candidate at Boston University, used Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. data to show that a 1 percent increase in the number of
branches raised a bank&#8217;s market share by 0.72 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The banks have figured out they need to be able to
deliver their products through multiple channels, and branches
are one of those that will be here to stay,&#8221; said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst with RBC Capital Markets in Portland,
Maine. &#8220;Banking has yet to find the killer app to make
branching obsolete.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will pay a $2
million fine to the Comptroller of the Currency and $25 million
to reimburse customers after using &#8220;high pressure&#8221; tactics to
sell credit insurance on car loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s customer-service representatives deceived
borrowers about costs and terms of credit protection offered to
cover missed payments in 2008 and 2009, the OCC said in a
settlement document released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chase Auto used written scripts together with oral high-
pressure sales tactics that included statements which were
materially false, deceptive or otherwise misleading in violation
of the Federal Trade Commission Act,&#8221; the regulator said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan didn&#8217;t admit or deny wrongdoing. In consultation
with the OCC, the firm developed a plan to reimburse customers
and fix deficiencies in credit protection linked to Chase auto,
home and credit-card loans, the OCC said. Chase advertised the
car-loan product, known as the Chase Payment Assurance plan, as
a way to cancel some or all monthly payments in case of
accidental death, disability, involuntary unemployment or a
leave of absence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have reimbursed affected customers and have revised
our sales scripts and marketing materials for our payment
protection products,&#8221; Patrick Linehan, a JPMorgan spokesman,
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We&#8217;ve implemented enhanced and
more extensive controls to ensure that we are treating our
customers fairly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon reassigned retail bank
CEO Charles Scharf&#8217;s duties and removed Scharf from the firm&#8217;s
15-person operating committee in a shakeup of top management
yesterday. Scharf&#8217;s responsibilities for overseeing auto and
student lending were given to card services CEO Gordon Smith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank will take &#8220;appropriate remedial actions to fully
address and correct the violations of the law,&#8221; according to
the OCC. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore" date="Jun 15, 2011  2:14 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-15/jpmorgan-s-zubrow-will-tell-congress-bank-rules-risk-hobbling-recovery.html"><headline>JPMorgan&#8217;s Zubrow Will Tell Congress Bank Rules Risk &#8216;Hobbling&#8217; Recovery</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Risk
Officer Barry Zubrow will tell Congress that regulators risk
impeding the economic recovery by going too far in tightening
bank rules and raising capital requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The regulatory pendulum clearly has now begun to swing to
a point that risks hobbling our financial system and our
economic growth,&#8221; Zubrow said in testimony prepared for
delivery tomorrow to the House Financial Services Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A capital surcharge on the largest global banks combined
with higher U.S. margin requirements for certain trading
accounts &#8220;currently risks doing more harm than good,&#8221; Zubrow
said. It also puts U.S. firms at a &#8220;distinct and unnecessary
competitive disadvantage,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remarks echo concerns expressed by JPMorgan Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon earlier this month, when he asked
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke whether he&#8217;s concerned
that overzealous regulation will stymie an economic rebound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zubrow is scheduled to testify along with Stephen O&#8217;Connor,
a managing director at New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS), and
regulators including Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman
Sheila Bair and Fed board member Daniel Tarullo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zubrow also said he opposes proposed rules that require
companies to post extra margin against certain derivatives
contracts, which are used to hedge interest-rate, currency and
other risks. The rules restrict the types of collateral that may
be posted to U.S. cash, Treasuries or agency securities. They
also would require U.S. banks to demand collateral from foreign
clients while European competitors don&#8217;t, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Too Late&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In addition, we are not permitted to accept margin in the
form of, for example, Euro Cash and G7 Sovereign Debt,&#8221; Zubrow
said. &#8220;This effect will be to kill our overseas swaps
activities; even if Europe and other regulators were to
subsequently adopt similar rules, it would be too late.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Connor, chairman of the International Swaps  Derivatives
Association, also will tell Congress tomorrow that policy and
timing disparities between U.S. and international derivatives
rules will disadvantage the nation&#8217;s financial markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences will hurt the U.S. &#8220;by driving up costs
and reducing liquidity,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said in prepared remarks.
&#8220;They do so without demonstrating any clear benefit to equal or
outweigh the considerable costs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Race to the Bottom&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Gibson, senior associate director of the Federal
Reserve, told the Senate Agriculture Committee today that global
regulators should harmonize rules on derivatives to prevent
financial risks from migrating to the least-supervised
economies. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said earlier
this month that he favored having global authorities agree on a
minimum level of regulation to avoid a &#8220;race to the bottom&#8221;
among countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, required by
the Dodd-Frank Act to write new regulations for the $601
trillion over-the-counter swaps market, may enter agreements
with foreign officials to recognize comparable rules, Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, told the Agriculture Committee today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who&#8217;s also chairman of New York-based JPMorgan,
questioned Bernanke at a June 7 conference of bankers in Atlanta
on whether regulators have gone too far in reining in the
banking system and are slowing economic growth. The U.S.
unemployment rate rose to 9.1 percent in May as the SP/Case-
Shiller index of property values in 20 cities showed that home
prices slumped in March to their lowest since 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have a great fear someone&#8217;s going to try to write a
book in 20 years, and the book is going to talk about all the
things that we did in the middle of the crisis to actually slow
down recovery,&#8221; Dimon, 55, told the Fed chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposed global capital standards would impose a 3 percent
surcharge on top of a 7 percent minimum requirement on the
largest systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs.
The rules are being drafted by a group of bank regulators who
are scheduled to decide on a preliminary plan this month and
present a final proposal to the G-20 group of nations in July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, said corporate customers adopted the Office 2010
product five times faster than the previous version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales to businesses outpaced those of Office 2007 through
the first nine months of product availability, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said today. The 2010 software suite
is the fastest selling update among regular consumers, and
almost 50 million of them are using the Web-based versions of
Office programs Microsoft released to combat Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is announcing the numbers in a blog on the one-
year anniversary of the product&#8217;s release, Takeshi Numoto, an
Office vice president, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Business Division unit, mostly sales from
Office, has been exceeding analysts&#8217; estimates, helping revenue
growth as the Windows operating-system business loses some
consumers to Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. Mountain View, California-based
Google has been trying to steal corporate and government
customers from Office with online word-processing and
spreadsheet software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Office business is the one business people feel
pretty good about,&#8221; said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at
Pacific Crest Securities Inc. in Portland, Oregon, who rates the
shares &#8220;sector perform.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s not really coming under the
same kind of attacks&#8221; as Windows and mobile software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Apps has been out for several years and there hasn&#8217;t
been mass defections, he said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud Computing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployments of Office 2010 are also beating those of Office
2003 &#8220;by a pretty significant margin,&#8221; Numoto said. Nine of 10
customers in a Microsoft satisfaction survey said 2010 was the
best Office release ever, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in the business division, the company&#8217;s biggest, rose
to $5.27 billion last quarter, exceeding the $4.9 billion
average of analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office business is being challenged by the growing
popularity of so-called cloud software delivered over the
Internet, which is allowing companies to choose from more
options, Barnicle said. Delivering software as a service over
the Internet may squeeze Microsoft&#8217;s profit margins, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) settled a
dispute with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. over documents
related to a short-selling investigation the failed investment
bank is conducting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Goldman Sachs announced the settlement today
during a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. He
didn&#8217;t disclose details. Goldman Sachs is competing with Lehman
and a creditor group led by hedge fund Paulson  Co. to propose
a liquidation plan for the defunct firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs yesterday accused Lehman of harassment in
making a &#8220;baseless&#8221; demand for documents as part of a probe of
whether rival firms contributed to its September 2008 failure by
putting pressure on its stock through rumors and so-called short
sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman said the fifth-biggest U.S. bank was  &#8220;deliberately
moving at glacial pace&#8221; in handing over information. It asked
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck to order New York-based Goldman
Sachs to produce the documents within two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), 08-13555,

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) drilled 84 wells to a
depth of two miles beneath the Indonesian rainforest to tap
steam, not oil and gas, that&#8217;s trapped in the world&#8217;s richest
store of volcanic energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil driller&#8217;s geothermal plant, set among wild orchids
and bamboo trees, uses 315 degree Celsius (600 degree
Fahrenheit) heat to spin turbines 24 hours a day, generating
electricity for Jakarta, a four-hour drive to the north.
Chevron, which pioneered geothermal energy 20 years ago in
Southeast Asia&#8217;s biggest economy, is about to see competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies from General Electric Co. (GE) to India&#8217;s Tata Corp.
are leading an investment boom in Indonesia that may climb to
more than $30 billion, anticipating President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono will honor his promise in February to boost clean-
energy subsidies. The pledge has spurred the biggest geothermal
spending spree in Asia and the largest outside of the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s great momentum in Indonesia&#8217;s geothermal market,
and demand for power is there,&#8221; Mark Taylor, a geothermal
analyst in Washington at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said in
an interview. &#8220;But there are regulatory risks for developers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was burned by Indonesia in the late 1990s, when the
state-owned utility forced it to renegotiate a power-purchase
accord. The San Ramon, California-based oil company is now
planning to expand its geothermal operations, helping Yudhoyono
eliminate energy shortages that threaten his target for as much
as 6.6 percent economic growth through his term&#8217;s end in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Geothermal Superpower&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geothermal is central to Indonesia&#8217;s push for alternatives
to fossil fuels such as oil, which the country once exported and
now must import, driving up costs and curbing growth. Brownouts
are frequent on the main island of Java, and 35 percent of the
nation&#8217;s 245-million population doesn&#8217;t have access to
electricity, the International Energy Agency has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation, described by clean-energy investor Al Gore in
January as the first potential &#8220;geothermal superpower,&#8221; plans
9.5 gigawatts of capacity by 2025. That&#8217;s more than triple the
U.S.&#8217;s geothermal use and about 33 percent of Indonesia&#8217;s
electricity demand, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia&#8217;s 17,000 islands straddle the Pacific Ocean&#8217;s
volcanic &#8220;ring of fire,&#8221; making the country to geothermal
power what the Middle East is to oil -- the world&#8217;s largest
potential resource with 40 percent, or about 28 gigawatts, of
the total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4% of Potential &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geothermal currently provides about 0.3 percent of global
electricity and 0.2 percent of energy for heat, and with better
policy incentives those levels could climb to 3.5 percent and
3.9 percent, respectively, the Paris-based International Energy
Agency said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has tapped about 4 percent of its potential and
has orders for 2.3 gigawatts of plants, second only to the U.S.,
New Energy Finance data show. A gigawatt, about equal to the
output of a new atomic reactor, needs $2 billion to $4 billion
of investment, Taylor said. In comparison, Iceland, also a
volcanic island, got 27 percent of the country&#8217;s electricity
from geothermal, according to government figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a remarkable opportunity for Indonesia to
increase the amount of power generated from geothermal,&#8221; said
Stephen Green, former head of Chevron&#8217;s Indonesia and
Philippines operations and now its vice president of policy,
government and public affairs. &#8220;There are synergies between oil
and geothermal and it makes sense for us to exploit that,&#8221; he
said in an interview Chevron&#8217;s Jakarta office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia hasn&#8217;t always appealed to foreign investors, and
skepticism still goes beyond questions of how to uncork the
boiling water that&#8217;s trapped miles below the surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama&#8217;s Stepfather &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Asian financial crisis, state-owned utility PT
Perusahaan Listrik Negara canceled power purchase agreements
with companies including PT Paiton Energy, 40 percent owned by
Irvine, California-based Edison Mission Energy, because it
couldn&#8217;t afford the contracts after the collapse of the rupiah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unocal Inc., which built the plant in the rainforest and
was acquired by Chevron in 2005, was forced to renegotiate a
deal to sell its power at 4 to 5 U.S. cents a kilowatt-hour
instead of 6 cents to 7 cents. Unocal negotiated Indonesia&#8217;s
first foreign-partnership geothermal license in 1982 with the
help of U.S. President Barack Obama&#8217;s late stepfather, Lolo
Soetoro, who worked for Unocal as a government liaison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rainforest plant was opened in Mount Halimum Salak
National Park in 1992. Together with another about 100 miles
west in Dajarat, Chevron lights homes for 4 million people. To
capitalize on the new tariffs for geothermal electricity, the
company is planning new plants including a potential 200-
megawatt facility in South Sumatra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Interest &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geothermal investors are again &#8220;starting to look at
Indonesia as a place where they can do business,&#8221; Ravi
Krishnaswamy, a Singapore-based director for energy consultancy
Frost  Sullivan, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia began consuming more oil than its domestic
production capacity in 2004 as economic growth surged. It
suspended membership in the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries, or OPEC, in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher oil prices give the government more incentive to
promote geothermal power, Chevron&#8217;s Green said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generators use wells to tap underground deposits of
scalding water. At Salak, hot water and steam are pumped from as
deep as 3,211 meters (10,535 feet) below the surface through 54
kilometers (34 miles) of pipes to turn turbines to make power.
Each well takes as much as 90 days to drill and costs up to $7
million, Chevron says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Dependence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s no shortage of foreign interest. Sumitomo Corp. (8053),
Japan&#8217;s third-biggest trading company, is building a 110-
megawatt plant in nearby Ulubelu. Australia&#8217;s Origin Energy Ltd.
is partnering with power company Tata in northern Sumatra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s good for the environment and good for reducing our
dependence on oil,&#8221; Widhyawan Prawiraatmadja, General Electric
Co.&#8217;s Indonesia company executive, said in a phone interview
from Jakarta. &#8220;It also frees up tradable resources such as oil
and gas and coal to be exported.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet geothermal deals in Indonesia remain &#8220;very
difficult,&#8221; according to BNEF. The government&#8217;s decision to
raise the price that state-owned utility PLN pays for geothermal
power to up to 9.7 cents per kilowatt-hour may backfire, Vandana Gombar, a geothermal analyst at BNEF, wrote in a February
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utility usually opts for cheaper coal power that
enables it to sell electricity to consumers at the government-
mandated 6-7 cents per kilowatt-hour. The policy hinges on
whether the government will continue to subsidize PLN at the
higher prices because the increase can&#8217;t yet be passed on to
consumers, Gombar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s plan is a &#8220;pipe dream&#8221; until it&#8217;s
prepared to force consumers to pay more for their electricity,
Ari Soemarno, former president of Indonesia&#8217;s state-owned oil
company PT Pertamina, said in an interview. The government can&#8217;t
afford to keep subsidizing power yet isn&#8217;t brave enough to force
consumers to buy at cost, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper stockpiles in China, the
world&#8217;s biggest consumer of the metal, may have dropped 50
percent in the past two months, potentially spurring more
imports and higher prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inventories in bonded warehouses, used to store shipments
before duties are paid, may have declined to about 300,000
metric tons, according to estimates from traders and analysts in
China including Shanghai East Asia Futures Co. The warehouses,
whose holdings aren&#8217;t disclosed, contained about 600,000 tons at
the end of March, according to Standard Bank Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased shipments into China, which represents about 40
percent of global demand, may mean a rebound in prices that fell
9.8 percent from a record in February. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
anticipates copper trading at an all-time high of $11,000 a ton
in 12 months as mining companies fail to keep pace with demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Metal has been leaving the bonded warehouses at quite a
steady pace because it is the peak-demand season,&#8221; said Jia
Zheng, a trader at Shanghai East Asia. &#8220;China is still growing,
which is keeping demand robust.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-month futures on the London Metal Exchange peaked at
$10,190 per ton on Feb. 15, before tumbling on concern that
global economic growth may be slowing. The metal, used in pipes
and wires, traded at $9,184 a ton at 11:31 a.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher prices would benefit Phoenix, Arizona-based
Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc. (FCX), Chile&#8217;s state-owned
Codelco, and Australia&#8217;s BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP), the top three
producers last year, according to London-based researcher CRU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Production &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s policy makers have been raising interest rates and
ordering banks to set aside more cash to curb inflation that
rose 5.5 percent in May, the fastest pace since 2008. Data this
week also showed industrial production gained 13.3 percent in
May, faster than forecast. The World Bank predicts China&#8217;s
economy to expand 9.3 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Demand has definitely picked up,&#8221; said Che Hongyun,
deputy director of research at Galaxy Futures Co., who also
estimated that holdings in bonded warehouses have dropped to
about 300,000 tons over the past two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of copper held in warehouses monitored by the
Shanghai Futures Exchange, fell 53 percent from this year&#8217;s high
on March 17 to 83,275 tons last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Drew Massively&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand in China last month &#8220;was likely being met largely
out of inventory, which drew massively,&#8221; Goldman analysts
Allison Nathan and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a June 10 report. The
report stuck with a 12-month price forecast of $11,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper stored in bonded warehouses has fallen about 150,000
tons in the past two months, Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) said in a June
6 report. The bank had estimated the stockpiles were 550,000
tons on April 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital analyst Gayle Berry also said bonded
holdings have dropped and forecast an increase in imports,
according to a June 3 report. The Chinese market &#8220;is awakening
from the destocking cycle that lasted nine months,&#8221; Nicholas Snowdon, an analyst at Barclays Capital, said June 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s copper-products output was 979,000 tons last month,
20 percent more than a year earlier, according to data from the
country&#8217;s statistics bureau. Imports of copper and copper
products were 254,738 tons last month, 36 percent lower than a
year earlier, according to data June 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher Imports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;latest numbers from China show that the country is
drawing down its domestic inventories rapidly,&#8221; Tobias Merath,
the Zurich-based head of global commodity research at Credit
Suisse AG, wrote in a note yesterday. &#8220;China will have to step
up its imports in the coming months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near-term copper supplies in China have been more expensive
than longer-dated contracts since April, suggesting increasing
demand or tighter short-term availability. Spot copper in
Shanghai&#8217;s Changjiang, the biggest cash market, was 740 yuan a
ton more than futures today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Downstream demand is steady,&#8221; said Li Ye, an analyst at
Minmetals Starfutures Co., referring to manufacturers that use
copper to make products. &#8220;Traders have little problem finding
buyers for metal once it leaves the warehouse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s copper imports have fallen as local output has
risen and prices overseas have been more expensive, making
imports unprofitable for traders who seek to exploit price gaps
between markets. Refined-copper output in China hit a record
470,000 tons in March and was 439,000 tons in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper in London has traded at a premium to futures in
China, falling 2.3 percent between April 1 and May 31 compared
with the 3 percent drop in Shanghai, where prices include a 17
percent value-added tax. Copper for August delivery on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange gained 1.3 percent to 68,610 yuan
($10,584) a ton today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Copper Study Group has forecast a
377,000-ton global shortage this year. High prices will last &#8220;a
substantial amount of years&#8221; on demand from China, Diego Hernandez, Codelco&#8217;s chief executive officer, said June 8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. (INTC) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) may
have help in their multiyear effort to bring more high-skill
workers from overseas into the U.S. under a bill Representative
Zoe Lofgren introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lofgren, a Democrat from California, introduced a bill
yesterday that would provide green cards, or permanent
residence, to more foreign students who earn at least a master&#8217;s
degree in science or engineering at U.S. universities. It also
gives green cards to foreign entrepreneurs who start companies
employing five or more U.S. citizens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies, from Intel and Microsoft to
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), have backed efforts to
make it easier for scientists and engineers from abroad to come
to the U.S. Many scientists come to the U.S. for their post-
graduate education and leave when they can&#8217;t get a visa to stay,
said Peter Cleveland, Intel&#8217;s vice president of global public
policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We drop the ball when we let these individuals take this
education elsewhere,&#8221; he said in a phone interview. &#8220;We should
have them stay here and work for Apple, work for Facebook, work
for Intel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduates with master&#8217;s degrees and higher in science,
technology, engineering and math who get jobs related to their
degrees would qualify for green cards under Lofgren&#8217;s bill.
Entrepreneurs from abroad would get a temporary residence and
could petition to stay permanently after two years if their
businesses are still open and employing U.S. citizens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s smoking cessation aid
Chantix, already carrying a warning it raises risks of suicide,
may be tied to higher heart danger in patients with
cardiovascular disease, U.S. regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration found infrequent chest
pain, heart attacks and other adverse reactions in a study of
700 people with cardiovascular disease, the agency said today in
a statement. The information will be added to the warnings and
precautions section of the prescribing information for Chantix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA is requiring New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
biggest drugmaker, to further evaluate the heart risks with an
analysis of existing studies. Chantix, approved in 2006,
generated $755 million in sales last year. The revenue has
fallen since the FDA warned in 2009 that the medicine may
increase the chance of suicide or erratic behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The known benefits of Chantix should be weighed against
its potential risks when deciding to use the drug in smokers
with cardiovascular disease,&#8221; the FDA said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The overall cardiovascular event rates reported in the
study were low,&#8221; Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to discuss the analysis of existing
studies and the product labeling with FDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 5 cents to $20.24 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chantix affects dopamine, a chemical in the brain involved
in controlling mood and behavior. Because dopamine triggers a
positive mood response, regulating its levels can remove some of
the pleasure derived from smoking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DG FastChannel Inc. (DGIT), the network
operator that links advertisers with radio and television
stations, is weighing a sale and working with Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) to find buyers, according to three people with
knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irving, Texas-based company, which has a market value
of about $755 million, may seek $1 billion, or about 10 times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the plans
aren&#8217;t public. The company has started soliciting bids and most
of the potential buyers are private-equity firms, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DG FastChannel fell 68 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $28.21 as
of 3:25 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. It
has dropped 29 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company tried to sell itself twice before, according to
the people. One attempt failed as buyers balked at the price,
while the company halted the process another time, these people
said. The current effort also may not lead to a deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JoAnn Horne, a spokeswoman for DG FastChannel, couldn&#8217;t be
reached for comment. Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DG FastChannel said today it agreed to buy MediaMind
Technologies Inc., a New York-based provider of integrated
digital advertising solutions, for $517 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, added Debora L. Spar, president of
the women-only liberal arts school Barnard College, to its board
at a meeting today in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spar, who turned 48 today, will sit on the audit, risk,
compensation and corporate governance and nominating committees,
New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a statement. She joined New
York&#8217;s Barnard College in July 2008 after 17 years on the
faculty of Harvard Business School. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which was the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history before the 2008 financial collapse,
has been a target of regulatory and political investigations
since then. The firm paid $550 million last year to settle a
civil fraud suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission and
has denied claims by a U.S. Senate subcommittee this year that
the firm misled clients into buying mortgage-linked securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein&#8217;s
wife, Laura, is a Barnard College alumna and is listed on the
school&#8217;s website as a member of the board of trustees. She has
resigned that post, Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, said today. The Lloyd  Laura Blankfein Foundation
donated $50,000 to Barnard College in fiscal 2010, which ended
Jan. 31, 2010, and $25,000 in the previous year, according to
the nonprofit&#8217;s federal tax filings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission proposed expanding scrutiny of how brokerages handle
trillions of dollars in client assets in a measure that reflects
the enduring regulatory impact of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC commissioners voted 5-0 yesterday to seek comment on a
rule that would increase disclosures required of broker-dealers
who hold investor funds, building on a 2009 rule for investment
advisers. The measure would require enhanced audits of 300
brokers with custody of client assets and quarterly disclosures
from all 5,000 registered firms on how they handle funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule -- subject to a 60-day comment period -- would
require that a broker-dealer&#8217;s internal controls be checked by a
registered public accounting firm and would let regulators
examine audits. Brokerages would have to tell the SEC whether
they have access to client money and how access is controlled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing law requires broker-dealers to be audited each
year by a firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board. The PCAOB, which is required by the Dodd-Frank
Act to start inspecting the audits, established an interim
program for the reviews yesterday. The SEC proposal would expand
what the audit watchdog sees in those examinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s 2009 effort to look more deeply at investment
advisers&#8217; custodial practices was a response to Madoff, who is
serving a 125-year prison term after pleading guilty to
defrauding clients out of billions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer-Credit Raters to Open Books to Critics on U.S. Board &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is likely to
place the three major credit-reporting bureaus, Equifax Inc. (EFX),
Experian Plc and TransUnion LLC, under direct supervision by
federal examiners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul requires the
new agency to propose regulations by July 21, 2012, on whether a
company constitutes a &#8220;larger participant&#8221; in consumer
financial services. That designation would lead to supervision
similar to that of banks for the three firms, which provide
credit reports on borrowers to prospective lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three credit bureaus are likely to meet that legal test,
Corey Stone, the consumer agency&#8217;s assistant director for credit
information markets, told consumer advocates last month,
according to three people present at the meeting. Bureau
officials have also delivered this message directly to two of
the three firms, according to the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top officials at the consumer bureau have been critical of
credit information bureaus in the past. Consumer advocates have
long charged that the Big Three bureaus -- as Experian,
TransUnion and Equifax are often known -- aren&#8217;t transparent
about how credit scores are calculated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Klein, a spokesman for Equifax, said federal officials
have told the Atlanta-based firm it will face supervision.
Colleen Tunney, a spokeswoman for closely held TransUnion in
Chicago, said her firm hasn&#8217;t been explicitly informed but that
&#8220;we do expect to be supervised by the CFPB.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Hadley, senior vice president for government affairs
and public policy at Dublin-based Experian, said the agency&#8217;s
creation marks a new relationship between his company and the
U.S. government, including supervision. The full impact
&#8220;depends on implementation,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budget Cuts for Consumer Bureau, IRS Proposed by Republicans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. House Republicans proposed limiting the funding for
the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and placing the
agency under the congressional appropriations process by 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services
released the measure yesterday, which would limit to $200
million the amount the Federal Reserve can transfer to the new
agency in fiscal 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July, created the consumer
bureau and called for it to be funded by a percentage of the
Fed&#8217;s budget, as much as $500 million per year, with the
bureau&#8217;s director deciding how much is needed. The Republican
bill includes the requirement that, effective Oct. 1, 2012,
appropriations would be made by Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans, who almost unanimously opposed the Dodd-Frank
Act, have sparred with Democrats over the new agency&#8217;s funding
and mission. The appropriations measure includes $19.9 billion
in funding for agencies under the panel&#8217;s jurisdiction,
including the Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and General Services Administration. That is 9
percent less than last year and almost $6 billion less than the
request of President Barack Obama. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haldane Eyes Shadow Banking as New BOE Panel Targets Bubbles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Financial Policy Committee may target unregulated
bank transactions as it seeks to prevent bubbles and end the
pattern of rivals taking competitive risks said Andrew Haldane,
a Bank of England official and member of the new panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FPC must &#8220;advise government when we think risks have
migrated outside of the conventional banking system into what is
these days called the shadow banking system,&#8221; Haldane said in
an interview in London yesterday. Evidence of &#8220;banking-type
activities&#8221; in &#8220;non-regulated parts of the system&#8221; could
compel the FPC to ask the government to expand its powers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interim FPC meets today for the first time as part of
Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s shake-up of banking regulation.
The panel will be chaired by Bank of England Governor Mervyn
King. Haldane, executive director for financial stability at the
bank, said officials are still deciding what tools will be used
to shield the economy from financial risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haldane said lenders will welcome an end to the &#8220;Chuck
Prince dynamic,&#8221; where the former Citigroup Inc. (C) Chief
Executive Officer was quoted in 2007 as saying that so long as
rivals were taking big risks, he would too. Haldane said the FPC
may solve the problem of banks being powerless to act against
the tide when the environment is &#8220;a bit on the risky side.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank will hold a press conference on June 24 to
discuss the results of today&#8217;s meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain Rejects Proposal to Reform Mortgage Foreclosures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain&#8217;s Parliament rejected a law that would have eased the
effect of mortgage foreclosures for as many as 300,000
homeowners who have lost their properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Galician National Block, known as the BNG in Spain, had
asked legislators to amend the law to allow mortgage holders to
walk away from their debt by handing over the keys to their
properties, as well as permitting homeowners to delay mortgage
payments beyond agreed-upon deadlines. Lawmakers rejected the
proposals, Parliament said on its website late last night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Spanish law, if a foreclosed property is sold for
less than the outstanding mortgage on the asset, the bank can
claim the difference from the borrower, pursuing all of a
borrower&#8217;s present and future assets and earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of foreclosed properties in Spain has climbed
tenfold in three years.     Spain&#8217;s Parliament has created a
committee to study possible changes to the country&#8217;s mortgage
rules and whether the current law allows for abusive practices,
the assembly said on its website on June 8. The commission has
until December to present a report on its findings. &lt;/p&gt;

insurance on car loans, the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s customer-service representatives deceived
borrowers about costs and terms of credit protection offered to
cover missed payments in 2008 and 2009, the OCC said in a
settlement document released yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chase Auto used written scripts together with oral high-
pressure sales tactics that included statements which were
materially false, deceptive or otherwise misleading in violation
of the Federal Trade Commission Act,&#8221; the regulator said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan didn&#8217;t admit or deny wrongdoing. In consultation
with the OCC, the firm developed a plan to reimburse customers
and fix deficiencies in credit protection linked to Chase auto,
home and credit-card loans, the OCC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan&#8217;s retail unit,
wasn&#8217;t immediately available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tussle Over Indonesian Agency Raises Bank Supervision Risks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tussle between lawmakers and the government over
Indonesia&#8217;s planned financial regulator has raised the risk of
political interference in bank supervision, highlighting the
nation&#8217;s struggle to eliminate corruption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority parliamentary working
committee, which is holding meetings this month to debate
whether lawmakers can appoint two members to the nine-person
board of commissioners for the agency, hadn&#8217;t reached a
&#8220;compromise&#8221; as of yesterday, said Andi Rachmat, deputy
chairman of the working group. The government&#8217;s proposal for the
board would exclude members of parliament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome may influence the effectiveness and
independence of an authority set to take over regulation of
capital markets, insurers, pension funds and banks from the
finance ministry and central bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC Postpones Most Dodd-Frank Swaps Rules Scheduled for July &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission postponed
almost all Dodd-Frank Act rules for the $601 trillion swaps
market that were scheduled to take effect in mid-July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency provided the delay in an order released
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delay will give the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading
Commission more time to complete rules for the market that are
aimed at increasing transparency and reducing risk after largely
unregulated swaps helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC on June 14 proposed a six-month delay of Dodd-
Frank provisions scheduled to take effect July 16. The agency&#8217;s
commissioners could decide to push the deadline into 2012 if
they find that more time is needed, according to the CFTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS &#8216;Pleased&#8217; With Swiss Upper House Decision on Capital Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, said it is &#8220;pleased&#8221;
with the decision by the upper house of parliament June 15 to
cap capital requirements at 19 percent at the group level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upper house is debating the government&#8217;s proposal to
raise capital requirements for UBS and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN),
the biggest Swiss banks, to avoid the need for a bailout in a
crisis. The parliamentarians June 15 approved the government&#8217;s
clarification that total capital needs would be capped at 19
percent of assets weighted according to the risks at the group
level. The banks had said enforcing the requirement at unit
level may result in higher capital needs for the groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final vote in the upper house on the so-called too-big-
to-fail legislation is expected for today, said parliament
spokesman Mark Stucki. The proposals, which require approval
from the lower house of parliament, will be debated in the next
three-week session starting Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CFPB Bank Supervisor Says Agency Oversight Set to Start July 21 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Antonakes, the top bank supervisor at the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau, said oversight of banks with more
than $10 billion in assets will start as planned on July 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made the remarks at a conference of the American Bankers
Association in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antonakes&#8217;s unit will supervise 111 banks, thrifts and
credit unions controlling about 80 percent of U.S. banking
assets, about $10 trillion worth, he said. The consumer bureau
will conduct &#8220;point-in-time examinations&#8221; that will last four
to 12 weeks, depending on the size and complexity of the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the supervision will continue for two years, if
&#8220;the exam is clean.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At firms with more than $100 billion in assets, there will
be &#8220;continuous supervision in which we will have a presence at
the institution throughout most of the year,&#8221; Antonakes said.
That regular presence may include, for example, product reviews
of credit cards or mortgage origination, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer bureau has completed the task of transferring
bank examiners from other federal regulators and is wrapping up
that process so it can recruit more examiners from outside the
government, Antonakes said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency, created by the Dodd-Frank Act, is scheduled to
begin work on July 21. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gibson, Gensler Testify On Capitol Hill About Derivatives &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Gibson, senior associate director of the Federal
Reserve, and Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, testified about regulations on derivatives
and swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The goal of all of these efforts is to develop a
consistent international approach to the regulation and
supervision of derivatives products and market
infrastructures,&#8221; Gibson told lawmakers at a Senate Agriculture
Committee hearing yesterday in Washington. &#8220;Our aim is to
promote both financial stability and fair competitive conditions
to the fullest extent possible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooksley Born of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission,
Daniel Roth of the National Futures Association, Charles Conner
of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives and Adam Cooper
of the Managed Funds Association were also scheduled to speak

&lt;p&gt;Osborne to Back Vickers Plan for U.K. Retail-Bank Firebreaks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne will back
proposals to erect firebreaks around the consumer-banking units
of British banks as he seeks to protect taxpayers and depositors
during future financial crises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osborne was scheduled to express his support for
recommendations drawn up by the Independent Commission on
Banking in April for the first time in public during his annual
Mansion House speech to bankers in London yesterday evening,
according to a Treasury official who declined to be named in
line with government practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of the panel, John Vickers, a former Bank of
England chief economist, was asked by the government last year
to recommend ways to boost stability and competition in the
British banking industry. The Treasury spent 65.8 billion pounds
($108 billion) rescuing Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) and
Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) during the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While endorsing the principles of the proposals by
Vickers&#8217;s panel, Osborne won&#8217;t give details of how much extra
protection he will require for retail banks, the official said.
Instead, the chancellor will wait for Vickers&#8217;s final
recommendations on Sept. 12 before deciding how much extra
capital the retail operations of banks should hold above the 7
percent recommended by international regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed&#8217;s Parkinson Says High Quality Capital Should Back Surcharge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve&#8217;s top banking supervisor said the
largest global banks should retain an additional buffer against
potential losses in the form of &#8220;high quality capital.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed and banking regulators around the world are
currently discussing the size of capital cushions for the
largest financial firms, considering whether that buffer should
be in the form of common equity or hybrid securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Federal Reserve strongly supports such efforts to
increase the level and quality of regulatory capital for our
internationally active banking organizations,&#8221; Patrick
Parkinson, director of the division of Banking Supervision and
Regulation, said yesterday in the text of a speech in
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The additional requirement should be met with high-
quality capital that can reliably absorb losses and allow the
institution to remain a going concern,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

Trichet as head of the European Central Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parliament&#8217;s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee
yesterday in Brussels approved Draghi&#8217;s nomination to become ECB

&lt;p&gt;Former Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) broker
Eric Butler had his securities-fraud conviction overturned by a
federal appeals court, which ruled that Brooklyn, New York, was
the wrong venue for the trial on the charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York yesterday upheld
Butler&#8217;s conviction on two conspiracy counts. Butler was
convicted in 2009 of fraudulently selling securities that cost
investors more than $1.1 billion in losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No conduct that constituted the offense took place in the
Eastern District&#8221; of New York, which includes Brooklyn, the
Manhattan-based court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler and his partner Julian Tzolov intentionally misled
clients about securities purchased on their behalf, falsely
claiming they were backed by federally guaranteed student loans.
The men told clients the investments, actually backed by riskier
corporate debt and subprime mortgages, were a safe alternative
to bank deposits or money-market funds, according to prosecutors
in the office of U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch in Brooklyn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will review the Second Circuit&#8217;s decision and consider
our options,&#8221; Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for Lynch, said in an
e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re grateful that the court reversed on the substantive
count and would have preferred an outright reversal,&#8221; Steven F.
Molo, a lawyer for Butler at MoloLamken LLP in Manhattan, said
in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals panel said that, because of its decision,
Butler will have to be resentenced. In January 2010, U.S.
District Judge Jack B. Weinstein sentenced Butler to five years
in prison on each count, to be served concurrently. He has been
out on bail pending his appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Tzolov, 08-cr-370, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). The appeal is U.S. v.
Tzolov, 10-562, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Nvidia Analyst Says He Passed Tips to Networker Jiau &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) financial analyst testified he passed
confidential information about his company to a former Primary
Global Research LLC consultant after she befriended him and
suggested they form an investment club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonny Nguyen, 39, the former analyst, testified that he
passed data about Nvidia&#8217;s quarterly earnings once to Winifred
Jiau, 43, in August 2008. He said the two met when Jiau worked
as a contract employee at the Santa Clara, California-based
chipmaker in about 2007 and she was about to leave the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiau, 43, is on trial charged with illegally passing tips
about Nvidia and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) to hedge fund
managers. She is the first of the expert networkers, who provide
industry information to financial company clients, to go to
trial on charges of securities fraud and conspiracy. She faces
as long as 25 years in prison if convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She was asking me to provide Nvidia&#8217;s inside
information,&#8221; Nguyen testified, adding that he knew that&#8217;s what
she wanted. &#8220;I had access to all the company&#8217;s financial
data,&#8221; Nguyen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Avi Weitzman asked Nguyen what he
understood Jiau&#8217;s motive was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My understanding was that she was going to buy or sell
for personal gain,&#8221; Nguyen said. &#8220;It would be stock tips of
inside information from various companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Jiau, 1:11-cr-00161, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algosaibi Drops Defense of HSBC $250 Million Default Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi  Brothers Co., a Saudi investment
company that defaulted on billions of dollars of debt, won&#8217;t
defend itself against a $250 million U.K. lawsuit filed by HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) and four other banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algosaibi switched course during a London trial after
deciding the judge would likely find the company hadn&#8217;t done
enough to prevent the forgery and fraud it alleges were behind
the loans, the family said yesterday in a statement. The company
has said Maan al-Sanea, a family relation and founder of Saudi
conglomerate Saad Group, wrongfully got about $9.2 billion of
loans in Algosaibi&#8217;s name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It could be found in this case that if the Algosaibis
knew there was&#8221; improper use of loans &#8220;they should have taken
more aggressive steps to detect and prevent the massive forged
lending scheme,&#8221; said Eric Lewis, Algosaibi&#8217;s legal coordinator
with the law firm Baach Robinson  Lewis Pllc in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case follows a global dispute between Algosaibi and al-
Sanea, one of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s richest men who married into the
family before founding Saad Group. Units of the conglomerates,
both based in the Saudi oil city of Al-Khobar, defaulted in 2009
after borrowing about $15.7 billion from more than 80 banks.
Algosaibi has sued al-Sanea in the Cayman Islands, Saudi Arabia
and New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Milton, a spokesman for Saad Group from Cardew Group
in London, declined to comment when reached yesterday by phone.
The company has previously denied all claims by Algosaibi,
sometimes referred to as AHAB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC spokesman Brendan McNamara declined to comment on the
case until a judgment is handed down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3M Sued by U.K. Over Development of Superbug Detection Product &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M Co. (MMM), the maker of products including Scotch tape and
Post-it Notes, is being sued by investors including the U.K.&#8217;s
Ministry of Defence for failing to market and develop technology
that detects hospital superbug MRSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.K. unit of 3M bought the superbug detector in 2007 and
then let it &#8220;whither,&#8221; Stephen Phillips, a lawyer for Porton
Capital Ltd. and Ploughshare Innovations Ltd., a civilian unit
of the Ministry of Defence, said at a trial yesterday. The
investors are seeking $54 million in lost profits, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porton and Ploughshare Innovations sold 3M a company called
Acolyte, which had obtained regulatory approval for MRSA
detection product BacLite, Phillips said. Part of the sales
price was a payment based on net Acolyte sales in 2009, capped
at 41 million pounds ($66.5 million) according to court
documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By a mixture of delay, incompetence and lack of due
diligence by the 3M group, BacLite was allowed to whither on the
vine,&#8221; Phillips said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, 3M scaled back, and then terminated the marketing
of Acolyte&#8217;s sales activities, resulting in no payment for the
claimants, Phillips said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company said in a statement
on its website that it ceased marketing BacLite because it
proved not to be &#8220;commercially viable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the view of the company, BacLite was not commercially
viable and it failed to meet certain standards of the
marketplace, so the company discontinued its efforts to sell the
product,&#8221; 3M lawyer William A. Brewer III said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is 2008-877 Porton Capital Technology Funds v. 3M
UK Holdings Limited. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP Sues Oracle in California Over Breach of Contract Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) sued Oracle Corp. over claims that in a
period of eight months Oracle has moved from partner to &#8220;bitter
antagonist.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed yesterday in state court in San Jose,
California, cites Oracle&#8217;s hiring of Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s former
Chief Executive Officer Mark Hurd last year and Oracle&#8217;s March
announcement that it would no longer support its database
software on Hewlett-Packard computer servers that use the
Itanium chip. Oracle also has used &#8220;strong-arm tactics&#8221; in
forcing customers to &#8220;shift from HP&#8217;s Itanium server hardware
to Oracle&#8217;s own server hardware,&#8221; the suit said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, which also cites libel claims, follows Hewlett-
Packard&#8217;s June 8 letter to Oracle demanding that the software
maker keep supporting a server chip made by Intel Corp. (INTC),
reiterating its concern that the move will hurt customers and
trammel competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 22, Oracle said that it would stop developing
software for Intel&#8217;s Itanium chip that powers Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s
line of Integrity servers, which can cost hundreds of thousands
of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle, in an e-mailed statement, said Hewlett-Packard knew
of Intel&#8217;s plans to terminate its Itanium processor, and said
the company attempted to mislead customers and shareholders into
believing such plans don&#8217;t exist. Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s claim that
Oracle breached an agreement to support Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s
Itanium processor is false, Oracle said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard spokesman Bill Wohl said in an interview
that its lawsuit is an attempt to address harm to its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company demands Oracle reverse its decision on Itanium
support and change its licensing scheme for the Itanium
processor, Wohl said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Oracle Corp. (ORCL),
111CV203163, California Superior Court, Santa Clara County. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Seeks to Collect $403.8 Million in Deutsche Bank Accord &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court seeking
to collect $403.8 million as part of a 2010 non-prosecution
agreement with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) over improper tax shelters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank admitted in December to criminal wrongdoing
and agreed to pay $553.6 million to avoid prosecution over
fraudulent shelters that generated $29 billion in phony tax
losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint filed yesterday, the U.S. government asked
for the $403.8 million it said Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank had
turned over to the U.S. Treasury Department in satisfaction of
its forfeiture obligation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Gallagher, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, had no immediate
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government claimed that from 1996 to 2002, Deutsche
Bank helped wealthy U.S. citizens avoid taxes through 15
different shelters, including transactions called &#8220;BLPS,&#8221;
&#8220;FLIP&#8221; and &#8220;HOMER.&#8221; In the settlement, Deutsche Bank said it
participated in at least 1,300 transactions for more than 2,100
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. $403,794,153.00 in U.S. Currency, 11-
cv-04045, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group Sued Over Sale of Hotel Owner Extended Stay &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX) was sued over its 2007 sale of Extended
Stay Inc., which left the hotel company insolvent and drove it
into bankruptcy, a trust for Extended Stay creditors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone &#8220;siphoned&#8221; $2.1 billion from the company as
part of the leveraged buyout without regard for how it would
perform following the deal, the creditor trust said in lawsuits
filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan and New
York State Supreme Court. Blackstone called the suits meritless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Blackstone siphoned $2.1 billion of value from the
debtors, rendering them insolvent, undercapitalized and unable
to survive,&#8221; the complaints state. &#8220;The defendants were well
aware of the financial harm of the LBO, but nevertheless caused
or allowed it to happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone, based in New York, sold Extended Stay to David
Lichtenstein&#8217;s Lightstone Group LLC for $8 billion, according to
a Lightstone statement at the time. Lichtenstein and Lightstone
are also named as defendants in the lawsuits. Extended Stay
filed for bankruptcy in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The real cause of the company&#8217;s bankruptcy was an
economic tsunami which resulted in across-the-board revenue per
available room declines of more than 20 percent,&#8221; Christine
Anderson, a Blackstone spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;This was an industrywide phenomenon that landed
every large lodging transaction executed in 2006-2007 in
bankruptcy, foreclosure or restructuring.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A representative of Lightstone couldn&#8217;t immediately be
reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is Extended Stay Litigation Trust v.
Blackstone Group LP., 11-02254, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The state-court case is
Extended Stay Litigation Trust v. Blackstone Group, 651667-2011,
New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centro Sued Over $9.4 Billion Sale of Assets to Blackstone &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centro Properties Group (CNP) said it was sued over claims that a
proposed $9.4 billion sale of its U.S. malls to a unit of
Blackstone Group LP must be approved by shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartec Capital Pty, which owns less than 0.5 percent of
Centro&#8217;s outstanding shares, filed the lawsuit in the Federal
Court of Australia, Melbourne-based Centro said yesterday. The
Australian Securities Exchange ruled that Centro didn&#8217;t need
shareholder approval to sell the U.S. assets, the shopping-mall
manager said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Real Estate Partners VI LP, a unit of the
world&#8217;s biggest private-equity firm, agreed to buy Centro&#8217;s 588
U.S. malls on March 1. Centro is selling assets to pay debt that
totaled A$16 billion as of Dec. 31, according to its financial
statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Centro considers that this proceeding is misconceived,&#8221;
the company said in the statement. Smartec&#8217;s actions are
&#8220;diverting management resources and expense and damaging and
being inconsistent with the best interests of all security
holders,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) settled a dispute with Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) over documents related to a short-selling
investigation the failed investment bank is conducting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Goldman Sachs announced the settlement
yesterday during a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. He didn&#8217;t disclose details. Goldman Sachs is
competing with Lehman and a creditor group led by hedge fund
Paulson  Co. to propose a liquidation plan for the defunct
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs accused Lehman June 14 of harassment in
making a &#8220;baseless&#8221; demand for documents as part of a probe of
whether rival firms contributed to its September 2008 failure by
putting pressure on its stock through rumors and so-called short
sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman said the fifth-biggest U.S. bank was  &#8220;deliberately
moving at glacial pace&#8221; in handing over information. It asked
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck to order New York-based Goldman
Sachs to produce the documents within two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS Client Greeley Charged in U.S. Tax Case in San Francisco &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UBS AG (UBSN) client, Robert E. Greeley, was charged by
prosecutors in California with filing a false tax return that
failed to disclose two Swiss accounts held in the name of Cayman
Islands entities that he controlled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greeley controlled a UBS account named Meyrin Investors
from 2002 through at least 2008 and one named Exchange Preferred
Limited from 2004 through at least 2008, according to a criminal
charge filed June 14 in federal court in San Francisco. Greeley
was charged with filing a 2008 tax return that didn&#8217;t disclose
those accounts or the interest income earned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greeley couldn&#8217;t immediately be located for comment, and
court records didn&#8217;t include the name of his lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greeley is one of more than two dozen former UBS clients
accused of tax crimes since 2007. Zurich-based UBS avoided U.S.
prosecution in February 2009 by paying $780 million, turning
over the names of U.S. account holders and saying it helped
Americans hide assets from the Internal Revenue Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Greeley, 11-cr-374, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adelphia&#8217;s Rigases Lose Bid to Dismiss Criminal Tax Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adelphia Communications Corp. founder John Rigas and his
son Timothy, who are in prison for securities fraud, failed to
persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a pending criminal tax case
against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Rigas, 86, is serving 12 years and Timothy Rigas, 55,
17 years for looting the cable company and lying about its
finances. After a federal jury in New York convicted them in
2004, U.S. prosecutors in Pennsylvania charged the two with
conspiring to dodge taxes on $1.9 billion they stole from
Adelphia, a cable-television company that collapsed in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rigases asked a judge to dismiss the tax charges,
claiming prosecutors in the New York case interfered with their
rights to legal counsel and a fair trial by threatening Adelphia
with indictment if it supported them, including by advancing
legal fees. U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, said June 14 that those actions were irrelevant
because they occurred before the New York fraud case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the Rigases were indicted in the instant tax evasion
prosecution, they had already been convicted of federal
securities fraud violations,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;That Adelphia did not
provide them at that point with legal fees to defend themselves
in the instant indictment is nothing short of typical business
practice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attorney for the Rigases, Lawrence McMichael, said he
was disappointed by the ruling. He intends to file a similar
motion in federal court in New York, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rigas, 05-cr-402, U.S. District Court,
Middle District of Pennsylvania (Harrisburg). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second Rothstein Associate Pleads Guilty in Investment Scam &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second associate of convicted fraudster Scott Rothstein
admitted to his role in a $1.2 billion investment scheme
involving fake lawsuit settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Caputi, a 53-year-old nightclub manager, pleaded
guilty yesterday to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud
before U.S. District Judge William Zloch in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida. Howard Kusnick, formerly of Rothstein&#8217;s law firm,
entered a guilty plea to the same charge June 14 in West Palm
Beach, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothstein pleaded guilty last year to five counts of
racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud, admitting he sold
investors interests in bogus settlements in sexual-harassment
and whistle-blower suits. He was sentenced to 50 years in
prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caputi attended meetings with potential investors in the
scheme, posing as a banker or a plaintiff in the phony suits,
federal prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have a lot of remorse and regret for what I&#8217;ve done,&#8221;
Caputi told the judge. &#8220;I want to get this behind me and get on
with my new life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caputi faces a maximum term of five years in prison at his
sentencing, which is set for Aug. 24. Prosecutors agreed to take
his cooperation in their investigation into account when making
a sentencing recommendation, Zloch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hy Shapiro, Caputi&#8217;s attorney, declined to comment after
yesterday&#8217;s hearing. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Kaplan also
had no comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Kusnick, 11-60125, U.S. v. Caputi,
11-60124, U.S. v. Renie, 11-60123, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, will open a physical commodities
sales and trading office in Houston, according to a person
familiar with the plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs expects to hire about a dozen sales and
trading professionals for the office by the end of the year,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the
information isn&#8217;t public. Some of the new hires for the office
will come from outside the firm and some will relocate from New
York and London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trey Griggs, who is currently a managing director in energy
sales in New York, will relocate to Houston to be the head of
commodities for the office, the person said. Ben Freeman, a
trader based in London, will relocate to lead commodities
trading in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company wants to establish a local
trading and sales presence for clients in Houston, according to
the person. Physical commodities trading will include crude,
refined products, natural gas liquids and coal, the person said.
The office is expected to open this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t disclose how much money it makes from
commodities trading. The business is folded into a larger unit
known as fixed-income, currencies and commodities, or FICC, that
is Goldman Sachs&#8217;s largest by revenue, accounting for 35 percent
of the firm&#8217;s revenue in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) are the top firms
among traders of over-the-counter commodity derivatives,
according to a recent report by Greenwich Associates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s plan to open a Houston office was reported
earlier on the SparkSpread website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abraaj Capital Ltd. hired Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to find a
buyer for its Turkish hospital unit Acibadem Saglik Hizmetleri 
Ticaret AS, according to two people with knowledge of the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraaj, based in Dubai, plans either to sell its entire
stake to a single buyer, or offer the shares on the market, said
the people, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acibadem&#8217;s market value is 2.25 billion liras ($1.4
billion), based on today&#8217;s closing share price. Abraaj has a 46
percent stake in Almond Holding, which owns 92 percent of
Acibadem, according to data on the website of the Istanbul Stock
Exchange. The stock rose 9.3 percent to 22.45 liras at 5:30 p.m.
in Istanbul, extending earlier gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraaj&#8217;s Turkey manager, Selcuk Yorgancioglu, didn&#8217;t answer
phone calls seeking comment on the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraaj Capital, the biggest private equity firm in the
Middle East and North Africa, bought the Acibadem stake for
about $606 million in 2007 and 2008. Funds under management were
$6.6 billion at the end of 2009, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s growing health-care industry has attracted
investors including Carlyle Group, the world&#8217;s second-largest
private-equity firm. Carlyle bought 40 percent of hospital
operator Medical Park Saglik Grubu AS for an undisclosed price
in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acibadem, based in Istanbul, operates 11 general hospitals,
8 medical centers and a laboratory and genetic diagnostic center
in Turkey, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pablo J. Salame, one of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s four sales and trading chiefs, plans to move
to New York from London this summer and may take a new
assignment, according to three people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salame, a 45-year-old Ecuadorian, joined Goldman Sachs in
1996 and has worked in London since 2002. A Goldman Sachs
partner since 2000, Salame was co-manager of global credit,
mortgages, emerging markets trading and equity derivatives
before he became co-head of the securities unit in 2008 with
David B. Heller, Edward K. Eisler and Harvey M. Schwartz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s securities division, which includes sales
and trading of equities, fixed-income, currencies and
commodities, is the New York-based firm&#8217;s biggest and most
profitable unit. It produced 56 percent of the company&#8217;s revenue
in 2010 and both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, and his top deputy, President and Chief Operating
Officer Gary D. Cohn, 50, helped lead securities trading before
rising to their current roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Salame may keep his position as a co-head of the
securities unit, he&#8217;s also considering new roles, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the negotiations
aren&#8217;t public. Salame&#8217;s move to New York would put three of the
four global heads of securities trading in the city, with
Eisler, 41, remaining in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salame started his career at Goldman Sachs, the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, in emerging markets currency
trading and later helped lead the global emerging debt markets
group. The experience in developing markets may lead him to work
more closely with J. Michael Evans, 53, who was named global
head of growth markets in January, two of the three people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, like many rivals, is aiming to do more
business in fast-growing economies like Brazil, Russia, India
and China. Cohn told investors earlier this month that China,
India and Brazil are three places where Goldman Sachs is doing
the most hiring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salame didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment and Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, said Salame
wouldn&#8217;t comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s second-
quarter profit estimate was reduced 40 percent by an analyst at
Atlantic Equities LLP, who said the firm&#8217;s trading and investing
revenue is declining, making job cuts more likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will likely earn $2.17 per share, down from a
previous estimate of $3.49, Richard Staite wrote today in a note
to investors. Staite expects trading revenue to tumble to $4.9
billion, a 27 percent decrease from the first quarter, and
investing and lending gains to narrow to $200 million from $2.7
billion, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;About half the cut is due to weaker trading revenues
while the other half is driven by lower investment gains,&#8221;
wrote Staite, who has a &#8220;neutral&#8221; recommendation on Goldman
Sachs stock. &#8220;Given the weak environment we expect jobs to be
cut across the industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
dropped 19 percent in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
so far this year on concern about weaker revenue and increased
regulation. Staite&#8217;s estimate for Goldman Sachs&#8217;s second-quarter
earnings per share puts the London-based analyst below the $3.56
average forecast of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs earned $4.38 per share in the first quarter
of this year and $0.78 per share in the second quarter of 2010.
Staite wrote that he expects the New York-based firm&#8217;s second-
quarter return on tangible equity, or ROTE, will be 8 percent,
while the full-year ROTE will be 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staite said he expects Goldman Sachs&#8217;s fixed-income,
currencies and commodities trading revenue to drop 33 percent
from the first quarter to $2.9 billion in the second quarter,
while equity trading revenue may fall 15 percent to $2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-banking revenue, which includes fees from merger
advice and underwriting, will probably rise to $1.3 billion, or
4 percent, from the first quarter, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MBIA Inc. (MBI) hid potential losses of as
much as $950 million on commercial real estate debt as it sought
New York regulators&#8217; approval to restructure its insurance
business in 2008, banks including Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and UBS
AG (UBSN) claimed in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York insurance regulators were given an internal
presentation that included &#8220;manual overrides&#8221; of loan data
that dropped potential losses from the debt to zero, the banks
said in a brief that was filed in redacted form in March and
unsealed yesterday in state court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When making its case to the regulators, MBIA, once the
world&#8217;s biggest bond insurer, deleted parts of a presentation
originally given in November 2008 to the company board&#8217;s credit
risk committee. Those deletions showed that in a &#8220;more
stressful economic environment&#8221; the insurer could have losses
from the debt as much as $950 million, according to the court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks&#8217; claim is &#8220;absolutely false&#8221; and regulators
were told of both the overrides and the impact they had on loss
projections, Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for MBIA, said in an
interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The evidence is clear and unequivocal that all of the
issues with respect to these overrides were clearly and
unequivocally communicated to the insurance department, and the
insurance department acknowledges that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was not
just disclosed, but it was discussed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Dinallo, then the state&#8217;s insurance superintendent,
approved the split in 2009, allowing Armonk, New York-based MBIA
to move its guarantees on state and municipal bonds out of the
unit that insured some of Wall Street&#8217;s riskiest mortgage debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, UBS and other institutions sued MBIA and
the state under New York&#8217;s Article 78, which allows court review
of state administrative decisions. The banks say the
restructuring allowed MBIA to move $5 billion from the company&#8217;s
MBIA Insurance Corp. unit into a new insurer in a bid to revive
its business of guaranteeing state and municipal debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasowitz said a trial is expected in early 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re completely confident that the proceeding is going
to uphold and approve the determination of the superintendent of
insurance in approving the transformation,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Article 78 case is ABN Amro Bank NV v. Dinallo, 601846-
2009, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hedge Fund Paymasters&#8217; Bought Inside Tips From Jiau &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Primary Global Research LLC consultant got friends
at Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) to give her
financial data she sold to her &#8220;hedge fund paymasters,&#8221; a
prosecutor told a jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a brazen insider-trading scheme, and at the
heart of it was Winifred Jiau,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Avi
Weitzman said yesterday in closing arguments at her trial in
Manhattan federal court. &#8220;Just like her hedge fund clients, she
did it for the money,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiau, 43, is charged with illegally passing nonpublic
financial information about the two Santa Clara, California-
based technology companies to hedge fund managers. She&#8217;s the
first of the so-called expert networkers to go on trial since
the U.S. charged at least a dozen people beginning in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiau, of Fremont, California, is charged with securities
fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. If convicted
she faces as long as 25 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weitzman said Jiau befriended Sonny Nguyen, then a senior
financial analyst for Nvidia, and Stanley Ng, an accountant with
Marvell, to obtain the information she then sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nguyen testified for the prosecution as one of three
cooperating witnesses. He pleaded guilty to federal charges in
May. Ng was placed on administrative leave by Marvell in January
after he refused to cooperate with an internal investigation,
court records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah Freeman, a former SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio
manager, testified that he had a secret agreement with Samir
Barai, founder of New York-based Barai Capital Management LP, to
pay Primary Global for exclusive access to Jiau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanna Hendon, Jiau&#8217;s lawyer, told the jury that despite
the government&#8217;s assertion her client was at the center of the
insider-trading scheme, Barai and Freeman had many other sources
of inside information. There was no evidence they considered her
tips serious enough to base trades upon, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She showed jurors the raft of e-mails concerning Marvell
financial information which was sent by another person the
portfolio managers nicknamed &#8220;10-K&#8221; because Freeman said his
tips were as complicated as a company&#8217;s filing. Hendon also
presented jurors with Jiau&#8217;s trading records that showed she
lost tens of thousands of dollars when she traded in Marvell and
Nvidia stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who is presiding over the
case, told jurors yesterday that they will hear a rebuttal
summation from a prosecutor today and then he will instruct them
on the law. They will then begin their deliberations, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Jiau, 1:11-cr-00161, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debit-Card Swipe-Fee Cap &#8216;Not Traditional,&#8217; Bank Lawyer Argues &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A planned cap on the debit-card swipe fees charged to
merchants by the biggest U.S. banks is &#8220;discriminatory,&#8221; a
lawyer for one of the affected banks told a U.S. appeals court
panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timothy D. Kelly, a lawyer for TCF National Bank, told the
St. Louis-based court yesterday that it should reverse a trial
judge&#8217;s decision denying the bank&#8217;s bid to block the cap while
the lender challenges its legality. The provision is scheduled
to take effect July 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limit on per-transaction charges is part of the Dodd-
Frank financial overhaul. Banks with more than $10 billion in
assets won&#8217;t be allowed to collect more than the cost of
providing the service, making profit impossible, TCF claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Below-cost rates and widespread exemptions are not
traditional rate regulation,&#8221; Kelly told the three-judge panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCF, a Sioux Falls, South Dakota, unit of TCF Financial
Corp. (TCB), sued last year seeking to invalidate the measure, arguing
it violates the U.S. Constitution&#8217;s promises that the government
will not confiscate private property without just compensation
and of equal protection under the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government has &#8220;unlimited discretion&#8221; to
regulate the U.S. banking industry, Justice Department lawyer
Lindsey Powell told the judges, in defense of the regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The as-yet-unannounced rate is to be fixed by the Federal
Reserve. It&#8217;s part of a regulatory program intended &#8220;to restore
to reasonable levels&#8221; fees charged to merchants and, through
them, to consumers, attorneys for the government argued in
appellate filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is the lead
defendant in the TCF suit, which also names Vice Chairman Janet
Yellen, four Fed governors and Acting Comptroller of the
Currency John Walsh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower-court case is TCF National Bank v. Bernanke, 10-
cv-04149, U.S. District Court, District of South Dakota (Sioux
Falls). The appeal is TCF National Bank v. Bernanke, 11-1805,

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Credit Suisse Broker Should Go to Prison Now, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) broker Eric Butler, whose
conspiracy conviction for fraudulently selling securities was
upheld June 15, should go immediately to prison, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld two conspiracy convictions
against Butler. It reversed a securities-fraud conviction,
ruling that Brooklyn, New York, was the wrong venue for the
trial on the charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In light of the Court of Appeals&#8217; decision, the
government now moves for the defendant&#8217;s immediate remand,&#8221;
U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch in Brooklyn said yesterday in a
court filing. The appeals court said Butler needs to be
resentenced, and Lynch asked for a court date for that &#8220;as soon
as possible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler and his partner Julian Tzolov were accused of
intentionally misleading clients about securities purchased on
their behalf, falsely claiming they were backed by federally
guaranteed student loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men told clients the investments, actually backed by
riskier corporate debt and subprime mortgages, were a safe
alternative to bank deposits or money-market funds, according to
Lynch&#8217;s office. Victims&#8217; losses were more than $1.1 billion,
according to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven F. Molo, a lawyer for Butler at MoloLamken LLP in
Manhattan, didn&#8217;t return a call for comment on Lynch&#8217;s request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2010, U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein
sentenced Butler to five years in prison on each count, to be
served concurrently. He has been out on bail pending his appeal.
Butler, who was found guilty at a trial in 2009, also was fined
$5 million on the securities-fraud conviction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court rejected the government&#8217;s argument that
Butler could be tried for securities fraud in the Eastern
District of New York because he and Tzolov flew out of John F.
Kennedy International Airport in Queens, which is part of the
district, to meet with clients they defrauded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Tzolov, 08-cr-370, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). The appeal is U.S. v.
Tzolov, 10-562, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayer Loses U.S. High Court Case on Baycol Class-Action Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for two West
Virginians to seek class-action status in a suit against a Bayer
AG (BAYN) unit over its withdrawn cholesterol drug Baycol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday unanimously overturned a decision
that said the pair was bound by a ruling rejecting a West
Virginia class-action bid in an earlier Baycol suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Smith and Shirley Sperlazza are seeking to sue Bayer
Corp. on behalf of all West Virginians who took Baycol. They
said they shouldn&#8217;t be bound by the earlier ruling because they
weren&#8217;t involved in that case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer withdrew Baycol from the market in August 2001. The
U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Baycol was linked to
rhabdomyolysis, a sometimes-fatal muscle breakdown disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Smith v. Bayer, 09-1205, U.S. Supreme Court
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-IMF Chief Strauss-Kahn Told Police He Had Immunity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-
Kahn told police he had diplomatic immunity when he was first
detained at a New York airport, according to a filing by
Manhattan prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn, 62, who is awaiting trial on charges of
sexually assaulting and attempting to rape a Manhattan hotel
maid on May 14, made the statement after police stopped him at
John F. Kennedy International Airport the day of the alleged
attack, according to the disclosure form sent yesterday to New
York State Supreme Court Justice Michael Obus in Manhattan, who
is presiding over the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would like you to come with us,&#8221; Detective Diwan
Maharaj told Strauss-Kahn on the jetway before taking him to the
Port Authority Police precinct at the airport about 5 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have diplomatic immunity,&#8221; Strauss-Kahn said while
being handcuffed, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Where is your passport?&#8221; Maharaj asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not in this passport, I have a second passport,&#8221;
Strauss-Kahn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn has a laissez-passer travel document issued by
the United Nations. The UN modifies laissez-passer agreements
based on the status of the relevant organization and its
officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn&#8217;s lawyers, Bill Taylor and Benjamin Brafman,
haven&#8217;t claimed their client enjoys diplomatic immunity. After
surrendering his French passport to the district attorney&#8217;s
office, his lawyers said they would get the laissez-passer,
which was in Strauss-Kahn&#8217;s Washington office, and turn it over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brafman didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail about yesterday&#8217;s
filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algosaibi Overwhelmed by Claims, Lawyer Says Can&#8217;t Pay EIIB &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Islamic Investment Bank Plc (EIIB) is seeking payment of
its $78 million claim against Saudi investment firm Ahmad Hamad
Algosaibi  Brothers Co. without a trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EIIB, which filed its claim on behalf of a group of other
banks, sought the ruling from a London judge after Algosaibi
admitted June 15 liability in another case where HSBC Holdings
Plc (HSBA) and four other banks are seeking $250 million from the
company. Algosaibi, which has defaulted on its debt, said there
isn&#8217;t enough money to go around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They would like to pay, but they are unable,&#8221; Ewan
McQuater, Algosaibi&#8217;s lawyer, said at yesterday&#8217;s hearing. The
company &#8220;is overwhelmed&#8221; by demands for payment, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EIIB, a London-based lender whose deals comply with Sharia
law, in March lost a bid to join the HSBC case before trial
began. HSBC&#8217;s lawsuit stems from the largest Saudi default to
come out of the credit crunch and includes claims by British
Arab Commercial Bank Ltd., Arab Banking Corp. and Credit
Agricole SA. (ACA) Algosaibi dropped its defense of the HSBC case
after deciding it would probably lose if the 10-week trial
continued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Courtovich, a spokesman for Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia-
based Algosaibi, declined to comment on EIIB&#8217;s request for
summary judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has said Maan al-Sanea, an Algosaibi family
relation and founder of Saudi conglomerate Saad Group,
wrongfully got about $9.2 billion of loans in Algosaibi&#8217;s name.
The company is suing him in other jurisdictions. Litigation
under way in the Cayman Islands could ultimately affect more
than 100 banks that made loans to Algosaibi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toshiba Among Display Makers Sued for Price Fixing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toshiba Corp. (6502), Sharp Corp. and at least 13 other makers of
liquid-crystal displays were sued by retailer P.C. Richard  Son
Inc. over claims they conspired to fix prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning about 1996, the companies &#8220;met in person or
communicated by other means to agree on LCD product prices and
the amount of LCD products each would produce,&#8221; according to
the complaint filed yesterday in federal court in Brooklyn, New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Farmingdale, New York-based P.C. Richard,
the suit was filed by Pontiac, Michigan-based ABC Appliance
Inc., which runs retailer ABC Warehouse, and Marta Cooperative
of America Inc., a buying cooperative based in Scottsdale,
Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven of the defendants have admitted to participating in
the conspiracy and paid millions of dollars in criminal fines,
according to the lawsuit. Best Buy Co., the world&#8217;s largest
consumer-electronics retailer, sued the display makers last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keisuke Oomori, a spokesman for Tokyo-based Toshiba, said
the company is checking on the matter. Miyuki Nakayama, a
spokeswoman for Osaka, Japan-based Sharp, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is P.C. Richard  Son Long Island Corp. v. AU
Optronics Corp., 11-2903, U.S. District Court, Eastern District
of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heineken Wins Cut to EU Beer Cartel Fine in Court Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heineken NV (HEIA), the world&#8217;s third-largest brewer by volume,
and Bavaria NV won bids to reduce antitrust fines levied by the
European Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU General Court cut Heineken&#8217;s fine to 198 million
euros ($280 million) from 219.3 million euros and Bavaria&#8217;s fine
to 20.7 million euros from 22.8 million euros. The Luxembourg-
based court said the European Commission failed to prove the
extent of the cartel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commission has not proved that the infringement
concerned the occasional coordination of commercial conditions,
other than prices, offered to individual customers in the on-
trade segment,&#8221; said the court. Handwritten notes on which the
commission relied included references that &#8220;are sporadic and
brief&#8221; about which the companies &#8220;have put forward a plausible
alternative explanation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission, the EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator, fined the two
brewers and Dutch rival Royal Grolsch NV in April 2007 for
coordinating prices in the Netherlands from at least 1996 to
1999. InBev NV, which has since merged with Anheuser-Busch Cos.
to become the world&#8217;s largest brewer, escaped a fine after
tipping off EU officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court largely confirmed the commission&#8217;s decision to
impose &#8220;deterrent fines&#8221; in an important market for consumers,
Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the Brussels-based regulator,
said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed that the general court has not
accepted all of our arguments, but we appreciate that the court
has reduced the amount of the original fine,&#8221; Jean-Francois van
Boxmeer, chief executive officer of Heineken, said in the
statement. The company said it &#8220;will consider its options&#8221;
after it has studied the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are T-235/07, Bavaria v. Commission; T-240/07,
Heineken Nederland and Heineken v. Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edison, Air Liquide EU Rulings May Aid Fine Cuts, Lawyers Say &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edison SpA (EDN) and Air Liquide SA (AI)&#8217;s successful challenges to
European Union antitrust fines may aid companies seeking to
avoid paying fines for competition violations committed by
subsidiaries, lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edison yesterday won a EU court challenge to a 58.1
million-euro ($82 million) antitrust fine based on errors
committed by EU regulators. Air Liquide SA, the world&#8217;s biggest
producer of industrial gases, also won its bid to overturn the
EU&#8217;s decision of collusion in the cartel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU General Court in Luxembourg said regulators failed
to consider evidence submitted by Edison showing it didn&#8217;t have
decisive influence over units involved in the cartel. The
European Commission in April slashed a fine against
ArcelorMittal SA by 80 percent, saying they couldn&#8217;t force the
company to pay fines imposed on several of the steelmakers&#8217;
units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Until today&#8217;s judgment no parent company had ever before
managed to escape liability,&#8221; said Alfonso Lamadrid, a lawyer
at Garrigues in Brussels. &#8220;This is one of the most common
grounds of appeal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court also reduced Solvay SA (SOLB)&#8217;s fine in the case to
139.5 million euros, from 167 million euros. FMC Corp. (FMC) lost an
appeal to overturn or cut a 25 million-euro penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the Brussels-based
antitrust agency, said the regulator carefully asses the
decision &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The general court confirmed the correctness of the
commission&#8217;s decision as regards parental liability,&#8221; by
upholding regulators&#8217; decision to require two other companies in
the cartel, FMC and SNIA SpA, to pay their units&#8217; fines, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brussels-based Solvay, the world&#8217;s largest soda-ash maker,
got the highest penalty of 167 million euros plus a 26 million-
euro fine for Solvay Solexis, which it acquired from Edison in
2002. Erik De Leye, a spokesman for Solvay, had no immediate
comment on yesterday&#8217;s fine reduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are: T-185/06, L&#8217;Air Liquide v. Commission; T-
186/06, Solvay v. Commission; T-191/06, FMC Foret v. Commission;
T-192/06, Caffaro v. Commission; T-194/06, SNIA v. Commission;
T-195/06, Solvay Solexis v Commission; T-196/06, Edison v.
Commission; T-197/06, FMC v. Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Message Juror Gets Eight-Month Sentence in U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An English juror was jailed for eight months after she used
Facebook Inc.&#8217;s social-networking service to contact a defendant
in a drug case and discussed the jury&#8217;s deliberations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanne Fraill, 40, was sentenced yesterday by the Chief
Justice Igor Judge and two other judges. She admitted to
contempt of court at a hearing earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Her contact with the acquitted defendant as well as her
repeated searches on the Internet constituted flagrant breaches
of the orders made by the judge for the proper conduct of the
trial,&#8221; Judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time someone has been punished for
contempt of court because of contact over the Internet,
according to U.K. Solicitor General Edward Garnier, who
prosecuted the case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boeing Case Jets Obama Lawyer From Obscurity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing under threat of a subpoena isn&#8217;t the only reason
Lafe Solomon may be uncomfortable when U.S. lawmakers question
unfair-labor charges he brought against Boeing Co. (BA) today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uproar over cases he&#8217;s filed since President Barack
Obama named him acting general counsel of the National Labor
Relations Board a year ago was a shock after 39 years of
relative anonymity as a career employee with the federal agency,
Solomon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone from one or two Google pages to hundreds,&#8221;
Solomon, 61, said in an interview with Bloomberg Government.
&#8220;Nothing really prepared me for the nonlegal parts of this job.
I never could have imagined any of this, ever.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon has become a public enemy to business groups and
their Republican allies, especially after his April 20 complaint
saying Boeing built a nonunion assembly plant for its new 787
Dreamliner in South Carolina in retaliation for work stoppages
by unions at its Seattle-area production hub. Boeing, the
world&#8217;s largest aerospace company, has denied such motives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, headed
by Republican Representative Darrell Issa of California, is
holding today&#8217;s session in North Charleston, site of the plant.
The hearing&#8217;s title indicates the reception Solomon may receive:
&#8220;Unionization Through Regulation: The NLRB&#8217;s Holding Pattern on
Free Enterprise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The committee has made it clear that it is their
intention to subpoena me if I do not voluntarily appear,&#8221;
Solomon wrote in a June 10 letter to Issa. Solomon said he would
show up even though he was concerned about lawmakers questioning
&#8220;an agency acting in its quasi-judicial capacity about its
decisions in a pending case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judge Hearing Google Suit Over Microsoft Contract Tough on U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Judge Susan G. Braden, who will rule on Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s
challenge to an Interior Department plan to buy Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
products, pushes agencies to prove contracts are awarded in fair
competitions, court records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 62-year-old judge is weighing Google&#8217;s allegation that
the department improperly favored Microsoft for a planned $59.3
million e-mail services contract. The companies are vying for a
foothold in the U.S. government cloud-computing market, valued
at as much as $20 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A George W. Bush nominee who joined the U.S. Court of
Federal Claims in 2003, Braden&#8217;s experience as a litigator has
translated into a no-nonsense judicial style that focuses on the
facts, lawyers and former clerks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The judge does not mince words,&#8221; David Nasse, a former
clerk, told Bloomberg Government. &#8220;She&#8217;s incredibly thorough.
If you&#8217;re not prepared, and you don&#8217;t know the facts of your
case, she&#8217;s going to let you know that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is advising
clients to avoid delaying investment decisions for Russia until
it becomes clear who will be the next president in elections in
March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s not a lot of wisdom to wait,&#8221; said Christopher Barter, co-chief executive officer for Goldman&#8217;s Russia unit, at
a conference in St. Petersburg today. &#8220;Our advice to clients
who think there could be a dramatic change is not to wait. The
opportunities are enormous and valuations are very attractive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
have yet to announce whether either will run for the presidency
next year and political uncertainty before parliamentary
elections in December and the 2012 vote are spurring capital
flight from Russia, German Gref, chief executive officer at OAO
Sberbank, the nation&#8217;s largest lender, said April 15. Russia&#8217;s
central bank posted $30 billion of outflows in the first four
months of the year, near the $35.3 billion for all of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
jumped to fourth place in handling equity sales for Russian
companies last year, its highest position ever, behind VTB
Capital and Renaissance Capital, both based in Moscow, and
Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The old perception of Goldman Sachs in Russia is that we
haven&#8217;t been consistent in our efforts in this country,&#8221; Barter
said in an interview in Moscow May 12. &#8220;This is not the reality
today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sberbank, Yandex &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman was one of the four banks chosen by the central
bank June 14 to manage a sale of part of its stake in Sberbank,
a transaction that may be worth as much as $7 billion. It also
helped sell 300 million pounds ($487 million) of sterling-
denominated bonds issued by OAO Russian Railways June 15 and
assisted with Russian search engine owner Yandex NV&#8217;s $1.3
billion initial public offering in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year was the biggest for Russian mergers and
acquisitions since 2007, helped by 96 deals worth $50.9 billion
in the fourth quarter alone, Bloomberg data show. Russia has
seen deals worth $36 billion in the first half, up from $26
billion for the same period a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A large part of why these banks are coming to St.
Petersburg is because of this MA and privatization business,&#8221;
said Clemens Grafe, chief economist for Goldman in Russia, at
the conference in St. Petersburg on June 16. &#8220;The old corporate
landscape is changing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks Still Cheap &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian stocks are still cheap, Jim O&#8217;Neill, chairman of
Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television in Hong Kong, broadcast May 13. A global
stock rally &#8220;could start in China,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s benchmark Micex Index has risen 21 percent over
the last year, advancing to a three-year high on April 6. The
30-stock gauge slid 2.3 percent last week as oil, the country&#8217;s
main export earner, tumbled 6.3 percent on concern Greece&#8217;s debt
crisis will hobble a global recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skype Technologies SA, the Internet-
calling service being bought by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), is firing
senior executives before the deal closes, a move that reduces
the value of their payout, according to three people familiar
with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vice Presidents David Gurle, Christopher Dean, Russ Shaw
and Don Albert were dismissed from the Luxembourg-based company,
said the people, who requested anonymity because the departures
aren&#8217;t public. Chief Marketing Officer Doug Bewsher and Anne
Gillespie, head of human resources, were also fired. Executives
Ramu Sunkara and Allyson Campa, from the 2011 Qik purchase, were
also let go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the dismissals means stock options will be
worth less than if the executives stayed until the closing of
the $8.5 billion deal, the people said. When a company gets
bought, compensation is often tied to the purchase price, said
Neil Sims, a managing director at Boyden, a search firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All is good if you&#8217;re staying with that transition team
or you&#8217;re packaged out,&#8221; said Sims, who is based in San
Francisco. &#8220;But if you&#8217;re eliminated unceremoniously, without a
package and without some negotiation, you could certainly lose
unvested options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver Lake, based in Menlo Park, California, led a $2
billion buyout of a 70 percent stake in Skype from EBay Inc. (EBAY) in
2009. The private equity firm and several Skype directors have
actively voiced their opinions on who should be fired, two of
the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny Farrelly, a spokeswoman for Silver Lake, and Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Management Changes&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As part of a recent internal shift, Skype has made some
management changes,&#8221; said Brian O&#8217;Shaughnessy, a Skype
spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver Lake hired Chief Executive Officer Tony Bates from
Cisco Systems Inc. to replace Josh Silverman last year. Bates
has put his stamp on Skype by trying to restore its engineering-
centric roots, churning out more features at a faster pace for
its 170 million active users. He also streamlined a global
management structure that was decentralized and fraught with
territorial disputes and slow bureaucracy. The company was
headed for an initial public offering before Microsoft agreed to

&lt;p&gt;FTC Approval &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced the Skype acquisition on May 10 and
plans to connect it to Outlook e-mail, Xbox game console,
Windows mobile phones and corporate-phone software. Skype offers
voice and video calling over the Internet and is primarily used
by consumers. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said it approved
the deal, according to a June 17 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gurle joined Skype in January 2010, overseeing its efforts
to persuade corporations to adopt Skype. Dean served under
Silverman as chief strategy officer, helping forge a partnership
with Facebook Inc. Albert oversaw advertising endeavors
including a partnership with The Oprah Winfrey Show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six of the departures were previously reported by Skype
Journal, a blog that covers the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skype was founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis. The founders sold the company for $2.6 billion in 2005 to
San Jose, California-based EBay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) units were sued by the federal agency that
regulates credit unions, seeking to recover money lost on
mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Credit Union Administration Board, or NCUA,
accused the institutions of packaging and selling mortgage bonds
with loans that didn&#8217;t meet underwriting guidelines. The bonds,
sold to federally chartered credit unions, caused more than
$800 million in losses, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A material percentage amount of the loans included in the
bonds &#8220;were all but certain to become delinquent or default
shortly after origination,&#8221; the regulator said in two
complaints filed in federal court in Kansas City, Kansas. It
didn&#8217;t specify the amount of money sought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five so-called wholesale credit unions failed because they
purchased mortgage-backed securities that lost about $50
billion, David Small, an NCUA spokesman, said in an interview.
After repackaging about $28 billion worth of the bonds and
selling $10 billion worth, the final loss to the entire federal
credit union system will be between $7 billion and $9 billion,
Small said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency plans to sue between five and 10 additional
banks related to the mortgage bonds, Small said. Agency
officials are in settlement talks with the banks, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Untrue Statements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold credit unions almost $213 million of mortgage
bonds using sale documents that contained untrue statements or
lacked important information, according to one complaint. RBS
used documents with the same flaws to sell credit unions about
$138 million of bonds, the NCUA said in the other complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCUA wants the banks to help cover losses caused by the
failures of the credit unions, including U.S. Central Federal
Credit Union, which was placed into conservatorship in 2009. The
agency is liquidating the wholesale credit unions. Wholesale
credit unions provide services to retail credit unions, which
serve consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospectuses for the bond sales contained &#8220;untrue
statements of material fact or omitted material facts,&#8221; in
violation of U.S. securities laws, according to the NCUA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Geller, a spokesman for Edinburgh-based RBS, and
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
didn&#8217;t immediately return calls for comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are National Credit Union Administration Board v.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, 11-cv-02341, and National Credit
Union Administration Board v. RBS Securities Inc., 11-cv-02340,
U.S. District Court, District Of Kansas (Kansas City). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acura Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ACUR), a maker
of technology to deter drug abuse, rose the most in 11 weeks in
Nasdaq trading after U.S. regulators approved its short-acting
painkiller Oxecta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Palatine, Illinois-based company climbed 63 cents, or
16 percent, to $4.50 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market composite trading. It was the stock&#8217;s biggest percentage
increase since April 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acura said in a regulatory filing today that it will
receive $20 million from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) as a result of the Food and
Drug Administration approval. Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, acquired marketing rights to the pain medicine,
formerly known as Acurox, in its $3.3 billion purchase of King
Pharmaceuticals in March. Sales of the pills may be limited to
$30 million a year because they don&#8217;t guard against intentional
overdose, according to Ian Sanderson, an analyst at Cowen  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the Acura technology does prevent them from being
crushed and snorted and chewed, the primary means of abuse is
still wide open,&#8221; Sanderson said in a telephone interview from
Boston. &#8220;It really does not have a lot of commercial
potential.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA in 2009 rejected the original Acurox formulation
that included niacin, a vitamin that causes redness and
irritation of the face when taken in excess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Egol, a Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. managing director, bought an eight-room condominium with
views of Manhattan&#8217;s Central Park for $3.72 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal for the four-bedroom apartment at 40 East 94th
Street was completed on June 2, according to New York City
property records, which show Egol and his wife, Zina, took out a
$1.1 million mortgage to buy the property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egol ran a desk at New York-based Goldman Sachs that
created, sold and traded complex investments such as the Abacus
collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, that allowed the
company and its clients to bet that mortgages would drop in
value. Goldman Sachs paid $550 million last year to settle a
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit that accused the
firm of misleading investors in one of the Abacus CDOs. Egol
hasn&#8217;t been charged with any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egol didn&#8217;t return two phone messages and an e-mail seeking
comment on June 17. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman,
declined to comment today and said Egol couldn&#8217;t be reached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;sun-filled&#8221; condo in Manhattan&#8217;s Carnegie Hill
neighborhood &#8220;features magnificent panoramic open city views,&#8221;
according to StreetEasy.com, a property-listings website. The
property was initially listed for sale by Brown Harris Stevens
for $4.25 million in October. The price was cut twice since
then, dropping to $3.65 million in February, according to
StreetEasy. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Greg Stohr and Jef Feeley" date="Jun 20, 2011  1:01 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-20/pfizer-rejected-by-u-s-high-court-on-58-million-prempro-award.html"><headline>Pfizer&#8217;s Bid to Appeal $58 Million Prempro Jury Award Denied</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
hear a Pfizer Inc. (PFE) unit&#8217;s appeal of a $58 million award to three
Nevada women who contracted breast cancer after taking the
company&#8217;s Premarin and Prempro menopause drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rebuff leaves the award as the largest to be upheld on
appeal in thousands of hormone-replacement drug suits. More than
6 million women took Prempro and other menopause drugs before a
2002 study highlighted their links to cancer. Pfizer and its
units at one point faced more than 10,000 claims, according to
lawyers for former users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nevada Supreme Court concluded jurors properly held
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit responsible for hiding the breast-cancer
risks of Premarin and Prempro. The original 2007 award totaled
$134.1 million to Arlene Rowatt, Jeraldine Scofield and Pamela
Forrester. The trial judge later reduced the verdict to $57.6
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we are disappointed with the Supreme Court&#8217;s
decision, it does nothing to change the fact that hormone
therapy medicines are an important treatment option for many
women with debilitating symptoms of menopause,&#8221; Chris Loder, a
Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the U.S. Supreme Court, Wyeth argued the Nevada judge
should have ordered a new trial rather than reduce the award.
The company argued the jury was swayed by an &#8220;improper and
inflammatory&#8221; closing argument by the women&#8217;s lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;False Reassurances&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for the women urged the Supreme Court not to get
involved, saying the award was warranted in light of the
company&#8217;s mishandling of the drug and misleading marketing
campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wyeth refused to accept responsibility for what it did to
these brave women,&#8221; Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer for Rowatt,
Scofield and Forrester, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Wyeth
can&#8217;t hide any more. These women will finally see justice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual sales of Wyeth&#8217;s hormone-replacement drugs exceeded
$2 billion before a 2002 study, sponsored by the U.S. National
Institutes of Health, suggested that women using the medicines
had a 24 percent higher risk of breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many patients combined Premarin, Wyeth&#8217;s
estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made by
Pfizer&#8217;s Pharmacia  Upjohn unit. Wyeth then combined the two
hormones in Prempro. The drugs are still on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Largest Drugmaker &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker,
acquired Wyeth in 2009. The company, which has settled a third
of the pending cases over its Prempro menopause drug, said last
month that it set aside $772 million to resolve claims over the
medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rowatt, Scofield, Forrester were all in their 60s at the
time of the verdict. Forrester and Rowatt have since died of
causes unrelated to the litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2008, a judge awarded the women&#8217;s lawyers more
than $1.6 million in fees and expenses, Littlepage said in a
statement. That brings the total award to more than $59 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wyeth LLC v. Scofield, 10-1177, U.S. Supreme
Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milestone Turnaround Management Co.
plans to raise about 15 billion yen ($187 million) for Japanese
hotel- and apparel-company investments patterned on strategies
used by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Fast Retailing Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTM, as the company is known, aims to attract higher-
spending customers at resorts it buys by remodeling them,
&#8220;similar to the way Hoshino Resort turns around inns and hotels
jointly with Goldman,&#8221; said Keizo Hayase, president of the
Tokyo-based fund. MTM is in talks about investing in several
hotels and apparel companies, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayase, who said his 9 billion yen first fund has returned
44 percent since its February 2007 start, plans to plow several
billion yen into about 10 hotels on the island of Kyushu because
its hot spring and mountain resorts are convenient to tourists
from China and South Korea. The southwestern Japanese island has
also attracted resort investments by RHJ International (RHJI) SA, Daiwa
Securities SMBC Principal Investments and H.I.S. Co., Japan&#8217;s
second-biggest travel agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These opportunities are drawing investors&#8217; interest,&#8221;
Hayase, 52, said in an interview in Tokyo on June 16. MTM may
also invest in trading companies and department stores to create
businesses that operate like Fast Retailing&#8217;s Uniqlo, which
designs the clothes it sells, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was fined
25,000 pounds ($40,000) by the ICE Futures Europe exchange for
&#8220;disorderly&#8221; oil trading, the London-based exchange said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ICE committee that investigated the trades &#8220;found no
evidence of intentional manipulation of the market; nevertheless
it considered the breach to be of a serious nature,&#8221; ICE said
in a circular on its website dated June 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly Loeffler, Atlanta-based spokeswoman for
IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE), which owns ICE Futures Europe,
said the company doesn&#8217;t comment on investigations. Joanna Carss, a London-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, said
she couldn&#8217;t comment on the matter immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penalty relates to &#8220;price spikes&#8221; on the April 2011
Brent-WTI crude spread that occurred on Jan. 28 from 2:26 p.m.
U.K. time to 2:31 p.m., according to the circular. The moves
were found to be the result of several large market orders
placed in quick succession by a Goldman trader, ICE said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICE committee &#8220;considered the behavior of Goldman
Sachs and its client to be a clear case of disorderly trading,
in that the distorting price impact of the placement of such
large orders in close proximity was not considered.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread between the April 2011 contracts narrowed to
$7.49 a barrel on Jan. 28, having opened at $9.41 a barrel, 
before closingg at $7.87 a barrel, according to data from ICE.
The difference between the two front-month global benchmarks
was $19.20 a barrel as of 3:42 p.m. today in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks retreated, threatening
the 2011 gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, as European
officials failed to agree on a bailout plan for Greece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) dropped,
following declines in European lenders. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and
Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) paced losses in energy companies as oil
approached a bear market following a 20 percent drop from its
2011 peak. Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) retreated 2.1 percent after
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. cut its recommendation for the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell 0.2 percent to 1,268.62 at 9:33 a.m. in
New York. The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities rose 1.1 percent
this year through June 17. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
dropped 22.10 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,982.26 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s quite a conundrum,&#8221; said Hayes Miller, the Boston-
based head of asset allocation in North America at Baring Asset
Management Inc., which oversees $51.6 billion. &#8220;The European
debt crisis overhang is going to be here for a while. We&#8217;re
going to have positive economic growth, but it&#8217;s going to be
anemic. That&#8217;s not enough to put people back to work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark gauges snapped a six-week decline on June 17,
preventing the longest slump for the SP 500 since March 2001.
The SP 500 has retreated 6.8 percent from this year&#8217;s high at
the end of April through June 17 amid weaker-than-expected
economic data and concern about Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks fell across the globe today as Europe faltered in
its race to save Greece from default as finance chiefs said
further aid hinged on embattled Prime Minister George Papandreou
delivering budget cuts in the face of domestic opposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence Vote &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the eve of a confidence vote that threatens to topple
Papandreou, the euro area&#8217;s top economic policy makers pushed
Greece to pass laws to cut the deficit and sell state assets.
They left open whether the country will get the full 12 billion
euros ($17.1 billion) promised for July as part of last year&#8217;s
110 billion-euro lifeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its forecast for second-
quarter U.S. growth to 2 percent from 3 percent, according to a
June 17 report by Sven Jari Stehn, an economist for the company
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 is trading close to its average price of the
last 200 days of about 1,258.85. A decline below that level
could trigger further losses, according to analysts and traders
who study charts to make forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American banks retreated following declines in European
peers. Bank of America fell 0.3 percent to $10.65. Wells Fargo
dropped 0.1 percent to $27.30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy stocks slumped as oil fell to the lowest in four
months in New York. Today&#8217;s low marked a 20 percent decline from
its 2011 settlement high in April, the sign of a bear market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon retreated 0.5 percent to $78.66. Schlumberger slid
0.3 percent to $81.53. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM declined 2.1 percent to $27.16. The BlackBerry
smartphone maker was downgraded to &#8220;underperform&#8221; from
&#8220;market perform&#8221; at Sanford Bernstein. The 12-month share
price estimate is $20. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects Emirates NBD closing price in seventh paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai&#8217;s shares retreated the most in
almost a month after European governments failed to agree on a
payment to prevent Greece from default and as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut two of the emirate&#8217;s biggest banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emirates NBD, the biggest lender in the United Arab
Emirates by assets, dropped the most on record. Dubai Islamic
Bank PJSC (DIB), which has the second-biggest weighting on the
benchmark index, fell the most in a month. The DFM General Index (DFMGI)
slipped 1.7 percent, the most since May 23, to 1,572.46 at the 2
p.m. close in the emirate. Excluding today, Dubai&#8217;s measure rose
2.5 percent this month on speculation MSCI Inc. will upgrade the
U.A.E. to emerging-market status tomorrow. The Bloomberg GCC 200
Index (BGCC200) fell 0.9 percent at 2:06 p.m. in Riyadh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The worries over Greece and China are weighing on the
markets,&#8221; said Akram Annous, Middle East and North Africa
strategist at Al Mal Capital PSC in Dubai. &#8220;MENA volatility
relative to global volatility is down significantly, though you
do have to wonder how much longer these markets will hold up if
the global slowdown fears become a reality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The STOXX Europe 600 Index slumped 0.9 percent and the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index declined 0.7 percent after European
governments failed to agree on releasing a loan payment to
Greece, raising pressure on Prime Minister George Papandreou to
deliver further budget cuts in the face of domestic opposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil declined for a second day in New York on speculation
that Greece&#8217;s debt crisis will contribute to lower global fuel
demand. Crude for July delivery fell as much as 2 percent to
$91.14 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council supply
about a fifth of the world&#8217;s oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Cuts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emirates NBD, the Dubai-based company with the third-
biggest weighting on the Dubai index, was cut to &#8220;neutral&#8221;
from &#8220;buy&#8221; at Goldman Sachs, while Dubai Islamic Bank was
lowered to &#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; The investment bank also
reduced the earnings estimates of U.A.E. banks by 10 percent on
average from 2011 to 2014 because of new central bank guidelines
that capped consumer loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emirates NBD dropped 6.4 percent, the most since October
2007 when the bank was formed following a merger, to 4.27
dirhams. Dubai Islamic Bank fell 1.4 percent, the most since May
25, to 2.07 dirhams. Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR), the biggest weighted
stock on the index and the developer of the world&#8217;s tallest
tower in Dubai, lost 2.2 percent to 3.15 dirhams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) retreated the most since
March 2, falling 2.7 percent to 3.2 dirhams. The U.A.E.&#8217;s third-
largest bank by assets was lowered to &#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;buy&#8221; at
Goldman Sachs with a price estimate of 3.04 dirhams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatar&#8217;s QE Index (DSM) slipped 1.4 percent and Kuwait&#8217;s gauge
fell 1 percent. Abu Dhabi&#8217;s ADX General Index (ADSMI) dropped 0.7
percent, Oman&#8217;s benchmark stock index retreated 0.2 percent,
while Saudi Arabia&#8217;s measure fell 0.8 percent. Bahrain&#8217;s BB All
Share Index was little changed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC
retreated the most in more than a week after the United Arab
Emirates&#8217; third-largest bank by assets was lowered to &#8220;sell&#8221;
from &#8220;buy&#8221; at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares dropped 3.3 percent, the most since June 12, to
3.18 dirhams as of 1:16 p.m. in Abu Dhabi. The lender&#8217;s 24-month
price estimate was cut to 3.04 dirhams from 3.44 dirhams at
Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi Commercial on June 17 signed an agreement to sell
its 24.9 percent stake in Malaysian lender RHB Capital Bhd. to
Abu Dhabi&#8217;s state-owned Aabar Investments PJSC for about 5.9
billion ringgit ($1.9 billion). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong property prices may fall
as much as 15 percent by the end of the year, said Walter Kwok,
former chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16), the world&#8217;s
biggest developer by market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukewarm demand at an auction on June 9 for a parcel of
land near the Peak district, about a 10-minute drive from the
Central business district, will lead to a softening of prices of
finished properties, said Kwok in an interview in the western
Chinese city of Chongqing on June 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised they will fall 10 to 15
percent,&#8221; Kwok said. &#8220;We have already seen the peak.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government officials including Chief Executive Donald Tsang
have warned of an asset bubble in the Chinese city, where home
prices have surged more than 70 percent since the beginning of
2009. In the most recent measures to curb prices, announced on
June 10, the government raised up-front payments for properties
costing more than HK$6 million ($770,000) and required borrowers
whose income is primarily from outside Hong Kong to deposit an
extra 10 percent when they buy properties unless they can
demonstrate a &#8220;close connection&#8221; to the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will add more than 20,000 homes this year
and may offer more land for residential projects, Tsang said in
an interview in Melbourne on June 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices may drop 10 percent to 20 percent in 2012 and a
further 10 percent in 2013 on rising interest rates, Andrew Lawrence, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Barclays Capital, said in
a June 7 Bloomberg Television interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property Shares Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Property Index, which includes Sun Hung Kai,
has declined 12 percent this year, while the benchmark Hang Seng
Index is down 6.2 percent. Sun Hung Kai fell 16 percent this
year and dropped 2 percent to HK$108.90 to close at its lowest
since September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising prices should not be entirely blamed on mainland
Chinese, and the measures making it more difficult for non-
residents to buy property will not solve the problem, Kwok said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hong Kong should not give the impression to the outside
world that it practices discrimination; this is open door,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainland Chinese buyers of property in Hong Kong are
exacerbating the territory&#8217;s shortage of land for development,
Tsang said on June 17. Mainland China doesn&#8217;t include Hong Kong,
Macau or Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Reasonable&#8217; Level &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers from other Chinese cities account for 20 percent to
30 percent of sales, a level Kwok called &#8220;reasonable,&#8221;
especially when compared with London and New York where foreign
ownership is larger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas buyers and those from other Chinese cities
accounted for about a third of luxury home transactions in Hong
Kong in the first quarter of this year, according to Centaline
Property Agency Ltd., the city&#8217;s biggest privately held realtor.
Savills Plc ranks Hong Kong as the most expensive place to buy
an apartment.
     Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., controlled by billionaire Li Ka-shing paid about HK$26,763 per square foot, according to
Centaline. That is considerably less than the HK$35,000 per
square foot the market expected, said Kwok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kwok is the eldest son of Sun Hung Kai&#8217;s late co-founder
Kwok Tak Seng. He was stripped of the company&#8217;s chairmanship in
2008 by brothers Thomas and Raymond Kwok, who replaced him with
their mother. Walter remains a non-executive director of the
company. The family&#8217;s combined wealth of $20 billion is second
on Forbes Magazine&#8217;s list of Hong Kong richest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s deal to
settle a U.S. regulator&#8217;s claims that the bank misled buyers of
mortgage-linked securities before the housing market collapsed
echoed a case brought last year against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to pay $153.6 million to end a Securities
and Exchange Commission suit. The SEC alleged that the New York-
based bank failed to tell investors in 2007 that a hedge fund
helped pick, and bet against, underlying securities in the
collateralized debt obligation they purchased. In July, Goldman
Sachs paid a record $550 million for failing to inform clients
in 2007 that it allowed a hedge fund that also bet against
housing to help formulate the CDOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the same general allegation of wrongdoing,&#8221; Robert Khuzami, enforcement chief of the SEC, said yesterday in a
Bloomberg Television interview. &#8220;The message in both cases is
if you engage in this kind of wrongdoing, if you mislead
investors, you&#8217;re going to pay a fine.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is targeting mortgage-industry firms from loan
originators including Countrywide Financial Corp. to Wall Street
CDO underwriters. The regulator has looked at Citigroup Inc. (C),
Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG and Morgan Stanley, a person with
knowledge of the matter has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Goldman, JPMorgan&#8217;s brokerage unit, JPMorgan
Securities LLC, didn&#8217;t admit or deny wrongdoing in settling.
Unlike Goldman, the claims against the firm relied solely on a
section of the Securities Act of 1933 that connotes a &#8220;lesser
violation,&#8221; said Ed B. Horahan, a Washington-based securities
lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Messed Up&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs settled under a section of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 that says the accused firm knew what it was
doing, while JPMorgan&#8217;s case is closer to negligence, Horahan
said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan simply admitted that it &#8216;messed up&#8217; the
documentation,&#8221; said Brad Hintz, an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. The bank &#8220;pays a fine, announces a public mea
culpa and has no more liability. This looks like a win for
JPMorgan.&#8221; JPMorgan rose 1.1 percent to close at $40.91
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customers misled by the two banks also differed,
according to the SEC suits. JPMorgan sold about $150 million of
notes in the CDO, known as Squared, to about 15 firms including
a not-for-profit Lutheran insurer, Thrivent Financial, and a New
York City-based manager of General Motors Co. pensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, one of the biggest investors in Goldman Sachs&#8217;
Abacus CDO was Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG. The German bank was aware of the risk
associated with the securities and was &#8220;among the most
sophisticated mortgage investors in the world,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
said in April 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Magnetar &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facts of JPMorgan&#8217;s case, which involve hedge fund
Magnetar Capital LLC, look worse than Goldman Sachs&#8217;s, said
Charles Whitehead, an associate professor at Cornell Law School
in New York. Magnetar, betting housing prices would fall, stood
to profit if assets defaulted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman was able to point to a number of cases where the
Abacus collateral manager refused to take suggestions made by
the hedge fund,&#8221; Whitehead said. &#8220;In this case, the SEC&#8217;s
complaint goes out of its way to highlight the fact that the
collateral manager was taking direction very much from
Magnetar.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar had a &#8220;significant role&#8221; in picking the assets
linked to the CDO, known as Squared, during February 2007,
according to e-mails between the hedge fund, JPMorgan and the
collateral manager, a unit of GSC Capital Corp., the SEC said.
That month, the hedge fund bet against 18 of 19 securities
inserted into the investment, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar&#8217;s Bets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar didn&#8217;t control the asset-selection process and its
bets were part of a &#8220;market-neutral&#8221; portfolio, Steve Lipin, a
spokesman for the hedge fund, said yesterday in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Magnetar is not a party to the settlement nor a defendant
in this case, and was not involved in the marketing of the
securities,&#8221; Lipin said. &#8220;The SEC staff issued a closing
letter to Magnetar stating that it does &#8216;not intend to recommend
any enforcement action&#8217; against Magnetar, any of its funds or
any current or former Magnetar personnel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in a statement that the bank booked $900
million in losses on the CDO and, after an internal review,
voluntarily made $56 million in payments to investors of a
separate CDO called Tahoma I. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC has not charged the firm with intentional or
reckless misconduct,&#8221; JPMorgan said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses on CDOs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDOs package assets such as mortgage bonds into new
securities with varying risks. A surge in U.S. home loan
defaults undermined the instruments, helping lead financial
companies to record $1.82 trillion in losses and writedowns
during the housing crisis, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s claim focuses on JPMorgan&#8217;s disclosures about
Squared CDO 2007-1. Marketing materials said the instrument&#8217;s
portfolio was selected by GSC, which had experience analyzing
CDO credit risk. Magnetar also played a role in the selection
and stood to benefit if CDOs tied to the instrument defaulted,
according to the agency&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the months before the deal closed in May 2007, the bank
made a &#8220;frantic global sales effort&#8221; to sell the Squared
securities amid signs of distress in the housing market, the SEC
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are soooo pregnant with this deal, we need a wheel-
barrel to move around,&#8221; wrote a JPMorgan employee in charge of
distributing the CDO in a March 2007 e-mail meant to encourage
the sales staff, according to the SEC complaint. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
schedule the cesarian, please!&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) has lost so
much value that an acquirer could pay a 50 percent premium and
still buy the BlackBerry maker for a lower multiple than any
company in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM, once worth $83 billion, fell more than 80 percent from
its record three years ago as Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone and Google
Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android platform siphoned off smartphone customers. The
Waterloo, Ontario-based company, which plunged last week after
saying quarterly sales may drop for the first time in nine
years, closed yesterday at $25.89 a share, or 4.7 times earnings
next year. That&#8217;s less than any communications-equipment
provider, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis, RIM&#8217;s co-chief
executive officers, said last week that their commitment to RIM
is &#8220;stronger than ever,&#8221; the company may now attract Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) and Dell Inc. (DELL), BMO Harris Private Banking said. A buyer
would get a smartphone maker that is still dominant among
corporate clients, offers greater security with its own e-mail
servers and generates more free cash versus its market value
than any of its rivals. Paying $40 a share still values RIM at a
discount to comparable companies in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chicago gasoline strengthened after
Exxon Mobil Corp. shut a furnace for repairs at the Joliet,
Illinois, refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 238,000-barrel-a-day plant flared hydrogen sulfide and
sulfur dioxide, causing the shutdown of the furnace for repairs,
the company said in a filing with the Illinois Emergency
Management Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for 87-octane, conventional gasoline in
Chicago narrowed 2 cents to 13.5 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:34 p.m. in New
York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
slipped 0.65 cent to $2.75 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc&#8217;s 475,000-barrel-a-day Texas City, Texas, refinery
will operate at reduced rates until August because of problems
associated with an April power failure that caused the plant to
shut, Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 1.75 cents to 19.5 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average over the second quarter, BP&#8217;s Texas City
refinery has used about half the plant&#8217;s capacity, Dean said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and the World
Bank will provide as much as $400 million to developing nations
for hedging their trade in agricultural supplies after record
global food prices pushed 44 million more people into poverty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit will come equally from New York-based JPMorgan
and the World Bank&#8217;s International Finance Corp. and allow for
as much as $4 billion of hedging, the World Bank said in a
statement today. The funds are available to producers,
consumers, cooperatives and local banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;High, uncertain and volatile food prices are the single
gravest threat facing the most vulnerable in the developing
world,&#8221; World Bank President Robert Zoellick said in the
statement. &#8220;People are hungry for food and for action on a
global level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group of 20 farm ministers meet in Paris this week to
discuss proposals to share information on stockpiles, eliminate
export restrictions, create emergency food stocks for the
poorest nations and reduce commodity price swings. World food
output will have to rise 70 percent by 2050 as the global
population climbs to 9.2 billion from an estimated 6.9 billion
in 2010, the United Nations says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank wants to get other lenders involved in its
Agriculture Price Risk Management product, extending credit to
those in emerging markets who would not normally be able to pay
for hedging. Stable prices will help farmers get financing to
expand output and ensure &#8220;reasonable access&#8221; to food for
consumers, the Washington-based bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central Database &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G-20 ministers should agree to establish a central
database on the quality and quantity of global grain stocks,
which would reduce price swings by avoiding panic-buying,
Zoellick said in the statement. They should also exempt
humanitarian aid from export bans, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth in rice and wheat yields in developing countries,
representing about 80 percent of the global population, has
slowed to 1 percent a year, from 3 percent in the 1970s,
Zoellick said. Unless action is taken to mitigate climate
change, agricultural yields may drop 16 percent over the next
half century, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to be creative about farming, so there are not
only more crops but more resilient crops,&#8221; Zoellick said. There
are almost 1 billion hungry people in the world, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World food prices rose 37 percent in the past 12 months,
reaching a record in February, according to an index of 55
commodities from the UN&#8217;s Food and Agriculture Organization.
That helped push 44 million people into poverty in the past
year, defined as those living on less than $1.25 a day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court, in a ruling
that will mean new limits on class-action suits, ruled that Wal-
Mart Stores Inc. can&#8217;t be sued for discrimination on behalf of
potentially a million female workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices said the lawyers pressing the case failed to
point to a common corporate policy that led to gender
discrimination against workers at thousands of Wal-Mart and
Sam&#8217;s Club stores across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workers &#8220;provide no convincing proof of a companywide
discriminatory pay and promotion policy,&#8221; Justice Antonin
Scalia wrote for five members of the court. The justices were
unanimous on some aspects of the opinion and divided on others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, said in a
statement that the ruling &#8220;effectively ends this class-action
lawsuit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the majority made clear, the plaintiffs&#8217; claims were
worlds away from showing a companywide pay and promotion
policy,&#8221; Wal-Mart said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling may help companies facing similar suits. Units
of Cigna Corp. (CI), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Bayer AG (BAYN), Toshiba
Corp. (6502), Publicis Group SA, Deere  Co. (DE) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)
all face gender discrimination complaints that seek class-action
status. More than 20 companies supported Wal-Mart at the Supreme
Court, including Intel Corp. (INTC), Altria Group Inc. (MO), Bank of America
Corp., Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and General Electric Co. (GE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four justices -- Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia
Sotomayor and Elena Kagan -- said they would have returned the
case to a lower court and let the workers try to press ahead
with a class action under a different legal theory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women&#8217;s lawyers said they would seek to press ahead
with claims on behalf of aggrieved workers, either as
individuals or as part of smaller groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case is not over,&#8221; said Brad Seligman, one of the
two lead attorneys for the workers. &#8220;Wal-Mart is not off the
hook. There are thousands of claims of discrimination that
remain to be filed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was one of the most closely watched Supreme Court
business disputes in years, in part because the justices hadn&#8217;t
looked at the standards for certifying a class-action suit in 12
years. Billions of dollars were at stake for Wal-Mart, the
world&#8217;s largest private employer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, 10-277, U.S. Supreme
Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks Can&#8217;t Block Theflyonthewall.com Reports, Court Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC), Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s Merrill Lynch and
Morgan Stanley (MS) can&#8217;t use New York law to block
Theflyonthewall.com, an online financial news service, from
issuing immediate reports about changes in their stock ratings,
a federal appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals panel yesterday in Manhattan reversed a lower
court ruling that had blocked Theflyonthewall.com, based in
Summit, New Jersey, from reporting the upgrades or downgrades of
stocks for two hours or until half an hour after the opening of
the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injunction U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan
issued last year relied on New York state law, which permits
plaintiffs to sue based for the misappropriation of so-called
hot news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We conclude that in this case, a firm&#8217;s ability to make
news -- by issuing a recommendation that is likely to affect the
market price of a security -- does not give rise to a right for
it to control who breaks that news and how,&#8221; U.S. Circuit Judge
Robert Sack wrote on behalf of two judges on the three-judge

&lt;p&gt;Hedge Fund Expert-Networker Convicted in Insider Trade Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winifred Jiau, a former consultant with expert networking
firm Primary Global Research LLC, was convicted in the third
trial to result from a U.S. government crackdown on insider
trading tied to hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiau, 43, who provided industry information to financial
clients, was convicted of one count each of conspiracy and
securities fraud in Manhattan federal court for passing inside
tips about Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) to
hedge fund managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sentencing date was scheduled for Sept. 21. Jiau&#8217;s
lawyer, Joanna Hendon, said she would file an appeal after the
sentencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiau, of Freemont, California, was one of several dozen
people charged in overlapping insider rings stemming from the
probe of New York-based hedge fund Galleon Group LLC. The cases
implicated hedge funds, banks, technology firms and consultants
such as Jiau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Jiau, 11-cr-00161, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate-Change Suit Against Utilities Rejected by Top Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States can&#8217;t invoke federal law to force utilities to cut
greenhouse-gas emissions, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, shutting
off one avenue for groups that advocate bolder steps against
climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unanimous ruling is a victory for five companies --
American Electric Power Co., Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), Xcel Energy
Inc. (XEL), Southern Co. (SO) and the government-owned Tennessee Valley
Authority -- that had been sued by six U.S. states, including
California, and the city of New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states, which sought a cap on emissions, argued that
carbon dioxide spewed by the utilities is a public nuisance
because it causes climate change. The justices said the
Environmental Protection Agency was better equipped than federal
judges to assess the costs and benefits of reducing greenhouse
gases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is altogether fitting that Congress designated an
expert agency, here, EPA, as best suited to serve as primary
regulator of greenhouse-gas emissions,&#8221; Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg said for the court. Justice Sonia Sotomayor didn&#8217;t take
part in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the federal Clean Air Act, Congress has entrusted
the EPA and state regulators to determine greenhouse-gas
regulations for industries, according to the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling bolsters EPA&#8217;s position as the focal point for
curbing heat-trapping emissions from vehicles and industrial
polluters such as power plants, according to David Doniger,
policy director for the climate center at the Natural Resources
Defense Council, an environmental group based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration joined the power industry in
urging rejection of the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling reverberates beyond the power industry. Trade
groups representing automakers, oil companies, farmers, mining
companies, chemical companies and manufacturers all urged the
court to dismiss the suits, in some cases saying their members
might face similar claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is American Electric Power v. Connecticut, 10-174.

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Langbar CEO Gets One Year in Jail for Misleading Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geoffrey Stuart Pearson, the former chief executive officer
of a Bermuda-based investment company at the center of a fraud
scandal, was sentenced to a year in prison for making misleading
statements about its assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pearson, 63, was found guilty of three counts of making
misleading statements to the financial markets after a five-week
trial at a London criminal court, according to a statement
yesterday from the U.K. Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted
the case. Pearson, who was acquitted of 10 other charges, was
also barred from working as a company director for five years,
the SFO said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury found that Pearson lied to the market, saying that
Langbar International Ltd. had assets held by Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3)
and others in order to boost its share price. He also falsely
stated the company had an asset value of 357 million pounds
($578 million), according to the agency&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pearson&#8217;s lawyer, Shula de Jersey, said the former CEO has
helped to recover 38 million pounds in a related civil lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge recognized &#8220;Mr. Pearson was, for a substantial
part of time, himself a victim of deception by the principals in
this fraud, none of whom have ever been arrested, and this was
the basis upon which he was sentenced,&#8221; de Jersey said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, RBS Sued by Federal Agency Over Mortgage Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)
units were sued by the federal agency that regulates credit
unions, seeking to recover money lost on mortgage-backed
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Credit Union Administration Board, or NCUA,
accused the institutions of packaging and selling mortgage bonds
with loans that didn&#8217;t meet underwriting guidelines. The bonds,
sold to federally chartered credit unions, were rated AAA when
issued, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A material percentage amount of the loans included in the
bonds &#8220;were all but certain to become delinquent or default
shortly after origination,&#8221; the regulator said in two
complaints filed in federal court in Kansas City, Kansas. It
didn&#8217;t specify the amount of money sought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold credit unions almost $213 million of mortgage
bonds using sale documents that contained untrue statements or
lacked important information, according to one complaint. RBS
used documents with the same flaws to sell credit unions about
$138 million of bonds, the NCUA said in the other complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCUA wants the banks to help cover losses tied to the
failures of at least four federal credit unions that bought the
securities, including U.S. Central Federal Credit Union, which
was placed into conservatorship in 2009. The agency is
liquidating the credit unions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospectuses for the bond sales contained &#8220;untrue
statements of material fact or omitted material facts,&#8221; in
violation of U.S. securities laws, according to the NCUA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Geller, a spokesman for Edinburgh-based RBS, and
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
didn&#8217;t immediately return calls for comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are National Credit Union Administration Board v.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, 11-cv-02341, and National Credit
Union Administration Board v. RBS Securities Inc., 11-cv-02340,
U.S. District Court, District Of Kansas (Kansas City). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Lerner Associates Sued Over $6.8 Billion in REITs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Lerner Associates Inc. was sued by investors who
claimed it acted negligently in the sale and underwriting of
more than $6.8 billion in shares of the Apple Real Estate
Investment Trusts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage firm, known for its founder&#8217;s &#8220;Take a tip
from Poppy&#8221; advertising slogan, misstated the business model of
the REITS and misrepresented the value of shares and returns for
investors, according to a complaint filed yesterday in federal
court in Newark, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the past seven years, the firm collected more than
$600 million in fees and commissions while five Apple REITs made
more than $6 billion in proceeds, according to the complaint.
The firm has marketed the REITs as appropriate for conservative
investors and claims they have never lost money by investing in
hotels, the complaint said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In fact, investors who have acquired interests in the
Apple REITs have incurred substantial unrealized losses because
their interests are worth far less than the price paid by
investors to acquire them,&#8221; according to the complaint, filed
by Stanley and Debra Kronberg of Mahwah, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph C. Pickard, the firm&#8217;s general counsel, said in an
e-mailed statement that the claims are &#8220;frivolous&#8221; and were
filed by &#8220;attorneys seeking a quick payday.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The allegations are baseless and rife with falsehoods,
distortions and misleading statements, and we look forward to
the opportunity to be vindicated in a court of law,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Kronberg v. David Lerner Associates Inc., U.S.
District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3M Sues Porton Capital, CEO Harvey Boulter Over &#8216;Blackmail&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M Co. (MMM), the maker of Scotch tape, sued Porton Capital Inc.
and its chief executive officer, Harvey Boulter, in New York
state court, accusing them of trying to extort $30 million in
connection with a lawsuit in the U.K. over 3M&#8217;s purchase of a
medical technology company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porton and Ploughshare Innovations Ltd., two of the
shareholders who sold their stakes in the technology company,
sued 3M in London over the deal. The trial began last week and
is expected to continue into July, St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M
said yesterday in a New York State Supreme Court filing.
Ploughshare is a unit controlled by the British Ministry of
Defense, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Instead of awaiting the outcome of the pending
litigation, defendants and their investors have engaged in an
unlawful campaign to blackmail 3M into paying $30 million in
order to avoid the continuation of the campaign,&#8221; the company
said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M also said in its complaint that the &#8220;defendants seek to
publicly defame 3M and its chairman/CEO.&#8221; George W. Buckley is
the chairman and chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I got what my client believes was a ransom demand,&#8221;
William Brewer, the lawyer for 3M who filed the suit in New
York, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brewer said the defendants implied that a settlement
unfavorable to them would hurt 3M&#8217;s chances to do business in
the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He broke the rules of settlement under confidentiality,
which in most places in the world is both unprofessional and
unethical for a lawyer of his supposed standing,&#8221; Boulter said
in an e-mail. &#8220;To publicly characterize a settlement
negotiation as blackmail is shameful of Mr. Brewer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial centers on 3M&#8217;s acquisition of Acolyte Biomedica
Ltd., which was developing products to detect microorganisms,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is 3M Co. v. Boulter, 651708/2011, Supreme Court
of the State of New York (New York County). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW Group Asks Judge to Throw Out Gundlach&#8217;s Contract Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW Group Inc. asked a judge to throw out breach-of-
contract claims by its former investment chief Jeffrey Gundlach,
who said he was fired in 2009 so the company wouldn&#8217;t have pay
him as much as $1.25 billion in fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Carl West said at a
hearing yesterday that summary judgment wasn&#8217;t the appropriate
way to resolve Gundlach&#8217;s claims. West issued a tentative
decision before the hearing denying TCW&#8217;s request for a ruling
that Gundlach has no claim because he had no contract, and took
the matter under submission without issuing a final order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was an agreement here and what this agreement was
isn&#8217;t entirely clear,&#8221; West said at the hearing. &#8220;A jury is
going to have to determine what the terms were.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW, the Los Angeles-based unit of Societe Generale (GLE), sued
Gundlach and three other ex-employees in January 2010 after more
than half of its fixed-income professionals joined Gundlach&#8217;s
new firm, DoubleLine Capital Inc. TCW seeks more than $200
million in damages, claiming Gundlach stole its trade secrets as
he plotted to start his own business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach filed counterclaims a month later, saying he was
dismissed so that TCW wouldn&#8217;t have to pay $600 million to $1.25
billion in future management and performance fees from the funds
his group managed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Quinn, a lawyer for TCW, said at the hearing that
Gundlach was never promised any specific amount or percentage of
the fees and that he received what was left from his group&#8217;s
share of the fees after he had paid all the expenses of his
group. It was &#8220;gross oversimplification&#8221; to say that Gundlach
was entitled to a percentage of TCW&#8217;s fees, Quinn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Helm, a lawyer for DoubleLine, said TCW had been
paying Gundlach and Gundlach had been working under an agreement
and that the only dispute was what the terms of the contract
were. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury trial is scheduled to start July 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Jeffrey Gundlach,

&lt;p&gt;Merrill Must Face Group Lawsuit Over Mortgage Securities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit must face a
group lawsuit by union and public employee retirement funds over
mortgage-backed securities, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff in Manhattan certified a
class of buyers of 301 tranches of mortgage-backed securities in
18 separate offerings from February 2006 through September 2007.
Rakoff also granted the investors&#8217; request to appoint New York-
based Bernstein Litowitz Berger  Grossmann LLP as lead lawyers
for the class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After careful consideration, and for reasons that will be
stated in a forthcoming written opinion, the court hereby grants
both motions,&#8221; Rakoff wrote in an order released June 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the litigation, filed in 2008, the investors accuse
Merrill of issuing offering documents for $16.5 billion of
certificates that omitted material facts and contained untrue
statements, including that the underlying mortgages complied
with the stated underwriting guidelines. Rakoff&#8217;s certifying of
the class is a boon to the investors because it means they don&#8217;t
have to sue individually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Halldin, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The named plaintiffs in the case include the Mississippi
Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System, the Los Angeles County
Employees Retirement Association, the Wyoming State Treasurer,
the Connecticut Carpenters Pension Fund and the Connecticut
Carpenters Annuity Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System of
Mississippi v. Merrill Lynch  Co., 08-10841, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus Says Hynix, Micron Conspired Illegally as Trial Opens &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) and Micron Technology Inc. (MU) carried
out an &#8220;unlawful conspiracy&#8221; to drive Rambus Inc. (RMBS) out of the
computer memory market, a Rambus lawyer said as an antitrust
trial began yesterday in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus, based in Sunnyvale, California, is seeking as much
as $12.9 billion from Hynix and Micron over Rambus-designed
dynamic random access memory, or RDRAM, chips. The $4.3 billion
in damages sought by Rambus against the two companies would be
automatically tripled under California law, according to Rambus.
The chip manufacturers deny the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hynix and Micron engaged in &#8220;a secret and unlawful
conspiracy to kill a revolutionary technology, make billions of
dollars and hang onto power,&#8221; Rambus lawyer Bart Williams told
jurors. &#8220;The conspiracy worked,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Rather than win
the race to become the next industry standard,&#8221; RDRAM &#8220;was
condemned to a smaller market share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micron and Hynix are scheduled to present their arguments
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus claims Ichon, South Korea-based Hynix and Boise,
Idaho-based Micron inflated the price of RDRAM chips and
collusively underpriced their own SDRAM and DDR chips to
undercut competition from Rambus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micron General Counsel Rod Lewis said in an e-mailed
statement that Rambus&#8217;s case in one example of its &#8220;continued
attempts to place blame on third parties for its failure to
compete successfully in the marketplace.&#8221; RDRAM failed because
it was less efficient and more costly to produce and implement
than its competitors, Lewis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Rambus Inc. v. Micron Technology Inc., 04-
431105, California Superior Court (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First American Gets Supreme Court Hearing in Kickback Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider halting a suit
that accuses First American Financial Corp. (FAF) of operating an
illegal title-insurance kickback scheme and seeks hundreds of
millions of dollars on behalf of homebuyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday granted an appeal by First American,
the second-largest U.S. title insurer, which is seeking to block
the suit in a federal court in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit centers on First American&#8217;s ownership stake in
thousands of title agencies across the country. The company is
accused of acquiring those interests in exchange for promises
that the agencies would refer customers to a First American unit
that sells title insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First American argued in its appeal that consumers can&#8217;t
sue under the 1974 U.S. Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act,
which bars kickbacks, unless they claim they paid higher fees as
a result. A federal appeals court in San Francisco rejected that
contention, letting the suit proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court will hear the case in its next term
beginning in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First American is based in Santa Ana, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is First American Financial v. Edwards, 10-708,
U.S. Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PPL Gets U.S. High Court Hearing on $50 Million Montana Award &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review a decision
requiring a PPL Corp. (PPL) unit to pay more than $50 million to
Montana for the use of riverbeds under the company&#8217;s
hydroelectric facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PPL Montana is appealing a Montana Supreme Court ruling
that said the state owns the riverbeds and is entitled to demand
rent payments. The company argues in its appeal that the
riverbeds are owned either by private parties or the federal
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Montana state trial court ordered the company to pay $40
million in past rent, plus an unspecified amount for rent
starting in 2008. PPL Montana last year recorded a pretax charge
of $56 million to cover estimated payments through the first
quarter of 2010. The company said last month that its total
accrued loss as of March 31, 2011, was $78 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices agreed to hear the appeal against the advice
of the Obama administration, which urged rejection without a
hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute centers on dams on the upper Missouri, Madison
and Clark Fork rivers. PPL is based in Allentown, Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is PPL Montana v. Montana, 10-218, U.S. Supreme
Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks including Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) are seeking buyers for a client selling about 300 million
euros ($432 million) of leveraged loans such as Formula One
Holdings Ltd., Eircom Group Ltd. and ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM),
according to two people with knowledge of the trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Barclays Capital, Royal Bank of Scotland Plc
and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) are inviting bids for senior and
second-lien loans from 66 European companies, said the people,
who couldn&#8217;t be identified because the auction is private. The
deadline for bids is Friday at 2 p.m. London time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are shedding riskier assets on rising concern
that Greece&#8217;s debt burden will further roil Europe and depress
the global economy. Actively-traded credits in Standard  Poor&#8217;s
Leveraged Commentary  Data composite for Europe fell 42 basis
points last week to an average 99.25 percent of face value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debt is being sold in a so-called &#8220;bid wanted in
competition,&#8221; or BWIC, process, whereby buyers submit auction-
type bids and the highest above the reserve price wins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans are typically those to buyout targets that
have been saddled with debt by their private-equity firm owners.
Included on the list are loans to Apax Partners LLP&#8217;s Trader
Media Group and Gala Coral Group Ltd., the U.K. gaming company
run by creditors led by Apollo Global Management LLC. Irish
phone company Eircom plans to start talks with creditors this
month to restructure 3.75 billion euros of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank investors may have to wait at
least another quarter for trading to rebound as analysts expect
lower trading revenue in the current period, the fifth straight
year-over-year drop, amid weaker volume and market declines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income trading revenue at U.S. banks likely will fall
30 percent from the first quarter, while equities trading will
drop 15 percent, Keith Horowitz, a Citigroup Inc. (C) analyst, wrote
in a report this week. Seven analysts have cut their earnings
estimates for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley in the
past four weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street faced lower trading volumes as clients stepped
back amid concerns that the Greek debt crisis will spread to
other European nations and evidence that U.S. economic growth is
slowing. Declining trading revenue expectations have fueled
share declines of more than 10 percent at each of the six
largest U.S. banks since March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a number of headwinds and the markets haven&#8217;t
really been cooperating,&#8221; said James Ellman, president of San
Francisco-based hedge fund Seacliff Capital LLC. &#8220;This trend
can turn around in a moment if clients become more active, and
you get more volume and volatility in generally rising markets,
but we haven&#8217;t seen that yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total trading revenue at the five biggest Wall Street banks
-- Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. (BAC),
Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley -- may drop to $21.7 billion, a
4.4 percent decline from the second quarter of 2010 and 17
percent from last quarter, according to estimates by Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York. Trading
accounted for almost a quarter of the firms&#8217; revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Sluggish&#8217; Environment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second quarter likely saw &#8220;a continuation of the
sluggish risk-on/risk-off environment that we have had for the
past four quarters,&#8221; Kotowski wrote in a report this week. His
figures exclude charges tied to the firms&#8217; own debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from fixed-income, currencies and commodities, or
FICC, has been hindered this quarter by weak trading volumes,
low levels of client leverage, widening credit spreads in high-
yield and sovereign assets, and declining volatility, Horowitz
said. Banks also are starting to see the effects of the absence
of proprietary-trading groups that were shut down to comply with
new rules, Ellman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not just the trading activity, it&#8217;s the shrinking of
these prop businesses,&#8221; Ellman said. &#8220;As you shut those areas
down, you lose some of the more profitable areas of FICC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income trading revenue at the five banks fell 25
percent in the first quarter, compared with the first three
months of 2010, according to company filings. Equities trading
revenue dropped 4.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies&#8217;s Profit Falls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF), the New York-based investment bank
that&#8217;s been expanding its advisory and fixed-income businesses,
yesterday reported that profit fell 3.8 percent in the fiscal
second quarter ended May 31 as trading revenue decreased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The general climate pretty much throughout the quarter
was one of clients being uncertain of direction of positions and
basically not being very active on the trading side,&#8221; Jefferies
Chief Executive Officer Richard Handler, 50, said during a
conference call with investors. &#8220;As a result, you just do not
get the natural flow that we enjoyed during the first quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities, has cut his
second-quarter earnings estimates for all five banks over the
last two weeks. Fixed-income trading likely will fall 16 percent
from the first three months of the year, while equities trading
will probably fall 14 percent, he wrote in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Turbulent Macro Environment&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Overall, cash equities trading volume is expected to
decline in the second quarter compared to a seasonally strong
first quarter,&#8221; Trone said in the note. &#8220;The decline will be
challenged further by the turbulent macro environment which
should further dampen investor activity as the appetite for risk
decreases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are turning to cost-cutting measures amid the lack of
revenue growth. Morgan Stanley (MS) Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said earlier this month that the firm has commenced a
three-year program to reduce expenses by $1 billion. Morgan
Stanley may also cut 300 brokers in its wealth-management unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is aiming to reduce $1 billion in non-
compensation expenses over the next 12 months, according to a
person familiar with the matter who declined to be identified
because the plan hasn&#8217;t been publicly announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Cuts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weak trading revenue so far this year is likely to lead to
cuts on Wall Street, analysts including Meredith Whitney and
Nomura Holdings Inc.&#8217;s Glenn Schorr have said. U.S. banks may
accelerate announced job reductions after eliminating 11,400
positions in the first five months of the year, a 21 percent
increase over 2010, according to Challenger, Gray  Christmas
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing directors in the fixed-income trading divisions
are likely to be cut, Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. in New York, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview last week. The ratio of managing directors on staff at
investment banks is going to drop to about 10 percent from 15
percent at well-run firms and from 20 percent at those that are
poorly run, Hintz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to fire lots of people, you just need to
fire expensive people,&#8221; said Hintz, adding that the 40 percent
of compensation that goes to managing directors isn&#8217;t
sustainable. &#8220;You are going to change the shape of the
pyramid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-Income Revenue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reporting record investment-banking and trading
revenue for 2009, banks have had declines in those businesses
for four straight quarters compared with year-earlier periods. A
fall in fixed-income trading revenue, the biggest capital-
markets business for the banks, largely spurred the decreases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregate fixed-income revenue for the five U.S. banks and
four international rivals -- UBS AG (UBSN), Credit Suisse Group AG,
Barclays Plc, and Deutsche Bank AG -- dropped to $101 billion
last year, from a record $146 billion in 2009, according to
Schorr, a Nomura analyst in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities trading revenue for 10 of the largest U.S. and
European banks rose about 55 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, according to a report last month by London-based
research firm Coalition Development Ltd. That led commodities to
contribute 7 percent of overall fixed-income trading revenue in
the quarter, up from 4 percent in the first quarter of 2010,
Coalition said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities trading probably won&#8217;t provide the same boost
in the second quarter, Citigroup&#8217;s Horowitz said. That may lead
to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which have large commodity
businesses, reporting larger FICC revenue declines than their
competitors, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude Oil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil has fallen 12 percent to $93.65 so far this
quarter, which would be the largest drop since the fourth
quarter of 2008. Silver prices dropped 28 percent in a week in
May as CME Group Inc., owner of Comex, raised margin
requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average daily equity-trading volume on the largest U.S.
exchanges is down 32 percent from the second quarter of 2010,
and is on pace to fall 9.8 percent from last quarter. Dollar
volume of high-yield corporate bonds has declined 17 percent
from a year earlier, while volume of investment-grade bonds rose
6.1 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading volume, an indicator of performance, may not
correlate directly with firms&#8217; revenue because banks make money
on changes in the value of the securities they hold and
transaction fees that may not be related to volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading accounted for 23 percent of the five firms&#8217; total
revenue last year, ranging from 56 percent at Goldman Sachs to
16 percent at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America,
according to company filings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four largest U.S. stock market
operators asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to delay
implementation of rules governing how brokers send orders to
venues, including a ban on unsupervised, or &#8220;naked&#8221; market
access given to some high-frequency traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter to the SEC dated June 20, NYSE Euronext (NYX), Nasdaq
OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ), Bats Global Markets and Direct Edge Holdings
Inc. asked the regulator to extend to Nov. 30 the date by which
broker-dealers routing orders for other securities firms must
comply with the rules. The current deadline is July 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC in November proposed banning unfiltered or
&#8220;naked&#8221; access to markets. The rule applies to all forms of
securities trading, including the routing of orders to markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Adamonis, a spokesman for NYSE Euronext, declined
to confirm or comment on the letter. Stacie Fleming of Lenexa,
Kansas-based Bats, declined to comment. Robert Madden of Nasdaq
OMX in New York couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for comment.
Michael Boccio of Sloane  Co., which represents Direct Edge,
said the market operator co-signed the letter from the
exchanges. Direct Edge is based in Jersey City, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Nester, an SEC spokesman, declined to comment on
whether implementation would be delayed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Working With U.S. on Electric-Car Rules, De Gucht Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and the European Union are close to setting joint
standards for electric vehicles in a move that would foster
development of the low-polluting cars, the EU&#8217;s top trade
official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht made the remarks in a
speech in Washington yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Gucht, who is in Washington to meet with U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk, other administration officials and
business executives, didn&#8217;t elaborate on what the standards
would be. They may be announced when he returns to Washington
for a meeting with White House officials late this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Gucht also made a pitch to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
the nation&#8217;s largest business lobbying group, for a long-stalled
Doha Round of the World Trade Organization, saying the trade
arbiter should come up with some smaller package to agree to
before the end of the year. That agreement should include rules
for facilitating trade in poor nations and a standstill
guaranteeing that no nation raises tariffs while a full accord
is still pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Watchdog Weighing Proposal to Make Auditors Explain Work &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is seeking
comment on proposed changes that may require auditors of U.S.-
registered firms to explain their findings rather than simply
saying whether rules were followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCAOB, the Washington-based watchdog for firms that
review companies&#8217; books, issued a statement yesterday on
&#8220;possible enhancements&#8221; of the model for the auditor&#8217;s report,
which it called a primary means for communicating with
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCAOB Chairman James Doty said the release is a significant
move for investor protection in response to the 2008 financial
crisis and the first step toward reforms designed to improve the
relevance, transparency and reliability of the audit process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator, created by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
and overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission, will
accept comment on the concept release through Sept. 30 and plans
to hold a public meeting on the proposal later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EEX Says it Accepts FSA Qualifications for New Energy Traders &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Energy Exchange AG accepts trader
qualifications from the U.K. Financial Services Authority for
access to its energy contracts, Oliver Maibaum, managing
director of the Leipzig, Germany-based exchange, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Energy Exchange provides a single market of
exchange regarding energy trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Regulators May Ease Swaps-Database Legal Safeguard Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators looking to simplify sharing of derivatives
information may release market databases from certain Dodd-Frank
Act requirements if they register for business with both
domestic and overseas watchdogs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign regulators wouldn&#8217;t need to indemnify the swap-data
repositories or U.S. regulators for litigation costs if the
databases have dual registration, the heads of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission
said in a letter. Indemnification also wouldn&#8217;t be needed when
overseas officials seek information from the two agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler and SEC chief Mary Schapiro made
the statements about indemnification and dual registration in
the June 8 letter to Michel Barnier, the EU&#8217;s financial markets
commissioner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank, the U.S. regulatory overhaul enacted last year,
requires the databases as part of derivatives oversight aimed at
reducing risk and boosting transparency in the $601 trillion
swaps market. The law requires repositories to have protection
against legal costs before sharing information with regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European officials and repositories such as the Depository
Trust  Clearing Corp. have questioned the provision, saying it
may cause the global swaps market to become too fragmented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Thompson, DTCC&#8217;s general counsel, said in testimony
for a May 25 House Agriculture Committee hearing that the
measure may lead overseas jurisdictions to set up their own
repositories to escape U.S. rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan to Settle SEC Probe of CDO Sale for $153.6 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to pay $153.6 million to settle
U.S. regulatory claims it misled pension funds and a Lutheran
group while selling a product linked to risky mortgages as the
housing market unraveled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, the only major Wall Street bank to remain
profitable throughout the financial crisis, didn&#8217;t tell
investors that hedge fund Magnetar Capital LLC helped pick
assets linked to a synthetic collateralized debt obligation in
2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission wrote in a fraud
case filed yesterday at Manhattan federal court. Magnetar,
betting housing prices would fall, stood to profit if assets
defaulted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan marketed highly complex CDO investments to
investors with promises that the mortgage assets underlying the
CDO would be selected by an independent manager looking out for
investor interests,&#8221; the SEC&#8217;s enforcement chief, Robert
Khuzami, said in a statement. &#8220;With today&#8217;s settlement, harmed
investors receive a full return of the losses they suffered,&#8221;
he said in the statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC has not charged the firm with intentional or
reckless misconduct,&#8221; JPMorgan said in a statement. The bank
booked $900 million in losses on the CDO, known as Squared, and
after an internal review voluntarily made $56 million in
payments to investors of a separate CDO called Tahoma I. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC won&#8217;t bring claims over that investment, Khuzami
told reporters on a conference call yesterday. Asked why
JPMorgan executives weren&#8217;t sued, he said, &#8220;we look hard and
long at the conduct of individuals and make our decisions based
on the evidence.&#8221; JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s deal to settle a U.S.
regulator&#8217;s claims that the bank misled buyers of mortgage-
linked securities before the housing market collapsed echoed a
case brought last year against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is targeting firms in the mortgage industry. Like
Goldman, JPMorgan&#8217;s brokerage unit, JPMorgan Securities LLC,
didn&#8217;t admit or deny wrongdoing in settling. Unlike Goldman, the
claims against the firm relied solely on a section of the
Securities Act of 1933 that connotes a &#8220;lesser violation,&#8221;
said Ed B. Horahan, a Washington-based securities lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs settled under a section of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 that says the accused firm knew what it was
doing, while JPMorgan&#8217;s case is closer to negligence, Horahan
said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Said to Consider Releasing Stress Tests When Markets Closed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union&#8217;s top securities regulator is
recommending the release of the bank stress-test results at
night or on a weekend when global stock markets are closed,
according to a person familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Securities and Markets Authority wrote to the
European Banking Authority, the London-based EU agency carrying
out the tests, calling for publication of results while markets
are shut, said the person, who declined to be identified because
the talks are private. While a date for the results hasn&#8217;t been
set, regulators expect them to be released in mid-July, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stress-test results were published on July 23 last year
while U.S. markets were still open. If it opts to release the
data on a weeknight, the EBA has a two-hour window to coordinate
publication. U.S. markets close at 9 p.m. U.K. time and the New
Zealand exchange opens two hours later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at ESMA didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment.
Franca Rosa Congiu, an EBA spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve to Hold Meeting on Debit-Card Rules June 29 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve Board is scheduled to meet next week as
it prepares to implement caps on debit-card swipe fees paid by
retailers by July 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice of the June 29 Fed meeting was posted on the central
bank&#8217;s website yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks have challenged in court a provision of the
Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law that limits the amount of
debit-card swipe fees on the grounds that it is &#8220;confiscatory&#8221;
and therefore unconstitutional. The case is pending before the
U.S. Court of Appeals in St. Louis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True Asks Thai Telecom Regulator to Revoke Total Access License &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True Corp. Pcl, Thailand&#8217;s third-largest mobile-phone
company, asked the industry&#8217;s regulator to revoke Total Access
Communication Pcl (DTAC)&#8217;s operating license, claiming the company is
in breach of foreign ownership rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications
Commission&#8217;s board will discuss the issue and consult with the
commerce ministry, because the agency isn&#8217;t authorized to revoke
licenses, Takorn Tantasith, the regulator&#8217;s acting secretary-
general, said yesterday in Bangkok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True has filed complaints to the police and Thailand&#8217;s
commerce ministry alleging that Total Access is majority-owned
by foreign investors, said Supasorn Honchaiya, a legal
representative for True&#8217;s mobile-phone unit True Move Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Access Chief Executive Officer Jon Eddy Abdullah said
last week that the company, controlled by Norway&#8217;s Telenor ASA (TEL),
complies with all Thai laws and regulations. Thai investors hold
51 percent of Total Access, the Bangkok Post reported last week,
citing the government&#8217;s Department of Business Development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bair Says Resolutions Panel Has Wide Range of Expertise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair and
members of the agency&#8217;s Advisory Panel on Systemic Resolutions
met in Washington yesterday to map strategy to deal with too-
big-to-fail firms in the event of a collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and former
Citigroup Inc. (C) co-Chairman John Reed are serving on the panel
along with executives including BlackRock Inc. (BLK) fixed-income
chief Peter Fisher and Standard  Poor&#8217;s President Deven Sharma. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPA Extends Comment Time on Mercury and Air Toxics Proposal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency said it will extend the
public comment period for a proposed mercury and air toxics
rule, responding to calls from lawmakers to give companies more
time to weigh in on the standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPA will extend the comment timeline by 30 days,
according to a statement yesterday. The November deadline for
issuing final standards will remain the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension gives utilities, manufacturers, environmental
groups and other interested parties 120 days to comment, double
the current schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviews/Speeches &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amar Bhide Says Bank Capital Cushions Are &#8216;Irrelevant&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amar Bhide, a professor at Tufts University, talks about
Basel III bank capital requirements and the Dodd-Frank financial
regulation overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhide described the capital adequacy issue as a &#8220;fake
debate&#8221; because &#8220;nobody knows what the risk-weighted assets
are,&#8221; and capital cushions are therefore irrelevant. Amar, who
concluded that the regulations didn&#8217;t go far enough, spoke with
Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insurers Need Global Capital Standards, OSFI&#8217;s Dickson Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance regulators must settle on global capital and
accounting standards to enhance risk management, said Julie
Dickson, Canada&#8217;s financial services regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dickson, superintendent of the Office of the Superintendent
of Financial Institutions, made the remarks during a speech
yesterday at the International Insurance Society conference in
Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the International
Association of Insurance Supervisors hasn&#8217;t made as much
progress as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision on
&#8220;international harmonization&#8221; in the banking industry, said
Dickson, 53. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swartz Says Groupon&#8217;s Pre-IPO Jokes Not a Good Idea &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Swartz, partner at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman
LLP, talked about Groupon Inc.&#8217;s actions during its pre-initial
public offering quiet period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swartz, who spoke with Emily Chang and Cory Johnson on
Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Bloomberg West,&#8221; discussed Groupon&#8217;s
use of the &#8220;talking cat&#8221; and the law in general regarding the
&#8220;quiet period&#8221; after announcement of a public offering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama Nominee Bryson Sides With Republicans on Taxes, Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Bryson, President Barack Obama&#8217;s nominee for Commerce
secretary, sided with Republicans in Congress, saying companies
need lower taxes and that a labor complaint against Boeing Co. (BA)
was &#8220;not sound.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryson, facing questions from lawmakers who said Obama has
produced costly regulations and failed to spur job growth, said
yesterday he would push as Commerce secretary to curb rules
burdening companies, cut taxes and spur trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8216;m committed to helping simplify regulations that are
difficult to understand, eliminate regulations that are
ineffective and speed up regulatory decisions so American
businesses can have the certainty they need,&#8217;&#8217; Bryson testified
to the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryson, 67, is a founder of the Natural Resources Defense
Council, an environmental group, and former chief executive
officer of Edison International (EIX), the owner of California&#8217;s
largest utility. Senators read a letter of support for Bryson
from the Business Roundtable, which represents CEOs of companies
such as Boeing. While Republicans questioned Obama&#8217;s policies,
none said they would oppose Bryson&#8217;s nomination because of
concerns over his willingness to stand up to Obama&#8217;s &#8216;&#8216;anti-
business administration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peru&#8217;s production of coca, the plant

percent to 61,200 hectares in 2010. Cultivation in Colombia,
which receives $500 million a year in U.S. anti-narcotics aid,
fell 15 percent to 62,000 hectares, according to the study based
on satellite tracking by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru&#8217;s cocaine production has increased as the government
abandoned remote areas to drug traffickers and holdout members
of the Shining Path guerrilla movement, said Adam Isacson, a
researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve ceded this territory, to all intents and
purposes, leaving just a very small underpaid police force,&#8221;
Isacson said in telephone interview from Washington. &#8220;The
numbers are starting to catch up with them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humala, a one-time ally of Hugo Chavez, has joined the
Venezuelan leader and members of his anti-American Alba bloc of
nations in criticizing the U.S. drug war and extolling the
virtues of the coca leaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Wise&#8217; Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his 198-page campaign platform, Humala vowed to &#8220;fight
for respect of the coca leaf as a traditional crop&#8221; while
combating cocaine trafficking. The platform also calls for a
&#8220;wise&#8221; anti-narcotics policy that disavows forced eradication
and doesn&#8217;t &#8220;subordinate Peru to external interests.&#8221; Since
being elected June 5, he&#8217;s distanced himself from the platform
and said Peru needs U.S. support in its fight against drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coca plant, found only in the Andes, contains trace
amounts of an alkaloid that in large quantities can be used to
make cocaine. While the leaf has been used for centuries in Peru
as a mild stimulant that helps ward off hunger, a 1961 UN treaty
stipulates governments must gradually eradicate the plant and
ban all traditional uses of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isacson said the U.S. may use a surge in drug production in
Peru to pressure Humala should bilateral relations sour for
whatever reason. American anti-narcotics aid to Peru, which has
a free trade agreement with the U.S., has declined from $148
million in 2002 to an estimated $40 million this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even if coca production maintains its current pace of
growth, this will be a pretext to decertify Peru,&#8221; Isacson
said, referring to the annual U.S. government evaluation of a
country&#8217;s drug control efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decertification &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the U.S. lists Venezuela and Bolivia, where
former coca grower Evo Morales has been president since 2006, as
two nations in South America that aren&#8217;t cooperating with U.S.
anti-narcotics efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlos Basombrio, a former Peruvian deputy interior
minister, said that Humala doesn&#8217;t have a clear drug policy,
though he has probably taken a more pragmatic view of the drug
war as he distanced himself from Chavez during the campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any changes in his position haven&#8217;t been visible, but
given Humala&#8217;s transformation into another person during the
campaign, his stance on opposing coca eradication was probably
left behind,&#8221; Basombrio said in a phone interview from Lima. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia Production &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While coca production has been rising in Peru, it&#8217;s been
falling since 2007 in neighboring Colombia, the main focus of
the U.S. drug war in South America. Colombia and Peru each grow
about 40 percent of the world&#8217;s coca, while Bolivia grows about
20 percent, according to the UN report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocaine cultivation in Colombia, under pressured by U.S.-
backed eradication efforts, has moved into neighboring Peru like
air inside a balloon when it is squeezed, said General Oscar Naranjo, head of Colombia&#8217;s national police. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Colombia is leaving behind its old image of the failed
state in the hands of drug traffickers,&#8221; Naranjo told reporters
in Bogota today, &#8220;but evidently -- to deny it would be a lie --
that has produced a balloon effect.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decline in Colombia, from an eight-year high of 99,000
hectares in 2007, coincided with a change in the country&#8217;s
eradication strategy to depend less on aerial spraying of crops
with herbicide. Instead, security forces are being deployed to
Marxist guerrilla strongholds to protect workers who dig up coca
bushes by hand. The average size of a coca plot has shrunk to as
little as 0.7 hectare from 2 hectares in 1999, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Manual eradication gets rid of the whole plant, not just
one harvest, and requires the government to be there on the
ground,&#8221; said Isacson. &#8220;It makes a big difference.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocaine Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s cocaine industry, the world&#8217;s largest for more
than a decade, has been hit by a combination of falling output,
higher seizures and a rally by the peso against the dollar, said
Ricardo Rocha, an economist and author of the book &#8220;The
Colombian Economy After 25 Years of Drug Trafficking.&#8221; The peso
has appreciated 45 percent against the dollar over the last five
years, while Peru&#8217;s sol has gained 19 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everything points toward a loss of income for drug
traffickers in Colombia,&#8221; Rocha said in a phone interview from
Bogota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombian wholesale cocaine prices rose 0.8 percent to 4.6
million pesos ($2,439) per kilogram in 2010, the UN study found.
Prices have risen 5 percent since 2002, according to the UN,
while the nation&#8217;s consumer price index rose 58 percent over the
same period. Prices are up 59 percent in dollar terms over the
same period, while coffee and sugar prices have tripled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocha estimates that cocaine now accounts for less than 1
percent of Colombia&#8217;s gross domestic product, down from a peak
of 6.3 percent in 1987, when Forbes Magazine listed Medellin
cartel boss Pablo Escobar in its ranking of the world&#8217;s
billionaires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia receives more U.S. aid than any country outside
the Middle East and Afghanistan. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has pledged to continue the government&#8217;s eradication
programs, saying that cocaine is financing the country&#8217;s Marxist
insurgency. The Santos government aims to further reduce coca
production by more than 30 percent by 2014, Naranjo said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. equity research and related
services from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-largest American
bank by assets, was voted the most valuable to asset managers
surveyed by Greenwich Associates, a report yesterday said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) won the most U.S. equity trading
volume based on commissions spent, the survey from the Stamford,
Connecticut-based research firm said. The two brokers, along
with Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), placed in the top five in both categories. The
responses from 217 fund managers and 304 equity traders were
weighted by the dollar value of the commissions spent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset managers decided how much to pay brokers from a
commission pool that shrank 12 percent in the year that ended in
mid-February to $11.6 billion, Greenwich said in another report
on U.S. equities earlier this month. The contraction occurred as
trading volume on American exchanges declined about 14 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Customers depend on research for their investment
decisions,&#8221; said Joseph Cangemi, managing director at BNY
ConvergEx Group LLC and chairman of the Security Traders
Association, both based in New York. &#8220;If there&#8217;s less trading
commissions available, firms will be forced to spend a greater
percentage of their commission dollars on research.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commissions paid for research and advisory services,
including access to executives at companies, rose to a 10-year
high of 59 percent of the total from 53 percent a year earlier,
Greenwich said. The dollar amount spent remained about the same
at $6.8 billion, compared with $7 billion a year earlier,
according to John Feng, Jay Bennett and John Colon of Greenwich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protecting Access &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Firms spent more proportionally for research services
because they needed to protect their access to that advice,&#8221;
Feng, a managing director at Greenwich, said in an interview.
&#8220;Commissions are the currency to access those insights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional brokerage commissions shrank and trading
volume slowed as the U.S. stock market produced smaller gains.
The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, the benchmark measure of U.S.
equities, surged 32 percent between Feb. 13, 2009, and Feb. 16,
2010, recovering from the subprime-mortgage crisis that saddled
banks worldwide with $2.06 trillion in losses and writedowns. In
the next year, it gained 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenwich said the nine biggest brokers, which it didn&#8217;t
identify, got 68 percent of U.S. equity commissions, up from 65
percent last year, while mid-size and regional brokers got 18
percent. Securities firms that execute orders for institutional
clients without engaging in proprietary trading or offering
investment banking services received 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest brokers, including Goldman Sachs in New York
and Bank of America in Charlotte, North Carolina, offer more
services than other securities companies. They can provide
access to initial public offerings, company research and
analysis, meetings with management, capital to help clients
execute larger trades without swaying stock prices, and
investment services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the commission pool shrinks, firms often concentrate
their commissions with the bigger firms to remain valued clients
and get the services they deem important. That puts more
pressure on smaller brokers that struggle to maintain their
level of trading and commissions to help fund their businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best brokers providing research and related services
according to votes by fund managers aren&#8217;t necessarily the ones
that get the most commissions in trading volume, Feng said.
Factors such as the willingness to commit capital for a firm&#8217;s
transactions and traders&#8217; assessment of how well the securities
company handles orders play into the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a push-pull between the vote a broker earns and
the commissions paid,&#8221; Feng said. &#8220;The results are highly
correlated but not proportional.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the amount paid for research and advisory services, 21
percent was used to compensate brokers for access to management
at companies the firms may want to buy or sell, up from 19 the
previous year, the Greenwich report said. Payment for analyst
services decreased to 24 percent from 27 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley (MS),
all based in New York, were ranked the top brokers based on the
quality of their U.S. research. The ranking based on research
and advisory votes includes the quality and breadth of a firm&#8217;s
offering, Feng said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse in Zurich was also the top broker for North
American trading of baskets of stock. That result was based on
interviews with 109 firms, weighted by the dollar amount they
trade, the Greenwich report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 2010 Crash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to needing to pay for research and investment
services, asset managers and hedge funds became more concerned
about electronic trading after the May 6, 2010, plunge that
briefly erased $862 billion in equity value, Feng said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That prompted them to pare back the use of electronic
trading, including algorithms that break up orders into smaller
pieces and dark pools, to 40 percent of the total dollar value
of transactions from 45 percent the previous year, he said.
Algorithmic trading claimed 19 percent of dollar volume, the
same as the prior year. For dark pools, or private venues, the
proportion slipped to 8 percent from 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average commission paid to brokers for algorithmic
trading was 1.3 cents a share across asset managers, with hedge
funds paying 1 cent, Greenwich said. Dark pools charged an
average 1.4 cents. For direct market access, in which clients
trade on exchanges themselves, brokers charged 1.2 cents on
average, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking Brokers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of U.S. asset managers using so-called client
commission arrangements increased to 64 percent from 54 percent
the previous year, Greenwich said. These offerings allow mutual
funds and asset managers to trade with brokers they want and add
money to the commission paid to compensate other firms whose
research they use. Nomura Holdings Inc.&#8217;s Instinet Inc., Capital
Institutional Services Inc. and BNY ConvergEx have offered
access to research from other firms for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the U.S. equities survey may not indicate a
shift in the longer-term trend toward more electronic trading by
mutual funds, pensions and hedge fund clients, Feng said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the commission pool goes back up next year, the
percentage spent for research may revert to a historical norm,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will return
$800 million in cash and securities belonging to customers of
bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)&#8217;s brokerage under a
settlement approved by a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James M. Peck today approved the
accord, struck in April between the second-biggest U.S. bank and
the trustee liquidating the remains of the brokerage, Lehman
Brothers Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the main clearing bank for the Lehman
brokerage, processing billions of dollars of transactions and
lending it tens of billions of dollars daily, according to court
filings. While some loans were secured by securities in the
brokerage&#8217;s accounts, the bank didn&#8217;t have a valid lien on the
$800 million in customer property that is being returned,
according to filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Customer property held by the LBI estate available for
distribution will increase by more than $800 million,&#8221; the
trustee, James Giddens, said in an e-mailed statement today.
&#8220;This is a significant and positive result from two years of
investigation and close cooperation with JPMorgan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consenting to return the assets in April, the bank said the
settlement would have &#8220;no material financial impact,&#8221; as most
of the assets had already been set aside to satisfy potential
claims by the trustee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, JPMorgan is seeking dismissal of an $8.6
billion lawsuit by the Lehman parent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage bankruptcy case is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Lehman Brothers Inc., 08-01420, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures fell, indicating
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index will drop for a second day, amid
concern about the effects of the European debt crisis on banks
and as American jobless claims rose more than forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) retreated after
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said the
debt crisis threatens to infect banks. Chevron Corp. (CVX) and
Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc. (FCX) declined at least 1.6
percent as a rising dollar sent commodities down. ConAgra Foods
Inc. (CAG) slumped 2.6 percent as the food manufacturer reported
profit that missed analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP 500 futures expiring in September slid 1.2 percent to
1,264.30 at 9:03 a.m. in New York. The benchmark gauge yesterday
snapped a four-day rally after the Federal Reserve lowered its
forecast for economic growth. Dow Jones Industrial Average
futures retreated 119 points, or 1 percent, to 11,903 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has fallen 4.3 percent this month through
yesterday as reports showed consumer confidence dropped more
than forecast and sales of existing homes decreased. The index
was still up 2.4 percent in 2011 through yesterday amid better-
than-expected earnings and government stimulus measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global stocks fell today as Trichet said risk signals for
financial stability in the euro area are flashing &#8220;red&#8221; as the
debt crisis threatens to infect banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On a personal basis I would say &#8216;yes, it is red&#8217;,&#8221;
Trichet said late yesterday in Frankfurt after a meeting of the
European Systemic Risk Board, referring to the group&#8217;s planned
&#8220;dashboard&#8221; to monitor risks. &#8220;The message of the board is
that&#8221; the link between debt problems and banks &#8220;is the most
serious threat to financial stability in the European Union.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Russia-in-1998&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek crisis has all the elements that dogged Russia
during its 1998 default, according to Sergei Ulatov, the
resident World Bank economist in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Greece example reminds me very much of what was
happening in Russia in 1998, but on a much larger scale,&#8221;
Ulatov said in an interview during the Russia and CIS Capital
Markets Forum organized by Euromoney in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock-futures extended losses before the start of regular
trading as a report showed that applications for jobless
benefits increased 9,000 in the week ended June 18 to 429,000,
Labor Department figures showed today. The level of claims
exceeded the highest estimate in a Bloomberg News survey in
which the median projection called for 415,000 filings. The
number of people on benefit rolls was little changed, while
those getting extended payments rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Home Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchases of new houses probably dropped in May for the
first time in three months, showing the real-estate market is
struggling to gain traction. Sales likely decreased 4 percent to
a 310,000 annual rate last month, according to the median
forecast of 67 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
Commerce Department&#8217;s report is due at 10 a.m. in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks declined. JPMorgan retreated 1.3 percent to $40.16.
Citigroup fell 1.4 percent to $38.97. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy and raw material producers slumped as the dollar
rose, curbing demand for commodities as alternative investments.
Chevron slid 1.7 percent to $99.40. Freeport-McMoRan dropped 2.1
percent to $47.85. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConAgra declined 2.6 percent to $24.75. The food
manufacturer attempting to acquire Ralcorp Holdings Inc. (RAH) said
its consumer food unit was &#8220;challenged by difficult
conditions&#8221; in the latest quarter because of higher costs,
according to a statement. The company, the maker of Chef
Boyardee pasta and Slim Jim snacks, raised prices earlier this
year to help offset higher wheat costs. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture predicts food prices will rise 4 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said a U.S.
Senate vote implies much greater headwinds for further
extensions of ethanol policies, which expire at the year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 16, the U.S. senate passed an amendment to repeal
the existing tax credit of 45 cents per gallon to ethanol
blenders and a tariff of 54 cents per gallon on imported
ethanol, the bank said in a note dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the vote was largely symbolic and we believe the
likelihood of an imminent repeal remains low, it still implies
much greater headwinds for further extensions of these ethanol

may have unusual moves in U.S. trading June 27. Stock symbols
are in parentheses, and prices are as of 5:40 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF)  fell 0.4 percent to
$86.30. North America&#8217;s largest iron-ore producer said
regulators rebuffed its carbon monoxide remediation plan for the
Pinnacle Mine in West Virginia. The plan would have allowed
resumption of underground mining operations at Pinnacle, which
now won&#8217;t restart before the fourth quarter, the company said.
Operations were stopped in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freddie Mac (FMCC US): The mortgage-finance company
operating under federal conservatorship said it entered into an
agreement with Taylor, Bean  Whitaker Mortgage Corp. that will
allow Freddie Mac to be granted a $1.02 billion unsecured claim
in the Taylor, Bean bankruptcy estate, among other measures. The
claim may result in a distribution of about $40 million to $45
million, Freddie Mac said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)  declined 0.2 percent to
$39.40. Irving H. Picard, the trustee for the liquidation of
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s investment company, filed an amended complaint
in U.S. court against the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
seeking to collect a minimum of $19 billion in damages. Picard
had sought $5.4 billion in damages previously, in addition to $1
billion in transfers and claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universal Forest Products Inc. (UFPI) : The maker of do-

the liquidation of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s investment company, filed an
amended complaint in U.S. court against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
that seeks to collect a minimum of $19 billion in damages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hulu.com, the online video site
considering a sale, reached a tentative agreement for renewed
rights to television shows from its part-owner, Walt Disney Co. (DIS),
according to two people with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Disney, which operates the ABC broadcast
network, is similar to Los Angeles-based Hulu&#8217;s new arrangement
with another co-owner, Fox parent News Corp. (NWSA), said the people,
who weren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly. The News Corp.-Hulu
renewal was reported by Variety this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renewed license agreements will make the website more
attractive in a sale, said Steve Beck, a managing partner at New
York-based management consultant Cg42 LLC. The new agreements
will allow more more ads to be sold against current shows,
including &#8220;Modern Family,&#8221; which airs on ABC, and Fox&#8217;s
&#8220;Family Guy,&#8221; the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A deal is relatively unlikely&#8221; without the agreements,
said Beck, whose clients include Microsoft Corp. &#8220;Any deal
would be contingent on ongoing access to that content.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deals may be signed within weeks, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;Modern Family&#8221; episode on Hulu includes about 2.5
minutes of ads. On a broadcast network, commercial time totals
about 8 minutes per half hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hulu Chief Executive Officer Jason Kilar said in a February
blog post on the site that, with fewer ads than traditional
television, the website is a more effective marketing medium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elisa Schreiber, a Hulu spokeswoman, declined to comment.
Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-based Disney,
didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hulu, whose owners also include Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s NBC and
Providence Equity Partners, was approached by a potential buyer
and is weighing its options, a person with knowledge of the
situation said this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-biggest
U.S. energy company, bought a 50-story office tower that it
occupies in downtown Houston (BHTX) from Brookfield Office Properties
Inc. (BPO) for $340 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookfield paid about $120 million for the skyscraper at
1400 Smith St. in 2006, the New York-based real estate company
said in a statement today. It leased the entire building, the
former headquarters of Enron Corp., to Chevron soon after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale price is a &#8220;coup&#8221; for Brookfield, said Dan Fasulo, managing director at Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New
York-based real estate research firm. Houston added 50,700 jobs,
a 2 percent increase, in the 12 months through February, helping
stabilize a property market where 2.1 million square feet
(195,000 square meters) of new offices will be completed by year
end, brokerage Cushman  Wakefield Inc. reported in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a win-win for both parties,&#8221; Fasulo said in a phone
interview. &#8220;For Chevron, obviously they&#8217;re a cash-rich
corporation. They have the money to buy their own property,&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal for the 1.3 million-square-foot building made
&#8220;economic sense,&#8221; Mickey Driver, a spokesman for San Ramon,
California-based Chevron, said in a phone interview. He declined
to discuss the financial benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Owning Buildings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron owns and operates most of its office buildings,
according to Driver. The company has about 9,000 employees in
the Houston area, in offices in downtown Houston, Bellaire and
Briarpark, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It owns 1500 Louisiana St., across from the Smith Street
tower, and a nearby 1,100-space parking garage, Driver said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookfield owned 1400 Smith St. in a joint venture with
Blackstone Group LP (BX), the world&#8217;s largest private-equity firm,
said Kristin Calmes, a Brookfield spokeswoman. The companies
together acquired seven other Houston properties in 2006 through
their buyout of Trizec Properties Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to Peter Rose, a spokesman for New York-based
Blackstone, wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This sale is reflective of our ongoing strategy of
recycling capital from mature assets into more accretive
opportunities,&#8221; said Richard Clark, Brookfield&#8217;s chief
executive officer, in the statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale is Brookfield&#8217;s second multi-million-dollar
transaction in Houston in the last seven months. The company
paid $321.5 million in December for Heritage Plaza, a 53-story
skyscraper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chevron deal equals about $260 a square foot. That&#8217;s
roughly consistent with what Brookfield paid for the 1.2
million-square-foot Heritage Plaza, Real Capital&#8217;s Fasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron also renewed a 311,000-square-foot lease at the
neighboring 1600 Smith St. for seven years, Brookfield said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookfield, which owns New York&#8217;s World Financial Center,
has 78 million square feet of office buildings in the U.S.,
Canada and Australia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s pensions
buyout unit, Rothesay Life, mistakenly told U.K. regulators it
had entered into derivatives contracts valued at 151 billion
pounds ($242 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank overstated the position by a factor of a thousand
in its annual return to the Financial Services Authority, signed
by the unit&#8217;s chief executive, Addy Loudiadis, and audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The unit has 151 million pounds of
inflation and interest-rate swaps outstanding, spokeswoman Fiona Laffan said by e-mail today. The firm told the FSA about the
typographical error after filing in March and wasn&#8217;t required to
resubmit it, Laffan said. PwC declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which set up Rothesay in 2007, manages about 4.3
billion pounds of pensions liabilities for companies including
British Airways and RSA Insurance Group Plc. (RSA) Firms such as
Rothesay promise to pay pensions if retirees live beyond a
certain age. They typically receive a portion of the pension
plan&#8217;s assets in return and try to hedge the risk they take on
with derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothesay has total capital of 161 million pounds, 350
percent more than the regulatory minimum required by the FSA,
according to the filing, and more than competitors including
Pension Insurance Corp., Prudential Plc (PRU), and Legal  General
Group Plc (LGEN), according to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also disclosed in the filing it assumes
pensioners will live longer than their employers assume. London-
based RSA said in 2009 it expected 65-year-old men to live a
further 22.5 years on average, while Rothesay, which reinsured
the fund the same year, says that these men will live for 25
more years. Rothesay expects a woman aged 45 today to pass their
95th birthday, five years more than RSA&#8217;s assumptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The more conservative these assumptions are, the better
capitalised and solvent the insurance company is,&#8221; Goldman
Sachs said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish banks rose, sending the
benchmark gauge for lenders to the highest level in almost two
weeks, after JPMorgan Chase  Co. said the industry&#8217;s ratings
may improve after the third quarter and valuations are &#8220;looking
appealing&#8221; following recent losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banking index added 1.4 percent to 128,855.1 by the
5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul. Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN), the
country biggest lender by market value, jumped 1.1 percent to
7.34 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would be adding to Turkish exposure near current price
levels,&#8221; analysts led by Paul Formanko in London wrote in a
report on banks in central and eastern Europe, the Middle East
and Africa. The brokerage kept its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on
Turkish banks on a &#8220;long-term view,&#8221; recommending Garanti,
Yapi  Kredi Bankasi AS and Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS. (HALKB) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank has lifted reserve requirements for
lenders four times since December by a total of 10 percentage
points, helping damp earnings outlooks and fuel a 10 percent
drop in the banking index this year. That compares with a 6
percent drop in the broader ISE National 100 Index. (XU100) Banks make
up about 40 percent of the ISE 100 gauge, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish banking underperformance has been due to
&#8220;uncertainty&#8221; over central bank measures to tackle loan growth
that&#8217;s helping to drive up the current-account deficit,
according to JPMorgan. Share price performance &#8220;will remain
volatile over the second and third quarters as the markets focus
on margin evolution and central bank policy measures,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Rebound &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings per share will probably decline 11 percent this
year, followed by a 19 percent increase in 2012 and 21 percent
gain in 2013, Formanko wrote in the report. Price estimates for
banks were lowered to reflect &#8220;the full impact from regulatory,
administrative measures and market trends,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halkbank advanced 2.6 percent to 11.65 liras today, and
Yapi Kredi gained 1.8 percent to 3.96 liras. JPMorgan cut its
price estimate for Halkbank to 15 liras from 16 liras and
lowered Yapi Kredi&#8217;s estimate to 4.9 liras from 6.4 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan cut Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISCTR) AS to &#8220;underweight&#8221; from
&#8220;neutral,&#8221; and Asya Katilim Bankasi AS (ASYAB) to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;overweight,&#8221; citing &#8220;limited upside potential&#8221; from revised
estimates, according to the report. Isbank&#8217;s price estimate was
reduced to 5.1 liras from 6.1 liras, while the projection for
Akbank was raised to 7.5 liras from 7.4 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akbank gained 1.9 percent to 7.54 liras, and Isbank added
0.6 percent to 4.84 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISE National 100 Index rose for a second day, rising
0.8 percent to 62,072.64. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
hasn&#8217;t arranged a debt or equity sale in Ukraine since at least
1999, will advise the government of the former Soviet republic
free of charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein,
will advise the administration of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov
on managing its investments, state debt and &#8220;other issues of
financial-policy implementation,&#8221; the government said in a
statement dated June 20 and published on its website today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selection follows Goldman&#8217;s third attempt in 17 years
to crack the neighboring Russian market where it has been
ramping up presence and wooing the Kremlin for roles in asset
sales. The bank, once the most profitable securities firm in
Wall Street history, wasn&#8217;t involved in a single deal since 1999
as the Ukrainian government and companies raised $41.4 billion
in stock and debt sales during the period, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monika Schaller, a Goldman spokeswoman in Frankfurt, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to two telephone calls and a written request
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second Bailout &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine&#8217;s government, which in July obtained a $15.6
billion loan from the International Monetary Fund for its second
bailout in two years, expects its debt servicing payments to
peak between 2012 and 2016. The nation resumed Eurobond sales in
2010 after a three-year break and has sold $2.75 billion of debt
so far this year. The government may issue as much as $4.5
billion in bonds in 2011, according to the budget plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has also twice extended a $2 billion six-month loan
from VTB Group, Russia&#8217;s second-largest bank, which it received
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IMF has so far released $3.4 billion in two tranches,
helping the government cover its deficit and boost foreign-
currency reserves. The third disbursement, initially planned for
March, has been delayed after the authorities failed to raise
the retirement age and increase household utility prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine may receive $3 billion from the IMF in September,
Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Tigipko said June 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will have to repay 153.3 billion hryvnia
($19.2 billion) between 2012 and 2016, the Finance Ministry said
Dec. 28. Ukraine&#8217;s state debt, including guarantees, more than
tripled since the beginning of 2008, surging to $57.8 billion as
of May 31, according to the ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley (MS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Morgan Stanley and VTB organized the
government&#8217;s $1.25 billion sale of five-year bonds this month.
UBS AG (UBSN), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Morgan Stanley were the top
three of the 67 underwriters of Ukrainian share and bond sales
between Jan. 1 1999 and now, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Russia, by contrast, Goldman jumped to fourth place in
handling equity sales for Russian companies last year, its
highest position ever, behind VTB Capital and Renaissance
Capital, both based in Moscow, and Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, was one of
the four banks chosen by Russia&#8217;s central bank June 14 to manage
a sale of part of its stake in OAO Sberbank, a transaction that
may be worth as much as $7 billion. It also helped sell 300
million pounds ($480 million) of sterling-denominated bonds
issued by OAO Russian Railways June 15 and assisted with Russian
search engine owner Yandex NV&#8217;s $1.3 billion initial public
offering in May. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) and NYSE Euronext
settled shareholder lawsuits challenging the $9.53 billion
buyout of the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange by
offering to pay $910 million in dividends earlier this month,
court papers show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement to pay the dividends helped to resolve suits
in Delaware and New York alleging the all-stock deal provided
too little for investors, according to a filing in Delaware
Chancery Court. The payout totals about 620 million euros, equal
to 2 euros a Deutsche Boerse share or $1.37 a NYSE share,
company officials said June 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased with the result here, because this
dividend will give shareholders a quantifiable and immediate
payment,&#8221; Mark Lebovitch, a New York-based lawyer for NYSE
shareholders, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Boerse agreed to buy NYSE Euronext (NYX), owner of the
New York Stock Exchange and the Liffe derivatives market, for
$9.53 billion in February. IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) and
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) dropped a competing bid last month after
the U.S. Justice Department threatened an antitrust lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Adamonis, spokesman for New York-based NYSE Euronext,
didn&#8217;t return a phone call for comment yesterday. Tim Lynch, a
spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchanges agreed to pay the dividends and settle the
suit in hopes of winning support for the deal in a vote next
month. Deutsche Boerse needs 75 percent of shareholders to
approve its purchase of NYSE Euronext by July 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors can opt to &#8220;terminate the settlement&#8221; if the
exchanges decide against paying the dividends, according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE Euronext investors sued in Delaware in February,
calling Deutsche Boerse&#8217;s offer &#8220;grossly inadequate.&#8221; The
shareholders alleged the bid valued NYSE Euronext at less than
targets in similar deals, such as London Stock Exchange Group
Plc&#8217;s purchase of Canada&#8217;s TMX Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Boerse officials acknowledged that the lawsuits
&#8220;were a factor&#8221; in the decision to pay the dividends, lawyers
for NYSE Euronext investors said in court papers. The suits also
helped persuade NYSE officials to give investors an opportunity
to have the value of their shares appraised, according to the
June 17 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine must decide
whether to give the accord final approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re NYSE Euronext Shareholders Litigation, CA
No. 6220, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan to Return $800 Million to Lehman Brokerage Clients &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will return $800 million in cash and
securities belonging to customers of bankrupt Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)&#8217;s brokerage under a settlement approved by a
judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James M. Peck yesterday approved the
accord, struck in April between the second-biggest U.S. bank and
the trustee liquidating the remains of the brokerage, Lehman
Brothers Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the main clearing bank for the Lehman
brokerage, processing billions of dollars of transactions and
lending it tens of billions of dollars daily, according to court
filings. While some loans were secured by securities in the
brokerage&#8217;s accounts, the bank didn&#8217;t have a valid lien on the
$800 million in customer property that is being returned,
according to filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Customer property held by the LBI estate available for
distribution will increase by more than $800 million,&#8221; the
trustee, James Giddens, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.
&#8220;This is a significant and positive result from two years of
investigation and close cooperation with JPMorgan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consenting to return the assets in April, the bank said the
settlement would have &#8220;no material financial impact,&#8221; as most
of the assets had already been set aside to satisfy potential
claims by the trustee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, JPMorgan is seeking dismissal of an $8.6
billion lawsuit by the Lehman parent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage bankruptcy case is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Lehman Brothers Inc., 08-01420, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug Marketing Curbs Voided by Top Court on Speech Grounds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court, invoking free-speech grounds,
overturned a Vermont law aimed at limiting the ability of brand-
name drugmakers to target doctors with individual sales pitches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6-3 ruling is a victory for the pharmaceutical industry
and so-called data-mining companies that sell information to
drugmakers about the prescription-writing practices of
individual doctors. The invalidated measure barred use of that
data for marketing without the doctor&#8217;s consent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vermont law targeted &#8220;detailing,&#8221; the industry
practice of one-on-one marketing to doctors to persuade them to
prescribe particular drugs. Companies spend more than $8 billion
a year on detailing, according to trial testimony in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The state may not burden the speech of others in order to
tilt public debate in a preferred direction,&#8221; Justice Anthony
Kennedy wrote for the majority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vermont is one of three New England states that restricted
the use of prescription records for marketing, and similar
legislation has been introduced in two dozen other states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena
Kagan dissented. Breyer said the law was part of the state&#8217;s
legitimate efforts to protect public health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sorrell v. IMS Health, 10-779, U.S. Supreme
Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic-Drug Makers Shielded From Lawsuits, Top Court Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court gave a new legal shield to the
generic-drug industry, ruling that companies can&#8217;t be sued for
failing to warn patients about the risk of dangerous side
effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5-4 ruling bars two women from suing units of Mylan
Inc. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) over
metoclopramide, a stomach drug they say caused them to contract
a severe neurological disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision limits the reach of a 2009 Supreme Court
ruling that required brand-name drugmakers to defend against
failure-to-warn suits filed under state product liability law.
Generic-drug companies successfully argued that they shouldn&#8217;t
held to the same standard because federal law requires them to
copy the packaging inserts used by brand-name manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the manufacturers had independently changed their
labels to satisfy their state-law duty, they would have violated
federal law,&#8221; Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling divided the court along familiar lines, with
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony
Kennedy and Samuel Alito joining Thomas in the majority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the ruling &#8220;leads
to so many absurd consequences that I cannot fathom that
Congress would have intended to preempt state law in these
cases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Pliva v. Mensing, 09-993; Actavis Elizabeth
v. Mensing, 09-1039; and Actavis v. Demahy, 09-1501, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline, SB Pharmco to Settle With 37 States, D.C. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline LLC and SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc. entered
into a $40.8 million accord with 37 U.S. states and the District
of Columbia to resolve allegations they breached drug
manufacturing standards, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madigan, in a press statement issued yesterday, said that
between 2001 and 2004 the companies made bad batches of the
anti-nausea drug Kytril, which is used by chemotherapy patients;
Avandamet, a drug used to treat diabetes; the antidepressant
Paxil CR and the antibiotic topical treatment Bactroban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consumers put their faith in drug companies that the
medications they purchase are safe,&#8221; the attorney general said.
&#8220;My office will not tolerate pharmaceutical companies cutting
corners at the potential expense of consumer health.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madigan, in a complaint and settlement agreement she said
was filed yesterday at the Illinois state courthouse in Chicago,
accused the drug companies of unfair and deceptive practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no current cause for concern for patients,&#8221; she
said, adding that the products in question had previously been
recalled or have since expired and the manufacturing facility
has closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company chose to settle the matter, which it
initially disclosed in its 2010 fourth quarter results and its
2010 annual report, to avoid the expense and uncertainty of
protracted litigation and trial,&#8221; according to a
GlaxoSmithKline statement issued yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker, which has offices in Philadelphia and
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, didn&#8217;t admit to any
wrongdoing or liability. The company is a unit of London-based
GlaxoSmithKline Plc. (GSK) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Railroads Lose Supreme Court Fight Over Worker Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court, ruling against a CSX Corp. (CSX) unit,
made it easier for railroad industry workers to win lawsuits
blaming their company for injuries they suffered on the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices, voting 5-4, yesterday upheld a $184,250 award
to a locomotive engineer who said CSX Transportation Inc. was
responsible for a hand injury he suffered while at the helm of a
train. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case centered on the test for determining whether a
railroad&#8217;s negligence was the cause of an employee&#8217;s injury. The
federal judge overseeing the CSX trial in Benton, Illinois, told
the jury that the railroad was responsible if its negligence
&#8220;played a part -- no matter how small -- in bringing about the
injury.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSX contended workers should have to meet the more
demanding standard, known as proximate cause, that applies in
other types of personal-injury suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In upholding the award, the Supreme Court said the Federal
Employers&#8217; Liability Act, which governs railroad industry suits,
lets workers recover damages without meeting the proximate cause
test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the court&#8217;s majority
opinion. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia,
Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito dissented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CSX Transportation v. McBride, 10-235, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viacom Sues Cablevision Over Distribution of Shows on IPad &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viacom Inc. (VIA/B) sued Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) in federal court
in New York over the distribution of its programming on Apple
Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viacom seeks a court order directing the Bethpage, New
York-based cable provider to halt &#8220;unauthorized distribution&#8221;
of its copyrighted entertainment programming via wireless
portable devices using an iPad application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Viacom also seeks unspecified damages
stemming from Cablevision&#8217;s April 2 launch of the computer
application which allows its users to get live streaming feeds
of what Viacom says is its copyrighted entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On April 2, 2011, despite Viacom&#8217;s repeated objections,
Cablevision launched the iPad to its cable television
subscribers, and included nineteen of Viacom&#8217;s programming
channels, in violation of the parties&#8217; agreements and Viacom&#8217;s
intellectual property rights,&#8221; Viacom said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viacom said that both sides have since engaged in
discussions to resolve the dispute without success, while
Cablevision &#8220;continues to refuse to remove Viacom&#8217;s programming
from its iPad services.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Maiella, a spokesman for Cablevision, said the
company was preparing a statement and that he didn&#8217;t have an
immediate comment on the litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Viacom Inc. v. Cablevision Systems Corp. 11-CV-
4265, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakheel&#8217;s Ex-CEO Sues the Developer for Breach of Contract &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakheel PJSC&#8217;s former chief executive officer, Chris
O&#8217;Donnell, is suing the company for breach of contract in the
Dubai World Special tribunal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO, who quit earlier this month after five years at
the developer&#8217;s helm, filed a lawsuit June 22 without saying how
much he&#8217;s seeking, according to court records. Nakheel has 14
days to acknowledge the claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakheel, which built palm tree-shaped islands off Dubai&#8217;s
coast, is restructuring $10.5 billion of debt after the global
credit crisis caused property demand in Dubai to evaporate. Home
prices slid by more than 60 from their peak in mid-2008, forcing
developers to cancel and delay projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tribunal&#8217;s website lists 33 cases involving Nakheel and
contractors, buyers and developers including Kleindienst
Properties Limited. The Austrian developer, which bought six
islands on Nakheel&#8217;s man-made archipelago shaped as a world map,
was sued by Nakheel on June 12 for breach of contract, the
court&#8217;s website shows. Nakheel is seeking $199 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a difference of opinion between ourselves and
Nakheel on the amount due for the islands purchased by the
Kleindienst Group, and the time frame in which this is due,&#8221;
Kleindienst said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josef Kleindienst, CEO at the family-owned company, has
acknowledged the claim and the case will go to court, the
company said. Meanwhile, work on Kleindienst&#8217;s 3.1 billion-
dirham ($840 million) project has been suspended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Nakheel declined to comment on the cases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HSBC Seeks Dismissal of $9 Billion Madoff Trustee Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), seeking dismissal of a $9 billion
lawsuit by the trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm, said
he isn&#8217;t allowed by law to bring such cases on behalf of the
confidence man&#8217;s former customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving Picard, the trustee, sued HSBC and a dozen so-called
feeder funds for $9 billion in December, accusing them of aiding
Madoff&#8217;s fraud. Yesterday, Picard and HSBC, which acted as
custodian for the funds, argued in front of U.S. District Judge
Jed Rakoff in Manhattan over whether the case should be
dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard is mistakenly suing HSBC for damages on the theory
that it had a duty to investigate the Madoff fraud and that it
hurt all of the con man&#8217;s investors by not doing so, said Thomas
Moloney, a lawyer for the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;HSBC owes no duty to these customers,&#8221; Moloney said.
&#8220;HSBC was not the watchman&#8221; for all Madoff investors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff said he will rule on HSBC&#8217;s request by the end of
July. The dispute pits Europe&#8217;s biggest lender against the
lawyer liquidating Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC,
which perpetrated the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.
Picard has filed 1,000 lawsuits in bankruptcy court to recover
$90 billion from banks and former Madoff investors who allegedly
profited from the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district court case is Irving H. Picard v. HSBC Bank
Plc, 11-cv-0763, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carl Icahn Suit Against Raynor, R2 Investments Dismissed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Icahn&#8217;s lawsuit seeking at least $100 million from
Texas hedge-fund promoter Geoffrey Raynor, his R2 Investments
LDC and others was dismissed by a New York state judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the suit, filed in February 2010, Icahn said Raynor
interfered with a $2 billion bond offering by Icahn Enterprises
LP and other Icahn companies. Justice Eileen Bransten in
Manhattan yesterday dismissed the case, which included claims of
tortious interference with contract, libel and abuse of process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raynor and Icahn formed a partnership in 2001 to acquire
debt securities issued by Federal Mogul Corp., which was in
bankruptcy at the time, Bransten said in her decision. After a
dispute over the right to purchase some Federal Mogul stock,
Raynor made a securities filing in January 2010 disclosing a
suit commenced the same day by Raynor-affiliated Nineteen
Eighty-Nine LLC seeking to impose a &#8220;constructive trust&#8221; on
the shares, Bransten said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn, 75, said the timing of the regulatory filing and
suit lowered demand for the bond offering. He sued Raynor, R2,
Nineteen Eighty-Nine and five other defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A message left with Icahn&#8217;s secretary wasn&#8217;t returned. A
message left with attorneys for Raynor also wasn&#8217;t returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Icahn v. Raynor, 150040/2010, New York state
Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anglo Irish Says U.S. Assets Sale, Merger Are &#8216;Sovereign&#8217; Acts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo Irish Bank Corp. defended a sale of its U.S. loan
portfolio that was ordered by the Irish government and its
acquisition of Irish Nationwide Building Society, calling them
&#8220;non-commercial, sovereign acts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo Irish Bank made the statement in a letter June 22 to
U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe in Manhattan, who had
directed the bank to disclose whether it has sold substantial
commercial assets in the U.S. and whether a sale of its
remaining U.S. assets was imminent. The letter was obtained by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fir Tree Partners, a New York investment firm, sued Anglo
Irish Bank in February, claiming it owns $200 million of notes
the bank issued in the U.S. Fir Tree seeks an order blocking
Anglo Irish Bank from transferring any U.S. assets out of the
country so it can force the bank to honor its debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fir Tree sent a letter to the judge on June 20 asking for
an expedited hearing on the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo Irish Bank said the sale of its U.S. assets and its
acquisition of Irish Nationwide Building Society in &#8220;the next
week or two weeks&#8221; had been reported in the global press and
were consistent with and anticipated in statements it has made
to the court, according to yesterday&#8217;s letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Smith, a lawyer for Fir Tree, and Walter Stuart, a
lawyer for Anglo Irish Bank, didn&#8217;t return calls for comment
after regular business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fir Tree Capital Opportunity Master Fund LP v.
Anglo Irish Bank Corp., 11-CV-0955, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn Accuser Hires French Lawyer to Find Other Victims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman who accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn of attempted
rape and sexual assault in New York hired a Paris lawyer to look
for women in France who may have been victimized by the former
International Monetary Fund chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth P. Thompson, a former federal prosecutor who is
representing the accuser in New York, hired Thibault de
Montbrial to provide legal support, the French lawyer said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am working with him, I am the contact for his firm in
France, notably to see if there exist other victims of Mr.
Strauss-Kahn,&#8221; de Montbrial said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn, 62, was arrested May 14 and later indicted on
seven counts, including criminal sex act, attempted rape, sexual
abuse, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. If convicted
of the top charges, he faces as long as 25 years in prison. He
has pleaded not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He allegedly attacked a housekeeper, a 32-year-old from
Guinea, at the Midtown Manhattan Sofitel on May 14, grabbing her
breasts and trying to pull down her pantyhose, prosecutors said
in court papers. The former IMF chief attempted to rape her and
forced her to perform oral sex, according to the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Montbrial represented former Renault SA employee
Matthieu Tenenbaum in his wrongful-firing case over false claims
he sold information on the automaker&#8217;s electric-car program. De
Montbrial declined to say when he was hired or comment on how
information he uncovers would be used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Browne, a spokeswoman for Thompson, had no immediate
comment. Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Strauss-Kahn, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Illinois, you&#8217;re never too big or
too small to get stiffed by the state, which is $4 billion
behind in its bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Inc. is owed $1.1 million.
Office Depot Inc. (ODP) is waiting for a $660,955 check. And the 17th
Street Bar  Grill in Sparta is due $340.52. They are among at
least 8,000 vendors including businesses, charities and
government agencies waiting months for the state to pay up. At
least 114 companies are due more than $1 million, according to
documents from Illinois Comptroller Judy Baar Topinka. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While states periodically fall behind in paying Medicaid
providers or, in the case of California, rely on bank loans and
IOUs, the Illinois backlog has been growing for three years.
It&#8217;s forcing some vendors to fire workers, cut services and, if
they can, obtain loans and lines of credit to keep their
businesses going while the state takes months to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An Illinois phenomenon,&#8221; said Ron Ford, CEO of Chicago-
based Help at Home Inc., which is owed $43.4 million and hasn&#8217;t
heard from the state since December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creditors include health and education agencies, schools,
charities, funeral homes, plumbing-and-heating contractors and
purveyors of food, coal, clothing, electronics and pizza. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s &#8220;Cars 2&#8221; had
estimated sales of $25.7 million yesterday for the sequel to the
2006 animated film about talking vehicles, Hollywood.com said in
an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pixar film, which appeared in 4,115 theaters, is
expected to post sales of $59 million for the weekend, according
to BoxOfficeMojo.com. Hollywood.com Box-Office President Paul Dergarabedian said sales may exceed expectations with a weekend
total between $65 million and $70 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directed by John Lasseter, the movie has stock car
Lightning McQueen, voiced by actor Owen Wilson, vying for world
racing supremacy against Formula One champ Francesco Bernoulli,
as they race in Japan, Italy, France and England. Actor John Turturro is the voice for Bernoulli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous &#8220;Cars&#8221; movie had $60.1 million in sales its
opening weekend in June 2006 on the way to a domestic gross of
$244.1 million and $461.9 million worldwide, according to
Hollywood.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That film trailed recent efforts by Pixar, including $1.06
billion in sales generated by last year&#8217;s &#8220;Toy Story 3,&#8221;
$731.3 million in worldwide receipts from 2009&#8217;s &#8220;Up,&#8221; and
&#8220;Wall-E&#8221; in 2008 with $532.7 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s most recent No. 1 debut was with the &#8220;Pirates of

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. will take into account
Venezuela&#8217;s new oil-price tax when considering investment in
projects in the country, El Universal reported, citing Ali Moshiri, the company&#8217;s president for Latin America and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Hugo Chavez in April modified Venezuela&#8217;s oil tax
laws by swapping out its old system of royalties and instead
charging a levy of 80 percent or 95 percent on revenue above $70
and $100 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will not pull out of existing projects and expects
to begin producing 50,000 barrels a day from its Carabobo fields
in the Orinoco Belt by September 2012, El Universal said, citing
Moshiri. Production in the Carabobo fields may increase by
50,000 to 100,000 barrels every two year once initial production
is started, Moshiri said, according to El Universal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said in May he expected the
Carabobo fields to have 50,000 barrels a day of early production
with joint venture partners this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) won a
recommendation by an Idaho Department of Transportation official
to use the state&#8217;s Highway 12 to transport heavy equipment
destined for the company&#8217;s Kearl oil-sands project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearing officer recommended the state issue permits to
haul the equipment from the port of Lewiston to the Montana
border, the department said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing officer found no errors were made in granting
the initial permit to haul the equipment through the state,
according to the statement. The recommendation can be appealed
to the hearing officer within 14 days and then appealed to the
head of the department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipment has been held up since April when opposition
groups filed petitions with officials in Idaho and Montana.
Imperial Oil, the Canadian division of Exxon, purchased about
200 modules to be used in the construction of a new bitumen
mining and refinery plant at its Kearl oil-sands project in
northern Alberta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 33 modules, each of which is as tall as 30 feet
(9 meters) and 100 feet long, arrived from Asia at the port of
Vancouver, Washington, in October, where they were to begin the
final leg of their journey along Highway 12 through Idaho and
Montana to Alberta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, is still awaiting a decision
by a Montana judge to use that state&#8217;s portion of the road,
which travels through the Bitterroot Mountains and into Canada. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Jersey officials are negotiating
a temporary bank loan with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) of as much as
$2.25 billion to cover a revenue gap in its new fiscal year, the
Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people
familiar with the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state is considering tapping a so-called bridge loan,
or credit line, to cover bills coming due early in the year
beginning July 1 as it prepares to sell tax-revenue anticipation
notes to cover expenses until it collects taxes, the newspaper
said on its website. The notes would repay the bank loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper said state officials are negotiating with
JPMorgan following competition for the business. A bank
spokesman, whom the newspaper didn&#8217;t identify, declined to
comment. A spokesman for New Jersey, also unidentified, also
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer and Internet stocks led
gains in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
surged the most since September and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) climbed to
the highest level in six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 3.7 percent to $25.20 at 4 p.m. in New York,
and Amazon advanced 4.5 percent to $201.25. Technology stocks in
the SP 500 increased 1.4 percent, the most among 10 groups in
the index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending on computers by companies and governments in the
U.S. will grow 5.6 percent in 2011, about double the estimated
increase for gross domestic product, according to International

shares have posted the third-worst returns in the SP 500 among
the 10 industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There probably was a bit more pessimism that was really

Michael Yoshikami, chief investment strategist at YCMNet

&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. (AIG),
the bailed-out insurer, will face costs of about $500 million
from U.S. storms in April and May, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;High catastrophe losses are likely to pressure property-
and-casualty margins in the second quarter,&#8221; said Jimmy Bhullar, an analyst at JPMorgan, in a note to investors today.
Bhullar rates AIG shares &#8220;neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record catastrophes in the first half of 2011 are weighing
on the Chartis property-casualty unit, which accounts for a
growing share of AIG&#8217;s revenue after Chief Executive Officer
Robert Benmosche sold non-U.S. life insurers. AIG had first-
quarter losses of $1.7 billion on disasters including the March
earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Insurers typically face the
largest claims in the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season,
which is in the third and fourth quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loss of $500 million from U.S. storms in April and May
would rank AIG behind Allstate Corp. (ALL) and State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Co., which rely more on home and auto
insurance. AIG&#8217;s property-casualty sales in the U.S. come mostly
from its commercial insurance business, Bhullar said. Mark Herr,
a spokesman for New York-based AIG, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allstate has said April and May storms will cost the
company $2 billion. State Farm, the largest U.S. home insurer,
said June 16 that it has already paid almost $1.75 billion tied
to the disasters. Storms in the period include the tornado in
May that struck Joplin, Missouri, killing at least 150 people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIA Stake &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG hasn&#8217;t released a statement on second-quarter
catastrophe losses, meaning costs likely won&#8217;t exceed the figure
reported in the first three months of 2011, said Paul Newsome,
an analyst with Sandler O&#8217;Neill Partners LP, in a note to
investors on June 22. AIG announced Japan costs before the end
of the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gains from AIG&#8217;s 33 percent stake in Hong-Kong-based life
insurer AIA Group Ltd. (1299) may cushion catastrophe losses, Bhullar
said. The holding, which AIG retained after divesting most of
its AIA stock in a public offering last year, appreciated by
more than $1 billion since March 31, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG climbed 36 cents to $28.81 at 4:01 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;

Dodgers Will Pay 10% for Bankruptcy Loan From JPMorgan&#8217;s Highbridge</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles Dodgers, which asked
at least seven lenders for money before filing for bankruptcy
today, will pay 10 percent interest on a loan from JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Highbridge Capital Management LLC, plus fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one-year $150 million loan from Highbridge, a New York-
based hedge fund, sets interest at the London interbank offered
rate, or Libor, plus 7 percent, providing that Libor is no lower
than 3 percent, according to a court filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team can draw $60 million initially and $90 million
later. Highbridge, which will have first claim on the Dodgers&#8217;
assets, gets a $4.5 million deferred commitment fee, plus 0.5
percent of the unused part of the loan, payable monthly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a very expensive loan&#8221; for an entity like the
Dodgers, said Lynn LoPucki, a bankruptcy-law professor at the
University of California at Los Angeles. &#8220;If the assets are
worth the $500 million the debtor claims, repayment is virtually
certain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team listed assets of $500 million to $1 billion in its
Chapter 11 petition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darin Oduyoye, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment.
Dodgers assistant treasurer Jeffrey Ingram said in a court
filing that the team had &#8220;no adequate alternative,&#8221; as only
Highbridge &#8220;was willing to provide a commitment for financing
of a sufficient amount and within the debtors&#8217; time
constraints.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coyotes Loan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phoenix Coyotes paid 7 percent for a bankruptcy loan in
2009 with no fees to the lenders, said Chip Bowles, a bankruptcy
lawyer at Greenebaum Doll  McDonald PLLC in Louisville,
Kentucky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies in some industries paid more than the Dodgers for
bankruptcy loans. Borders Group Inc. this year paid as much as
13.5 percent for some loans, and Trico Marine Services Inc. last
year paid 14 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sbarro Inc. and Great Atlantic  Pacific Tea Co. paid 8.75
percent for some loans in the past two years, according to
Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highbridge may be charging a higher interest rate because
of &#8220;the special nature of a sports team,&#8221; said Stephen Lubben,
a bankruptcy professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in
Newark, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The assets are not worth as much to a lender, because the
league can veto sales,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Rangers, sold last year to a group including Hall
of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan, needed approval of its bankruptcy
auction from owners of at least 23 of the 30 Major League
Baseball teams, as well as Commissioner Bud Selig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auction Delayed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coyotes had to delay the team&#8217;s 2009 auction after the
National Hockey League said Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf
and another bidder needed more time to improve their offers. The
NHL was the buyer in the end, paying $140 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Coyotes&#8217; owner wanted to sell against the will of the
league,&#8221; Bowles said. Similarly, the Dodgers, in  discussions
in court filings of a television-rights deal with News Corp. (NWS)&#8217;s
Fox Sports that was rejected by the league, were &#8220;clearly
saying between the lines the Fox contract was a good deal,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodgers, which lost money last year as attendance
dropped and the team failed to reach the playoffs, have $40
million in payroll obligations on June 30 and July 1, according
to Ingram. At least four potential lenders of the seven
approached reviewed the team&#8217;s finances, and only Highbridge
agreed to provide all it needed, he said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deal Rejected &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the TV rights deal with Fox Sports fell through on
June 20, the team stepped up its effort to find other sources of
money, Ingram said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selig last week said the 17-year deal with Fox, which
Dodgers owner Frank McCourt said would have assured financial
stability for the team, would harm the franchise in the long
term. Baseball took over the team&#8217;s business operations about
two months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodgers have five bank accounts with Bank of America
Corp. (BAC), according to filings. Manny Ramirez, a former Dodgers
player, is the largest unsecured creditor with about $21 million
owing on a contract, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andruw Jones is owed $11.1 million and Hiroki Kuroda $4.5
million. Rafael Furcal has a claim of $3.7 million. The Chicago
White Sox team is owed $3.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCourt, a Boston real-estate developer who unsuccessfully
bid for the Boston Red Sox, bought the Dodgers from Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News Corp. (NWSA) in 2004 for $430 million. He is fighting
with his ex-wife, Jamie, over ownership of the team. A judge
last year invalidated an agreement that Frank McCourt claimed
made him the sole owner of the Dodgers, leaving the team&#8217;s
ownership in limbo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Los Angeles Dodgers LLC, 11-12010, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     June 27 (Bloomberg) -- Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF), the investment
bank that&#8217;s been expanding since the financial crisis, hired
Brian Chadwick as a managing director for U.S. rates sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chadwick, who will be based in Chicago, previously held a
similar position at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), New York-based
Jefferies said today in a statement. He also spent nine years at
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., where he was a senior vice
president in rates sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies is bulking up its fixed-income business by hiring
corporate debt traders from banks including UBS AG, Morgan
Stanley, Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG. The firm&#8217;s
compensation costs rose 12 percent to $431.9 million, or 59
percent of revenue, in its fiscal second quarter as staff
expanded 14 percent to 3,222 from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chadwick&#8217;s &#8220;experience, knowledge and strong relationships
will significantly enhance our rates capabilities across the
U.S.,&#8221; Christopher Bury and Dan Markaity, co-heads of global
rates at Jefferies, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) agreed
to sell its stake in Manhattan&#8217;s 200 Fifth Ave., the former
International Toy Center, to a real estate fund run by JPMorgan
Asset Management, two people with knowledge of the deal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund paid about $700 million for Lehman&#8217;s majority
interest, said the people, who asked not to be named because
details of the transaction are private. The building&#8217;s tenants
include Tiffany  Co., which has 260,000 square feet (24,150
square meters) of offices, and Eataly, an Italian food emporium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which filed for bankruptcy almost three years ago,
has been planning real estate sales as values for its properties
increase. Chief Executive Officer Bryan Marsal said on Dec. 30
that the firm would bring &#8220;some very high-quality assets&#8221; to
market in the first half of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, in a partnership with New York-based real
estate investor LL Holding Co., bought 200 Fifth Ave. in 2007
for $480 million, according to property records. LL, which
manages the 800,000-square-foot building, remains an owner, one
of the people with knowledge of the transaction said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported the deal earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokerage Eastdil Secured LLC represented Lehman in the
sale of its stake. Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman,
declined to comment on the deal, as did Kristen Chambers, a
spokeswoman for JPMorgan. David Levinson, chairman and CEO of
LL, didn&#8217;t return a phone message left at his office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, once the fourth-largest investment bank, listed
real estate assets of $23 billion the day before its Sept. 15,
2008, bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history. Its properties
had a market value of about $14 billion nine months later, the
New York-based company said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is
increasing its Brazil workforce by about 20 percent this year to
expand in an economy that&#8217;s growing more than twice as fast as
the company&#8217;s home market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian unit, which raised headcount to about 300
from 200 last year, plans to invest during 2011 in research,
asset management, private banking, sales, investment banking and
trading, the group&#8217;s president, Valentino D. Carlotti, said in a
video-conference interview last week from Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
headquarters in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been growing a lot in Brazil over the past couple
of years, but we still see significant opportunities to continue
to build,&#8221; said Carlotti, 45, who plans to hand leadership of
the unit to Alejandro Vollbrechthausen, 42, over the next
several months. &#8220;We have robust growth plans for every product
and division.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and international banks are competing against Brazil-
based companies such as Banco Itau BBA SA and Banco BTG Pactual
SA, which have used their stronger local contacts to squeeze out
foreign firms. Investment-banking fees in Brazil were about $1
billion to $1.5 billion last year industrywide, two dealmakers
said last month, asking not to be identified because they aren&#8217;t
authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full Service &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs only completed its strategy to become a full-
service bank in Brazil in late 2009, after two failed attempts
to buy local firms. In 1998, Goldman Sachs tried to purchase
Banco de Investimentos Garantia SA, which was acquired by Credit
Suisse Group AG. (CSGN) Seven years later it sought to purchase Banco
Pactual SA, a top investment bank later acquired by UBS AG.
Pactual was sold back to BTG Partners in 2009 and is now BTG
Pactual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse has continued to grow in Brazil, and in 2007
acquired a majority stake in Brazilian asset manager Hedging-
Griffo for 358 million Swiss francs ($427 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks are turning to emerging markets to tap
faster growth. After expanding 7.5 percent last year, the
highest growth in more than two decades, Brazil&#8217;s economy is
expected to grow 4 percent this year, according to central bank
estimates. U.S. central bankers said the economy will expand 2.7
percent to 2.9 percent this year, down from forecasts ranging
from 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convertible Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t make the top 10 in any Brazil
investment-banking categories in 2009 and 2010, excluding
international bonds, according to Bloomberg data. The firm,
which doesn&#8217;t separately disclose Brazil revenue or profits,
said its strategy in the country is to focus on more complex
products that generate higher profit margins, such as
convertible debt and receivables securitization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re going to have a hard time getting market share
from us because we have long-term, well-established
relationships and we have a big balance sheet locally,&#8221; Renato Lulia-Jacob, Banco Itau BBA International SA&#8217;s head of corporate
banking for North America, Europe and Asia, said in an interview
in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau BBA is the leading adviser of equity sales so far this
year in Brazil, and ranks fifth in mergers and acquisitions,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not planning to do plain-vanilla credit,&#8221; Daniel
Wainstein, who heads investment banking for Goldman Sachs in
Brazil, said in a joint interview with Carlotti from Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking Team &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wainstein&#8217;s team grew to 40 bankers this year after the
firm hired 10 people, including managing director Rodolfo Soares, previously head of fixed income at Banco J. Safra SA.
Soares is the head of a new division of structured credit. The
bank also hired Marcelo Bernal from HSBC Holdings Plc, where he
was responsible for bond and syndicated-loan transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zurich-based Credit Suisse has about 36 investment bankers
in the country, and Banco BTG has 49. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 300 total employees in
Brazil, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-biggest U.S. bank, has
630, including its investment bankers, and plans to almost
double that figure. Bank of America Corp. (BAC), No. 1 in the U.S.,
employs about 400 in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Goldman Sachs&#8217;s current deals in Brazil is a 300
million reais ($189 million) convertible-bond sale by Minerva
SA, Brazil&#8217;s fourth-largest meat producer. The structure allows
the company to sell debt without increasing leverage because the
securities become equity when they mature. Investors receive a
set coupon until the conversion, and then can benefit if the
shares gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private Equity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is also betting that its advisory work for
private-equity clients who want to get into Brazil will generate
investment-banking business and help boost fees from initial
public share sales and acquisitions, Wainstein, 41, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of MA transactions reached 85 billion reais so
far this year, compared with 97 billion reais in the same period
last year, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn said
earlier this month that China was the No. 1 country for new
hiring at the firm, and the top three would also include India
and Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil, Latin America&#8217;s biggest economy, is key for Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein&#8217;s strategy &#8220;to be Goldman
Sachs in more places,&#8221; said Wainstein, who along with Andre
Laport, head of equities for Latin America, became the first
Brazilian partners at Goldman Sachs last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian Shares &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Brazilian stocks underperforming comparable shares in
most other emerging markets, some medium-sized Brazilian
companies are looking instead to private-equity companies for
financing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carlyle Group, one of the world&#8217;s largest private-
equity managers, raised $1 billion to invest in South American
companies with an emphasis on Brazil, according to a June 15
statement. The leveraged-buyout firm closed a $776 million fund
that will target deals across South America with a focus on
Brazil, and a 360 million real pool raised with Banco do Brasil
SA dedicated to Brazilian deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have seen a number of private-equity firms setting up
platforms in Brazil and actively looking at opportunities,&#8221;
Wainstein said in a phone interview on June 1. &#8220;Given our
global relationships with these firms and other long-term
oriented investors, we have been close to this dynamic and we&#8217;ve
been providing them with opportunities and ideas and liaising
them with our clients in Brazil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial Share Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is currently managing two initial public offerings
of companies that are controlled by private-equity firms.
Technos SA, a watchmaker, hired Goldman Sachs as joint lead-
manager and bookrunner with Credit Suisse. Itau BBA is leading
the group. Private-equity firm DLJ South American Partners owns
39.9 percent of Technos, while local asset manager firm Dynamo
has a 32 percent stake. Switzerland-based private-equity firm
Partners Group owns about 5.6 percent of the company and
executives and other investors own the remaining stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualicorp SA, a Brazilian health-insurance broker
controlled by Carlyle, is also listing shares. Goldman Sachs and
Banco Bradesco BBI are the bookrunners, and Bank of America
Merrill Lynch is leading the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is climbing in investment-banking rankings in
Brazil, and is back among the top 10 advisers of mergers and
acquisitions and equity sales so far this year for the first
time since 2008, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefonica Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s role in the second-biggest transaction so far
this year was to advise Telefonica SA (TEF), a longtime client that
simplified its corporate structure in Brazil in a deal that
included a merger between its fixed and mobile-phone assets. The
assets involved in the restructuring were valued at nearly 9
billion reais, according to Bloomberg data. Banco Santander SA
and HSBC also worked with Telefonica. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank worked on only one of the 20 equity sales that
have been priced this year, though it has been hired by two
companies to work on offerings that are expected to be priced in
the second half and would be among the biggest this year,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter, Goldman Sachs rose to the top of
Brazil&#8217;s MA rankings. It&#8217;s in fourth place year-to-date,
compared with 20th for all of last year. Banco Santander SA is
the top-ranked bank. Goldman Sachs climbed to ninth among
underwriters of equity offerings, from 11th last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NYSE Amex&#8217;s sale of almost 53
percent of its options market to seven brokers won regulatory
approval more than 21 months after it was first announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the
joint venture that gives 52.8 percent of that options market to
brokers including units of Citadel LLC and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) in exchange for sending orders to the venue, according to a
notice dated June 24. NYSE Amex is owned by exchange operator
NYSE Euronext, which also runs another options market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will allow Amex to attract more order flow,&#8221; said
Bob Fitzsimmons, Chicago-based head of derivatives for
Investment Technology Group Inc. &#8220;Those large broker-dealers
now have an incentive to direct more order flow to Amex.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE Amex&#8217;s share of total U.S. options trading rose to
13.4 percent in May from 6.1 percent in August 2009, the month
before the joint venture was announced, according to data
compiled by Chicago-based OCC. Amex is now the fourth-largest
individual market. The OCC clears all options volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven broker-dealer owners must send a minimum number
of options contracts to the exchange for five years and three
months, according to the agreement. NYSE Amex will adjust the
brokers&#8217; share of the 52.8 percent each year based on whether
they meet targets tailored to each firm. No brokerage will own
more than 19.9 percent, the limit allowed by the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Best Owners&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our best customers are potentially our best owners,&#8221;
Steve Crutchfield, chief executive officer of NYSE Amex Options,
said in an interview. &#8220;This consolidates our relationship with
seven of the best order-providing firms in the industry and
allows us to work more closely with them to understand their
needs and the needs of their clients as we structure the
business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crutchfield said he expects to see &#8220;additional growth&#8221; in
Amex&#8217;s market share once the joint venture is completed, and
expects the deal to close in the &#8220;coming days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their collective leverage in some of the businesses in
which we operate is not to be trivialized,&#8221; NYSE Euronext (NYX) Chief
Executive Officer Duncan Niederauer said about the importance of
brokers to exchanges&#8217; trading volume at a UBS conference on May
10, according to a transcript. Increasing trading volume
requires being &#8220;a little creative in terms of organizational
construct, business model, et cetera,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citadel and Goldman Sachs will initially own 14.95 percent
each, followed by Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Citigroup Inc. (C) and TD
Ameritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD) at 5 percent each, with UBS AG (UBSN) at 4.9
percent and Barclays Plc (BARC) at 3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue From Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is the U.S. bank that
makes the most revenue from trading. Chicago-based Citadel runs
a brokerage as well as a hedge fund. Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America is the nation&#8217;s biggest bank by assets,
and Citigroup of New York is No. 3. TD Ameritrade of Omaha,
Nebraska, is the third-largest U.S. retail brokerage by client
assets. Zurich-based UBS AG (UBS) is Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, and
London-based Barclays is the U.K.&#8217;s third-largest lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based NYSE Euronext submitted its proposal, which
it has worked on with the SEC since 2009, as competition in the
options industry intensified. Nine exchanges now trade equity
options, compared with five a decade ago. CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE)
runs the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which began trading
equity derivatives in 1973 and is now the second-largest market
operator after New York-based Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ), whose two
venues had almost 29 percent of total volume last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling Stakes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bats Global Markets, Direct Edge Holdings LLC and Chi-X
Europe Ltd. have sold stakes in their markets in the past few
years to groups of brokers that could send them orders. Bats,
owned in part by Bank of America, Tradebot Systems Inc. and
Getco LLC, said in February it would buy Chi-X Europe and
operate it on the same technology platform as its current
European venue. Bats is based in Lenexa, Kansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners of Direct Edge, which is based in Jersey City,
New Jersey, include options market International Securities
Exchange, Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG), Citadel and Goldman Sachs.
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse AG, which owns ISE, said in
February it plans to buy NYSE Euronext in a deal currently
valued at $9.02 billion, according to Bloomberg data. NYSE
Euronext hasn&#8217;t said what it plans to do with ISE&#8217;s stake in
Direct Edge after the acquisition by Deutsche Boerse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vying for Business &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options exchanges are vying for business in an increasingly
competitive market that&#8217;s growing faster than equities. U.S.
options volume rose 8 percent last year to 3.9 billion
contracts, for an eighth-straight annual record, OCC said.
Average daily U.S. equities volume last year was 8.5 billion
shares, down from 9.8 billion in 2009, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE Amex will retain regulatory control over the options
market and will have the right to buy some or all of the equity
stakes of the seven brokers in 10 years. The deal with the
brokers doesn&#8217;t affect the ownership of NYSE Amex&#8217;s equities
market, although they use the same regulatory license to operate
their exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very pleased with the market share growth we&#8217;ve
seen on Amex over the last 18 months,&#8221; Crutchfield said. &#8220;We
hope it turns out to be a good investment for our partner
firms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is updating its
online corporate software offerings to include a full Internet-
based version of Office 2010 for the first time, an effort to
stave off competition from Google Inc. (GOOG) for business accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office 365 suite of programs is available today in 40
markets, Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said at an event
in New York. Software will cost small businesses $6 a user each
month for a package with programs like Office Web Apps and
Exchange e-mail software, Microsoft said. For an additional $12
a month, companies can add a full version of Office, including
Word and Excel programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is trying to keep
Google&#8217;s office-productivity software, called Apps for Business,
from making further inroads with corporate and government
clients. The two companies are fighting for customers who want
more applications hosted in the so-called cloud -- on a network
rather than a hard drive. The full online version of Office
follows last year&#8217;s release of the more basic Office Web Apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Financially, it will be a while before Office in the
cloud becomes meaningful, but it provides another delivery
mechanism for some of Microsoft&#8217;s mainstream products and brings
them on par with Google Apps,&#8221; said Sid Parakh, an analyst at
McAdams Wright Ragen in Seattle, who recommends buying Microsoft
shares. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Eric Kirsch plans to retire as global head of insurance asset
management, a position that involved overseeing $75 billion for
clients, according to a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirsch plans to leave the New York-based Goldman Sachs in
September after four years on the job, Ed Canaday, a spokesman,
said in a telephone interview. John Melvin, global head of
insurance fixed-income portfolio management, and Ellen Cooper,
global head of insurance strategy, are among executives who will
take over Kirsch&#8217;s responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs tripled insurance general account client
assets under management while Kirsch was at the firm, according
to Canaday. The bank said this month that Mark Oldcorn and
Etienne Comon will be joining its asset-management group in
London as it looks to expand services in Europe overseeing funds
for insurers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are fully committed to the insurance asset-management
business and have a strong leadership team in place,&#8221; said
Canaday. &#8220;We will continue to invest in additional resources
and infrastructure to serve this very important client
segment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirsch joined Goldman Sachs in 2007 after overseeing about
$140 billion at Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s insurance asset-management
business. His retirement was reported by Insurance Asset Manager
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, the
country&#8217;s largest lender by revenue, has signed a deal for
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) to build a platform to
deliver electronic banking services, as it aims to employ new
technology to expand its business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state-owned lender plans to increase the number of its
branches by 500, from 372 at present, over five years and to
boost account holders by 25 percent a year, from 2 million now,
the Addis Ababa-based bank said in an e-mailed statement today.
The statement was released jointly with New York-based IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s growing demand for banking services in Ethiopia,
whose annual economic growth rate of 8 percent last year was the
fifth fastest in sub-Saharan Africa, after the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Nigeria, according to
an International Monetary Fund report in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $3 million agreement aims to develop a platform,
operational by August, that will enable the bank to introduce
new mobile and Internet banking programs, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Cavallaro&#8217;s Twitter feed
usually deals with matters like the free-range egg salad she
serves at her Beehive Caf&#233; in Bristol, Rhode Island. On May 17,
2010, she blasted a different message to her followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She cited her recent trip to Washington, where she lobbied
to cut the average 44 cents that merchants must pay a bank
whenever a customer uses a debit card. &#8220;Remember I went to
DC?&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;Well believe it or not it worked! New law
will cap fees for consumers and businesses soon!!!!&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cavallaro was a recruit in the retail industry&#8217;s surprise
victorious assault on one of the most reliable income streams
for big banks, worth $16 billion a year. Her message hailed the
U.S. Senate&#8217;s decision that week to include a cap on debit-card
fees in its bill overhauling rules for Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far from ending the matter, the vote touched off one of the
most intense lobbying duels in memory as the banking industry,
Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) sought to kill or delay the debit-
card measure. It raged for more than a year, culminating on June
8 when the banks lost a cliffhanger of a vote in the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behind-the-scenes story of the swipe-fee war --
reconstructed from public and confidential documents and
interviews with more than 30 people in Congress, regulatory
agencies and industry -- shows how far the richest interest
groups can go when a single decision puts billions of dollars up
for grabs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), this year&#8217;s
top adviser on corporate takeovers, appointed Jeff Urwin to be
global head of investment banking as it seeks to coordinate
operations across regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urwin, co-head of North American investment banking since
July, will lead investment-banking coverage, capital markets and
mergers and acquisitions, wrote Jes Staley, chief executive
officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank, in an employee memo
obtained by Bloomberg News and confirmed by Tasha Pelio, a
company spokeswoman. JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. lender,
hasn&#8217;t had a global head of investment banking in years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We interact in a global marketplace at a pace and along
dimensions not possible as recently as a few years ago,&#8221;
Staley, 56, wrote in the memo. &#8220;The opportunities to serve are
enormous, as are the challenges, and it is important that
JPMorgan&#8217;s coverage model conform to this global paradigm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urwin, 55, is among the highest-ranking JPMorgan executives
to join the New York-based firm through its 2008 acquisition of
Bear Stearns Cos. Reporting to Staley, he will help run a
business that ranks No. 1 in U.S. debt underwriting and
syndicated-loan underwriting and that has advised on $269.2
billion in takeovers this year, ahead of Morgan Stanley and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s Expansion Goals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has made expanding
overseas a priority as emerging markets like Brazil grow at two
and three times the pace of developed nations like the U.S. and
U.K. Investment bank head Staley laid out ambitious plans early
last year to double the bank&#8217;s market share in Asia in
the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re adding bankers, branches, and products to serve the
multinationals where they want to be served,&#8221; Dimon, 55, told
investors June 2 at a conference held by Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co. in New York. &#8220;If we go to China or India or Indonesia or
Malaysia, it&#8217;s not just for the business there. We&#8217;re helping
Italian companies go to Indonesia. We&#8217;re helping Indonesian
companies go to America.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the memo, Staley described Urwin as a &#8220;highly
experienced&#8221; banker, manager and leader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He has played a pivotal role in building our Americas
investment-banking franchise over the past three years,&#8221; Staley
wrote. A successor for the post Urwin is vacating will be named
&#8220;shortly,&#8221; Staley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urwin was co-head of investment banking at Bear Stearns,
which he joined in 1996, and head of global emerging markets at
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in New York. He and Kevin Willsey
replaced Doug Braunstein as co-heads of investment banking for
the U.S. and Canada last year when Braunstein became chief
financial officer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, plans to cut 230 jobs in New York,
according to a filing the firm submitted to the state&#8217;s
Department of Labor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positions, which weren&#8217;t identified, will be eliminated
for economic reasons between Sept. 26 and March 31, today&#8217;s
filing shows. David Wells, a spokesman for the company in New
York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Barclays Capital and Credit
Suisse Group AG have begun cutting staff as they grapple with
reduced revenue from trading stocks and bonds. In the past four
weeks, 10 analysts have lowered second-quarter profit estimates
for Goldman Sachs. The company is scheduled to report results on
July 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs employed 35,400 people globally at the end of
March, 300 fewer than at the end of December. While the firm&#8217;s
headquarters and biggest office are in downtown Manhattan,
Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t disclose how many workers are based in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is doing most of its hiring in China, India and
Brazil, President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn told
investors on June 2. He said that the company has hired &#8220;a lot
of people&#8221; in Singapore and in Bangalore, India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York State Workers Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, known as the WARN Act, became effective on
Feb. 1, 2009. The law requires private employers with 50 or more
workers in New York state to provide 90 days&#8217; notice of a plant
closing, mass layoff, relocation, or reduction in work hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate filing yesterday, Bank of New York Mellon
Corp. (BK) notified the labor department of plans to start cutting
124 jobs in its treasury services operations lockbox. The cuts
will take place in stages beginning July 1 and continue through
March 31, the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs filing was reported earlier today by Dow
Jones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB agreed to pay
6.55 billion pesos ($555 million) in stock for the Coke bottling
operations of Grupo Tampico SA, marking the company&#8217;s first all-
share transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s largest soft-drink bottler will give closely held
Grupo Tampico 63.5 million newly issued Coca-Cola Femsa shares
valued at 103.20 pesos each, it said yesterday in a statement.
Mexico City-based Coca-Cola Femsa will also assume 2.75 million
pesos in net debt. The stock fell the most in two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction would be Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s largest since
2003 and follows a 27.7 billion-peso share merger of Mexico&#8217;s
second- and third-largest bottlers this year to form Arca
Continental SAB. Using shares instead of cash may help persuade
more small bottlers to be acquired, Chief Financial Officer
Hector Trevino said in a telephone interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a lot of bottlers in Mexico and Latin America
that don&#8217;t want to get out of the business,&#8221; Trevino said. &#8220;On
the other hand, they are small and they see the advantages of
having bigger scale and geographic diversification.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa fell 93 centavos, or 0.8 percent, to 109.01
pesos at 4 p.m. New York time in Mexico City trading, the
biggest decline since April 26. The shares have gained 6.7
percent this year, compared with a 27 percent advance for
Monterrey, Mexico-based Arca Continental. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Tampico Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Tampico expects revenue of 4.4 billion pesos and
shipments of 154 million unit cases in 2011. Coca-Cola Femsa had
2010 revenue of 103 billion pesos. Tampico-based Grupo Tampico,
in Tamaulipas state, will have earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization -- a measure of cash flow known as
Ebitda -- of 967 million pesos in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe it&#8217;s a geographical area of the country that
will have important growth and we have plans to continue growing
the business,&#8221; Trevino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition boosts Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s leading position
in the Mexican beverage market, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Salazar said today in a conference call. Trevino told analysts
the deal may close by the end of next quarter, and will require
approval from Mexican regulators as well as from the board of
Coca-Cola Co. (KO), which owns almost a third of Coca-Cola Femsa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual synergies should reach 180 million pesos to 220
million pesos from the Grupo Tampico deal in the next 24 months,
Trevino said today. He said in the interview that using cash to
pay off the bottler&#8217;s debt is an option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accretive to Earnings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition will be accretive to earnings in a year to
18 months, said Jose Castro, chief of investor relations, in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After purchasing Panamerican Beverages Inc. for $3.6
billion in 2003, Coca-Cola Femsa hadn&#8217;t struck a deal greater
than $100 million in three years. Investors such as Jose Miguel Garaicochea, who helps manage about $1 billion for a Banco
Santander SA unit in Mexico City, had said last month that the
company should consider acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the creation of new shares to pay for Grupo Tampico,
Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB&#8217;s ownership of Coca-Cola Femsa
will drop to 51.9 percent from 53.7 percent now and Coca-Cola
Co.&#8217;s ownership will decline to 30.6 percent from 31.6 percent.
The amount of shares traded publicly will increase to 17.5
percent from 14.7 percent, Trevino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners of Grupo Tampico will gain a seat on Coca-Cola
Femsa&#8217;s board, which will be expanded to 19 seats from 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Tampico became the first Coca-Cola bottler in Mexico
in 1912, according to the company website. It has 25
distribution centers in six Mexican states, including
Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosi and Veracruz. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
world&#8217;s biggest consumer-payment networks, both surged more than
9 percent after the Federal Reserve moved to cap debit-card
transaction fees at 21 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa advanced 9.1 percent, to $82.15 at 3:12 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. MasterCard rose 9.2
percent, to $303.92 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cap on swipe fees, also called interchange, was
mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. San Francisco-based Visa and
MasterCard, based in Purchase, New York, set interchange fees
that are paid by merchants and pass the money to card issuers
including Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cap, which will reduce the fees merchants pay to accept
debit cards, replaces a formula that averages 1.14 percent of
the purchase price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa had gained 7 percent this year through yesterday after
falling 20 percent in 2010, while MasterCard had gained 24
percent this year after last year&#8217;s 12 percent decline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A New York federal judge approved a
$153.6 million settlement by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) of allegations
by the Securities and Exchange Commission that the bank misled
investors in a mortgage securities transaction just as the
housing market was starting to plummet, according to court
records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t admit or deny allegations in the
complaint, and will pay a civil penalty of $133 million, plus
$18.6 million repayment of its profits and $2 million in interest,
according to papers signed by Judge Richard M. Berman in Manhattan 
court today. Of the payments, $126 million will be for investors 
who bought notes in a product called Squared CDO 2007-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order also states that JPMorgan and its employees are
barred from making money by &#8220;means of any untrue statement of a
material fact or any omission of a material fact&#8221; or engaging
in any transaction which &#8220;would operate as a fraud or deceit
upon the purchaser.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares rose as much as 93 cents, or 2.35 percent,
to $40.47 and were trading on the New York Stock Exchange at
$40.11, up 57 cents, as of 10:42 a.m. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial-company options are
attractive because the shares tend to have &#8220;unusually large&#8221;
moves around the release of monthly manufacturing data, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy August $36 puts to sell and August $37
calls to buy the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI), an
exchange-traded fund tracking 60 stocks such as Boeing Co. and
Caterpillar Inc., because of &#8220;consistently large&#8221; moves in
those companies on the day the Institute for Supply Management&#8217;s
Manufacturing Index is released, according to John Marshall and
Krag &#8220;Buzz&#8221; Gregory, New York-based strategists at Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see the potential for elevated volatility over the
next month,&#8221; the strategists said. &#8220;Industrials options prices
are likely to remain well-bid through July as investors focus on
corporate earnings results, the U.S. debt-ceiling debate and
global growth concerns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industrials ETF rose 4.6 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with a gain of 3.1 percent for the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. The benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks
retreated 4.9 percent from its 2011 high on April 29 through
yesterday as the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe threatened to
crimp growth and the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the
U.S., which measures whether reports beat forecasts, fell to a
29-month low on June 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of the ISM report, a Chicago purchasing-
managers index and Japan&#8217;s Tankan survey, as well as attempts to
resolve Greece&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis, &#8220;have the potential to
drive large moves for industrials,&#8221; the strategists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also listed 30 stocks that &#8220;make unusually
large moves on ISM releases,&#8221; including Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM),
Transocean Ltd. (RIG) and Starwood Hotels  Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT) &lt;/p&gt;


Here are the 30 companies Goldman strategists said have large
share-price moves around the ISM Manufacturing Index release,

&lt;p&gt;The proposal to merge Carrefour SA (CA)&#8217;s
Brazilian assets with retailer Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao
Grupo Pao de Acucar may save the combined company 150 million to
275 million euros ($396.4 million) a year, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco BTG Pactual SA investment fund Gama, which proposed

of 700 million euros a year. Carrefour rival Casino Guichard-
Perrachon SA called the proposal &#8220;illegal.&#8221; Casino owns 37
percent of Pao de Acucar and would gain control of the company
next year under a 2005 accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan maintains a &#8220;cautious view&#8221; on the plan because
of the &#8220;execution risk&#8221; involved, according to an e-mail to

&lt;p&gt;Dubai&#8217;s shares advanced, led by
property companies, after the United Arab Emirates government
extended the visa period for real-estate investors to three
years from six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR), developer of the world&#8217;s tallest
skyscraper, advanced 2 percent and Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC), the
U.A.E.&#8217;s biggest construction company by market value, rose a
second day this week. The DFM General Index (DFMGI) gained 0.6 percent,
the most since June 15, to 1,516.93 at the 2 p.m. close in
Dubai, trimming the loss for the month to 2.8 percent. The DFM
Real Estate Index (DFREALTY) rallied 1.5 percent and Abu Dhabi&#8217;s increased
1.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision is giving investors hope that the government
is looking closely at how to enhance the attractiveness of the
U.A.E. real-estate sector and increase the demand,&#8221; said
Mohammed Ali Yasin, chief investment officer at Abu Dhabi-based
financial services company CAPM Investments PJSC. &#8220;As investor
participation in these real-estate stocks is high, the news has
affected sentiment across the market positively.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai home prices slumped 62 percent from their peak in
mid-2008 after the global credit crisis caused mortgage lending
to dry up and speculative demand waned, Deutsche Bank AG said in
February. In neighboring Abu Dhabi, prices slid 45 percent,
Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. estimated. About 85 percent of the
U.A.E&#8217;s population are foreign nationals and require visas to
live and work in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visa extension, which intends to &#8220;enhance the
attractiveness of the real-estate sector,&#8221; comes as part of a
new strategy plan announced by the government for the years 2011
to 2013, state-run Emirates News Agency said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Boost Demand&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move &#8220;could significantly boost demand in the
residential real-estate sector, particularly in Dubai, as the
promise of a long-term residency visa was a major driver of
second-home purchases during the real-estate boom prior to
mid-2008,&#8221; Citigroup Inc. analyst Farouk Soussa said in an e-
mailed note to clients dated today. &#8220;However, the overall
impact on the property market is likely to be somewhat muted by
oversupply issues that are being exacerbated by the ongoing
completion of new properties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emaar increased the most since June 15 to 3.02 dirhams.
Arabtec gained 2.4 percent to 1.28 dirhams, the highest since
June 22. In Abu Dhabi, Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR), the emirate&#8217;s
biggest real-estate developer by market value, advanced 1.6
percent, the most since June 15, to 1.24 dirhams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADX General Index (ADSMI) fell 0.3 percent after rising as much
as 0.3 percent. Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX) increased
0.7 percent. Qatar&#8217;s QE Index (DSM) rose 0.5 percent, while Oman&#8217;s MSM
30 Index added 0.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuwait&#8217;s SE Price Index retreated 0.2 percent, while
Bahrain&#8217;s BB All Share Index tumbled 0.9 percent. The U.A.E. and
Kuwaiti stock markets will close tomorrow for an Islamic
holiday, while Saudi Arabia&#8217;s market will be closed for the
weekend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Arab Emirates&#8217; plan to
extend visas for foreign homebuyers to three years from six
months could lift demand in Dubai&#8217;s slumping property market,
Citigroup Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.A.E.&#8217;s federal government yesterday agreed to
lengthen the period to &#8220;enhance the attractiveness of the real
estate sector,&#8221; the state-run Emirates News Agency said. The
period was shortened to six months from five years in May 2009,
sparking criticism from homebuyers and investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This could significantly boost demand in the residential
real estate sector, particularly in Dubai,&#8221; Citigroup analyst
Farouk Soussa said in a note to investors today. &#8220;The overall
impact on the property market is likely to be somewhat muted by
oversupply issues that are being exacerbated by the ongoing
completion of new properties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai home prices have dropped 64 percent from their peak
in mid-2008 after the global credit crisis caused mortgage
lending to dry up and speculative demand waned, Deutsche Bank AG
said in June. In Abu Dhabi, prices slid 55 percent, investment
bank Rasmala estimates. Investors from across the Middle East,
sub-continent and United Kingdom purchased homes in Dubai from
2002 as property ownership qualified them for a five-year
residency visa that was easily renewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government dampened housing demand in 2009,  when it
shortened the visa duration, set a minimum property price of 1
million dirhams ($272,264) and required holders to leave the
country and return for renewals, Citigroup said. The U.A.E. also
charged 2,000 dirhams for each new visa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Key Attraction&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The limitation on visas for home buyers in 2009 removed
one of the key attractions for foreign, and especially regional,
investors in the Dubai real estate market,&#8221; Dubai-based Soussa
wrote today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government didn&#8217;t say whether the other visa
requirements imposed in 2009 would be changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dubai Financial Market Real Estate Index, a measure
that includes the shares of five developers, rose 1.5 percent
today, its highest close since June 23. Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR),
developer of the world&#8217;s tallest tower in Dubai, climbed 2
percent to 3.02 dirhams. Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC), the country&#8217;s
biggest construction firm, added 2.4 percent to 1.28 dirhams.
The shares had their biggest gain in a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai&#8217;s home prices are expected to decline further as
54,000 homes, or about 15 percent to 20 percent of the existing
supply, comes onto the market from 2011 to 2015, Jones Lang
LaSalle Inc. estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Recovery Yet &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is premature to speak of a recovery in the property
sector driven by visa extensions, as the net impact is likely to
be more one of reducing the negative repercussions of
oversupply,&#8221; Soussa wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the changes to boost demand, the government needs to
make it clear that the extensions won&#8217;t be changed again soon,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move &#8220;will significantly enhance investor confidence
and drive the growth of the country&#8217;s property sector,&#8221; Emaar
Chairman Mohammed Alabbar said in a statement. Emaar is the
country&#8217;s largest developer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 85 percent of the U.A.E.&#8217;s population are foreign
nationals and require visas to live and work in the country. The
government&#8217;s 2002 decision to allow foreigners to own property
in certain areas helped make Dubai the world&#8217;s fastest-growing
real estate market until the financial crisis caused it to
collapse in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) plans to
increase the number of private bankers in Asia by about 70
percent by the end of 2012 to tap rising wealth in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-biggest U.S. bank by assets is hiring 100
advisers to wealthy Asians this year and next, adding to the 140
employed at the end of 2010, Andrew Cohen, the Hong Kong-based
chief executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s private banking for ultra-
high net worth individuals in Asia, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. These include bankers, global investment
specialists, wealth advisers and capital advisers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, joins competitors in expanding
offices in the region to win a share of the growing number of
rich Asians. Wealth in Asia, excluding Japan, is expected to
rise at about double the global rate of almost 6 percent through
the next five years, the Boston Consulting Group said in a May
31 report. Millionaires in Asia outnumbered those in Europe for
the first time in 2010, according to a report by Capgemini SA
and Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Getting the right talent, training them and retaining
them are the biggest challenges in Asia,&#8221; said Cohen, who has
been heading the Asian business since June 2010. JPMorgan is
hiring private bankers, as well as people from corporate banking,
hedge funds, private equity and consulting firms with a focus on
banking, he said. The bank is also hiring from outside Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wealth of 3.3 million high-net-worth individuals in the
Asia-Pacific region climbed 12.1 percent last year to $10.8
trillion, exceeding the $10.2 trillion accumulated by 3.1
million people in Europe, according to the Capgemini/Merrill
Lynch World Wealth Report released on June 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohen said he&#8217;s committed to the goal given last year of
tripling the size of the Asian business in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forecast is for JPMorgan&#8217;s entire private banking
business, including the private wealth management unit, which
caters to individuals with investable assets of $10 million to
$30 million, and the private bank for ultra-high net worth
individuals with assets exceeding $30 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohen didn&#8217;t disclose the size of the private banking arm&#8217;s
assets in the region. Globally, JPMorgan&#8217;s private banking
operations manage a total of $750 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endemol NV investors, including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), are facing losses of more than 60
percent as the Dutch producer of the &#8220;Big Brother&#8221; television 
show reorganizes 2.8 billion euros ($4.1 billion) of debt amid 
the Greek crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endemol&#8217;s enterprise value has fallen to no more than 1.2
billion euros from 3.1 billion euros four years ago, with its
equity and junior debt becoming worthless, said two people with
knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified because
talks with creditors are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders such as Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi&#8217;s Mediaset SpA (MS) and Goldman Sachs are in negotiations
with lenders complicated by last week&#8217;s departure of Chief
Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz amid disagreements over Amsterdam-
based Endemol&#8217;s strategy. Concerns that Greece will default on
its debt and the slowing economic recovery have pushed up
funding costs as investors shun risky assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is already discounting the breach of the
covenants,&#8221; said Saverio Papagno, an analyst at AZ Fund
Management in Luxembourg. &#8220;All the options on the table right
now, including a debt-for-equity swap.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endemol, the world&#8217;s largest independent TV producer, said
in its 2010 annual report that widening losses would cause the
company to breach its loan covenants. Marco Giordani, Mediaset&#8217;s
chief financial officer, said yesterday that the results of a
test on the latest debt ratios would be available in 45 days.
Los Angeles-based investment bank Houlihan Lokey is advising
Endemol on the reorganization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase 
Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc. were catapulted to top equity
underwriters in France this year, the first time they&#8217;ve headed
the list in at least 12 years, thanks to one deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year&#8217;s largest stock transaction in France, the
three banks helped sell about 1.15 billion euros ($1.66 billion)
of Legrand SA shares for private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts  Co. and Paris-based Wendel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlook for stock sales is gloomy as investors are
spooked by the Greek debt crisis and a rash of French sales
completed in 2009 leaves few deals ready to be brought to the
market. Two French initial public offerings were canceled this
year by companies citing poor market conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are sitting on their hands and don&#8217;t really
want to get involved in the market right now,&#8221; said Sylvie Sauton, head of equity capital markets for France at JPMorgan in
London. &#8220;A lot of IPOs haven&#8217;t performed well so investors have
found it difficult to make money on the deals. It&#8217;s better for
companies to wait and come back at a later stage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank was No. 10 in the French market in first half
of last year, while Nomura and JPMorgan didn&#8217;t rank among the
top 18. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which was the top underwriter
of French equities in the first half in 2010, tumbled to the No.
11 spot, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs
is still No. 1 for global and European equity sales this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilting Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies raised 2.84 billion euros in share sales, equity-
linked issues and rights offerings in France in the first six
months, according to Bloomberg data. That compares with 24.8
billion euros in the first half of 2001 and 11.85 billion euros
in the first half of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s not a large enough number of candidates in France
mature enough to do IPOs now,&#8221; said Valery Barrier, Paris-based
managing director responsible for equity capital markets in
France for Deutsche Bank. &#8220;Candidates are few and the market is
volatile. IPO activity in France is nonexistent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German market has fared better. The number of IPOs that
were priced in Germany in the first half rose to 11 from five in
the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 7.2 percent from its high
for this year on Feb. 17 as Japan&#8217;s earthquake caused the
biggest nuclear accident since Chernobyl, U.S. economic data
trailed forecasts and concern deepened that Greece may default
on its debt. The index has fallen for the past eight weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canceled IPOs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg European IPO Index, which measures the
performance of stocks during their first publicly traded year,
has declined more than 30 percent in 2011 as Pandora A/S, a
Danish jewelry maker, slid more than 50 percent and Flybe Group
Plc (FLYB), the U.K.&#8217;s biggest domestic airline, fell 42 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 16 equity and equity-linked issues in France in
the first half, down from 25 in the same period last year. The
number of announced IPOs in France doubled in the first half to
14 over the same period last year, Bloomberg data show. The
number of priced deals, however, fell to six. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Cie. de Saint-Gobain pulled its $1.1 billion
IPO of its packaging unit Verallia and Lagardere SCA (MMB) in March
delayed the offering of its Canal Plus France stake. JPMorgan
had been a bookrunner on both deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saint Gobain, Europe&#8217;s biggest supplier of building
materials, pulled its offering on June 20 because of market
conditions. The move came five days after Verallia&#8217;s competitor
Owens-Illinois Inc. cut its forecast for profit margins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Distortion&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lagardere, France&#8217;s largest publisher, postponed the sale
of Canal Plus France shares in March. A month earlier, people
with knowledge of the matter said the company may raise more
than 1.35 billion euros from the IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Legrand deal, Nomura, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan
sold shares through accelerated book building to institutional
investors. The block trade gave each bank about 14 percent share
of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t one single big transaction last year, so
there wasn&#8217;t the same distortion,&#8221; said Alasdair Warren,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s London-based head of ECM for Europe, the Middle
East and Africa. &#8220;Most people look at the French and Benelux
markets together, and Goldman was involved in two of the three
largest deals this year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the global coordinator on a 490 million-
euro rights offer by Belgium&#8217;s Nyrstar and the main adviser on
the 2.1 billion-euro spinoff of Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal&#8217;s
Aperam stainless-steel unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale (GLE) SA had the next biggest piece of the pie
in France after Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Nomura, with a
market share of 10 percent and five equity and equity-linked
transactions. The Paris-based bank was ranked second at the end
of the first half last year and finished the year in the first
position with 17 percent of the market and 15 issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our objective is to remain in our top spot position,&#8221;
said Laurent Morel, global head of ECM at Societe Generale
Corporate  Investment Banking in Paris. &#8220;The competition is
intense, but I&#8217;m confident. We have a team dedicated to small
and mid-cap deals in France, which helps us to keep a high level
of activity in this domestic market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top 17 underwriters for French sales have handled six
equity-linked deals, seven offerings of additional shares and
three IPOs so far this year, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlook for this year&#8217;s market will depend on the
outcome of Greece&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis, the bankers said. The
Greek government is trying to push through austerity measures
that are critical to ensure the cash-strapped nation can tap
loan payments from last year&#8217;s 110 billion-euro rescue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Things will be very quiet until September,&#8221; said Jerome Renard, managing director and co-head of the European equity
capital markets team at Nomura in London. &#8220;The rest of the year
will depend on the evolution of the macro environment and news
flow over the summer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S.
wireless provider, will probably say sales of Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s
iPhone dropped when it reports second-quarter results, a Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) analyst said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IPhone sales will likely be a touch below the 2.2
million&#8221; Verizon sold in the first quarter, said Jason Armstrong in a research note. Verizon began sales of the
smartphone Feb. 3, more than a month into the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armstrong said he met yesterday with investor relations
executives from Verizon Communications Inc., which co-owns
Verizon Wireless with Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD) Brenda Raney, a
spokeswoman for Basking Ridge, New-Jersey based Verizon
Wireless, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. (T), based in Dallas, had held an almost four-year
exclusivity on the Apple handset in the U.S. The iPhone is
Apple&#8217;s best-selling device, accounting for half of revenue in
the Cupertino, California-based company&#8217;s fiscal second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of Verizon&#8217;s other smartphones, which include the HTC
Corp. ThunderBolt that works on Verizon&#8217;s faster fourth-
generation network, were above the carrier&#8217;s expectations,
Armstrong said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon, like ATT, sells the iPhone 4 for $199.99 or
$299.99 with a two-year contract. ATT also offers an older
variety, the 3GS, for $49 with a contract. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are among financial firms cutting more than
1,300 workers in an effort to trim expenses and match revenue as
equity and bond trading slows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the biggest U.S. bank, cut about 60
positions in its equity-sales and trading division this month,
said two people with knowledge of the decision. Goldman Sachs,
the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, plans to eliminate 230
jobs in New York starting in September, according to a filing
the firm submitted to the state&#8217;s Department of Labor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms join Barclays Plc (BARC) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN),
which are cutting investment-banking workers as they grapple
with reduced revenue from buying and selling securities. Fixed-
income trading revenue at U.S. banks probably dropped 30 percent
in the second quarter from the previous three-month period,
while equities trading fell 15 percent, Keith Horowitz, a
Citigroup Inc. analyst, wrote in a report last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From a sales and trading perspective, the results will be
ahead of last year&#8217;s second quarter, but below the seasonally
strong first quarter,&#8221; Bruce Thompson, Bank of America&#8217;s
finance chief, said yesterday in a conference call with
analysts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank, appointed Sjoerd Leenart senior country
officer for the Middle East and North Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leenart will be based in Dubai and report to Emilio Saracho, head of investment banking for Europe, the Middle East
and Africa, New York-based JPMorgan said today in a statement.
The bank also hired Emre Derman as senior country officer for
Turkey. He will also report to Saracho. Senior country officers
manage the lender&#8217;s regional presence, including investment
banking and asset management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These appointments represent our continued commitment to
the region,&#8221; Saracho said in the statement. &#8220;We have made no
secret about our expansion plans and we are confident that
Sjoerd and Emre will continue to grow and maximize opportunities
in those markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leenart has worked at JPMorgan for 17 years and was co-head
of debt capital markets and sales and marketing for Central and
Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America,
according to the statement. Derman joins the bank following a
legal career advising on corporate transactions in the Turkish
market. He was a senior associate and partner at White  Case
LLP in Istanbul and London for 18 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leenart and Derman succeed Murad Megalli, the former head
of the region who was killed in a plane crash this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) filed
a court petition seeking approval of an $8.5 billion settlement
with Bank of America Corp. over residential mortgage-
securitization trusts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon made the filing yesterday in New York State
Supreme Court in Manhattan as trustee of 530 residential
mortgage-securitization trusts established from 2004 to 2008.
Investors claimed that Countrywide Home Loans Inc. and other
sellers breached agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement requires Bank of America, the parent of
Countrywide, or Countrywide, or both, to pay $8.5 billion into
the trusts, with amounts based on past and expected future
losses associated with the loans in each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This settlement resolves a significant portion of the
Countrywide private label securitization exposure and it allows
us to put this matter behind us and focus on running our
business,&#8221; Jerome Dubrowski, a spokesman for Bank of America,
said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Barbara R. Kapnick of New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan yesterday set a hearing on the settlement for Nov.
17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon is to give notice of the accord to
investors in the mortgage-backed securities, mortgage companies
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, ratings companies, bond insurers
including Ambac Assurance Corp. and MBIA Insurance Corp., and
underwriters including Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While individual agreements govern each securitization, all
contain representations that the mortgage loans conform to
underwriting guidelines and conform to their descriptions in
investor disclosure documents, the petition says. The loan
documents also include servicing obligations, it says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A substantial dispute has arisen concerning the sellers&#8217;
alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the
governing agreements, and the master servicer&#8217;s alleged
violations of prudent servicing obligations,&#8221; the petition
says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional investors, whose current holdings are in the
tens of billions of dollars, according to the filing, include
Blackrock Financial Management Inc., Pacific Investment
Management Company LLC, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.,
Goldman Sachs Asset Management LP, Trust Co. of the West, and
Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the matter of the application of The Bank of
New York Mellon, 651786/2011, New York state Supreme Court, New
York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, Lehman Europe Settle Over $2.5 Billion in Assets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) and Lehman Brothers International Europe
reached a settlement over assets valued at more than $2.5
billion that were held for the collapsed investment bank by
Citigroup in a number of countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup agreed to immediately begin transferring assets
held in custody for LBIE, which it kept while determining how it
was affected by Lehman&#8217;s collapse, PricewaterhouseCoopers,
Lehman&#8217;s U.K. administrator, said in a statement. Both parties
will drop all claims against each other, PwC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is by far the largest single deal we have undertaken
and easily the most complex to negotiate and then structure,
given the sheer scale of the legacy relationship between
Citigroup and LBIE,&#8221; Paul Copley, a PwC restructuring partner
who led the negotiations, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going into administration, LBIE and New York-based
Citigroup entered into &#8220;a large volume&#8221; of agreements related
to over-the-counter derivatives, stock lending, repurchase
transactions, prime brokerage and trading arrangements, both on
behalf of the banks and for third parties, LBIE said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LBIE&#8217;s former parent company, Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ), collapsed in September 2008, filing the largest bankruptcy
in U.S. history. London-based LBIE is in administration in the
U.K. Citigroup and LBIE have &#8220;taken steps&#8221; to return assets to
clients that were held by Citigroup during the administration,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have worked closely with the administrators of LBIE
and their team for many months to ensure that the arrangements
between Citigroup and LBIE were resolved amicably and in a
manner which fairly reflected the interests of both parties,&#8221;
Citigroup spokesman Jeffrey French said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings said in a court filing in New York
yesterday that it reached a deal with bondholders, led by hedge
fund Paulson  Co., and derivatives creditors including Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley on a $65 billion liquidation
plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s $153.6 Million SEC Settlement Approved by Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York federal judge approved a $153.6 million
settlement by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) of allegations by the
Securities and Exchange Commission that the bank misled
investors in a mortgage securities transaction just as the
housing market was starting to plummet, according to court
records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t admit or deny allegations in the
complaint, and will pay a civil penalty of $133 million, plus
$18.6 million repayment of its profits and $2 million in
interest, according to papers signed by Judge Richard M. Berman
in Manhattan court yesterday. Of the payments, $126 million will
be for investors who bought notes in a product called Squared
CDO 2007-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order also states that JPMorgan and its employees are
barred from making money by &#8220;means of any untrue statement of a
material fact or any omission of a material fact&#8221; or engaging
in any transaction which &#8220;would operate as a fraud or deceit
upon the purchaser.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
v. JPMorgan Securities LLC; 11-cv-04206; Southern District of
New York (Foley Square). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raymond James to Pay $300 Million in Auction-Rate Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF) will pay $300 million to
clients who bought auction-rate securities, moving to resolve
regulators&#8217; claims that the firm misled investors about risk
before the market froze three years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raymond James agreed to repurchase securities from
customers whose holdings have been unavailable since the $330
billion market collapsed in February 2008, the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission and the North American Securities
Administrators Association said yesterday in separate releases.
The firm will also reimburse interest costs for some clients who
took loans from the firm, the regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Raymond James improperly marketed and sold ARS to
customers as safe and highly liquid alternatives to money market
accounts and other short-term investments,&#8221; Eric Bustillo,
director of the SEC&#8217;s regional office in Miami, said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal and state regulators have sanctioned banks
including Citigroup Inc., UBS AG, Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and
Deutsche Bank AG for selling them as safe, cash-like investments
before credit markets froze. Auction-rate securities are
typically municipal bonds, corporate bonds and preferred stocks
whose rates of return are reset periodically through auctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am pleased we are able to resolve this issue and
provide liquidity to clients who continue to hold ARS in their
portfolios,&#8221; Raymond James Chief Executive Officer Paul Reilly
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Credit Suisse Broker Butler in Plea Talks, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) broker Eric Butler, convicted
in 2009 of fraudulently selling subprime securities to corporate
clients that cost investors more than $1.1 billion in losses, is
in plea talks to resolve pending charges, a prosecutor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re in discussion, plea negotiations, to resolve these
matters,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Spector told U.S.
District Judge Paul G. Gardephe yesterday in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court this month threw out Butler&#8217;s
securities-fraud conviction at a federal trial in Brooklyn,
saying the court was the wrong venue for the charge. At the same
time, the appeals court upheld convictions for conspiracy to
commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler still faces wire-fraud counts in federal court in
New York. Spector said yesterday the charges were refiled in
Manhattan, in the Southern District of New York, after Butler&#8217;s
lawyers challenged the charges on grounds of venue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn is in the Eastern District of New York. Butler
worked in the Zurich-based Credit Suisse&#8217;s office in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We gave the defendant an opportunity to resolve all of
these charges in one forum in the Eastern District,&#8221; Spector
said. &#8220;They chose to force the case to be brought here. They
made that choice, and it should be resolved here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler&#8217;s lawyer, Steven F. Molo, argued that the wire-fraud
charges stemmed from the same conduct for which Butler had been
convicted in Brooklyn and shouldn&#8217;t have to face retrial in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not only are the government sore losers, they&#8217;re sore
winners,&#8221; Molo said. &#8220;They brought these counts in the Eastern
District for the same scheme. I find this to be frankly an
extraordinary waste of the Department of Justice&#8217;s time and
money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardephe agreed to adjourn the case until July 25 to allow
both sides to file papers to support their position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molo and Spector declined to comment on the plea
negotiations after the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler and his co-defendant Julian Tzolov were charged with
conducting what prosecutors said was an illegal scheme in which
they falsely told clients their products were backed by
federally guaranteed student loans and were a safe alternative
to bank deposits or money-market funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Butler, 1:09-cr-00685, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bid to Block Debit Card Swipe Cap Denied By Appeals Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCF Financial Corp. (TCB) failed to persuade a U.S. appeals court
to block a federal regulation capping the fees the biggest U.S.
banks can get from retailers for processing debit-card
transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The St. Louis-based U.S. Court of Appeals yesterday, in a
unanimous nine-page ruling, upheld an April decision by U.S.
District Judge Lawrence L. Piersol that the lender hadn&#8217;t shown
it was likely to prevail on its claims the cap is
unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swipe-fee cap, to be set by the Federal Reserve,
applies to all U.S. banks with at least $10 billion in assets.
The measure, sponsored by U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, an
Illinois Democrat, was as an addition to last year&#8217;s Dodd-Frank
financial overhaul legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No legal prohibition exists against TCF fully recouping
the costs of its debit-card services by assessing customer
fees,&#8221; the three-judge appeals court panel said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swipe fees, or interchange, are set by Visa Inc. (V) and
MasterCard Inc. (MA), the biggest electronic-payment networks, which
collect the money and remit it to card-issuing member banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a June 21 letter to Piersol, attorneys for the
government told the court that the Federal Reserve, at a meeting
that day, would &#8220;consider and vote&#8221; on the final regulation,
which hasn&#8217;t yet been set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCF National Bank, a Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based unit
of TCF Financial, filed the lawsuit last year, naming as lead
defendant U.S. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and including Vice
Chairman Janet Yellen, four Fed governors and Acting Comptroller
of the Currency John Walsh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower-court case is TCF National Bank v. Bernanke, 10-
cv-04149, U.S. District Court, District of South Dakota (Sioux
Falls). The appeal is TCF National Bank v. Bernanke, 11-1805,

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southern Union Investors Sue to Block Energy Transfer Buyout &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southern Union Co. (SUG), a natural-gas pipeline operator that is
the target of buyout offers, was sued by investors who contend
they aren&#8217;t getting enough for their shares in a $4.2 billion
bid by Energy Transfer Equity LP. (ETE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives of Houston-based Southern Union didn&#8217;t properly
shop around for higher bids for the energy company and
structured the Energy Transfer deal in a way to discourage other
offers, officials of KBC Asset Management NV, a Southern Union
investor, said in suit filed in Delaware yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company&#8217;s public shareholders will not receive
adequate or fair value for their Southern Union common stock,&#8221;
under Energy Transfer&#8217;s bid, lawyers for the fund said in the
Delaware Chancery Court suit. Investors would get partnership
units worth $33 each under the offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit comes almost a week after Tulsa, Oklahoma-based
Williams Cos., another natural-gas provider, made an unsolicited
$4.86 billion all-cash bid for Southern Union. The offer values
Southern Union at $39 a share. That&#8217;s $6 a share, or about $750
million, more than the June 16 sale price announced by Southern
Union and Energy Transfer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy Transfer&#8217;s officials said June 28 that Southern
Union directors are violating the buyout agreement by discussing
the bid with Williams&#8217;s executives. Southern Union said they
aren&#8217;t breaching the contract with the talks, according to a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Barnett, a Southern Union spokesman, didn&#8217;t return
calls for comment yesterday on the shareholder suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KBC suit is KBC Asset Management NV v. Southern Union
Co., 6622, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington.) The Septa suit
is Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority v.
Southern Union Co., 6615, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Lehman Managing Director Faces Prescription Forgery Charge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradley H. Jack, a former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
managing director, was arrested in Connecticut by police who
charged him with attempting to pass a fake prescription for
Oxycontin and Ritalin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack, 52, is accused of using a forged prescription at a
Fairfield CVS pharmacy June 24 for 12 pills of the painkiller
Oxycontin and nine pills of Ritalin, a drug used to treat
attention deficit disorder, said Lt. James Perez of the
Fairfield Police Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A store employee followed the suspect outside the pharmacy,
watched him get into a black Range Rover and drive away, Perez
said June 28 in a telephone interview. The employee reported the
license plate number of the vehicle to police, who traced it to
two residences -- one on Sasco Hill Road in Fairfield and the
other on North Avenue in Westport, according to Perez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack joined New York-based Lehman in 1984 and ran
investment banking from 1996 to 2002, when he became co-chief
operating officer with Joseph Gregory. In 2004, he was named to
the office of the chairman with the responsibility of overseeing
all of the firm&#8217;s investment banking relationships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He decided to retire from New York-based Lehman to pursue
work in the nonprofit sector and spend time with his family,
said Richard Fuld, Lehman&#8217;s former chief executive officer, in
June 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradley Jack, when approached at his Westport property,
said he hasn&#8217;t &#8220;been in business in five years&#8221; and that
stories about his arrest have &#8220;some misunderstanding.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t comment on anything about that,&#8221; Jack said when
asked about the arrest. &#8220;It&#8217;s my personal life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack referred questions to a Norwalk, Connecticut attorney,
William A. Pelletreau, who didn&#8217;t return messages left at his
office after business hours. Robert Satti, a state&#8217;s attorney in
Bridgeport, declined to comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Opposes HP Bid to Seal Court Records in Contract Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. (ORCL) asked a judge to reject an attempt by Hewlett-
Packard Co. to seal court filings in the computer company&#8217;s
breach-of-contract lawsuit against the software maker&#8217;s decision
to end support for a product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Redwood City, California-based Oracle contend
officials of Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard
overreached when they sought to have filings sealed in a suit
over Oracle&#8217;s announcement that it would no longer support its
database software on Hewlett-Packard computer servers that use
the Itanium chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oracle asks the court to make clear now that this
litigation will take place in the sunshine,&#8221; the company&#8217;s
attorneys said in a filing yesterday in state court in San Jose,
California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard sued Oracle earlier this month claiming the
software maker went from partner to &#8220;bitter antagonist&#8221; by
breaching agreements with the biggest personal computer maker.
The suit cited Oracle&#8217;s hiring of Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s former Chief
Executive Officer Mark Hurd as one of the acts that soured the
companies&#8217; relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer maker&#8217;s executives also alleged Oracle
officials used &#8220;strong-arm tactics&#8221; to force customers to
&#8220;shift from HP&#8217;s Itanium server hardware to Oracle&#8217;s own server
hardware.&#8221; Oracle said in March it would no longer support its
database software on Hewlett-Packard computer servers that use
the Itanium chip, made by Intel Corp. (INTC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard has asked a California judge to seal
filings in its suit because they reveal confidential
information, including details of a settlement of litigation
over Hurd&#8217;s defection, Oracle&#8217;s lawyers said in yesterday&#8217;s
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurd left Hewlett-Packard in August after a company probe
determined he violated its standards of business conduct in
connection with a woman who served as one of the company&#8217;s
contractors. The panel didn&#8217;t find Hurd had violated the
company&#8217;s sexual-harassment policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle&#8217;s lawyers noted in yesterday&#8217;s filing that the
settlement of litigation over Hurd&#8217;s hiring already has been
made public and there&#8217;s no basis for sealing filings detailing
it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) v. Oracle Corp.,
111CV203163, California Superior Court, Santa Clara County. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massey Faked Reports Ahead of 2010 Fatal Mine Blast, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massey Energy Co. (MEE) managers pressured coal miners to
fabricate safety reports to mislead inspectors before the 2010
West Virginia mine explosion that killed 29 people, federal
investigators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Stricklin, the assistant administrator of coal at the
U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, said his agency&#8217;s
investigation of the April 2010 blast found duplicate books on
daily mine operations. On several occasions in the months before
the blast, the books didn&#8217;t match, he said. One set told
inspectors there were no serious issues while internal reports
revealed many hazards, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Managers were aware that chronic hazardous conditions
were not recorded,&#8221; Stricklin said at a briefing for families
of victims who died in the explosion, which was the worst U.S.
mining disaster in 40 years. &#8220;Management pressured examiners to
not record hazards in the books.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massey agreed in January to be acquired by Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. (ANR) for $7.1 billion. Ted Pile, an Alpha spokesman,
said the company would look at the agency&#8217;s conclusion as part
of a separate probe of the fatal blast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We heard this information for the first time from MSHA at
the same time everyone else did,&#8221; Pile said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stricklin said Massey managers had to countersign books at
the Upper Big Branch mine and knew that the hazards, from low
air flow to high levels of explosive gas, went unreported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A West Virginia investigator said in a report last month
that Massey is to blame for the fatal explosion at the mine. An
investigation by Massey concluded that the explosion was beyond
its control, and was a naturally occurring event caused by an
inundation of natural gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSHA plans to complete its own investigation this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This explosion could and should have been prevented by
the mine operator,&#8221; Stricklin said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama Health-Care Overhaul to Be Appealed to Supreme Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. appeals court upheld President Barack Obama&#8217;s
health-care reform act, setting the stage for a request that the
Supreme Court review claims that the law violates the
Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cincinnati-based Court of Appeals voted 2-1 yesterday
to reject a challenge to the legislation by the Ann Arbor,
Michigan-based Thomas More Law Center, a Christian-based public
interest law firm, which contended Congress exceeded its power
in imposing the individual mandate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not every intrusive law is an unconstitutionally
intrusive law,&#8221; Jeffrey Sutton, the first Republican-appointed
judge to back the law in litigation across the country, said in
his opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s federal appeals court ruling was the first to
address the constitutionality of Obama&#8217;s signature legislative
accomplishment. Robert Muise, who argued the case for the Thomas
More center in Cincinnati, said by phone that his group will ask
the high court to take the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case ultimately needs to be decided by the U.S.
Supreme Court,&#8221; Muise said, adding that his organization will
file its petition for review as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other appeals courts have heard arguments on challenges
to the health-care overhaul and the high court may wait for
their rulings before getting involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sutton, an appointee of Republican President George W.
Bush, joined Judge Boyce Martin, named to the bench by President
Jimmy Carter, in the majority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sutton is a former law clerk to Antonin Scalia, the
conservative U.S. Supreme Court justice who wrote this month&#8217;s
opinion rejecting a nationwide gender-bias suit against Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. Scalia once called Sutton &#8220;one of the very best law
clerks I ever had.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a lawyer, Sutton persuaded the high court to limit
Congress&#8217;s power by shielding states from suits under federal
age-bias and disabilities laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into
law by Obama in March 2010, is intended to create the first
near-universal U.S. health-care coverage program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statute bars insurers from rejecting coverage for
people who are already sick, and from imposing limits on
lifetime costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also requires almost every American resident to have
health insurance starting in 2014 or to pay a tax penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opponents of the act, including the Thomas More center&#8217;s
Muise, have argued the mandate exceeds the regulatory powers
given to Congress under the U.S. Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cincinnati case is Thomas More Law Center v. Obama,
10-2388, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
(Cincinnati). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Claimant Ceglia&#8217;s Lawyer Exodus Prompts Delay Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. claimant Paul Ceglia asked a U.S. court to
delay his lawsuit claiming half the holdings of the company&#8217;s
co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, as Ceglia seeks to reconstruct his
legal team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Ceglia&#8217;s lawyers, from the firms DLA Piper LLP and
Lippes Mathias Wexler Friedman LLP, filed papers June 28 in
federal court in Buffalo, New York, saying they were quitting
less than three months after joining the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the eve of a hearing requested by Facebook, which claims
the case is a &#8220;fraud on the court,&#8221; Ceglia asked the judge
yesterday for a three-week postponement. He said he wants to
allow a new lawyer, Jeffrey A. Lake of San Diego, to become
familiar with the case and to permit Ceglia to hire new lead
counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been very impressed with the all firms we have
interviewed,&#8221; said Paul Argentieri, of Hornell, New York,
Ceglia&#8217;s original attorney. &#8220;The directive from our client was
clear: find a firm with the resources, experience, and legal
horsepower to handle a case of this magnitude. But above all,
find someone who will not be intimidated by the defendant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DLA Piper, which has 4,200 lawyers in 30 countries, is one
of the biggest law firms in the world. The Lippes Mathias
lawyers representing Ceglia included former New York Attorney
General Dennis Vacco. DLA Piper and Vacco declined to say why
they were withdrawing from the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceglia claims he and Zuckerberg signed a contract in 2003
that made them equal partners when Zuckerberg launched Facebook
the following year. Facebook, based in Palo Alto, California, is
valued at as much as $71 billion, according to Sharespost.com,
an online marketplace for investments in companies that aren&#8217;t
publicly traded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook and Zuckerberg claim the contract is a fake and
have called Ceglia a con man in court papers. Facebook has asked
a Buffalo judge to issue an order seizing Ceglia&#8217;s computers and
requiring him to turn over an original contract and e-mails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ceglia v. Zuckerberg, 1:10-cv-00569, U.S.
District Court, Western District of New York (Buffalo). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. escalated
its legal dispute with Apple Inc. (AAPL) over smartphone patents,
filing a trade complaint that seeks to block U.S. imports of the
iPhone, iPod and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung, the world&#8217;s second-largest maker of mobile phones
whose Galaxy devices compete with the iPhone and iPad, claims
Apple is infringing five patents, according to a filing with the
U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington June 28. The
ITC, which can block imports of products found to violate U.S.
patents, must decide if it will investigate Samsung&#8217;s claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case by Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung adds to
lawsuits in at least four countries as the companies vie for
share of the mobile-device market and use the courts to try and
gain access to samples of products the other has in development.
The dispute began in April when Cupertino, California-based
Apple claimed in a U.S. lawsuit that Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy phone and
tablet computers &#8220;slavishly&#8221; copy the iPhone and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung, which also supplies memory chips for Apple,
retaliated with lawsuits in Seoul, Tokyo, San Francisco and
Mannheim, Germany. Apple also has a civil suit pending against
Samsung in South Korea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents in the ITC case are related to ways to transmit
multiple services over a wireless network; the format of data
packets used for high-speed data transmission; integrating Web
browsing into a phone; a way to store and play digital audio;
and viewing digital documents using a touch-sensitive display,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Each of the asserted patents is important to Samsung&#8217;s
success in the highly competitive industry of mobile electronic
devices by providing Samsung with features that are highly
desirable to consumers,&#8221; the company said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A representative for Apple wasn&#8217;t immediately available to
comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the ITC takes the case, a judge would hear arguments
within a year and the case would be completed within 15 to 18
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung, which has U.S. headquarters in Richardson, Texas,
and a research facility in San Jose, California, said it
&#8220;invests in U.S.-based personnel who provide product design,
research and development, and engineering to help design a
product that will work in the U.S. market.&#8221; The Apple devices,
it said, are made in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Mobile Electronic Devices,
including Wireless Communication Devices, Portable Music and
Data Processing Devices, and Tablet Computer, Complaint No.
2824, U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novozymes Wins Enzyme Patent Case Against Danisco in Dutch Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novozymes A/S won an injunction against DuPont Co. unit
Danisco A/S in a Dutch court in a patent infringement case
covering the use of a salt-coated enzyme granule for steam-
pelleting of enzymes for animal feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The litigation involves a patent granted to Novozymes in
November 2009. The company already won a similar case against
Danisco in Denmark on March 4. Novozymes says it is now entitled
to an immediate injunction against Danisco in the Netherlands in
relation to the infringement there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Novozymes is aggressively protecting our patents across
the world and also in the Netherlands,&#8221; said Mikkel Viltoft,
general counsel for Novozymes, in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Although the Netherlands isn&#8217;t one of the most important
markets for this product, we are happy with the outcome. This
decision sets an important precedent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S.-based Danisco officials were not immediately available
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Gets U.S. Patent on Method of &#8216;Virtual Skywriting&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest software company,
received a patent on what it calls &#8220;virtual skywriting.&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology covered by patent 7,966,024 enables the user
of a mobile device to capture a photo of a real world scene,
including a sky portion. This image can then be linked with an
image of existing skywriting, enabling the addition of the
skywriting to the photo image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said in the patent that
this is a form of &#8220;virtual graffiti.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company applied for the patent in September 2008. No
outside counsel is listed on the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Seeks Patent on Method to Silently Record VOIP Calls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest software company, has
applied for a patent on a technology that will permit silent
recording of telephone calls made using the Voice Over Internet
Protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the application filed with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, present-day phone recording technology doesn&#8217;t
work with calls made using VOIP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application notes that &#8220;sometimes, a government or one
of its agencies may need to monitor communications between
telephone users.&#8221; With the move to VOIP systems, a new
technology is needed, Microsoft said in its application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data associated with a request to establish
communication using VOIP can be &#8220;modified to cause the
communication to be established via a path that includes a
recording agent,&#8221; according to the application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft applied for this patent
in December 2009. The application was published in U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office&#8217;s database of pending applications June 23.
No outside counsel is listed on the application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama Urges Passage of Patent Reform as a Job-Growth Agent &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chrysler Fails to Win Ban on &#8216;Imported from Detroit&#8217; T-Shirts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrysler Group LLC, which sued Detroit clothing company of
trademark infringement for emblazoning T-shirts with the
carmaker&#8217;s &#8220;Imported From Detroit&#8221; slogan, has lost its battle
to have the shirts banned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a June 28 order and opinion, U.S. District Judge Arthur
Tarnow said the automaker failed to show it would suffer
irreparable harm if Moda Group LLC continued to sell its shirts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carmaker said it began using &#8220;Imported from Detroit&#8221;
in its ads to let consumers know &#8220;they could obtain the luxury
they associate with foreign imports from a manufacturer based in
the U.S.&#8221; Chrysler said it filed an application Nov. 23 with
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to register the phrase as a
trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company ran an ad during this year&#8217;s Super Bowl to
introduce the phrase to the public. At the end of the spot --
which features Detroit rapper Eminem announcing &#8220;This is the
Motor City. And this is what we do&#8221; -- the screen fades to
black and the Chrysler logo and the words &#8220;Imported from
Detroit&#8221; appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrysler said it spent &#8220;millions of dollars&#8221; to create
and release the ad, which generated an immediate 1,619 percent
increase in traffic to the Chrysler 200 model Web page on Super
Bowl Sunday, Feb. 6. The automaker also claimed that after this
commercial aired for the first time, &#8220;the second most-searched
term&#8221; on Google was &#8220;Chrysler 200.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anticipating the popularity of the ad, Chrysler said it
applied to register the mark for use on clothing Jan. 18 and
began shipping its own &#8220;imported from Detroit&#8221; shirts Feb. 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automaker said Moda began selling shirts bearing the
slogan without authorization. Chrysler sent Moda a cease-and-
desist letter Feb. 18, after which Moda said it would quit
selling the allegedly infringing items, according to court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sales continued, and Moda began marketing additional
items bearing the slogan, including tote bags, Chrysler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his ruling denying Chrysler&#8217;s request, he noted that
each company used its own &#8220;house marks&#8221; on their respective
shirts, and said &#8220;it is hard to believe&#8221; that a consumer
shopping at one of the Pure Detroit stores would think the
shirts were coming from the automaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chrysler Group LLC v. Moda Group LLC, 2:11-cv-
11074-AJT-MJH, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan
(Detroit) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prince Says Music Piracy Is Halting his Recording Career &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince, the American musician who once changed his name to
an unpronounceable symbol following a dispute with his record
label, told the U.K.&#8217;s Guardian that music-piracy problems are
so severe that &#8220;I&#8217;ll just hold off recording.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performer, who was born Prince Rogers Nelson, compared
the present state of music piracy to both the gold rush and a
carjacking, saying &#8220;there&#8217;s no boundaries,&#8221; according to the
Guardian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also doesn&#8217;t market any of his songs as a ringtone, he
told the Guardian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present era of digitized media, Prince said the only

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Aerospace, Defense Lose $2.6 Billion Annually to IP Theft &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s aerospace and defense industries lose 1.6
billion British pounds ($2.6 billion) a year to industrial
espionage and theft of intellectual property, that country&#8217;s
Defense Secretary Liam Fox said at a London Chamber of Commerce
event, according to the U.K.&#8217;s Daily Mail newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fox said the defense and security industries with &#8220;complex
supply chains&#8221; are particularly vulnerable to cyber intrusion,
the Mail reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s Ministry of Defense itself is the target of a
cyber attack every eight hours, according to the Mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is investing 650 million British pounds in a
new National Cyber Security Program to help government and
industry combat cyber attacks, the Mail reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is among 62
companies getting a break from U.S. limits on truck-driver work
hours that&#8217;s intended to help communities put on Independence
Day fireworks shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule waiver allows Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S.
Inc., based in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, and other operators of
July 4 displays to keep drivers on duty more than the federal
maximum of 14 hours a day, according to a June 28 notice in the
Federal Register. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a very narrow window of opportunity to do our
business,&#8221; said Julie Heckman, executive director of the
American Pyrotechnics Association, a Bethesda, Maryland-based
trade group for fireworks operators. &#8220;We don&#8217;t get July 5.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is the only publicly traded company getting an
exemption. Most others are small, family-owned businesses that
rely on seasonal workers to make the shows happen, Heckman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which
grants the exemptions, gave them to nine companies for the first
time. Disney and 52 others had them renewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One company on the list, Zambelli Fireworks of New Castle,
Pennsylvania, has staged fireworks displays in New York harbor,
Mt. Rushmore, major league baseball games and state fairs,
according to the company website. It&#8217;s producing July 4th
celebrations in Philadelphia, Phoenix, Cleveland, Kansas City,
Missouri and 16 other cities. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) lost a bid for
dismissal of a lawsuit in which consumers accused the second-
biggest U.S. bank of wrongly cutting home-equity lines of
credit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer in Chicago today
ruled the homeowners could go forward on some of their claims
against the lender while dismissing allegations that JPMorgan
had engaged in fraudulent practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs&#8217; allegations that defendant reduced or
suspended their HELOCs without adequate justification are
sufficient to state claims for breach of contract under
Minnesota, California, Texas and Delaware law,&#8221; Pallmeyer said
in a 42-page decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling comes in a consolidated class action, or group
lawsuit, alleging that the lender had retracted or crimped those
lines of credit without any justification for doing so. The bank
had sought to dismiss the action in its entirety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas A. Kelly, a Chicago-based spokesman for the New
York-based bank, declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We feel this is a really important victory for consumers
throughout the country,&#8221; plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer Jay Edelson of
Chicago said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Banks had believed they
could act with impunity. We&#8217;re seeing that&#8217;s not the case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edelson said the next step was to seek class-wide
certification. There are thousands of similarly situated
potential class members, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re: JPMorgan Chase Bank Home Equity Line of
Credit Litigation, 10cv3647, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google Inc. (GOOG) were
accused of violating a Louisiana company&#8217;s patent covering
mapping technology that helps computer users see locations in
three dimensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of Transcenic Inc. contend in a lawsuit that
executives of Google, owner of the world&#8217;s biggest search
engine, and Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker,
misappropriated technology that helps capture 3-D images of map
locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies&#8217; misuse of the mapping technology &#8220;has
injured Transcenic and Transcenic is entitled to recover damages
adequate to compensate for such infringement,&#8221; the closely held
Lake Charles, Louisiana-based company said today in a suit filed
in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patents covering computer-mapping software have sparked
litigation against Google, Microsoft and other companies in
federal courts around the U.S. GeoTag Inc. has filed patent-
infringement suits against 300 entities, many of which use
mapping technology made by Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
or Mountain View, California-based Google to show store
locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katelin Todhunter-Gerberg, a Google spokeswoman, and Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman, both said they couldn&#8217;t comment on
the suit because they hadn&#8217;t yet received a copy of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Street View Targeted &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcenic argues computer programs such as Google&#8217;s Street
View and Microsoft&#8217;s Streetside allow users to see 3-D images of
their destination rather than the traditional birds-eye view of
a map grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s Street View system also has become a target for
lawsuits alleging the company is violating residents&#8217; privacy
rights by collecting data from individual Wi-Fi networks. A
federal judge in California yesterday said a wiretapping suit
over the system could proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Google and Microsoft have placed &#8220;infringing systems
into action or service&#8221; and obtain &#8220;beneficial use&#8221; of those
systems, lawyers for Transcenic said in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent-infringement suit also names AOL Inc. (AOL) and its
MapQwest unit as defendants. Sandy Drayton, an AOL spokeswoman,
didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone call for comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Transcenic Inc. v. Google Inc., 11-cv-582, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bankers for Hulu LLC, the video-
streaming service, have met with Google Inc. (GOOG), Yahoo Inc. and
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) as the company explores a sale, people familiar
with the process said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and Guggenheim Partners have reached out to
10 to 12 potential bidders, including ATT Inc. (T), said two people
who weren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sale may bring more than $2 billion to Hulu&#8217;s owners,
which include Walt Disney Co. (DIS), News Corp. and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s
NBC Universal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and SNL
Kagan. Hulu was approached by a potential suitor, starting the
process, people familiar with the matter said on June 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elisa Schreiber, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles-based Hulu,
declined to comment, as did Chris Gaither, a spokesman for
Mountain View, California-based Google. Kim Rubey, with
Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo, Lisa Tryall, at Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft and Brad Burns, with Dallas-based
ATT also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles Times reported the meetings earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hulu would be attractive to any large company seeking to
build an online content business, Clayton Moran, an analyst with
Benchmark Co. in Boca Raton, Florida, said last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Greece were to default and force a
debt reorganization, the result might be bank runs, contagion to
other countries, triggering of credit default swaps and
political strife within Europe, said Jeffrey Sachs, who heads
the Earth Institute at Columbia University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, he wrote in the Financial Times, while a
default can&#8217;t be ruled out, it shouldn&#8217;t be a first or early
resort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument that a default is inevitable is based on the
claim that, since Greece owes foreign creditors about 120
percent of national income, servicing the debt will prove
unsustainable, Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average interest rates on Greek bonds are above 6 percent a
year and if the country had to pay that much, the burden would
indeed be impossible to bear; however, if a low interest rate
were to be negotiated and repayments extended over 20 years, the
debt could probably be serviced, Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming a 3 percent economic growth rate, the country
would be able to service its debt and cut the ratio of debt to
GDP from 120 percent to 70 percent over the 20 years, he
concluded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) pipeline leaked
crude oil early today into the Yellowstone River in Montana, the
company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spill from a 12-inch line operated by Exxon Mobil
Pipeline Co. is being investigated, and the cause isn&#8217;t known,
Rachael Moore, a company spokeswoman, said in a separate e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not going to speculate&#8221; on how much oil escaped
into the river, Moore said. &#8220;Right now our focus is on
containing the crude release and getting it cleaned up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fire department of nearby Laurel, Montana, evacuated
some homes amid concern of possible explosions, Moore said. The
pipeline runs from Silver Tip in south-central Montana to
Billings, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil flowed from the pipe for about 30 minutes before it was
stopped, the Associated Press reported earlier, citing Pam Malek, an Exxon spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline supplies refineries in the Billings area, the
AP said, citing Peters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RWE AG (RWE) is working with Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) as Germany&#8217;s second-largest utility considers a sale
of its Npower unit in the U.K., according to a person familiar
with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examination of the business, which had revenue of 7.8
billion euros ($11.3 billion) last year, is preliminary and the
Essen, Germany-based company may not pursue a sale, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the discussions
are private. A person familiar with the matter said in February
that RWE was considering a sale of U.K. assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RWE plans to raise as much as 8 billion euros with asset
divestments by 2013 to cut debt after its borrowings surged with
the acquisition of a Dutch competitor in 2009. The utility also
faces a tax on its German nuclear power plants that will reduce
earnings starting this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.K. continues to be a core market of RWE,&#8221; Peter
Hoscheidt, a spokesman for the company, said to Bloomberg News
in an e-mailed statement today. &#8220;Beyond that, we don&#8217;t have any
further comment on market speculation, which this is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Npower supplies natural gas and power and owns fossil-fuel-
fired electricity plants, according to its website. RWE&#8217;s
renewable-energy unit, called Innogy, operates about 550
megawatts of wind turbines and hydropower facilities in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RWE may sell Npower, one of the U.K.&#8217;s six leading energy
companies, for 5 billion pounds ($8 billion), the London-based
Times reported today, citing unidentified people familiar with
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
