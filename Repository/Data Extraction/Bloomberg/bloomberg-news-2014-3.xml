<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s newly appointed
Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, in an effort to reignite
growth, is shuffling management and putting former political
operative Mark Penn in the new role of chief strategy officer. </p>
<p>Tony Bates, who was passed over for the CEO job, is leaving
the company, with Eric Rudder, the head of advanced strategy,
taking over his duties on an interim basis, Microsoft said today
in a memo to employees. Tami Reller, the executive vice
president in charge of marketing, is also leaving and being
replaced by Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela. </p>
<p>The shakeup is the most extensive yet for Nadella, who was
named CEO in February after a five-month search and is tasked
with speeding up a turnaround at the world''s biggest software
maker. He''ll be leaning on a former political strategist in
Penn, who worked on Hillary Clinton''s failed 2008 presidential
bid. More recently, Penn, 60, developed Microsoft''s Don''t Get
Scroogled advertising campaign, a political-style attack on
Google Inc. </p>
<p>He''s aggressive, Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co., said of Penn. Maybe this will add a little
testosterone to the organization to counter the fact that Satya
is more of a deep thinker. </p>
<p>Penn''s background is in public relations -- he spent six
years as CEO of Burson-Marsteller. His aggressive style puts him
at odds with some managers, who were uncomfortable with the
Scroogled campaign, said people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<h2>Super Bowl Ad </h2>
<p>He''s also helped develop less controversial ads like
Microsoft''s first national Super Bowl commercial this year. In
the ad, former football player Steve Gleason, who suffers from
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and can''t speak, narrated
using Microsoft technology. </p>
<p>His focus on using data to quickly evaluate and evolve
our campaigns has driven new insights and understanding,
Nadella said in the memo. </p>
<p>Part of Penn''s job will involve helping the company decide
where to invest, and he will join the product leadership team,
said a person with knowledge of the change. </p>
<p>The overhaul follows last month''s announcement that
hardware group chief Julie Larson-Green will move to the
applications and services unit. Thom Gruhler, a vice president
who oversaw Windows and Windows Phone marketing, will lead
marketing for the applications and services group, people with
knowledge of the matter said. Reller notified employees of that
change in an e-mail, they said. </p>
<h2>Mobile Laggard </h2>
<p>Microsoft shares fell 1.4 percent to $37.78 at the close in
New York. The stock has risen 3.9 percent since Nadella''s
appointment on Feb. 4, and has trailed the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index in three of the past four years. </p>
<p>Nadella, a 22-year Microsoft veteran, is the company''s
third CEO after Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. He''s charged with
accelerating expansion at a company that hasn''t seen sales
growth exceed 6 percent since 2011. Microsoft''s investments in
mobile haven''t put a dent in Google and Apple Inc.''s control of
the smartphone market, while cloud applications from competitors
pose an increasing threat to Microsoft''s flagship Windows
business. </p>
<p>Nadella is trying things out, said Moerdler, who has
the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft. He said he expects
additional changes in senior leadership, including possible
outside hires. </p>
<h2>Job Split </h2>
<p>Bates was among the leading internal candidates for the top
job, along with Nadella and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner. Bates, a former Cisco Systems Inc. executive, ran
Microsoft''s Skype unit before becoming an executive vice
president in July. He doesn''t have another job lined up and
plans to take some time to figure out his next move, said a
person familiar with his plans. </p>
<p>Reller, who joined Microsoft in 2001, was also promoted to
executive vice president in July and led marketing for the
Windows 8 operating system. Capossela had been named chief
marketing officer back in 2011, though his role was reduced in
July when Ballmer split marketing between Reller and Penn, with
the latter taking on advertising strategy. </p>
<p>Penn''s ties to the Clintons date back to the 1990s and his
work in the re-election campaign for President Bill Clinton. He
worked on Hillary Clinton''s campaign until April 2008, when he
came under fire for his firm''s role in promoting trade with
Colombia. </p>
<p>At Microsoft, Penn has a longstanding relationship with
Ballmer and Gates and advised the company during its antitrust
case with the U.S. government. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is unveiling a new
Web-based Office application that uses search and social data to
display a user''s most important files and projects, seeking to
boost sales and fend off competition. </p>
<p>The app, code-named Oslo, has versions for Windows 8, the
Internet and mobile devices, including those based on Apple
Inc.''s and Google Inc.''s software for smartphones and tablets,
Jeff Teper, a Microsoft vice president, said in an interview.
The first Oslo programs, probably for Windows 8 and the Web,
will be available in the second half of 2014, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft wants to move more customers to cloud-based
versions of its Office productivity software, which are
delivered via the Internet, in order to boost growth and fend
off similar applications. Cloud programs are sold as
subscriptions, providing more regular sales compared with the
cycle of customers buying a version of Office every few years,
said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. </p>
<p>On the corporate side, they have a belief they can
significantly differentiate the Microsoft offering from others
with search and social features, Moerdler said. They want to
make Office massively more interactive. </p>
<p>The product incorporates features from two Microsoft
acquisitions: The 2012 purchase of Yammer Inc., which provides
social-networking tools for companies, and the acquisition in
2008 of Norway''s Fast Search  Transfer ASA, a search technology
developer. The Oslo code name is a nod to the Norwegian unit''s
team. </p>
<h2>Office Graph </h2>
<p>Instead of opening Outlook, Word or Excel, users of the new
app will have a dashboard of projects and files they''re working
on, as well as topics they should know about and those popular
among co-workers. Oslo will also let users search by categories,
such as modified by me, shared with me and trending
around me. Clicking on a colleague brings up not just that
person''s manager, peers and direct reports, but others working
on projects across an entire company. </p>
<p>Underlying Oslo is what Microsoft is calling the Office
Graph, an idea similar to the social graph, a term popularized
by Facebook Inc. for the depiction of personal relationships,
said Adam Pisoni, the Yammer co-founder who is now a Microsoft
vice president. The Office graph would act as a repository of
data culled from a user''s social relationships and actions.
Microsoft will also open up the data so other business-software
developers can create apps that can exchange such information
between Office and their programs. </p>
<p>With the Office unit now part of the same business as
Microsoft''s Bing search, future versions of Oslo will integrate
Web-search data from Bing, said Teper. Microsoft is still
working on pricing and will begin testing the software with a
few chosen customers in the next month or so, Teper said. </p>
<p>Don''t think of this as the version of Word you''ve got on
your machine, Teper said. It''s a really new experience for
how the office should work. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank
that was lead underwriter on Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s May bond offering,
named the technology firm''s chief financial officer, Peter Oppenheimer, to its board of directors. </p>
<p>Oppenheimer, 51, whose appointment expands the board to 13
members, is joining immediately and will sit on all four of its
committees, New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in a
statement. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, was
chosen to underwrite the majority of Apple''s then-record $17
billion bond offering last year. It was the Cupertino,
California-based company''s first issuance in 17 years. Apple
also hired Goldman Sachs in 2012 to help it improve transparency
and governance, including what to do with its more than $100
billion in cash. </p>
<p>Peter''s 25 years of broad experience across important
industries will add a valuable perspective to our board of
directors, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said in the statement. </p>

<p>ReNew Power Ventures Pvt., a clean-energy developer backed by Goldman Sachs Group (GS) Inc., won the
most capacity in a government solar auction in the central
Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. </p>
<p>ReNew was awarded a license to build a 30-megawatt
photovoltaic plant after bidding to sell power at 6,970 rupees
($112) a megawatt-hour, according to S.R. Mohanty, secretary of
new and renewable energy in the state. That''s about 19 percent
below the global average price for electricity generated by
panels, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>India, the third-biggest energy consumer on Earth, plans a
six-fold increase in solar capacity by 2017 to reduce blackouts
as plunging panel prices help photovoltaic projects compete on
costs with coal and gas-fired plants. The government is using
competitive tenders to avoid European-style subsidies, where
above-market tariffs for wind and solar farms are common. </p>
<p>Madhya Pradesh awarded 100 megawatts of capacity in total.
Developers promising to sell power at the cheapest rates won.
Himgiri Energy Ventures offered the lowest bid of 6,470 rupees a
megawatt-hour. </p>
<p>The winners also included Today Homes  Infrastructure
Pvt., Bhadresh Trading Corp., Ujaas Energy Ltd. (UJEL)''s unit KRBL and
Focal Energy Holdings Ltd., according to a list sent by Mohanty. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and the
World Bank said they will invest $132 million to push banks in
developing economies to lend to women-owned businesses. </p>
<p>The money will fund a new facility run by the World Bank''s
private-sector arm that will extend lines of credit and share
risks with local banks to ensure they give female entrepreneurs
access to financing for their small and medium-size companies.
The two contributors plan to raise an additional $468 million
from other investors, the World Bank said today in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>Gender equality is smart economics and a key driver of
development, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in a
speech in Washington announcing the partnership today. We need
to do more so that investing in women becomes mainstream by
businesses and financial institutions alike. </p>
<p>The bank estimates that women-owned companies face a $300
billion credit gap, made worse in some countries by unfavorable
regulation. Closing that gap would raise income per capita
across the main developing economies, with Brazil and Vietnam
gaining the most, according to Goldman Sachs research. </p>
<p>The World Bank''s International Finance Corp. unit will
invest $100 million in the so-called Women Entrepreneurs
Opportunity Facility, with Goldman Sachs providing $32 million,
the World Bank said. </p>

<p>Payment networks, retailers and
banks will continue to face significant costs to address fraud
as hackers find new ways to steal data, according to Byron Pollitt, chief financial officer of Visa Inc. (V) </p>
<p>This is an investment cycle that never ends, Pollitt
said today at a technology conference in San Francisco. The
resourcefulness, the intellect, the level of innovativeness in
the fraud sector is absolutely amazing. </p>
<p>Lenders and merchants are under pressure to convert from
magnetic strips to microchip technology that thwarts hackers
after millions of consumer records were breached at retailers
including Target Corp. One reason the conversion hasn''t happened
yet is because it''s expensive for merchants to upgrade their
systems and for lenders to issue new cards, said Pollitt, whose
company is the world''s biggest bank-card network. </p>
<p>It''s high investment and in the absence of a Target
catalyst, I doubt that we would be on the track we are on
today, Pollitt said. The chip will address about 70 percent of
fraud, he said. Including a requirement that consumers enter
personal identification numbers, or PINs, would dramatically
slow its implementation because about two-thirds of retailers
don''t have the necessary equipment, Pollitt said. </p>
<p>American Express Co., Foster City, California-based Visa
and MasterCard Inc. have given most U.S. merchants and issuers
until October 2015 to adopt chips -- named EMV for founders
EuroPay International, MasterCard and Visa. Those that refuse
would assume liability for counterfeit card transactions. </p>
<p>They are also pushing retailers to use tokenization,
where some account information is replaced with a digital ID for
online and mobile purchases. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
generated one-third of its profit from trading last year, hired
Kayhan Mirza from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) as global head of
foreign-exchange trading. </p>
<p>Mirza accepted a position as partner at Goldman Sachs,
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said
today by phone. DuVally declined to comment on reporting lines
in the business. Guy Saidenberg has held the role of global head
of foreign-exchange trading at Goldman Sachs. He declined to
comment when reached at his office. </p>
<p>Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
investment banks declined 9 percent in 2013, according to
industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in October that the
bank''s currency business had difficulty managing inventory
in the third quarter as the firm posted its worst fixed-income
trading revenue since the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs lost at least two partners from its currency-trading business this year. Leland Lim, co-head of macro trading
for Asia ex-Japan, left to start a hedge fund. Steven Cho,
global head of spot and forward trading of G-10 currencies in
New York, also departed. </p>
<p>At least a dozen regulators are investigating allegations
first reported by Bloomberg News in June that traders colluded
to rig benchmarks in the $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market.
That is boosting demand from clients for greater transparency in
pricing and transaction charges, accelerating a longer-term
shift in trading onto electronic platforms. </p>
<h2>Electronic Trading </h2>
<p>Electronic dealing, which accounted for 66 percent of all
currency transactions in 2013 and 20 percent in 2001, will
increase to 76 percent within five years, according to Aite
Group LLC, a Boston-based consulting firm that reviewed Bank for
International Settlements data. </p>
<p>Mirza had served as JPMorgan''s head of foreign-exchange
trading in Europe, Middle East and Africa and global head of FX
options trading. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn''t immediately return a call seeking comment. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), which sold its
European private wealth-management business last year, is

according to a person briefed on the discussions. </p>
<p>The Swiss unit, Bank Morgan Stanley AG, may be sold or
wound down, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because no decision has been reached. The Swiss financial news
website finews.ch reported the discussions earlier today. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley last year sold its wealth-management
operations in the U.K., Italy and Dubai to Credit Suisse Group
AG. The New York-based company said at the time that the Swiss
bank, which only serves clients outside the U.S., was an
integral part of its international business. </p>
<p>The firm now serves some of its private-wealth clients in
Asia through its institutional operation, leaving fewer
customers requiring the Swiss bank, the person said. Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman, 55, has said he wants to focus
on wealth-management businesses where the bank has significant
scale. </p>

<p>Richard A. Friedman, head of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s merchant banking division, said he sees
opportunities to invest in middle-sized companies as some other
private-equity firms sell their investments. </p>
<p>My peers, I see them at conferences, and they talk about
how it''s the greatest selling environment -- I actually think
it''s a good investing environment, Friedman, 56, said today in
a CNBC interview. We have continued improvement in the
economy, we have very low interest rates and access to capital,
and also for the first time, I''d say, in years, our CEOs can
actually put business plans together with more confidence. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s merchant banking unit makes investments in
private-equity and real estate assets using client funds and the
company''s own money. The firm''s investments are included in its
investing and lending segment, which produced $4.33 billion of
pretax earnings in 2013, the most profit of any of Goldman
Sachs''s four business units. </p>
<p>The bank has said it''s cutting its own stakes in private-equity funds to comply with the Volcker Rule, which limits such
investments. Still, the firm can often make direct investments
in debt or equity securities with its own money outside of fund
structures. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s merchant banking division has raised more
than $82 billion for investment funds in corporate equity and
debt since 1986, according to its website. The bank is
considering a different strategy than buying large companies to
take them private, which was popular before the financial
crisis, Friedman said. </p>
<h2>Not Happening'' </h2>
<p>What we''re looking at is actually buying mid-sized
companies or making early-stage investments and growing
companies, as opposed to what happened in 2005 through 2007,
which was a buying spree of taking companies private, Friedman
said. That''s just not happening anymore. </p>
<p>Friedman said he doesn''t expect interest rates to rise in
the near future. When that happens, it will probably lower
valuation multiples on companies, he said. </p>
<p>Friedman has worked at Goldman Sachs for more than 30 years
and was named a partner in 1990. He and Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein are the only two executives to sit on the
firm''s management committee since it was created in 1999. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp.''s (XOM) biggest
international exploration opportunity may be imperiled by
Russian President Vladimir Putin''s Ukrainian foray. </p>
<p>U.S.-based companies could face restrictions on doing
business in Russia if Putin''s regime is slapped with sanctions
by western governments or the United Nations for its
intervention in Ukraine''s Crimea region. </p>
<p>Exxon, under the terms of a 2011 contract with state-controlled OAO Rosneft, owns drilling rights across 11.4 million
acres of Russian land, its biggest exploration holding outside
the U.S. Sanctions could stall Exxon''s plans to begin drilling
in the Russian Arctic later this year in partnership with
Rosneft, and threaten the lucrative Sakhalin-1 oil license off
Russia''s Pacific Coast. </p>
<p>Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
agreed to invest billions of dollars and allow Rosneft to buy
stakes in premier North American projects in exchange for access
to Russia''s vast Arctic, deep-water and shale resources. </p>
<p>The 61-year-old University of Texas-trained engineer is
seeking to reverse sliding oil and natural gas output at the
world''s biggest energy producer by market value. Since assuming
the leadership post of Exxon in January 2006, the company''s
stock has increased 65 percent, lagging the 77 percent advance
in the price of crude, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Drilling Rights </h2>
<p>Exxon''s 11.4 million acres of Russian drilling rights are
eclipsed in size only by the company''s 15.1 million acres in its
home country, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission on Feb. 26. The next largest Exxon holdings
are in Canada, Germany and Indonesia, where the company owns
rights to 6.3 million acres, 5 million acres and 2.3 million
acres, respectively. </p>
<p>Exxon has repeatedly declined to comment on the impact the
Russian imbroglio in Ukraine may have on its operations or
investment decisions. Tillerson is scheduled to take questions
from analysts and the media later today at the company''s annual
strategy presentation at the New York Stock Exchange. </p>
<p>Exxon''s interests in the region aren''t confined to Russian
oil fields. The company dispatched high-level executives to the
Ukraine''s capital of Kiev six weeks ago to discuss exploring the
country''s vast shale deposits, Interfax reported on Jan. 23,
citing the website of then-President Viktor Yanukovych. </p>
<p>Yanukovych was ousted amid violent streets protests in late
February and has since fled to Russia. The January meetings
included Exxon executives Stephen Greenlee and Kevin Biddle,
according to the Interfax report. </p>
<h2>Rising Costs </h2>
<p>The Russian turmoil comes at a time when Exxon''s
exploration effort have stalled worldwide and costs to pump oil
and gas from the ground are rising. </p>
<p>The company found commercial quantities of oil or gas in 67
percent of the exploratory wells it drilled in 2013, unchanged
from 2012, according to the Feb. 26 regulatory filing. At the
same time, Exxon''s costs to produce the equivalent of a barrel
of crude jumped to $11.48 last year from $9.91 in 2012. </p>
<p>Exxon''s Russian drilling rights include 11.3 million acres
in the Kara and Black seas under the agreement with Rosneft, and
another 85,000 offshore acres beneath the Sea of Okhotsk near
Sakhalin Island. Rosneft is a partner in the Sakhalin-1
development, which began producing crude in 2005. </p>

<p>A U.S. judge handed Chevron Corp. a key victory in the energy company''s long-fought battle against a multibillion-dollar pollution lawsuit in Ecuador, ruling the American lawyer leading the case resorted to bribery and fraud. </p> <p>U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan agreed with Chevron yesterday that attorney Steven Donziger had paid off a judge and engaged in money laundering to secure a $9.5 billion judgment from an Ecuadorean court against the global oil giant. The ruling leaves Donziger, who spent the past two decades fighting Chevron, with a slimmer chance of securing compensation for rain forest dwellers in the country''s Lago Agrio area who claimed their land was turned into a toxic dumping ground for foreign oil interests. </p> <p>The New York plaintiffs'' attorney went over to the dark side and made a bargain with the devil, to obtain the 2011 judgment from the court in Ecuador, Kaplan said in a 500-page opinion yesterday. He ruled U.S. courts can''t be used to collect the award, cut in half from an original $19 billion by Ecuador''s highest court on Nov. 12. </p> <p>The defendants here may not be allowed to benefit from that in any way, the judge wrote. The ruling may also make it more difficult for Donziger and his clients to collect the Ecuador court''s award by seizing Chevron assets outside the U.S. </p> <p>Donziger would need to win a reversal of the decision on appeal in order to salvage a payday for himself and his clients after decades of litigation. Kaplan''s detailed findings will make winning an appeal more difficult, said Cassandra Burke Robertson, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who has followed the case. </p> <p>The appellate court would have to conclude that the district court''s finding is clearly erroneous, which is a very hard standard to meet, Robertson said. Donziger definitely has an uphill battle to seek reversal. </p> <h2>Other Countries </h2> <p>Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company by market value, has waged a battle across multiple countries to prevent Donziger from collecting the award, which was almost half of its 2013 profit of $21.4 billion. Kaplan''s bar on profiting from the judgment applies anywhere in the world, even though it doesn''t stop Donziger from trying to make his case in foreign courts, Randy Mastro, a lead lawyer for Chevron, said yesterday in a conference call. </p> <p>Chevron claims Kaplan''s opinion should be respected by courts in other countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Canada, where Chevron has assets and where Donziger and his team have already sued to try to collect on the judgment. The Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled in December that the 47 villagers have the right to pursue Chevron''s Canada assets. The other cases are pending. </p> <h2>Brazil, Canada </h2> <p>Chevron General Counsel R. Hewitt Pate said yesterday that the company plans to share Kaplan''s ruling with judges overseeing proceedings in Brazil, Argentina and Canada. </p> <p>In view of the findings here about what really went on in this case, we don''t think any serious court will entertain enforcement of the fraudulent judgment, Pate said. </p> <p>Ecuadorean villagers and activists working on their behalf had argued that Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, should be held financially responsible for pollution of the Amazon rainforest in the Lago Agrio area by Texaco Inc. from the 1960s through the early 1990s. Chevron, which bought Texaco in 2001, claimed the company already paid $40 million to clean up its share of the drilling contamination. </p> <h2>Secret Account </h2> <p>The case in Ecuador included things that normally come only out of Hollywood -- coded e-mails among Donziger and his colleagues describing their private interactions with and machinations directed at judges and a court-appointed expert, Kaplan wrote. </p> <p>Donziger and his team paid off a supposedly neutral court expert from a secret account, promised $500,000 to a judge handling the case who was so inexperienced he used an 18-year-old typist to do legal research, and wrote the judgment themselves, Kaplan said. </p> <p>Donziger began his involvement in this controversy with a desire to improve conditions in the area in which his Ecuadorean clients live, said Kaplan, who oversaw a seven-week non-jury trial on the judgment. In the end, however, he and the Ecuadorean lawyers he led corrupted the Lago Agrio case. </p> <p>The length of the opinion gives the parties more ammunition to continue their fight, said Robertson, the Case Western professor. I would be surprised if the ruling were upheld in full, but I think the ruling prohibiting Donziger from benefiting financially from the case will likely stand. </p> <h2>Helpful'' Ruling </h2> <p>John Watson, Chevron''s chairman and chief executive officer, told reporters yesterday at the IHS CERAWeek energy conference in Houston that having a judgment like this from a reputable court in the United States will certainly be helpful in preventing enforcement actions elsewhere. </p> <p>Chevron has also brought an arbitration case against Ecuador over its alleged failure to uphold agreements releasing predecessor Texaco from legal cases over the pollution. The arbitration in The Hague is pending. </p> <p>The Embassy of Ecuador said yesterday that Kaplan''s ruling explicitly does not exonerate Chevron from its own legal and moral responsibilities resulting from its decades of contamination of the rainforest that has endangered the lives, culture, and environment of countless poor, indigenous people. </p> <p>The embassy said Ecuador isn''t a party in Chevron''s case against Donziger. </p> <p>In a statement, Donziger called Kaplan''s ruling an appalling decision. </p> <h2>Wrong, Wrong </h2> <p>We believe Judge Kaplan is wrong on the law and wrong on the facts and that he repeatedly let his implacable hostility toward me, my Ecuadorean clients, and their country infect his view of the case, he said. </p> <p>Donziger said he will pursue an immediate and expedited appeal. </p> <p>The lawyer has argued that he did nothing wrong in Ecuador and that any aggressive tactics he may have used were no worse than Chevron''s actions. He said that Kaplan made it clear he would rule against us well before the trial began by refusing a request to hold the proceeding before a jury. </p> <p>Appellate lawyer Deepak Gupta, who joined Donziger''s team after the trial concluded, said in a statement that Kaplan has taken the extraordinary and unprecedented step of appointing itself a worldwide fact-finding commission, issuing what is in effect a global anti-collection injunction. </p> <h2>Appalling Verdict </h2> <p>This decision also effectively outlaws core activity protected by the First Amendment such as bringing lawsuits, holding protests, issuing press releases, and engaging public officials, he said, referencing tactics mentioned in Kaplan''s decision. This is particularly appalling given that this case is about holding a corporation accountable for refusing to clean up decades of toxic pollution in the Amazon. </p> <p>Donziger, a Harvard Law School graduate, joined the case in a junior role in the late 1990s and gradually rose to a position as a strategist and fundraiser. He contends that Ecuador-based lawyers are now in charge of the case. </p> <p>He is intelligent, resourceful, and a master of public and media relations, Kaplan said in the decision. </p> <p>Some celebrities supported the campaign against Chevron, including Trudie Styler, who founded the Rainforest Foundation with her husband, musician Sting, and helped to start a project to make clean water available to forest inhabitants in Ecuador. Styler attended some of the New York court proceedings, bringing her husband to watch Donziger testify. </p> <p>Actress Mia Farrow and actor Danny Glover also voiced support for the campaign, and the case was featured in a documentary, Crude, by filmmaker Joe Berlinger. Chevron won access to hundreds of hours of outtakes from the film, which it contended showed Donziger acting inappropriately. </p> <p>The racketeering case is Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 11-cv-00691, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass, Beth Jinks and Peter Burrows" date="Mar 05, 2014 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-05/microsoft-s-nadella-manages-legacy-of-ballmer-board-split.html"><headline>Microsoft''s Nadella Manages Legacy of Ballmer-Board Split</headline><body><![CDATA[

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is cutting 700 jobs,
a quarter of the employees at its interactive unit, in a
realignment of its video-game and Internet advertising
businesses. </p>
<p>Future games for consoles such as Sony Corp.''s PlayStation
and Microsoft Corp.''s Xbox will be licensed, James Pitaro,
president of Disney Interactive, said today in an interview.
Burbank, California-based Disney is also paring its online ad
sales team to focus on fewer and bigger partners. </p>
<p>The company will continue to invest in interactive,
including the Infinity game system and the upcoming Fantasia
title, mobile game development in Japan and short-form videos on
the Web. It''s also extending the Club Penguin online virtual
world to iPhone and Android platforms. The cuts announced today
are part of an effort to make the division profitable on a
consistent basis. </p>
<p>The interactive division lost $87 million on sales of $1.06
billion in the year ended Sept. 28. While the unit made a profit
of $55 million in this year''s first quarter ended in December,
Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said in February results this
period would be comparable to the $54 million loss in the second
quarter of 2013. </p>
<p>The division had one of the top 10 video games of 2013 with
its Infinity system, according to researcher NPD Group Inc.
Mobile traffic on its websites has about doubled since a
redesign two years ago, according to data from ComScore Inc. </p>
<h2>Web Ads </h2>
<p>Selling ads based on the mobile traffic has been
challenging, Pitaro said, explaining why the company is shifting
to more extensive sponsorships from display ads. </p>
<p>Playdom, a maker of games for social media that Disney
acquired for $563 million in 2010, has also struggled to come up
with hits as the business shifted to mobile and customers balked
at paying even 99 cents for games, Pitaro said. </p>
<p>The industry has shifted from social games to mobile
games, Pitaro said. Our focus is now mobile first. </p>
<p>Pitaro became sole president of interactive in November. He
previously shared that title with former Playdom Chief Executive
Officer John Pleasants, who left at that time. </p>
<p>Disney rose less than 1 percent to $83.34 at the close in
New York. The stock has advanced 9.1 percent this year. </p>

<p>Firms from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
to Deutsche Bank AG are putting their faith in India''s rupee as
the country looks forward to the biggest improvement in its
broadest measure of trade in a decade. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which ranked India as the most vulnerable
Asian market in September, now predicts the rupee will beat
peers from Brazil to South Africa and Turkey. Deutsche Bank, the
largest foreign-exchange trader, and Barclays Plc say it''s their
favorite emerging-market currency. The rupee has risen 6.8
percent against the dollar over the past six months, the most
among 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Investors are seeking safe, high-yielding assets as the
U.S. Federal Reserve reduces stimulus and after a slowdown in
China contributed to the worst start to a year for emerging-market currencies since 2009. For many, India fits the bill, as
policy makers take steps to reverse a slump that sent the rupee
tumbling to a record last August. </p>
<p>India looks in much better shape now than it did six
months back, Kim Jin Ha, a global fixed-income fund manager in
Seoul at Mirae Asset Management Co., which oversees about $59
billion, said by e-mail March 3. Capital flows can continue. </p>
<h2>Funds Return </h2>
<p>The rupee''s recovery bodes well for India''s efforts to curb
the fastest consumer-price inflation after Argentina among the
Group of 20 nations, and to boost inflows to help revive the
slowest economic growth in a decade. Less than three months into
2014, foreigners have already plowed back more than half of the
$8 billion they pulled from local bonds last year. </p>
<p>India''s rupee climbed as much as 1.1 percent today to
61.1050 per dollar, the strongest level since Dec. 10, and was
at 61.1150 as of 10:33 a.m. in New York. It has risen from an
all-time low of 68.845 on Aug. 28. The rupee weakened 13 percent
in the second and third quarters of last year amid a decline in
the country''s manufacturing industry and monetary tightening. </p>
<p>The rupee may get a boost after India''s current-account
deficit narrowed to a four-year low as the world''s second-largest bullion-consuming nation raised gold-import tariffs. </p>
<p>The shortfall in the broadest measure of trade, which
tracks goods, services and investment income, was $4.2 billion
last quarter, down from $5.2 billion in the prior three months,
the Reserve Bank of India said yesterday in Mumbai. </p>
<p>The deficit will shrink to $45 billion in the year ending
March 31, from $88 billion in the prior period, Finance Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram predicted last month. </p>
<h2>Small Long'' </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs said in February that it saw the rupee at 62
in three months'' time, while its asset-management arm opened
this year what it called a small long position on the
currency. HSBC Holdings Plc advises buying the rupee and selling
Indonesia''s rupiah, while Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley
predict India''s currency will strengthen against the Brazilian
real, according to client notes last week. </p>
<p>Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. may buy Indian assets because
the economy is less exposed to China''s faltering growth than
nations including South Korea, Emmanuel Ng, a strategist at the
Singapore-based firm, said by e-mail on Feb. 26. </p>
<p>I see the inflows continuing, said Rajeev De Mello, who
oversees $10 billion as the head of Asian fixed income at
Schroder Investment Management Ltd. in Singapore. </p>
<h2>Big Doubts'' </h2>
<p>Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg lifted the median mid-year
forecast for the rupee to 62.6, from 63.25 three months ago. </p>
<p>While that''s a bigger increase than for any of its Asian
peers, it still signals a drop of more than 1 percent by June
30. Credit Agricole SA says the rupee will weaken to 70 per
dollar by mid-year as a clampdown on bullion shipments boosts
unofficial imports and India prepares for elections next month. </p>
<p>India''s external position is not as good as it looks,
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at France''s
third-biggest bank, said in an interview on March 4. India''s
imports of gold have actually increased. I have big doubts
whether the government that will come out of the elections will
be welcomed by the markets. </p>
<p>RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan lifted interest rates three
times since taking office in September, boosting returns to
rupee investors and helping slow inflation to 8.8 percent in
January, from 11.2 percent in November. </p>
<p>He boosted capital inflows by offering discounted foreign-exchange swaps for dollar deposits and debt raised by local
banks. That helped increase foreign-exchange reserves by $20
billion, from September''s three-year low of $247 billion. </p>
<p>Dollar-based investors can make a return of 6.5 percent,
including interest, by holding the rupee until the end of 2014,
the biggest gain in Asia, according to data based on
appreciation estimates and deposit rates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Current-account numbers have been the key driver because
it''s a very transparent measure of whether the policy
prescriptions are having an impact, Philip Moffitt, the
Sydney-based head of Asia-Pacific fixed income at Goldman Sachs
Asset Management, which oversees more than $1 trillion, said in
an interview. If you can find something that''s relatively
cheap and the fundamentals appear to be improving, it''s usually
a good mix. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
generated one-third of its profit from trading last year, is
restarting Middle East and North Africa equity sales in Dubai,
according to two people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets is hiring Veer Ramlugon as part of the plans, one of the people said, asking
not to be identified because the matter isn''t public. Ramlugon,
who declined to comment when contacted by mobile phone earlier
this week, previously worked in Middle East equity and equity-derivative sales at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Dubai. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is joining banks from Renaissance Capital to
Arqaam Capital Ltd. in expanding coverage in the Middle East and
Africa as local markets rally and economic growth surges.
Dubai''s benchmark index has advanced the most among 50 of the
world''s largest equity gauges this year with a gain of 23
percent as the United Arab Emirates'' real-estate and banking
industries recover from a property crash. </p>
<p>The U.A.E. was raised to emerging-market status from
frontier by index provider MSCI Inc. in 2013, potentially paving
the way for greater foreign investment in the nation. Dubai, the
Arab world''s business hub, is gearing up to host the World Expo
in 2020 with $8 billion of infrastructure spending. </p>
<p>The cost of insuring the sheikhdom''s debt against non-payment with credit-default swaps was quoted at 189 basis points
at the end of February, the least since the 187 reached in May,
according to prices compiled by CMA. They traded at 192 basis
points as of 3:02 p.m. in New York. </p>
<p>Renaissance, the Russian investment bank controlled by
billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, is planning to open an office in
the city to take advantage of the rising demand for assets in
the oil-rich region, while Dubai-based Arqaam will start trading
African bonds and derivatives. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to give
mortgage-bond trustees evaluating a proposed $4.5 billion
settlement over bad loans an extra three months to consider
signing onto the deal. </p>
<p>The deadline was extended to June 16, according to a letter
posted to a website for the settlement. Trustees including Bank
of New York Mellon Corp., Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)
had asked the New York-based bank for the change in a letter
dated March 4. Stephen Cutler, JPMorgan''s general counsel,
agreed to the request, the document shows. </p>
<p>The previous deadline was March 16, according to an earlier
letter. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s tentative deal to offer payments to bond
investors for mortgages that failed to match their promised
quality is part of an effort by the largest U.S. bank to move
past legal troubles tied in part to the housing crisis. The
accord was announced in November during the week before the
company agreed to a record $13 billion settlement with
government agencies over faulty mortgage securities. </p>
<p>Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan, confirmed that
the deadline was pushed back and declined to comment further. </p>
<p>The $4.5 billion proposed accord was negotiated between
JPMorgan and 21 institutional investors including BlackRock Inc. (BLK)
and Pacific Investment Management Co. Trustees representing all
investors in individual transactions must accept the deal. Hedge
fund Fir Tree Partners has said it will seek to continue
separate lawsuits over some of the securities. </p>
<p>Kathy Patrick, a lawyer at Gibbs  Bruns LLP representing

of Deutsche Bank and Jen Hibbard of Wells Fargo. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Financial
Officer Marianne Lake said the $27 billion profit outlook the
bank laid out at an investor conference last month wasn''t a
target and the firm can earn more than that. </p>
<p>That''s not a forecast, that''s not a budget, it''s a
simulation, and it was really predicated only on those things
that we''re really certain of, Lake said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview with Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker.
I think there''s every reason to believe that it''s biased to
the conservative. </p>
<p>The $27 billion outlook compares with net income of $17.9
billion last year and $21.3 billion in 2012. At the firm''s
investor day in 2013, JPMorgan presented a scenario in which
earnings could increase to $27.5 billion, while saying its
target was $24 billion. </p>
<p>This year''s outlook only factored in the impact of higher
interest rates and investments the firm has made in its business
over the past few years, Lake said. It didn''t include higher
trading revenue, even as the bank absolutely expects that
business to grow over the next five years, she said. </p>
<p>Lake also said that rising costs from regulation will be
somewhat permanent. Still, JPMorgan holds the best hand
among large banks and will continue to outperform rivals,
according to Lake. She declined to forecast the maximum the bank
could earn in the next few years. </p>

<p>Ginni Rometty, chief executive
officer of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), said the
company fell short of expectations last year and must address
its struggling hardware businesses. </p>
<p>We must acknowledge that while 2013 was an important year
of transformation, our performance did not meet our
expectations, Rometty, who is also chairman, said over the
weekend in a letter to investors in the company''s annual report.
While we continue to remix to higher value, we must also
address those parts of the business that are holding us back. </p>
<p>IBM has struggled in a shift to the cloud era, where data
and information are delivered online instead of being stored
onsite. Falling demand for hardware and weak sales in growth
markets have dragged down revenue for the last seven quarters,
prompting Rometty to sell assets, fire and furlough workers, buy
back shares and cut taxes to help meet profit goals. </p>
<p>The company announced today that Michael Eskew, the former
chairman and CEO of United Parcel Service Inc. who has been on
the IBM board since 2005, will become IBM''s first presiding
director on May 1. </p>
<p>In the newly created position, Eskew will serve as a
liaison between the chairman and independent directors and be
able to call meetings of independent directors, according to a
regulatory filing. The presiding director also will be available
to speak with major shareholders, if requested, after
discussions with Rometty. Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. is IBM''s largest shareholder. </p>
<h2>Leadership Structure </h2>
<p>Board members as a whole accepted the recommendation of
Mrs. Rometty and believe that this leadership structure will
provide the company with the continued benefits of combining the
leadership role of chairman and CEO, while also recognizing the
unique strengths and capabilities of IBM''s board members, the
company said in the filing. </p>
<p>IBM''s sales fell 5 percent last year, and the stock was the
only decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That led top
executives to forgo annual bonuses and shrink the company''s
headcount for the first time in a decade. </p>
<p>With no bonus, Rometty''s 2013 pay, calculated using U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission rules, fell 14 percent from a
year earlier to $14 million. On the recommendation of the
board''s compensation committee, IBM''s independent directors
approved a long-term incentive plan for Rometty of $12.75
million in performance-based stock awards for the period ending
in 2016. </p>
<p>The committee believes Mrs. Rometty performed well in
shifting investments into key segments of the portfolio and
advancing innovative solutions, creating a strong foundation for
transformation in 2014, the company said. </p>
<h2>Maintaining Goal </h2>
<p>Even as revenue has tumbled, Rometty reaffirmed IBM''s goal
of $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015 -- up from $11.67 in
2010, the letter said. </p>
<p>IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $186.39 at the close
in New York. </p>
<p>The CEO said the company will continue shifting its focus
to cloud services and data analytics while making changes to its
hardware products. The company agreed in January to sell most of
its low-end server business for $2.3 billion to Lenovo Group
Ltd. (992) </p>
<p>After buying cloud provider SoftLayer Technologies Inc.
last year for $2 billion, IBM is integrating existing hardware
and data analytics with its services. </p>
<p>IBM will use its Power Systems servers to help deliver its
Watson tool through the cloud, the company said last month. The
company is spending $1 billion on building a new business group
around the technology, which analyzes troves of information and
answers questions in plain English. </p>
<p>This follows a $1.2 billion commitment to bolster
SoftLayer''s cloud offerings by adding new data centers and an
expansion of the services to lure new customers as it faces off
with competitors like Amazon.com Inc. </p>

<p>Australia''s dollar has tumbled 15
percent from its high last year and strategists forecast more
pain ahead. For Goldman Sachs Group Inc., it''s the perfect time
to develop Sydney as a hub for trading local-currency assets. </p>
<p>Australia''s stable AAA credit rating makes it a haven and
encourages sovereign-wealth funds to allocate more money there,
said Simon Rothery, the chief executive officer of Goldman
Sachs''s operations in the country and neighboring New Zealand.
The New York-based firm moved its Australian credit derivatives
business from Hong Kong to Sydney last month after bringing over
bond and swaps trading last year, Rothery said. </p>
<p>The Aussie dollar is an ever more important part of
sovereign-wealth funds, central banks and global accounts,
Rothery said in a Feb. 27 interview in Sydney. Everybody wants
to play the China story, but you can''t get exposure directly so
people gain access through Australia. </p>
<p>In a sign of Australia''s rising prominence, the
International Monetary Fund began breaking out central banks''
holdings of the local dollar at the end of 2012. Before that, it
was lumped together in the organization''s other currencies
category. Offshore investors boosted their holdings of the
country''s government bonds -- the highest-yielding top-rated
sovereign securities -- by A$28 billion ($25 billion) in 2013,
to a record A$217.4 billion. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world''s fourth-largest energy producer by market value, reduced its 2017
production estimate and said it will sell $10 billion in assets
during the next three years. </p>
<p>Chevron lowered its production forecast by 6.1 percent as
it slows U.S. natural gas drilling and higher crude prices
reduce its share of production in some nations, the company said
during a presentation to analysts in New York today. The company
now sees output equivalent to 3.1 million barrels of crude a day
from a previous estimate of 3.3 million. Last year Chevron
produced the equivalent of 2.6 million barrels. </p>
<p>Lower-than-expected U.S. gas prices prompted the company to
curtail some drilling in Pennsylvania''s Marcellus Shale gas
formation, said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson. New discoveries and acquisitions only added enough oil
and gas to reserves to replace 85 percent of the company''s
production last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Our growth strategy remains intact, though some things
have changed, Watson said. Higher crude prices will also have
a negative impact on output under production agreements in some
nations that curb a company''s share as prices escalate, he said. </p>
<h2>Rising Production </h2>
<p>Chevron is spending $39.8 billion this year on gas-export
terminals, offshore crude platforms and other capital projects
to reverse a three-year drop in production. Chevron is alone
among the world''s three-largest energy companies in forecasting
a production increase this year. </p>
<p>Chevron''s 2017 output target assumes crude prices will
average about $110 a barrel, the San Ramon, California-based
company said in a slide presentation prepared for today''s
meeting with analysts. That compares with the $79 price
assumption that underlaid the prior forecast from March 2013. </p>
<p>The company plans to increase drilling in the U.S. Permian
Basin by 8.6 percent this year to 505 wells, according to the
slides. The company''s production from the formation that
straddles the Texas-New Mexico border will double by the end of
2020. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. is the world''s largest energy producer,
followed by Royal Dutch Shell Plc and PetroChina. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. analysts
see Bitcoin as an innovative payments technology while doubting
that it will evolve into a true alternative currency, according
to a research report released today. </p>
<p>In the report, titled All About Bitcoin, the
researchers write that they examined multiple views of the
digital currency by people inside and outside of Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>So where does that leave us? With the conclusion that
Bitcoin likely can''t work as a currency, but some sense that the
ledger-based technology that underlies it could hold promise,
the report said. </p>
<p>Bitcoin emerged from source code written by an anonymous
developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto
in 2009, and attracted a following motivated in part by the
ability to escape the strictures of traditional currency,
notably government control. The report by Goldman Sachs lends
credibility to the virtual currency, said Michael Terpin, co-founder of BitAngels, a group of angel investors in early stage
Bitcoin startups. </p>
<p>The tone overall is conservative and measured, Terpin
said of the report. People will read it and draw their own
conclusions. It''s nice they are paying attention to it, and
don''t have a Bitcoin-is-evil view. </p>
<h2>Biggest Hurdle </h2>
<p>Dominic Wilson and Jose Ursua, the researchers at Goldman
Sachs who wrote the report, said that the ability to pay for
goods and services using Bitcoin is growing, saying that
obstacles to Bitcoin being used more broadly in the payments
system are arguably not insurmountable. </p>
<p>Roman Leal, an analyst at Goldman Sachs covering
information-technology services, said Bitcoin''s biggest
hurdle will be maintaining its cost advantage in the face of
greater regulation, higher operating costs, and competition from
entrenched players. </p>
<p>While it is too early to tell how banks and payment
processors will react to the threat of Bitcoin, we believe that
it is only a matter of time before major incumbents develop a
digital currency strategy, Leal wrote. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, faces competition to its $3 billion arthritis pill
Celebrex in May after a federal judge invalidated a patent that
would have extended protection through December 2015. </p>
<p>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), Mylan Inc., and Lupin
Ltd. (LPC) were among the generic-drug makers who successfully argued
that New York-based Pfizer''s patent wasn''t different enough from
the one expiring in May. Pfizer will pursue all available
remedies, including an immediate appeal of the court''s
decision, the company said in a statement today. </p>
<p>Celebrex, which belongs to a class of drugs called COX-2
inhibitors, helps arthritis patients reduce pain by blocking a
chemical reaction in the body that causes inflammation. The
medicine had been projected to generate $2.5 billion between May
and when the 2015 patent was slated to expire, according to
sales estimates surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>It seems likely that odds are in favor of generics
launching early, said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. Pfizer''s earnings per share will be
cut by 4 percent this year and 8 percent in 2015 if copycats do
make it to market, he wrote in a note to clients. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the
world''s largest brokerage, said it will combine the municipal
bond trading desks of its institutional business and wealth-management units. </p>
<p>The joint venture will be run by Patrick Haskell, 42, head
of municipal securities for the firm''s fixed-income unit, and
Eric Benedict, who leads capital markets for the brokerage, the
New York-based bank said today in an internal memo, which was
obtained by Bloomberg News. Jim Wiggins, a Morgan Stanley
spokesman, confirmed the memo''s contents. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 55, has said
partnerships between the investment bank and brokerage will help
the firm double return on equity by this year. In 2013, Morgan
Stanley bought the remaining stake in the brokerage, which has
more than 16,000 advisers and $1.91 trillion of client assets. </p>
<p>For institutional and retail investors, the joint venture
will provide the broadest possible inventory and unmatched
purchasing power, according to the memo, written by Andy Saperstein, who oversees the brokerage''s investment products and
services unit, and fixed-income co-heads Michael Heaney and
Robert Rooney. Combining our municipal inventory in a single
balance sheet will enable us to enhance our risk-management
discipline across the organization. </p>
<h2>Market Rebounds </h2>
<p>The bank said in January 2013 that it had 35 initiatives to
combine efforts between the institutional and brokerage units.
In 2012, Morgan Stanley created a fixed-income sales group for
middle-market clients under Benedict and transferred some
customers from its investment bank to its wealth-management
division. </p>
<p>The $3.7 trillion municipal market has rebounded after
posting negative returns in 2013 for the first time since 2008.
State and local debt has gained 3.25 percent this year,
outpacing the 1.38 percent return on U.S. Treasuries and 2.27
percent on corporate securities, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

<p>Morgan Stanley appointed Nancy King
as head of its oil-liquids operations and made several senior
appointments after the bank agreed to sell its global oil
merchanting business to an OAO Rosneft (ROSN) subsidiary. </p>
<p>King, formerly chief risk officer at Morgan Stanley''s
commodities division, will lead its remaining oil liquids
business from New York, according to a memo obtained by
Bloomberg News. She reports to Colin Bryce and Simon Greenshields, the bank''s joint heads of commodities trading in
London and New York. Hugh Fraser, a Morgan Stanley spokesman in
London, confirmed the contents of the document. </p>
<p>Banks including JP Morgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley
are exiting or reducing their activities in commodity markets
amid lower revenue and more scrutiny from regulators.
Commodities revenue at the 10 largest investment banks dropped
18 percent to $4.5 billion last year from $5.5 billion in 2012,
according to analytics company Coalition Ltd. in London. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s sale to Rosneft, Russia''s largest oil
producer, includes inventory, storage deals, sale and supply
agreements and freight shipping contracts, the bank said in a
Dec. 20 statement. It didn''t disclose financial terms. About 100
front-office executives in the U.S., U.K. and Singapore will
move to Rosneft. That''s about one-third of Morgan Stanley''s
commodities front-office personnel. </p>
<h2>Rosneft Sale </h2>
<p>Of the remaining staff, Javier Bocos in London will become
the bank''s head of oil-liquids trading and marketing in Europe
and Singapore, according to the document. Jeffrey Sun will lead
oil-liquids trading in the U.S. Bocos and Sun were heads of oil
options in Europe and the U.S., respectively. </p>
<p>Brett Humphreys will become the department''s chief risk
officer after serving as deputy CRO. Martin Mitchell will become
head of regulatory affairs, adding to his role as the unit''s

<p>Thomas Lee, the JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) chief equity strategist who has called for gains in American
stocks (SPX) for six straight years and got them in four, is leaving
the firm. </p>
<p>Lee, 44, is stepping down tomorrow after holding the job
since 2007, Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New York-based
firm, said in a telephone interview. Lee wants to take time away
from work, according to a memo sent to employees. </p>
<p>Lee, who worked for JPMorgan for 15 years, is among almost
two dozen Wall Street strategists who try to predict the
direction of the stock market and advise investors on which
companies to buy and sell. He had one of the highest year-end
forecasts for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index, telling investors
last week to stay bullish and buy health-care, technology and
financial stocks. </p>
<p>He''s just one of the best strategists in the game,
Philip Orlando, who helps oversee nearly $400 billion as chief
equity-market strategist at Federated Investors Inc., said in a
phone interview. I''m surprised and disappointed that a young
guy at the top of his game would be resigning. </p>
<p>Lee, a managing director at the largest U.S. bank, didn''t
respond to a telephone call seeking comment. </p>
<h2>Always Bullish </h2>
<p>He was bullish at the start of each of six full years as
chief equity strategist, forecasting an average annual rise of
14 percent in the SP 500 over the period. He was more accurate
than the average of strategist forecasts in four of the six
years, including 2012 and 2013. </p>
<p>Like every one of his competitors tracked by Bloomberg, Lee
failed to foresee the stock-market decline in 2008. He called
for an 8.3 percent increase in the SP 500 that year. The
benchmark gauge plummeted 38 percent in its worst annual
performance since the Great Depression. </p>
<p>Before taking the strategist job, he covered the wireless
and telecommunications industry from 1999 to 2007 and added
small-cap stocks in 2004, being recognized by Institutional
Investor magazine every year since 1998, according to the memo. </p>
<p>He held positions at Oppenheimer  Co., Kidder Peabody 
Co. and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. He received a bachelor''s
degree in economics in 1991 from the Wharton School at the
University of Pennsylvania with dual concentrations in finance
and accounting. </p>
<h2>Good Reputation'' </h2>
<p>He has a good reputation, Hugh Johnson, who oversees $2
billion as chairman of Albany, New York-based Hugh Johnson
Advisors LLC. Strategists are helpful in thinking about
issues, he said. They can tell you what the issues are and
give you interesting ways to analyze the issues. </p>
<p>The SP 500 will probably end the year at 2,075, Lee said
in a March 7 report. Only Weeden  Co. and Canaccord Genuity
Securities LLC have higher estimates, according to a survey
compiled by Bloomberg of 21 strategists. </p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, Lee stuck to his bullish
stance even as the SP 500 slid as much as 5.8 percent in
February. He was ultimately proved correct as the equities
benchmark recovered the losses by the end of the month. </p>
<p>His predictions during the rebound were more accurate. His
target of 1,100 for the U.S. equity benchmark in 2009 was only
off by 15 points. </p>
<p>His viewpoints have been very much on the money and he
will do well wherever he goes, John Manley, who helps oversee
about $233 billion as chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo
Funds Management in New York, said in a phone interview.
Hopefully, he reappears somewhere else. </p>

<p>Wind Point Partners LP is near an
agreement to sell snack maker Hearthside Food Solutions LLC to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s private-equity arm and Vestar Capital
Partners Inc. for about $1.1 billion, people with knowledge of
the matter said. </p>
<p>The deal may be announced as soon as tomorrow, said the
people, asking not to be identified discussing private
information. BC Partners Holdings Ltd. and Oak Hill Capital
Partners LP also made offers for the business, people said
earlier this month. </p>
<p>Hearthside, which makes snacks including pretzels and
cookies sold under consumer-product companies'' brand names, was
acquired by Wind Point in 2009. The company sold its ready-to-eat cereals and granola-making business to Post Holdings Inc.
last year, according to its website. Barclays Plc started an
auction for Downers Grove, Illinois-based Hearthside late last
year, the people said. </p>
<p>Andrea Raphael, a New York-based spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs declined to comment on its interest in Hearthside as did
Carol Makovich, a spokeswoman for Vestar. Marc Hazelton a
spokesman for Barclays also declined to comment, while officials
at Wind Point couldn''t immediately be reached. </p>
<p>Vestar was part of a group of buyout funds that acquired
Del Monte Foods Co. in a $5.3 billion deal in 2011. Vestar also
acquired a stake in grocery wholesaler American Roland Foods
Corp. in August and has owned consumer brands including Birds
Eye Foods and Celstial Seasonings. </p>

<p>Elizabeth Buse, a top executive at
Visa (V) Inc. who previously ran most of the firm''s international
business, is leaving after more than 16 years. </p>
<p>Buse, 53, was most recently the head of the global-solutions group, Foster City, California-based Visa said today
in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Buse is retiring March 31, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Throughout her career, Elizabeth has worked tirelessly to
build a stronger, more effective and engaged Visa, Chief
Executive Officer Charlie Scharf, 48, said in a statement. I
am thankful for the foundation she has created for us to work
from and wish her well. </p>
<p>Visa also said today that Ramon Martin, a former president
of merchant services at American Express Co. (AXP), will be joining
the firm. Martin will lead work related to merchant products
that Buse previously did, according to a person familiar with
the matter who asked not to be identified because the plans are
private. </p>
<p>Buse was appointed to her role in the new global-solutions
unit in May. She started her career at Visa in the product-organization group and was the first executive to oversee the
firm''s business in the Asia Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe,
Middle East and Africa regions, the filing said. </p>
<p>Shares of Visa fell 2.3 percent to $220.83 at 3:28 p.m. in
New York. They have decreased less than 1 percent this year, and
were the sixth-best performer in the 30-company Dow Jones
Industrial Average for 2013, rising 47 percent. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) discovered
pricing errors in the firm''s dark pool trading venue and sent
checks to customers to compensate for the mistakes, according to
people with direct knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>The bank sent the money to clients and other Wall Street
firms that use its Sigma X pool for equity trades made in August
2011, said the people, who requested anonymity because the
communications and payments aren''t public. Concerns that Greece
would default on its debt that month led to a sharp decline in
stock markets and dramatic price swings. </p>
<p>While the refunds probably weren''t large relative to
Goldman Sachs''s trading revenue, the errors show the potential
risks to operators of dark pools, which were created to let
major investors trade big blocks of stock without having news of
the orders move prices. Sigma X is one of the largest dark pools
in the U.S., accounting for 1 percent of total daily trading in
January, data from Rosenblatt Securities Inc. show. </p>
<p>The refunds were sent to customers whose trades were
executed at a certain point beyond the national best bid and
offer, according to one of the recipients. Stock venues in the
U.S. are obliged to price trades at the NBBO or better. Goldman
Sachs appears to have taken the action voluntarily. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Asset Management is
reducing its holdings of Europe''s higher-yielding debt as it
bets a rally in the bonds is ending. </p>
<p>Gains have sent yields from Greece to Spain tumbling to the
lowest since at least 2010 this month as data from gross
domestic product to manufacturing output add to evidence the
euro-area recovery is gathering pace. The rally has pushed the
securities to levels that are no longer good value for
investors, according to JPMorgan London-based money manager
Talib Sheikh. </p>
<p>A year ago we were pounding the table that European
peripheral debt was really cheap, Sheikh said in an interview
on Bloomberg Television''s Countdown with Anna Edwards and
Mark Barton. With valuations where they are it''s hard to make
the case that peripheral bonds look a buying opportunity here so
we''ve been reducing our exposure pretty aggressively into this
rally. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Asset Management oversees the equivalent of $1.6
trillion. </p>
<p>Italy''s 10-year bond yield fell to 3.36 percent on March
10, the lowest level since October 2005. The additional yield
investors demand to hold the securities over similar-maturity
German bunds slid to 173 basis points on March 11, the least
since June 2011. </p>
<p>The rate on Spanish bonds due in April 2024 dropped to an
eight-year low of 3.30 percent on March 10, reducing the
security''s yield spread over bunds to 165 basis points. That''s
the lowest level since October 2010. </p>
<p>While these spreads can narrow further it''s hard to say
that there''s real value in those bonds any more, Sheikh said. </p>
<p>Spanish bonds have returned 5.2 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italy''s have gained
4.4 percent and Greece''s have surged 17 percent. German
securities have earned 2.3 percent. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), the
insurer that is part of the investor group that owns 22.4
percent of Telecom Italia SpA (TIT), plans to exit its holding as
early as June, Chief Executive Officer Mario Greco said. </p>
<p>We have two exit windows, one in June 2014 and one in
February 2015, Greco said today during a conference call as
Generali announced another writedown in its Telecom Italia
stake. It''s likely that we will exit in June''s window. </p>
<p>Generali owns a 19.3 percent stake in Telco SpA, the
investor group that controls the board of Milan-based Telecom
Italia, suggesting its holding in Italy''s largest phone company
is about 4.3 percent. A stake of that size is worth about 500
million euros ($700 million) based on today''s trading. </p>
<p>The insurer is likely to sell the stake on the market or
directly to another investor, said Carlo Alberto Carnevale Maffe, a professor of business strategy at Milan''s Bocconi
University. Generali could join the other Italian shareholders
of Telco, Intesa Sanpaolo SpA and Mediobanca SpA, to sell their
stakes to the same buyer, Carnevale Maffe said. Officials at
Mediobanca and Intesa declined to comment. </p>
<p>Spain''s Telefonica SA (TEF), the largest shareholder in Telco, is
unlikely to buy Generali''s stake because of regulatory hurdles,
Carnevale Maffe said. Brazil''s antitrust authorities fined
Telefonica in December and ordered it to reduce its Brazilian
holdings or convince Telecom Italia to sell its local unit.
Telefonica and Telecom Italia both own phone carriers in Brazil,
and together control more than half of its wireless market. </p>
<p>A representative for Madrid-based Telefonica, Spain''s
largest phone company, declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Shareholder Pact </h2>
<p>Generali wrote down the value of its Telecom Italia holding
to 72 cents a share last quarter. Telecom Italia shares rose 0.7
percent to 81.2 cents at 12:37 p.m. in Milan. </p>
<p>An exit by any of the Telco partners would unravel a 2007
shareholder pact that put Italy''s biggest phone company under
the control of Telefonica and the Italian financial investors.
They have written down their stakes in Telecom Italia multiple
times over the years as intensifying competition has hurt sales,
earnings and the phone company''s stock price. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (UCG), Italy''s
biggest insurer, reported a fourth-quarter profit after booking
a loss a year earlier on writedowns of equity holdings. The
insurer more than doubled its dividend. </p>
<p>Net income was 324 million euros ($452 million) compared
with a net loss of 1.04 billion euros a year before, when
Generali wrote down stakes in companies by 1.3 billion euros.
Profit missed the 604 million-euro average estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>In 2014, the debt will be reduced further and significant
cost savings will be achieved, Chief Executive Officer Mario Greco said in the statement. We estimate to improve the
operating result and the net profit further, in line with the
plan. </p>
<p>Greco, who took over as CEO in 2011, is selling assets and
focusing on the company''s main business to strengthen finances
and boost profitability. The insurer is more than half way to
reaching its goal of raising 4 billion euros from disposals by
2015, after the sale of its U.S. reinsurance unit and Mexican
businesses last year. </p>
<h2>Dividend Raised </h2>
<p>Generali raised its dividend to 45 cents a share from 20
cents, the Trieste, Italy-based insurer said in a stock-exchange
statement. </p>
<p>Operating income fell 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter
from a year earlier to 859 million euros as income at the non-life business fell 40 percent to 291 million euros.      Claims
and costs as a proportion of premiums, known as the combined
ratio, improved to 95.6 percent in 2013. Life operating profit
increased 36 percent to 573 million euros. </p>
<p>Generali published mixed 2013 results below consensus
excluding the dividend, Raphael Caruso, an analyst at Raymond
James Euro Equities in Paris, wrote in a note today. Fourth-quarter results were impacted by a significantly higher than
expected combined ratio and some non-operating items, he said. </p>
<p>Generali rose 0.7 percent to 16.42 euros in Milan trading
as of 10:33 a.m. in Milan, giving the company a market value of
25.5 billion euros. The Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index was
little changed this year, compared with Generali''s 4 percent
decline. </p>
<h2>Telco Exit </h2>
<p>Results were driven by extraordinary items including
proceeds of disposals and the gain on the stake in the Bank of
Italy which have been offset by negative impacts from the Telco
SpA stake writedown and the goodwill writedown of BSI group,
Generali said in the statement. </p>
<p>Generali, which owns 19.3 percent stake in Telco, the
holding controlling Telecom Italia SpA (TIT), wrote down its stake by
189 million euros in the fourth quarter. The insurer plans to
exit its holding as early as June, Greco said during a
conference call today. </p>
<p>We wrote down the stake at Telecom''s market value at the
end of December, as it''s likely that we will exit Telecom in
June, Greco said. We have two exit windows, one in June 2014
and one in February 2015. </p>
<p>Madrid-based Telefonica SA, Spain''s biggest phone company,
is the largest shareholder in Telco and agreed to increase its
stake last year. </p>
<h2>BSI Sale </h2>
<p>The CEO is confident to sell Swiss asset-management unit
BSI Group as part of his disposal plan to boost capital. The
sale is easier now, after rules on U.S. clients treatment are
clarified, he said, without disclosing details on talks.
Generali wrote down the company''s value by 217 million euros in
the quarter. </p>
<p>Generali''s solvency ratio, a measure of its capacity to
absorb losses, fell to 141 percent by Dec. 31 from 143 percent
in September, the insurer said. At the end of February, the
ratio was about 150 percent, the company said. </p>

<p>ISS Holding A/S, the world''s
largest cleaning company, jumped as much as 13 percent in its
first day of trading in Denmark''s biggest initial public
offering in 20 years. </p>
<p>ISS''s new shares traded as high as 180 kroner in
Copenhagen, compared with the IPO price of 160 kroner. The
initial price range set during the offer was 140 kroner to 175
kroner. ISS said it raised gross proceeds of 8.04 billion kroner
($1.5 billion). </p>
<p>The sale of ISS, whose owners include Goldman Sachs Capital
Partners and EQT Partners AB, will be the largest IPO in Denmark
since the 1994 listing of TDC A/S. Companies in Europe raised
$10 billion from listings so far this year, about three times
the amount in the same period in 2013, as investors bet on an
economic recovery. </p>
<p>ISS''s defensive business model gives new investors the
prospect of stable growth, stable earnings, a good cash-flow and
very solid dividends, Soeren Loentoft Hansen, an analyst with
Aabenraa, Denmark-based Sydbank A/S, said in a note. He''s
starting coverage of ISS with a buy recommendation, and sees
room for the shares to advance as much as 25 percent from the
IPO price. </p>
<h2>Existing Shares </h2>
<p>ISS''s new stock traded at 179.3 kroner at 9:59 a.m. in
Copenhagen with 4.09 million shares traded. </p>
<p>In addition to the 50.2 million new shares sold by ISS,
Goldman Sachs and EQT will sell 1 million existing shares. ISS
will have a market value of about 29.6 billion kroner, excluding
the value of treasury shares held by the company. </p>
<p>We have received very positive feedback from investors,
ISS Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gravenhorstsaid in today''s
statement. </p>
<p>U.K. retailers Poundland Group Plc and Pets at Home Ltd.
began trading yesterday after closing their sales early because
of high demand from investors. Poundland gained 23 percent, and
Pets at Home fell about 3 percent. </p>
<p>ISS said about 10 percent of its shares were allocated to
Danish retail investors while the rest went to institutional
investors. </p>
<p>ISS, based in Soeborg, Denmark, said on Feb. 18 it would
raise 8 billion kroner to repay debt. The company said on March
11 it would close the share sale early after receiving strong
demand. </p>
<p>The company, which has more than 530,000 employees, offers
facility management services in more than 50 countries. </p>
<p>ISS pulled an IPO in March 2011, citing market uncertainty.
Later that year, G4S Plc said it abandoned a takeover pursuit of

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, faces competition to its $3 billion arthritis pill
Celebrex in May after a federal judge invalidated a patent that
could have delayed generic versions of the medicine. </p>
<p>A patent expiring in December 2015 was invalid because it
wasn''t different enough from one ending in May, a federal judge
in Norfolk, Virginia, said yesterday in a victory for companies
including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), Mylan Inc., and
Lupin Ltd. (LPC) Pfizer will pursue all available remedies,
including an immediate appeal of the court''s decision, the
company said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Celebrex, which belongs to a class of drugs called COX-2
inhibitors, helps arthritis patients reduce pain by blocking a
chemical reaction in the body that causes inflammation. The
medicine had been projected to generate $2.5 billion between May
and when the 2015 patent was slated to expire, according to
sales estimates surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>It seems likely that odds are in favor of generics
launching early, said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. Pfizer''s earnings per share will be
cut by 4 percent this year and 8 percent in 2015 if copycats do
make it to market, he wrote in a note to clients. </p>
<p>There would be little to no impact to EPS from 2016
onwards because we have already been modeling generics in late
2015, Anderson said. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell 1.4 percent to $31.98 yesterday in New York. </p>
<h2>Reimburse Pfizer </h2>
<p>Actavis Plc (ACT) said it plans to begin selling a generic
Celebrex in May, as long as it gets regulatory approval. Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, said
the company is pleased with the decision. Officials with Mylan
didn''t immediately return messages seeking comment. </p>
<p>Should the generic-drug companies enter the market and
later lose the appeal, they could be ordered to reimburse Pfizer
for any profits it loses from the low-cost competition. </p>
<p>An appeals court in 2008 had invalidated the patent, saying
it just covers a method of administering a therapeutically
effective amount of the compounds covered by the patent that
ends in May. New York-based Pfizer asked the patent office to
reissue it with modifications to work around the appeals court
decision. </p>
<p>District Judge Arenda Wright Allen said that the
modification sought by Pfizer wasn''t allowed under the law, so
the Federal Circuit''s reasoning stands. </p>
<p>The case is G.D. Searle LLC v. Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
13cv121, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia (Norfolk). </p>

<p>U.S. energy regulators'' efforts to harden the power grid against snipers and terrorists are fueling a debate over whether they''re diverting resources from other threats, like cyber attacks. </p> <p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week ordered the power industry to identify critical facilities and come up with a plan to protect them from attack. </p> <p>My concern is that we don''t shift our focus and our resources, said John Norris, a FERC commissioner who voted for the order while cautioning against overreacting to the sniper attack last year on a power substation in California. The rush to do this seems to be based on a very incomplete set of facts about what happened. </p> <p>As the electricity network has become increasingly dependent on software and the Internet, the utility industry has focused on combating potential cyber attacks. The April attack at PGE''s Metcalf substation near San Jose resurrected a 20th century threat -- an old-fashioned, military-style assault on the power network. </p> <p>Regulators are now trying to find the best way to guard against all threats to the generators, transformers and thousands of miles of high-voltage power lines that make up the U.S. electric grid. They''re also trying to encourage modernization of the aging network. </p> <h2>Microgrids, Upgrades </h2> <p>Norris said the U.S. should focus on technologies, like the development of microgrids, that can quickly isolate damaged components from the rest of the network in the event of an attack. Advanced technologies can also make better use of data to improve awareness of incidents affecting the grid, he said. </p> <p>You address multiple threats, not just physical threats, Norris said. At at FERC meeting on Feb. 20, he said, Our future is in a much smarter and more nimble grid. </p> <p>Former FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff for years has warned that the grid''s most critical components, such as transformers that adjust electrical voltage, are vulnerable and could be better protected with relatively simple measures, like improved fencing. </p> <p>An attack knocking out major critical components would result in catastrophic failure, potentially, of the interconnect, Wellinghoff said by phone. </p> <p>Wellinghoff said he also favors measures to prevent cyber attacks and other threats, and supports the FERC''s March 7 order. It requires the North American Electric Reliability Corp., a non-profit organization responsible for ensuring the reliability of the grid, to produce by June standards to guard against physical attacks. The standards should require utilities to identify their most critical components and show that they''re adequately protected. </p> <h2>Good Step'' </h2> <p>It was a good step to take, ultimately, Wellinghoff said. We''ll see what NERC does and how long it takes. </p> <p>NERC Chief Executive Officer Gerry Cauley said he shares Norris''s concerns about overreaction to the California attack, while other incidents, from ice storms to potential cyber attacks also pose threats, and utilities will eventually pass along many costs to consumers. </p> <p>Where it could get really expensive and challenging is whether you need stronger barriers like walls and other protections around transformers, he said in a phone interview. You wonder which ones are so critical it would warrant that. </p> <p>Cauley said utilities can increase physical security by improving existing protections like lighting, cameras, surveillance equipment and key-card access at substations. The California incident showed that companies need to be concerned about the line-of-sight for potential shooters, he said. </p> <p>I would like the standard to drive a more heightened look than what we''ve seen in the past, Cauley said. </p> <h2>FERC Steps </h2> <p>After rifle-toting attackers shot up PGE''s Metcalf substation near San Jose on April 16, the FERC provided the industry with a list of steps to improve security at substations, said Tom Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, a Washington-based industry group for publicly traded utilities including Duke Energy Corp. and Exelon Corp. </p> <p>The list hasn''t been made public. FERC spokeswoman Mary O''Driscoll declined to acknowledge its existence. EEI spokesman Jeff Ostermayer said in an e-mail he couldn''t provide the list for operational security reasons. </p> <p>Disabling as few as nine electricity substations and destroying a transformer manufacturer could plunge the nation into a blackout that would last for 18 months, the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday, citing an internal FERC report. </p> <h2>Homeland Security </h2> <p>Acting FERC Chairman Cheryl LaFleur didn''t deny the existence of the report, though she said in a statement that publishing sensitive information crosses the line from transparency to irresponsibility, and gives those who would do us harm a roadmap to achieve malicious designs. </p> <p>Executives from the power industry in recent months have met at least 10 times with officials from the U.S. Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation and local law-enforcement agencies to discuss improving security at electric substations, Kuhn told editors and reporters at Bloomberg''s New York headquarters last month. </p> <p>He said safety measures include outfitting grid components with additional security technologies and establishing closer ties with local police. In November, more than 2,000 representatives from utilities and government agencies participated in a NERC-run, grid-security exercise. </p> <p>I don''t think we could be taking it any more seriously, Kuhn said. </p> <h2>PGE Spending </h2> <p>San Francisco-based PGE plans to spend $100 million in the next four years to bolster its network against further attacks, said Brian Swanson, a company spokesman. While the April attack disabled transformers at the substation, the company was able to prevent customers from losing power, he said. The utility has since worked with law enforcement to increase patrols and deployed security guards to provide a round-the-clock presence at critical units, Swanson said. </p> <p>I can''t get into every security measure we''re doing, he said in a phone interview. Swanson did say PGE is building buffer zones around major substations with opaque fencing; it has removed vegetation to eliminate potential hiding places for would-be attackers; and it has installed more lighting, cameras and security systems to detect intruders. </p> <p>The industry''s focus is risk management, not risk elimination, Courtney Nogas, a spokeswoman for Washington-based Pepco Holdings Inc., said in an e-mail. Pepco has in place multiple layers of protections for its network, she said, while declining to say what steps the company has taken for security reasons. </p> <h2>Dominion''s Plan </h2> <p>Dominion Resources Inc., Virginia''s largest power company, said it plans to spend as much as $500 million during the next five to 10 years to improve physical security at its power stations. The upgrades include two layers of perimeter security, fences that can''t be climbed and card-key access for its substation yards, the company said in a publication for investors this month. </p> <p>Ultimately, the steps industry and regulators take to guard against physical attacks will be a balancing act between securing the grid and shielding consumers from high costs. The FERC must approve rate changes resulting from investments to the generators and high-voltage power lines that make up the bulk-electric network. </p> <p>The U.S. should remain vigilant about other threats, including natural disasters, cyber attack and geomagnetic disturbances as it considers these expenses, Norris said in his statement supporting FERC''s order. </p> <p>We simply cannot erect enough barriers to protect North America''s over 400,000 circuit miles of transmission, and 55,000 substations, he wrote, acknowledging that some substations may need more physical barriers. </p> <p>According to Wellinghoff, there are probably fewer than 100 power substations, primarily in rural areas, that are most critical to the network and may need heightened protection. While costs would vary among substations, the expense would be minimal if spread among taxpayers, he said. </p> <p>They should be spread over everybody because it affects everybody, he said. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Joel Rosenblatt" date="Mar 15, 2014 12:23 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-15/general-motors-sued-in-texas-over-ignition-switch-defects.html"><headline>General Motors Sued in Texas Over Ignition-Switch Defects</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>General Motors Co. (GM) was sued on
behalf of vehicle owners over an ignition flaw in some small-model cars as it faces regulators'' questions about this year''s
recall of 1.6 million vehicles. </p>
<p>Bob Hilliard, one of the lawyers who filed the complaint
yesterday in federal court in Corpus Christi, Texas, said he
seeks to recover $6 billion to $10 billion for the lost value of
cars affected by the recall. The suit is based on claims GM
concealed the defects and the diminution in value of the
owners'' vehicles, and not deaths resulting from crashes when the
engines stopped because keys came loose. </p>
<p>These vehicles, all they have to do is get on the road
for this defect to manifest, Hilliard said in a phone
interview. This is a true safety defect. </p>
<p>GM has said it identified 12 deaths in connection with the
recall of models made in the mid-2000s, including some Chevrolet
Cobalts and HHRs and other Opel, Pontiac and Saturn models.
Detroit-based GM, the largest U.S. automaker, has said it''s
continuing to review data and information related to the recall. </p>
<p>The GM recall and the multiple U.S. investigations that it
has spurred come as the company has sought to shed the
Government Motors stigma tied to its bankruptcy and
$49.5 billion U.S. bailout. Those investigating the company
include the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the Justice
Department and the Transportation Department. </p>
<p>GM has fallen 4.1 percent since Feb. 12, the day before the
first of the ignition-switch recalls were announced. It was
unchanged yesterday at $34.09 in trading in New York. </p>
<h2>Peace of Mind'' </h2>
<p>GM is focused now on ensuring the safety and peace of
mind of our customers involved in the recall, Greg Martin, a
company spokesman, said in an e-mail responding to a request for
comment on Hilliard''s lawsuit. Our principle throughout this
process has been to the put the customer first, and that will
continue to guide us. </p>
<p>The complaint filed by Hilliard seeks class-action status
to represent all vehicle owners affected by the recall. The
named plaintiffs in the case are Daryl and Maria Brandt of
Nueces County, Texas, who own a 2007 Chevy Cobalt, one of the
recalled vehicles. </p>
<p>Hilliard  also represents the families of two teenagers who
died in a 2006 crash of a Cobalt in Wisconsin. He said in an
interview earlier this week about that claim that GM''s
bankruptcy reorganization shouldn''t shield it from liability for
the pre-2009 crash. While bankruptcy typically protects
companies from new claims that predate the reorganization, GM
didn''t present the full extent of its ignition-switch
liabilities, Hilliard said. </p>
<h2>Liability Shield </h2>
<p>If you are aware of potential exposure to litigation and
you don''t reveal it, that''s fraud, he said. I''m going to go
back to that bankruptcy judge and say, You have to undo this,
the liability of old GM, because it was the new GM''s continued
coverup after the bankruptcy that allowed people to be hurt or
killed.'' </p>
<p>To persuade U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber in
Manhattan to reconsider the terms of GM''s reorganization,
Hilliard or other lawyers would need to gather evidence and
prove that the old GM had knowingly deceived the judge, said
Chip Bowles, a bankruptcy lawyer with Bingham Greenebaum Doll
LLP who wasn''t involved in the GM liquidation. </p>
<p>A few bankruptcy cases have been set aside for fraud on
the court, but you have to establish deliberate fraud and
concealment, said Bowles, who writes articles on bankruptcy
issues. </p>
<p>Gerber earlier this week declined to comment on past or
pending cases. </p>
<h2>Toyota Case </h2>
<p>In 2010, Hilliard filed one of at least 10 wrongful death
lawsuits against Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) over claims its cars
suffered from a defect that caused sudden, unintended
acceleration. </p>
<p>Since the U.S. sold its last GM shares in December, the
company has named Mary Barra as chief executive officer, making
her the first woman to lead a major automaker. A lineup of new
vehicles helped improve GM''s reputation among consumers and
boosted quality to record levels, according to reviewers
including J.D. Power  Associates and Consumer Reports magazine. </p>
<p>The cars recalled were the 2003-07 Saturn Ion, 2005-07
Chevrolet Cobalt, 2006-07 Chevy HHR, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice,
2007 Saturn Sky, 2007 Pontiac G5, 2005-06 Pontiac Pursuit in
Canada and 2007 Open GT in Europe. </p>
<p>As early as 2004, two GM engineers involved in the Cobalt
said there had been discussions about how the model''s engines
could cut out when the keys were bumped, according to documents
and depositions gathered in a lawsuit over a 2010 crash that
killed a Georgia pediatric nurse. </p>
<p>The case is Brandt v. General Motors LLC, 14-cv-00079, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Corpus Christie). </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) sold $5.5 billion
in its biggest bond offering on record as the world''s largest

hiatus from the U.S. bond market. </p>
<p>Exxon, which commands top AAA credit ratings from Moody''s
Investors Service and Standard  Poor''s, issued fixed- and
floating-rate notes in a five-part sale. The Irving, Texas-based
company may use proceeds to finance capital spending, for
acquisitions and to refinance commercial paper borrowings,
according to a regulatory filing today. </p>
<p>The new securities will add to the company''s $22.7 billion
of total debt, which accounted for about 39 percent of its
trailing 12-month cash flow at year-end, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That''s a lower leverage level than the
71-percent ratio at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which has similar rankings
of Aaa at Moody''s and AAA at SP. </p>
<p>Exxon sold $1 billion of 10-year, 3.176 percent coupon
bonds that yield 48 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $1.75 billion of five-year debt with a 1.819 percent
coupon and a yield spread of 25 basis points and $1.5 billion of
three-year, 0.921 percent debt that pays 15 basis points more
than benchmarks. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>The deal also includes $750 million of three-year floating-rate securities that pay four basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate and $500 million of five-year floating-rate debt yielding 15 basis points more than that
benchmark. Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow
from one another, was set at 0.23 percent today. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) are set for a fee bonanza with both banks playing roles on
the sale of Vivendi SA (VIV)''s French wireless unit, and Vodafone
Group Plc (VOD)''s purchase of a Spanish cable company. </p>
<p>The New York-based banks are advisers on Altice SA (ATC)''s effort
to acquire Vivendi''s SFR unit in a $28 billion deal, and also
Vodafone''s agreement to buy Grupo Corporativo Ono SA for $10
billion. If completed, the SFR purchase will be the second-largest globally this year, and the two transactions could
generate as much as $173 million in advisory fees for Morgan
Stanley, JP Morgan and other banks, according to estimates from
New York-based research firm Freeman  Co. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan are currently the top advisers
so far this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Dealmakers
are having their strongest start to the year since before the
global financial crisis amid growing economic confidence and
rising share prices. Deals in technology, media and
telecommunications continue to drive overall activity, with five
of the top 10 being in that space, including the proposed SFR
purchase, the data show. </p>
<p>Vivendi is in exclusive talks with Altice to sell for an
enterprise value of 20 billion euros, or $28 billion, according
to its billionaire owner Patrick Drahi. A deal could be
completed by the end of the month, Drahi said today. </p>
<p>If that deal closes, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley could
split as much as $52 million as advisers to Altice, while
Vivendi''s banks Citigroup Inc. and Lazard Ltd. could share as
much as $59 million, according to Freeman estimates. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, JPMorgan will share in up to $35 million of fees
with three other banks that advised Ono on its 7.2 billion euro
sale to Vodafone. Deutsche Bank AG was the lead adviser to Ono''s
shareholders, and Bank of America Corp. and UBS AG were co-advisers along with JPMorgan. </p>

<p>Investors should bet the pound will
strengthen against the dollar before the release of Bank of
England minutes, U.K. employment data and the budget this week,
according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Sterling is poised to gain as the March 5-6 minutes may
show policy makers believe the recovery has room to quicken due
to spare capacity, strategists led by head of global currency
strategy Hans Redeker in London wrote in a note to clients.
Morgan Stanley recommends investors buy the currency at $1.6650
with a target of $1.6950 and an order to exit the trade if it
weakens to $1.6560. The pound was little changed today, while
U.K. government bonds fell as tensions surrounding Crimea eased. </p>
<p>We expect the pound to gain some support during the
week, wrote the analysts at Morgan Stanley, one of the 10
biggest foreign-exchange traders according to a European
Institutional Investor Plc survey. We could see some of the
more hawkish views, regarding slack in the economy, starting to
become apparent in the minutes, which should provide sterling
with some support. The pound could also gain from some safe-haven flows in the expected risk-off environment. </p>
<p>The pound traded at $1.6645 at 4:18 p.m. London time after
advancing to $1.6823 on Feb. 17, the strongest level since
November 2009. The U.K. currency declined 0.2 percent to 83.69
pence per euro. </p>
<h2>Unemployment Rate </h2>
<p>The U.K. jobless rate will stay at 7.2 percent in the three
months through January, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists before the data is released on Wednesday. The level
has fallen from 7.8 percent a year ago. The central bank led by
Governor Mark Carney will release its minutes on the same day. </p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne plans to spur
construction in his budget by extending the Help-to-Buy program
for new homes to 2020 and fostering the expansion of a commuter
town southeast of London, according to a Treasury statement
yesterday. The budget will also take place on Wednesday. </p>
<p>The pound has weakened against all 16 of its major
counterparts this month as the Bank of England''s guidance on the
future path of interest rates has weighed against data that
suggests the recovery is strengthening. </p>
<p>We have provided guidance about how we think interest
rates will adjust, when the time comes to adjust them; in other
words, in a gradual, and to a limited extent, Carney said at a
hearing of the Treasury Committee in London on March 11. We''re
not complacent about the recovery. </p>
<h2>Strongest Growth </h2>
<p>Surveys indicate U.K. output growth is stronger than
official data suggests, central bank policy maker Charles Bean
said last week. Manufacturing, services and construction
activity all expanded in February, according to reports
published this month based on surveys of purchasing managers. </p>
<p>We''ve had a lot of fairly robust data and the Bank of
England is saying don''t get too carried away by this, said
Steve Barrow, head of Group-of-10 research at Standard Bank Plc
in London. That has acted as a bit of a counterweight to the
decent data we''ve had. </p>
<p>Standard Bank said its recommended portfolio has placed a
bet the pound will weaken against the dollar, with a target of
$1.6455, saying the indicators it uses to make predictions have

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) says
investors should favor debt from better quality companies, after
yield premiums jumped the most in almost six months last week. </p>
<p>The headlines from China and emerging markets have caused
volatility in the Asia credit market, analysts led by Hong
Kong-based Kenneth Ho wrote in a March 15 note. We think
investors should look at stronger quality corporates. </p>
<p>The cost to borrow in dollars for companies in Asia outside
Japan climbed 11.1 basis points last week, the most since the
period ended Sept. 27, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.
indexes. Bond risk in the region advanced, with a gauge of 40
investment-grade issuers gaining 8.5 basis points, the most in
seven weeks. </p>
<p>Emerging-market investors from Europe have mixed views on
Asia, according to Goldman Sachs. Defaults in China, where
Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science  Technology Co. failed to
fully pay a debt coupon earlier this month, are contributing to
caution, the analysts wrote. China bond funds extended their
longest streak of outflows since early in the third quarter of
2013 in the week to March 12, EPFR Global said in an e-mailed
report dated March 14. </p>
<p>Risk appetite weakened amid slowing Chinese industrial
output and emerging-market uncertainty, Goldman Sachs said.
Factory production rose 8.6 percent in January and February from
a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said last
week, the weakest start to a year since 2009. Voters in Crimea
chose to become part of Russia in a referendum deemed illegal by
the European Union and the U.S. </p>
<h2>India, Indonesia </h2>
<p>Although China high yield, especially the real estate
sector, has underperformed this year, we think it''s too early to
turn positive as we expect more credit differentiation and more
headline news on defaults to come, Ho said in the note. We
also maintain our preference for better quality corporates and
banks in India and Indonesia. </p>
<p>The Markit iTraxx Asia index climbed 1.5 basis points to
135.5 basis points as of 8:54 a.m. in Singapore, Standard
Chartered Plc prices show. The measure is set for its highest
close since March 3, according to data provider CMA. </p>
<p>The Markit iTraxx Australia gauge rose 1 basis point to
107.5 as of 11:00 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd. The benchmark is on course to match its
highest close since Feb. 4, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. </p>
<p>The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 81
basis points as of 9:00 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. </p>
<p>Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite. </p>
<p>The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) reached a
compromise with shareholders, saying it will split the roles of
chairman and chief executive officer in the future under what
the company called normal circumstances. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, amended
governance guidelines that already say the chairman will be an
independent director, unless the board decides the best
interests of shareholders would be otherwise better served,
according to a regulatory filing today. The change outlines
steps to be taken when the chairman isn''t independent. </p>
<p>The move averted a showdown at Disney''s annual meeting,
held today in Portland, Oregon, and led by Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger. A group of investors had sought a
shareholder vote on a measure to let owners of 3 percent or more
of the stock nominate board candidates. That plan was withdrawn
after talks with the company, according to the filing. </p>
<p>The proposal was submitted by Hermes Equity Ownership
Services, the California State Teachers Retirement System and
the Connecticut Retirement Plans  Trust Funds, according to a
January filing by Burbank, California-based Disney. They cited
the board''s decision to make Iger chairman and CEO. </p>
<p>Connecticut expressly reserves its rights to re-file the
resolution for the 2015 proxy season, if the engagement between
the co-filers and Disney does not continue to demonstrate
transparency on board leadership issues, state Treasurer
Denise L. Nappier said in a statement. </p>
<h2>Annual Review </h2>
<p>In its filing today, Disney said that, when the chairman
isn''t independent, it will evaluate the arrangement annually and
include a written explanation in proxy materials. </p>
<p>Iger, 63, has been CEO since 2005 and added the role of
chairman in 2012. The board has turned back calls to split the
positions in previous years. Disney appointed an independent
chairman in 2004 amid a shareholder revolt against then-CEO
Michael Eisner. </p>
<p>At today''s meeting, investors voted 80 percent in favor of
the company''s executive compensation plan, an increase from less
than 60 percent the past two years. They also rejected a
shareholder proposal to limit accelerated executive pay in the
event of a change in control. </p>
<p>Iger earned $34.3 million in total compensation in fiscal
2013, a 15 percent decline as Disney failed to beat its targets
as handily as in the prior year. The company posted record sales
and profit for the third straight year. </p>
<h2>Adviser''s Take </h2>
<p>Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., an advisory firm,
recommended that investors back the executive pay plan this year
after suggesting they reject it in 2013. </p>
<p>CEO pay and company performance are reasonably aligned
for the year in review, and CEO total pay decreased, for the
first time since 2009, ISS said in a Feb. 25 report. The
company has engaged with shareholders to seek input following
notable investor dissent to the say-on-pay proposal last year. </p>
<p>So-called say-on-pay proposals, required by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, give shareholders a
nonbinding advisory vote on executive pay. </p>
<p>At the meeting, Iger said the company plans a pirate-themed
land in Shanghai Disneyland when it opens at the end of 2015. He
announced a third installment to Cars, the Pixar film
series, and said the Star Wars picture scheduled for 2015
will take place 30 years after Return of the Jedi. </p>
<p>Disney rose 0.7 percent to $81.99 at the close in New York.
The stock has advanced 7.3 percent this year. </p>

<p>Financing arrangments in China
using commodities from copper to rubber as collateral to obtain
credit may be unwound in 12 to 24 months, driven by increased
yuan volatility, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>As much as 1 million metric tons of copper and 30 million
tons of iron ore could be released if the deals unwind, the bank
said in a report today. The unwinding would be bearish given
relatively limited physical liquidity to absorb the shock,
analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote. For now, the deals remain
profitable and an abrupt government crackdown on them is
unlikely given the potential effect on the country''s economic
growth, they wrote. </p>
<p>Our view is that Chinese commodity financing deals will
gradually unwind over the medium term, driven by an increase in
foreign exchange hedging costs, which would slowly erode
financing deal profitability and eventually close the interest
rate arbitrage, the analysts wrote. </p>
<p>The transactions using commodities as collateral made as
much as $160 billion, or 31 percent of China''s total short-term
foreign-exchange loans, the report showed. Gold, copper and iron
ore are most commonly used as collateral, followed by soybeans,
palm oil, rubber, nickel, zinc and aluminum, the bank said. </p>
<h2>Hot Money'' </h2>
<p>We believe Chinese commodity financing deals are ongoing
and facilitating hot money'' inflows into China by providing a
mechanism to import low-cost foreign financing, the analysts
wrote. The deals create excess physical demand and tighten the
physical markets artificially; in contrast, an unwind creates
excess supply and thus is bearish to prices. </p>
<p>With the exception of iron ore, profitability of most
hedged arrangements remains substantial because of positive
yuan- and dollar-based interest-rate differentials, limited
depreciation of the yuan last month and abundant commodity
supply, which limits hedging costs, the bank said. Continued
weakening of the yuan may spur some of the deals to unwind
sooner than expected, it said. </p>
<p>China''s yuan had the biggest three-day decline since at
least 2007 on concern rising financial risks will weaken growth
in the world''s second-largest economy. The yuan has dropped 2.4
percent from a 20-year high of 6.0406 per dollar reached on Jan.
14, after strengthening 2.9 percent in 2013. </p>
<h2>1 Million Tons </h2>
<p>Returns from using copper as collateral are still more than
10 percent and up to 1 million tons of the metal may be tied to
such arrangements, Goldman Sachs said. That''s up from 500,000
tons nine months ago, it said. </p>
<p>Imports of copper and iron ore into China rose to records
in January on financing demand, before sliding in February as
the currency weakened and the state moved to rein in shadow
banking. About 40 percent of iron-ore stockpiles at Chinese
ports are linked to finance deals, Mysteel Research estimates. </p>
<p>Financing arrangements probably lie behind a surge in
Chinese gold imports from Hong Kong, Goldman Sachs said. The
deals involve physical imports of gold and exports of semi-fabricated products to bring foreign exchange into China,
according to the bank. </p>
<p>The number of commodities used for financing increased
since mid-2013 as the government cut the amount of money that
could be borrowed per commodity unit, Goldman Sachs said. Copper
financing may account for about $23 billion worth of short-term
foreign exchange loans, iron ore for $10.4 billion and soybeans
for $7.7 billion in a base case, the bank said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp.

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will sell its
physical commodities unit to Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. for $3.5
billion, ending a five-year foray into owning and storing raw
materials amid pressure from regulators to leave the business. </p>
<p>The deal, disclosed in a statement from New York-based
JPMorgan today, takes the bank out of industries such as
petroleum products and power while cementing Mercuria''s standing
among the world''s biggest commodity traders. JPMorgan will
continue to provide services and products tied to commodities
including financing, market-making and the vaulting and trading
of precious metals, the bank said. </p>
<p>Our goal from the outset was to find a buyer that was
interested in preserving the value of JPMorgan''s physical
business, Blythe Masters, head of the company''s global
commodities operations, said in the statement. Mercuria is a
global leader in the commodities markets and an excellent long-term home. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is selling amid concern among regulators that
banks could control prices if they own commodities as well as
trade them, or suffer catastrophic losses that would endanger
the financial system. The Federal Reserve said in July it might
force insured lenders to get out, and JPMorgan agreed later that
month to pay $410 million to settle claims that it manipulated
power markets, without admitting wrongdoing. </p>

The report will be posted on Exxon Mobil''s website by the end of March.</p><h2>Exxon Mobil''s Response
</h2><p>Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement at Arjuna Capital, said she was very impressed by Exxon Mobil''s responsiveness to the shareholder resolution.</p><p>In the past, they''ve been seen as a climate denier, Lamb told Bloomberg BNA. Exxon Mobil seems to be making more of an effort to engage with shareholders on climate change and related issues, in part because you can only hide under a rock for so long, she said.</p><p>Lamb said Exxon Mobil made a big move recently when it disclosed to CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, that it has included a carbon proxy cost in its long-term business plans since 2007. Exxon Mobil is one of about 30 companies in the U.S. that put an internal price on carbon pollution.</p><p>Exxon Mobil invests billions of dollars in energy projects which take decades to plan and execute, Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers told Bloomberg BNA in December. Although climate policies remain uncertain today, for the purposes of our business planning we assume that governments will continue to gradually adopt a wide variety of more stringent policies to help stem greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Exxon Mobil declined to comment on the shareholder resolution.</p><h2>Setting Standard
</h2><p>The agreement with Exxon Mobil has the potential to set a standard for other energy companies in terms of what kind of information is important to investors, Fugere said.</p><p>About 10 energy companies, including Chevron Corp., Hess Corp. and Anadarko Petroleum Corp., have received similar shareholder resolutions on carbon asset risk so far during the 2014 proxy season. Discussions with these companies are in various stages, with some proposals leaning toward withdrawals, while many of the other resolutions will likely go to a vote, Fugere said.</p><p>As You Sow filed the first shareholder resolution on carbon asset risk with CONSOL Energy last proxy season. The resolution went to a vote and received about 20 percent support, which is considered high among shareholder resolutions.</p><p>Since then, CONSOL has divested nearly half of its carbon-heavy coal holdings in favor of less carbon-intensive natural gas, which Fugere said is an indication of where the energy market is going.</p><p>Companies need to acknowledge that preparing for a low-carbon future is a necessity, not a choice, she said.</p><p>For more about Bloomberg BNA, click here.</p><p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Andras Gergely" date="Mar 21, 2014 12:35 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-21/goldman-sees-forint-slump-to-2-year-low-as-rate-cuts-hit-yields.html"><headline>Goldman Sees Forint Slump to 2-Year Low as Rates Hit Yields</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>The forint will probably drop to a
two-year low after Hungary''s central bank cut interest rates to
a record, pushing bond yields to a level that doesn''t compensate
investors for currency risk, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>The forint, which depreciated 5.1 percent this year to
313.21 per euro, will probably slide toward 320, which would be
the weakest since January 2012, New York- and London-based
analysts Themistoklis Fiotakis and Magdalena Polan wrote in an
e-mailed note yesterday. Hungarian policy makers will probably
signal an end to easing after a 10 basis-point cut next week and
won''t increase rates in the coming months, they wrote. </p>
<p>The forint''s slump was caused by a reduction in Federal
Reserve stimulus and the crisis in Ukraine and is beyond the
government''s control, Hungary''s Economy Minister Mihaly Varga
said in an interview with Gazdasagi Radio on March 18. Hungarian
bonds yield an average 286 basis points above U.S. Treasuries,
compared with an emerging-market average of 315, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes. </p>
<p>Recent statements by Hungarian officials argue that there
still may be some way to go before tolerance to currency
depreciation runs out, the analysts wrote. Dovish surprises
are likely to maintain the tightening pressure on local currency
premia and bring EUR/HUF to 320. </p>
<p>Derivatives trading shows there is a 38 percent chance the
forint will weaken past 320 per euro in the next year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The probability it will
strengthen to 300 is 30 percent. The forint decline this year is
the fourth-worst performance among 24 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, following the Argentine peso, the Russian
ruble and Chile''s peso. </p>
<h2>Fed, Ukraine </h2>
<p>A gauge of 20 emerging-market currencies has fallen 1.5
percent in 2014. The Fed voted on March 19 to reduce its bond-purchase program to $55 billion a month. Russian President
Vladimir Putin signed legislation today to complete the process
of Crimea''s accession to Russia. The move is against the wishes
of Ukraine, last month ousted pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Yanukovych. </p>
<p>Magyar Nemzeti Bank cut its benchmark rate to a record 2.7
percent last month in 19 consecutive steps. The Monetary Policy
Council will probably cut the rate by 10 basis points next week,
in line with Goldman''s estimate, according to the median of 22
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The forint is vulnerable because the extra yield on
Hungary''s local-currency bonds over hard currency-denominated
assets offer little or no reward, the Goldman analysts wrote. </p>
<h2>Local Spread </h2>
<p>The yield on securities included in the Bloomberg Hungary
Local Sovereign Bond Index are 54 basis points below the
constituents of an index of Hungary''s dollar-denominated bonds.
That compares with a premium of as much as 200 basis points on
forint-denominated bonds before the monetary easing started in
2012. </p>
<p>Economic policy will have to adapt to a weak forint after
Hungary''s April 6 parliamentary election, said Varga, whose
Fidesz party is poised to win the vote according to all opinion
polls. The next administration should strengthen export-oriented
industries to exploit the currency''s weakness, rather than
trying to influence the exchange rate, he said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and directors
including Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon were sued by an
investor for creating a culture of lawlessness that led to
billions of dollars in settlements tied to mortgage-backed
securities and Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>Under Dimon''s leadership, the New York-based company sold
low-quality residential mortgage-backed securities, failed to
report questionable activity by Madoff, manipulated energy
markets and engaged in fraudulent credit-card billing
strategies, the Iron Workers Mid-South Pension Fund said in
papers filed March 17 in Delaware Chancery Court and partly
unsealed yesterday. </p>
<p>Dimon, CEO since December 2005 and chairman since December
2006, knowingly, recklessly, or with gross negligence created
a culture of lawlessness that resulted in fines, penalties
settlements and related costs totaling at least $20 billion last
year, the fund said. At the same time, Dimon received a
74 percent pay raise to $20 million. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, agreed in
November to a $13 billion settlement of government allegations
that it misled investors and public when it sold bonds backed by
faulty residential mortgages. U.S. and state officials blamed
JPMorgan''s actions for helping to cause the credit crisis that
led to the worst recession since the Great Depression. </p>

<p>Analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are abandoning their
sell ratings on Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) as the stock
posts its best quarterly rally since 2005. </p>
<p>All three banks raised their recommendations on Teva, the
world''s biggest maker of generic drugs, to neutral from sell in
the past two weeks as the stock soared to a three-year high in
New York trading. The analysts said the company is making
progress in its push to maintain market share of its best-selling drug Copaxone while a boom in mergers and acquisitions
in the industry yields deals of as much as $21 billion. </p>
<p>Shares of Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva have rallied 23
percent this year. The stock, the biggest investment in
billionaire George Soros''s fund, is the third-best performer on
the Market Vectors U.S. Listed Pharmaceutical 25 Price Index
after trailing the 21 other companies in the measure in 2013.
Mounting concern about the company''s leadership and growth
outlook has sent Teva''s valuation to 11 times estimated
earnings, the second-lowest multiple among 15 global generic
drug makers tracked by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The upgrades are not saying everything is great but, at
the valuation it got to investors are reconsidering their
positions, Jacob de Tusch-Lec, who helps oversee about $23
billion in equities at Artemis Investment Management LLP in
London, said by phone on March 20. Essentially things have not
gotten worse. </p>
<h2>Weekly Rally </h2>
<p>The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index rose 2.5 percent to
119.39 last week, the most since Feb. 14, extending its gain
this year to 7.3 percent. The TA-25 Index advanced 0.7 percent
at today''s close in Israel, extending its 2014 advance to 4.7
percent. </p>
<p>Leslie Shribman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, Lauren Bellmare at Morgan Stanley, and Amanda Smith at JPMorgan
declined to comment on their analysts'' reports. Denise Bradley,
a spokeswoman for Teva in North Wales, Pennsylvania, didn''t
respond to an e-mailed request for comment. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has been advising clients to buy Mylan Inc. (MYL), the
biggest U.S. generic-drug maker, since October 2007. The shares
have more than tripled since then. Morgan Stanley rated Perrigo
Co. (PRGO), a maker of generic over-the-counter medicines, the
equivalent of buy on Feb. 4, 2013, before a 50 percent rally. </p>
<p>Teva converted 8.7 percent of 20-milligram Copaxone
prescriptions to its 40-milligram version in the week ended Feb.
28, according to Bloomberg Industries. Leerink Partners and
Cowen  Co. analysts said the results mean the company may
deliver on its plan to get 30 percent to 50 percent of patients
on the three-times-weekly injection. </p>
<h2>$4 Billion </h2>
<p>Moving patients to the new version is key because the
remaining U.S. patent on the $4 billion-drug expires at the end
of May, while the new version will be protected from generic
competition until 2030. Teva''s next hurdle will be persuading
insurers in the U.S. to continue paying for the branded, three-times-a-week shot once a cheaper copycat of the daily version
becomes available. </p>
<p>Fifteen out of the 29 analysts tracked by Bloomberg
recommend buying Teva''s shares, the highest level since
September. Thirteen analysts have a hold rating, while one says
sell, the data showed. The shares declined 1.4 percent to 172.60
shekels, or the equivalent of $49.54, today in Tel Aviv. </p>
<p>A wave of mergers and acquisitions among generic drug
companies has also triggered a rally in Teva''s shares, according
to Jason Kolbert, an analyst at Maxim Group LLC. </p>
<p>Actavis Plc (ACT) agreed to purchase Forest Laboratories Inc. for
$25 billion last month, and Mylan Inc. Chief Executive Heather Bresch said Feb. 27 that the generic-drug maker may make a large
acquisition this year. Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh said
March 4 that Teva is open for deals as the pace of industry
consolidation quickens. </p>
<h2>Hot Topic'' </h2>
<p>The acquisition of generic companies has now become a
very hot topic, Kolbert, who has a buy rating for Teva, said
in a March 20 phone interview from New York. Actavis'' purchase
was a gift for the Israeli drugmaker, he said. That was
the trigger that got people focusing on Teva. </p>
<p>Soros Fund Management LLC, the family office of billionaire
George Soros, boosted its stake in Teva in the last three months
of 2013, making the Israeli drugmaker its largest holding in the
fourth quarter. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) agreed to buy Maker
Studios, a supplier of online video content to YouTube, for $500
million, gaining technology and experience with short-form
entertainment. </p>
<p>Disney also agreed to pay as much as $450 million more if
Maker Studios meets strong performance targets, the Burbank,
California-based company said today in a statement. That could
boost the total to $950 million. </p>
<p>With Maker Studios, Disney is following DreamWorks
Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) into an online video business with expanding
audiences and little profit. DreamWorks Animation, producer of
the Shrek movies, bought AwesomenessTV, a smaller competitor
of Maker Studios, for $33 million plus as much as $117 million
in incentives last year. The online outlets could help media
companies build awareness for films and TV shows. </p>
<p>Short-form online video is growing at an astonishing pace
and with Maker Studios, Disney will now be at the center of this
dynamic industry with an unmatched combination of advanced
technology and programming expertise and capabilities,Robert A. Iger, Disney''s chairman and chief executive officer, said in
the statement. </p>
<p>With more than 55,000 channels, 380 million subscribers and
5.5 billion views a month on Google Inc.''s YouTube, Culver City,
California-based Maker has established itself as one of the top
online video networks for young audiences, Disney said. </p>
<h2>Buying Again </h2>
<p>There is a lot of good happening in digital video
networks, Mike Vorhaus, a technology consultant at Magid
Advisors, said in an interview. There are a ton of eyeballs
and the content isn''t expensive to produce. There just hasn''t
been a lot of meaningful profit yet. </p>
<p>The acquisition is one of the biggest for Disney, the
world''s largest entertainment company, since the $4 billion
purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012. In the online space, Maker
could potentially exceed the $563.2 million Disney spent in 2010
on mobile game maker Playdom. Disney paid $350 million in 2007
for Club Penguin online world. </p>
<p>Disney rose 0.4 percent to $79.84 in extended trading at
7:53 p.m. New York time after the deal was announced. The stock
fell 1.1 percent to $79.49 at the close and has gained 4 percent
this year. </p>
<p>Maker Studios will report to Jay Rasulo, Disney''s chief
financial officer, according to the statement. The online
company was founded in 2009, according to a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Disney had $4.4 billion in cash at the end of September,
according to regulatory filings. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) named ABC News
President Ben Sherwood as co-chairman of its media networks,
filling the vacancy created by the planned departure in January
of Anne Sweeney. </p>
<p>Sherwood will begin the transition immediately as co-president of the Disney/ABC Television Group and will continue
to oversee news until a successor is named, the Burbank,
California-based company said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger is
moving quickly to fill a key executive role that oversees the
company''s largest division. Sherwood, 50, who will work
alongside ESPN President John Skipper as media co-chairman, will
be responsible for the Disney channels, the ABC broadcast
network and the ABC Family cable channel. </p>
<p>Ben is one of those unique executives who combine rich
creative experience with great business acumen, Iger said in
the statement. He''s also focused, strategic and competitive. </p>
<p>After being named ABC News president in December 2010,
Sherwood oversaw Good Morning America as it surpassed NBC''s
Today show in viewers and narrowed the ratings gap between
ABC''s World News and NBC''s Nightly News in the evening. </p>
<p>An ABC News partnership with Yahoo! Inc. under Sherwood
boosted the news division''s online exposure and he helped
developed Fusion, a cable-TV channel joint venture with
Univision Communications Inc. that targets English-speaking
Latinos with news and lifestyle programming. </p>
<h2>Disney''s Largest </h2>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, fell 1.1
percent to $79.49 at the close in New York. The stock has risen
4 percent this year. </p>
<p>The media networks division, led by ESPN and the Disney-branded channels, is Disney''s largest, generating $6.82 billion
in operating income, 64 percent of the company''s total, in the
most recent fiscal year. </p>
<p>Sweeney, 56, announced plans on March 11 to leave Disney
before the contest heats up to replace Iger, who plans to retire
in June 2016. Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and parks
division head Thomas Staggs have been mentioned frequently by
analysts as leading contenders. </p>
<p>Under Sweeney''s direction, the Disney Channel quintupled
its subscriber base. She supervised the introduction of related
channels, including Disney XD, aimed at boys, and Disney Junior,
targeting preschoolers. In 2005, ABC became the first network to
make its shows available at Apple Inc.''s iTunes store. </p>
<p>Like other broadcast networks, ABC has struggled with
declining viewership of traditional television as consumers turn
to cable TV and Web-based options such as Netflix Inc. </p>
<p>For the television season that started in September, ABC is
averaging 7.42 million viewers in prime-time, a decline of 5.1
percent from a year earlier, according to Nielsen data. In the
advertiser-targeted group ages 18 to 49, ABC is in last place,
down 7.9 percent to 2.68 million viewers. </p>

<p>Fang Fang, JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co.''s
chief executive officer of investment banking for China, is
leaving after more than 12 years at the firm. </p>
<p>The 48-year-old banker told New York-based JPMorgan that he
wanted to retire, according to an internal memo obtained by
Bloomberg News today. Frank Gong was named chairman of China
investment banking in the message from Therese Esperdy, co-head
of Asia-Pacific banking at the firm. Marie Cheung, a spokeswoman
in Hong Kong, confirmed the contents of the memo. </p>
<p>Fang''s impending departure comes amid an investigation into
JPMorgan''s Asian hiring practices. U.S. authorities are
examining whether the firm employed people in Asia so that their
relatives in government would steer business to the bank, people
with knowledge of the probes have said. </p>
<p>Fang joined JPMorgan in August 2001 and was a former vice
president of Beijing Enterprises Holdings Ltd., an investment
company controlled by the government of China''s capital. He
became head of JPMorgan''s China investment-banking business in
2007 and was made vice chairman for Asia investment banking in
2009. </p>
<p>The banker submitted his resignation last week as he wants
to spend more time with his family, a person with knowledge of
the matter said. </p>

<p>An electrical leak from a battery
may have prevented a Raytheon Co. (RTN) warhead from separating from
its booster rocket in a missile-defense test that failed in
July, according to findings emerging from a Pentagon review. </p>
<p>The most likely root causes are a combination of
electrical leakage during activation of the warhead''s battery
after launch and the susceptibility of some components to
such leaks, according to a Jan. 23 letter to Congress that
wasn''t previously made public. </p>
<p>The failed test has clouded prospects for the Pentagon''s
plan to increase the number of Orbital Sciences Corp. (ORB) booster
rockets in silos to 44 by fiscal 2017 from 30 today. The 14
added rockets would be equipped with a new warhead. The missile-defense system is aimed at fending off a potential attack by a
small number of intercontinental missiles from countries such as
North Korea or Iran. </p>
<p>The weapon in the test that failed on July 5 was a model
first deployed in 2004 that today arms 20 of 30 interceptors in
silos in Alaska and California. Before the failure the warhead
had scored three straight interceptions of test targets,
according to the Missile Defense Agency. </p>
<p>Boeing Co. (BA), based in Chicago, is the prime contractor on
the ground-based system of radar, interceptors and command
centers. Dulles, Virginia-based Orbital Sciences assembles the
booster that''s equipped with a non-explosive warhead made by
Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon. Falls Church, Virginia-based Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) builds the command-and-control
network. </p>
<h2>System Costs </h2>
<p>The U.S. has spent $24 billion on ground-based missile
defense intended to protect the continental U.S. and Hawaii, and
that amount will grow to $30 billion by 2019, Vice Admiral James
Syring, director of the Missile Defense Agency, told a House
Armed Services Committee panel today. </p>
<p>In response to the findings on the failed test, the Missile
Defense Agency plans to improve the warhead''s battery and
implement a fleet-wide software change for the 20 already in
the field that are the same version, Frank Kendall, the
Pentagon''s top weapons buyer, wrote House Armed Services
Committee members in an update on the continuing review. </p>
<p>Crucial to expansion of the missile-defense system is
success in testing the newer warhead that had two failures in
2010, the first caused by a quality defect, the second by a
design shortfall that wasn''t detected in ground testing. The
Missile Defense Agency and Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon''s top
tester, have said the new warhead has been improved and is ready
for an interception test. </p>
<h2>More Testing </h2>
<p>While the agency has screened the newer warhead''s battery
and took steps to ensure it won''t fail, ongoing testing and
analysis may require delaying the test for several months
until an improved battery is available, Kendall said. </p>
<p>He told lawmakers he expected final results from the review
of the test failure by March 31. </p>
<p>John Patterson, a spokesman for Raytheon Missile Systems,
didn''t immediately return a phone call and e-mail seeking
comment. </p>
<p>Rick Lerner, a spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency,
said he had no comment on Kendall''s letter. </p>
<p>Syring had said at a budget briefing on March 4 that the
July failure wasn''t caused by a quality defect. </p>
<h2>Quality Review </h2>
<p>Separately, the Pentagon''s inspector general said in
October that it had begun a quality review of Raytheon''s record
in manufacturing the interceptor. </p>
<p>The Missile Defense Agency is proposing four programs to
improve interceptor reliability, according to a 16-page report
to Congress submitted in January and labeled For Official Use
Only. </p>
<p>The programs are needed to achieve a higher probability
of engagement success'' against intercontinental ballistic
missiles, according the report. </p>
<p>The fiscal 2015-2019 budget plan for the Missile Defense
Agency calls for $4.39 billion for continued development of the
ground system, $189 million for a new common kill vehicle
that could replace the Raytheon warhead and $619 million to buy
additional interceptors and other equipment. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

The dark pool, which has ambitions to become an exchange, was built with defenses against the fastest traders. Yesterday, in a memo obtained by Bloomberg News, IEX said Goldman Sachs has more than double the volume of the No. 2 broker. </p> <p>It''s a bit surprising to see a major broker be such an active and vocal supporter of IEX early on, Justin Schack, partner and managing director for market structure analysis at Rosenblatt Securities Inc., said in a phone interview.

It was an early investor in IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. and was among the firm''s largest shareholders when it went public in 2005. Atlanta-based ICE, which now owns the New York Stock Exchange, has grown to become the world''s second-biggest bourse owner by market value at $23 billion. Goldman Sachs was also a shareholder of Direct Edge Holdings LLC, which merged this year with Bats Global Markets Inc. to form an exchange operator with about 20 percent of American volume. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) agreed to buy Maker
Studios, a supplier of online video content to YouTube, for at
least $500 million, gaining technology and experience with
short-form entertainment. </p>
<p>Disney also agreed to pay as much as $450 million more if
Maker Studios meets strong performance targets, according to
a statement yesterday by the Burbank, California-based company.
That could boost the total to $950 million. </p>
<p>With Maker Studios, Disney is following DreamWorks
Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) into an online video business with expanding
audiences and little profit. DreamWorks Animation, producer of
the Shrek movies, bought AwesomenessTV, a smaller competitor
of Maker Studios, for $33 million plus as much as $117 million
in incentives last year. The online outlets could help media
companies build awareness for films and TV shows. </p>
<p>Short-form online video is growing at an astonishing pace
and with Maker Studios, Disney will now be at the center of this
dynamic industry with an unmatched combination of advanced
technology and programming expertise and capabilities,Robert Iger, Disney''s chairman and chief executive officer, said in the
statement. </p>
<p>With more than 55,000 channels, 380 million subscribers and
5.5 billion views a month on Google Inc.''s YouTube, Culver City,
California-based Maker has established itself as one of the top
online-video networks for young audiences, Disney said. </p>
<h2>Online Space </h2>
<p>There is a lot of good happening in digital video
networks, Mike Vorhaus, a technology consultant at Magid
Advisors, said in an interview. There are a ton of eyeballs
and the content isn''t expensive to produce. There just hasn''t
been a lot of meaningful profit yet. </p>
<p>The acquisition is one of the biggest for Disney, the
world''s largest entertainment company, since the $4 billion
purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012. In the online space, Maker
could potentially exceed the $563.2 million Disney spent in 2010
on mobile game maker Playdom. Disney paid $350 million in 2007
for the kids'' social network Club Penguin. </p>
<p>Disney rose 0.4 percent to $79.84 in extended trading after
the deal was announced yesterday. The stock fell 1.1 percent to
$79.49 at the close in New York and has gained 4 percent this
year. </p>
<p>Maker Studios will report to Jay Rasulo, Disney''s chief
financial officer, according to the statement. The online
company was founded in 2009, according to a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Disney had $4.4 billion in cash at the end of September,
according to regulatory filings. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said he will hold nothing back to get the company''s programs across all devices, in a clear departure from the software maker''s longtime focus on its Windows operating system. </p> <p>At his first public speech since taking the CEO job last month, Nadella unveiled Office software for Apple Inc.''s iPad, the first time Microsoft is putting the popular productivity programs onto the tablet. Nadella also said the company''s goal is to get its Internet-based Office 365 service on any gadget, even if it reduces sales of Windows-based personal computers or other products. </p> <p>It''s not a tradeoff, because it''s about going where customers are going, Nadella said after the company event in San Francisco. It''s not about today''s share position based on today''s form factors, because in the full arc of time there will be many new platforms that will require Office, from small screens to large screens. </p> <p>Nadella is presiding over Microsoft''s shift to a more open approach. While former CEO Steve Ballmer kept more of a focus on Windows, including pushing the operating system onto smartphones, Nadella is indicating that he proactively wants to get Microsoft software onto Apple''s iOS and Google Inc.''s Android-based gadgets. Since Apple and Android devices dominate in mobile, Microsoft risks having its software locked out if it can''t sell its programs for those platforms. </p> <h2>New Sheriff </h2> <p>There is a new sheriff in town, Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co., wrote in a note about Nadella''s presentation. We believe the Office for iPad was a major positive step in the right direction and signals a strategic change at Microsoft. Ives has the equivalent of a hold on the stock. </p> <p>Microsoft shares fell 1 percent to $39.36 at the close in New York. </p> <p>Office for iPad, which now includes Word, PowerPoint and Excel, also heralds a new business model for the software, which has been a paid product. Now users will be able to view their Office documents for free on their iPad, though to edit or create documents they will need to pay $99 a year for a subscription to Office 365. </p> <p>Last year, Microsoft released paid versions of Office apps for the iPhone, which required a subscription to Office 365. That product cost $99.99 a year for a home version that works on five devices and $69.99 for a version that works for just one computer and one tablet. </p> <p>We''re excited that Office is coming to iPad  now part of the more than 500,000 apps designed specifically for iPad, said Trudy Muller, a spokeswoman for Apple. </p> <h2>Mobile, Cloud </h2> <p>On his first day as CEO, Nadella emphasized the Redmond, Washington-based company''s focus on devices and Web-based cloud services and said those priorities would define Microsoft going forward. </p> <p>At the event today, Nadella reiterated that the intersection of mobile and cloud is the most critical, though he added that it was just one aspect of our overall strategy. </p> <p>He also rolled out technology to enable developers to create what he called a cloud for everyone on every device. </p> <p>Nadella said Windows remains a massive agenda for us and the company plans to innovate with the operating system. The CEO said Microsoft will unveil more of its strategy as soon as next week at its Build developer conference in San Francisco, where Windows will be front and center. </p> <h2>Bigger Opportunity </h2> <p>Microsoft is in the process of migrating the lion''s share of its business to the cloud and subscription, Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., wrote in a note to clients last week. </p> <p>The iPad version of Office, a suite of software that includes Microsoft''s Word, Excel, Outlook and other programs, may add $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion in consumer Office subscription revenue a year, Moerdler said. </p> <p>Microsoft is taking a risk by asking people to pay $99 a year to edit, rather than just look at, their documents, said Milind Gadekar, CEO of CloudOn Inc., which makes a free mobile application that lets users access and edit their Office documents on mobile devices. </p> <p>Consumers expect editing to be free, he said. You have to find other advanced features to charge for. </p> <p>Milind said that while Microsoft is becoming more open, its new strategy still requires Office 365 users to use its OneDrive online storage system, rather than popular alternatives such as Dropbox, Box.net and Evernote. </p> <h2>Productivity Programs </h2> <p>Still, consumers are spending more than twice as much time using mobile productivity apps than they did a year ago, according to research measuring usage between January and March by Flurry, a mobile analytics firm which tracked usage on both phones and tablets. </p> <p>Microsoft''s announcement of Office for iPad couldn''t be more timely, the company said in a blog post. In fact, it can define Microsoft and its newly appointed CEO''s tenure in the post-PC world. The study included phones and tablets with both iOS and Android. This growth rate eclipsed all other categories including Messaging, Games and News. </p> <p>Asked if selling Office on other devices would cause big changes in sales of Windows-based PCs, phones and tablets, Nadella said at the event, I would leave it to Wall Street to do the analysis, but we are going after huge opportunities that are ahead of us. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Silla Brush" date="Mar 27, 2014  2:35 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-27/morgan-stanley-will-pay-490-000-over-cftc-customer-fund-claims.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley Will Pay $490,000 Over CFTC Customer-Fund Claims</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) will pay $490,000 to
settle U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission allegations
that the company failed to adequately oversee customer funds. </p>
<p>The bank''s Smith Barney futures brokerage in April 2013
transferred $16 million to the wrong type of account holding
customer funds, resulting in a violation of CFTC rules, the
agency said in a statement today announcing the settlement.
Customers didn''t lose any funds as a result of the company''s
failures in internal controls and supervision, the regulator
said. </p>
<p>In 2012, the brokerage also commingled customer and company
funds and improperly titled accounts for customer funds, the
CFTC said today. The bank hired KPMG LLP to review policies for
overseeing customer funds. </p>
<p>As the settlement notes, no customer lost any money as a
result of these issues, Christine Jockle, a spokeswoman for
New York-based Morgan Stanley , said in a statement. We
cooperated fully with the CFTC, hired an outside auditor to
review our procedures, and made improvements where required. </p>
<p>The CFTC, which oversees futures and swaps markets, has
pursued a series of enforcement actions against commodity
brokerages for failing to oversee funds since MF Global Holdings
Ltd.''s failure in 2011 resulted in an initial gap of $1.6
billion in customer funds. </p>
<p>Brokerage subsidiaries of Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and
Macquarie Group Ltd. reached settlements with the CFTC last year
to resolve allegations of improper oversight of customer funds. </p>

<p>Investors'' confidence in companies
making acquisitions is emboldening management to execute deals,
spurring a mergers and acquisitions boom, according to Michael Carr, co-head of Americas MA at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Shareholders have been embracing the acquiring companies,
Carr said today at the 26th annual Tulane University Corporate
Law Institute in New Orleans, signaling faith in the lasting
value of transactions as well as challenging the conventional
wisdom that they should brace for a selloff. </p>
<p>Public U.S. companies worth more than $1 billion have risen
an average of 5.2 percent in 2014 the day after announcing they
are acquiring a target, a reversal from the 1.9 percent one-day
decline buyers experienced five years ago, according to data
from Goldman Sachs. Almost 75 percent of acquiring companies
have gone up following deal announcements in the fourth quarter
of 2013 and the first quarter this year. </p>
<p>This is all about shareholder sentiment, Carr said.
Shareholders are accepting the companies'' view of synergies
and cost savings, and they''re giving a lot more credit than they
did. </p>
<p>There have been more than 6,500 deals announced globally in
the year to date, valued at almost $650 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That''s the most volume in the first
three months of the year since the first quarter of 2007, when
volume reached $960 billion, the data show. </p>
<p>The first-quarter volume reflects a 28 percent jump from
the year-earlier quarter, and a 12 percent increase from the
fourth quarter of 2013. </p>
<h2>Strategic Shift </h2>
<p>More companies are shifting toward strategic MA in 2014
and away from financial engineering, such as share buybacks,
Carr said. </p>
<p>Comcast Corp.''s $45.2 billion agreement to buy Time Warner
Cable Inc. was the largest announced in the first three months
of the year, topping a failed hostile bid from Charter
Communications Inc. Actavis Plc''s $21 billion offer for
drugmaker Forest Laboratories Inc. and Facebook Inc.''s $19
billion takeover of mobile messaging service WhatsApp Inc.
followed the cable combination to round out the quarter''s top
three acquisitions. </p>
<p>This year''s deals have been motivated by expansion of
market presence and consolidation, rather than many of 2013''s
biggest takeovers, which were clean-up trades, Carr said. </p>
<p>Comcast Corp.''s buyout of the remainder of NBCUniversal
from General Electric Co., and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)''s
acquisition of Verizon Wireless from Vodafone Group Plc were two
2013 deals driven by financial concerns and cheap debt, rather
than building influence in their particular industries, Carr
said. </p>
<p>The character of the market feels different than a good
part of 2013. </p>
<h2>Shareholder Sentiment </h2>
<p>While the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index has gained more than
65 percent since September 2011, earnings growth has risen just
14 percent in the same time period, indicating the market is
expecting profits to rise from deals, he said. This supports
deal advisers, who must count on shareholder sentiment to propel
future acquisitions, Carr said. It''s very, very hard for MA
activity to pick up without that optimism, he said. </p>
<p>Comcast''s Time Warner Cable acquisition, the largest U.S.
cable deal since Comcast''s $72 billion merger with ATT
Broadband in 2001, helped propel Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. to the top rankings for fees for the quarter, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley advised Time Warner Cable and JPMorgan
advised Comcast, according to the press release announcing that
deal. Bankers earned about $143 million on that merger, the
third-largest payday for any deal since 2009, according to New
York-based research firm Freeman  Co. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has advised on 58 deals this year, valued at
more than $215 billion, followed by JPMorgan''s $162 billion for
59, the data show. </p>
<p>While Goldman Sachs landed in third place for advising on
$132 billion of deals, it worked on more transactions than
either bank, at 77. Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc rounded out
the top five. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and Suzuki Motor
Corp. (7269) are among companies pushing demand for transportation of
machinery to Myanmar to bottle drinks and make trucks, after the
country''s five decades of isolation during military rule. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola, which opened a bottling plant in Myanmar last
year, plans to invest $200 million over five years while Suzuki
restarted production of trucks last year after leaving the
market in 2010. Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. (2502), Japan''s biggest
beermaker, said this month it''s forming a venture to start
operations there this year. </p>
<p>Because much of the machinery is too big to fit in regular
containers, Japan''s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. and other shippers
are increasingly using vessels that can handle oversized cargo.
The Southeast Asian nation, formerly known as Burma, is
importing basic materials to improve infrastructure after the
U.S., Europe and Japan eased sanctions following elections in
2012 in which the country''s leading dissident, Aung San Suu Kyi,
a political prisoner for 15 years, was elected to parliament. </p>
<p>It will take time for Myanmar to be a big manufacturing
country, said Masayuki Kubota, chief strategist at Rakuten
Securities Economic Research Institute. They''re buying
machinery now as part of the process to become a big
manufacturing country. It needs a huge amount of investment. </p>

<p>More Chinese companies are heading
toward default as higher funding costs and slowing growth weigh
on existing debt commitments, according to Morgan Stanley. (MS) </p>
<p>The pressures are now on for the corporate default rate
to be moving higher, said Viktor Hjort, the Hong Kong-based
head of Asia fixed-income research at the U.S. lender. Any
economy that generates defaults usually needs three things,
leveraged balance sheets, sluggish growth and tighter financial
conditions. China ticks all three boxes. </p>
<p>Chinese issuers pay an average 6.22 percent for dollar-denominated securities, after yields touched 6.39 percent on
March 20, the highest since September, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
indexes show. Top-rated companies pay an average 6.05 percent
for 10-year notes onshore, the most in a month and poised for
the biggest monthly increase since November, according to
Chinabond indexes. </p>
<p>Corporate borrowing spiraled during the global credit
crisis, as the Chinese government encouraged banks to lend to
support the economy. Financial institutions are now clamping
down on non-performing loans and curbing new lending, pushing up
the cost of servicing this debt as the nation''s economy slows. A
preliminary gauge of manufacturing missed estimates this week,
suggesting factory output weakened for a fifth straight month in
March. </p>
<p>Solar-cell maker Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science 
Technology Co. became the first company in China to default on
its onshore notes earlier this month. </p>
<h2>Credit Caution </h2>
<p>Access to credit has become increasingly tight, Hjort
said in an interview yesterday. That''s what''s starting to
create tensions in terms of credit risk in China, creating the
basis to expect default rates will go up, and is the main reason
why one needs to be cautious. </p>
<p>China''s economic growth is expected to slow to 7.4 percent
this year, according to the median estimate of 55 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Total lending by Agricultural Bank
of China Ltd., the nation''s third-largest, grew 12 percent in
2013, down from 14 percent a year earlier, according to annual
results published yesterday. </p>
<p>The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of funding
availability in the interbank market, climbed 96 basis points,
the most since Jan. 20, to 4.84 percent today, National
Interbank Funding Center data show. The measure is rising for an
11th straight day, the longest streak in seven years. </p>
<p>The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific corporate and sovereign
bonds from default rose, according to credit-default swaps
traders. </p>
<h2>Risk Rises </h2>
<p>The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 2 basis points to 132 basis
points as of 8:28 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia  New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is set for its biggest
one-day rise since March 20 when the new series of the index
began trading, according to data provider CMA. </p>
<p>The Markit iTraxx Australia index added 1 basis point to
103.5 as of 11:32 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. The measure is also on track for its highest close since
March 20, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market. The
Markit iTraxx Japan index advanced 0.5 of a basis point to 86.3
as of 9:40 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show. </p>
<p>Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite. </p>
<p>The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. </p>

Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) this month agreed to buy Spain''s Grupo Corporativo Ono SA for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion) including debt. Cable tycoon Patrick Drahi''s Numericable SA (NUM) is competing with Bouygues SA (EN) to combine with Vivendi SA''s French mobile-phone unit SFR. </p> <p>A London-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while representatives for Quadrangle and Oslo-based Get didn''t respond to e-mails requests seeking comment. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs and Quadrangle haven''t made a final decision on the sale and could decide to retain the business, one of the people said. Get, which offers TV and broadband-Internet access, has about 1 million customers in Norway, according to its website. </p> <p>Private-equity firms typically pool money from pension plans and insurance companies.

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) almost doubled Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman''s pay to $18 million, the most in
his four years leading the firm. </p>
<p>Gorman, 55, received a $6 million long-term incentive and
$5.09 million in deferred cash for his work in 2013, New York-based Morgan Stanley said today in a regulatory filing. He also
got a $316,000 cash bonus and $5.09 million in stock in addition
to his $1.5 million salary. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley shares jumped 64 percent last year as profit
margins in the retail brokerage improved and revenue from equity
trading was the highest since the financial crisis. Still, the
firm had a 5 percent return on equity, unchanged from a year
earlier and short of Gorman''s 10 percent goal. </p>
<p>The CEO, through strong leadership and commitment,
substantially improved the company''s strategic positioning,
the board''s compensation committee wrote in the filing. The
results of this repositioning started to be realized in the
company''s performance for 2013. </p>
<p>Gorman got a $9.75 million pay package a year earlier,
including a $3.75 million long-term incentive dependent on the
bank hitting performance targets. His bonus was made up of $2.63
million in stock options and $2.58 million in deferred cash in
addition to his $800,000 salary. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President
Gary Cohn said prices in global markets don''t reflect the risks
from geopolitical conflicts such as Russia''s annexation of
Crimea. </p>
<p>For the last six to 12 months, markets for some reason
have been ignoring a lot of the geopolitical risk, Cohn, 53,
said in an interview with Canadian television network CBC.
Russia, Crimea, Ukraine: this is not the first or newest
geopolitical risk we''ve had in the last year or so. </p>
<p>Cohn cited tensions between China and Japan as well as
continuing violence in the Middle East as risks that haven''t
halted a climb in global equities over the last 12 months.
Investors with a lot of cash have felt pressure to deploy it,
preventing a sustained downturn in prices, he said. </p>
<p>Anytime we get any sell-off in the market, there''s new
investors coming into the market, so we haven''t seen that
repricing, Cohn said. Investors are saying, I''ve got to put
cash to work, and maybe these situations are going to be with us
for a long time, and I can''t sit on cash at the bank earning no
return forever, he said. </p>
<p>Still, Cohn said the U.S. stock market seems fairly valued,
given low interest rates and bond yields that will probably
climb. The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index has risen 18 percent in
the last 12 months. </p>
<p>In a lot of respects, owning equities in the world today
seems like the least risky opportunity for cash out there,
Cohn said. Each of the alternatives has its own negative
potential consequences to it, and then you evaluate all the
alternatives in relationship to each other, and then you end up
in a scenario where I think equities provide the most upside
versus the downside. </p>

<p>Ghana''s cedi, the worst-performing
African currency in the first quarter, could depreciate another
20 percent this year as foreign-exchange reserves recede and
inflation (GHCPALLY) accelerates, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>Increased risk of outflows from the heavily foreign-owned local bonds, uncertainty around commodity prices and fewer
signs of a real turnaround in the country''s fiscal situation
add to the cedi''s weaker outlook, Giulia Pellegrini, sub-Saharan
Africa economist at JPMorgan, said in a report yesterday. </p>
<p>The U.S. investment bank, which cut Ghana''s gross domestic
product forecast for 2014, said lower growth will affect revenue
generation and widen the budget deficit to 10 percent of GDP
against the government''s target of 8.5 percent. Inflation
quickened to 14 percent in February, climbing for a sixth
consecutive month, as the government stopped utility subsidies
and the cedi weakened. It climbed from 13.8 percent in January,
above the central bank''s target of 9.5 percent plus or minus 2
percentage points. </p>
<p>Bank of Ghana has revised up its inflation forecasts,
Pellegrini said. It sees inflation staying above the target
band until 2015, with risks tilted to the upside on the
weakening cedi and slower-than-planned fiscal consolidation. </p>
<p>JPMorgan cut the economic growth forecast to 5.2 percent
given the West African nation''s erratic power supply and
uncertainty around commodity prices, Pellegrini said. The
government''s GDP estimate for this year is 8 percent. </p>
<p>Ghana''s gross foreign-exchange reserves dropped to $5.3
billion in January from $5.6 billion the previous month, the
central bank said March 19. </p>
<p>The currency of the world''s second-biggest cocoa producer
slumped 20 percent against the dollar last year. It is 12
percent weaker in the first quarter, the most among 24 African

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is seeking to
become one of the world''s three biggest stock brokers, lifting a
division that has fallen behind its capital markets, equity
derivatives and investment banking units. </p>
<p>The largest U.S. bank is trying to boost electronic trading
and increase commission pools to climb from sixth place in cash-equities trading, said Tim Throsby, global head of equities in
London. JPMorgan is ranked first in investment banking, equities
origination, fixed income, commodities and currencies, while it
comes second for derivatives products, according to research
firm Coalition Ltd. </p>
<p>One of the big themes for the firm is to bring cash
equities up to that same level, Throsby said in an interview
in London. There are some very obvious areas where we are
working to improve, and where we think there is a great
opportunity. Third or fourth place would be a realistic medium-term ambition, with second or third in the long term. </p>
<p>The lender isn''t planning to hire more staff to accomplish
the task, he added. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is betting that investments in electronic
platforms and hedge-fund services will help it leap over rivals
in an industry that has suffered from declining volume and
profitability. The New York-based bank was late in boosting
those offerings as it focused on advisory and sales, said
analysts including Derek de Vries at UBS AG. (UBSN) </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) failed to
persuade a federal judge to again throw out a securities lawsuit
over residential mortgage-backed securities it sold in 2007
after an appeals court overturned an earlier decision. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum in Manhattan,
who had dismissed the lawsuit by the Police and Fire Retirement
System of the City of Detroit twice before, ruled yesterday that
a 2012 appellate decision overturning her findings in a related
lawsuit had significantly changed the landscape. </p>
<p>In 2012 the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York reversed
Cedarbaum''s ruling that the NECA-IBEW Health and Welfare Fund,
which had sued Goldman Sachs in 2008, had failed to claim a
sufficient loss from the investments. The appeals panel also
threw out her ruling that the fund couldn''t represent investors
in offerings of the securities it hadn''t bought itself. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s ruling follows a New York state appeals court
decision in January that Goldman Sachs must face fraud claims in
a $1 billion lawsuit filed by an Australian hedge fund, Basis
Capital Funds Management Ltd.''s Basis Yield Alpha Fund, over
collateralized debt obligations sold by the bank before the
financial crisis of 2008. In 2010, Goldman Sachs reached a $550
million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission to resolve claims over the marketing of CDOs. </p>
<h2>Judge Reversed </h2>
<p>In the federal case, the Detroit pension fund filed a
separate lawsuit in 2010 on behalf of investors that bought
securities from the trust for which Cedarbaum had said NECA
couldn''t bring claims. The judge had dismissed the Detroit
fund''s lawsuit twice largely on her determination that it didn''t
adequately allege how Goldman Sachs''s purported
misrepresentations caused any loss. </p>
<p>After the higher court''s ruling, the fact that PFRS
received payments throughout the life of the certificates, and
was arguably aware of the risk that there would not be a
secondary market for its certificates, is immaterial,
Cedarbaum said in yesterday''s ruling. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>The case is The Police and Fire Retirement System of the
City of Detroit v. Goldman, Sachs  Co., 10-04429, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) almost doubled Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman''s pay to $18 million, the most in
his four years leading the firm. </p>
<p>Gorman, 55, received a $6 million long-term incentive and
$5.09 million in deferred cash for his work in 2013, the New
York-based bank said yesterday in a regulatory filing. He also
got a $316,000 cash bonus and $5.09 million in stock in addition
to his $1.5 million salary. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley shares jumped 64 percent last year as profit
margins in the retail brokerage improved and revenue from equity
trading was the highest since the financial crisis. Still, the
firm had a 5 percent return on equity, unchanged from a year
earlier and short of Gorman''s 10 percent goal. </p>
<p>The CEO, through strong leadership and commitment,
substantially improved the company''s strategic positioning,
the board''s compensation committee wrote in the filing. The
results of this repositioning started to be realized in the
company''s performance for 2013. </p>
<p>Gorman got a $9.75 million pay package a year earlier,
including a $3.75 million long-term incentive dependent on the
bank hitting performance targets. His bonus was made up of $2.63
million in stock options and $2.58 million in deferred cash in
addition to his $800,000 salary. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) New Chief Executive
Officer Satya Nadella announced new leadership roles for Scott Guthrie and Phil Spencer, adding to management moves aimed at
rebooting growth in cloud and devices at the world''s largest
software maker. </p>
<p>Nadella, who took over as CEO last month, wrote in an e-mail to employees that he had appointed Guthrie to lead
company''s cloud and enterprise organization. Spencer will run
the Xbox business and former Nokia Oyj CEO Stephen Elop will
join as executive vice president of the devices group when
Microsoft completes its acquisition of Nokia''s handset unit. </p>
<p>The CEO earlier this month named a chief strategy officer
and disclosed the exits of several top executives. Nadella, who
was promoted to replace Steve Ballmer, is lining up his
leadership team as he seeks growth in devices and cloud
services. Nadella is also replacing executives who''ve left after
Ballmer''s management overhaul in July and Nadella''s own
appointment. </p>
<p>The changes among executives show how we''re continuing to
evolve and tune our organization for maximum focus and impact,
Nadella wrote. </p>
<p>Guthrie, who has been named a new executive vice president,
has been the acting head of the cloud unit for the past two
months, replacing Nadella. </p>
<p>Spencer, who had previously overseen the company''s video
game and television studios, will add Xbox software and the Xbox
Live online service and report to operating systems chief Terry Myerson. Marc Whitten, who left Microsoft this month, had
previously been responsible for Xbox software and Xbox Live. </p>
<h2>CEO Moves </h2>
<p>Elop''s role was initially announced in September when
Microsoft unveiled the Nokia acquisition and initially included
oversight of games and TV studios. Xbox hardware remains in
Elop''s group. </p>
<p>Microsoft holds its developer conference, called Build, in
San Francisco this week. Last week, Nadella made his first
public appearance since taking on his CEO job when he unveiled
Microsoft Office software for Apple Inc.''s iPad. At the event,
the CEO said he will hold nothing back to get the Redmond,
Washington-based company''s programs across all devices, in a
clear departure from the software maker''s longtime focus on its
Windows operating system. </p>

<p>Saidenberg, who was named to the currencies post last year,
becomes global co-head of commodities trading with Greg Agran in
June, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a March 28 internal
memo. That''s when Mirza joins as a partner and London-based
chief of the unit that Saidenberg ran, the bank said in a
separate memo. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, confirmed
the appointments and declined further comment, as did JPMorgan''s
Brian Marchiony. Saidenberg declined to comment through an
associate in his office. </p>
<p>Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
investment banks declined 9 percent in 2013, according to
industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in October that the
firm''s currency business had difficulty managing inventory
in the third quarter as the company posted its worst fixed-income trading revenue since the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Saidenberg joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 on the interest-rate products trading desk and was named a managing director in
2005 and partner the following year, according to the memo. He
will also continue as head of Europe, Middle East and Africa
emerging markets trading, the firm said. </p>
<p>Bloomberg News reported Goldman Sachs''s hiring of Mirza,
who oversaw JPMorgan''s EMEA foreign-exchange trading and was
global head of FX options trading, on March 5. The Wall Street

<p>Argentina''s effort to repair ties
with overseas investors is starting to yield results in the bond
market as the country tries to stem a plunge in foreign-currency
reserves. </p>
<p>Its dollar-denominated notes surged by the most of any
emerging market, adding to a 9.2 percent rally in March, after
the government said it received loan proposals from
international investment banks. The statement was in response to
a newspaper report on March 30 that said Argentina is close to
getting a two-year, $1 billion loan from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. at an interest rate of 6.5 percent, less than the nation''s
similar-maturity bonds that yield 11.28 percent. </p>
<p>The loan would provide Argentina, which hasn''t issued
overseas bonds since its $95 billion default in 2001, with a
crucial source of hard currency at a time when the reserves it
uses to pay debt are at a seven-year low. The financing would
also show President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is succeeding
in restoring investor confidence after settling creditor
disputes at the World Bank, agreeing to compensate Repsol SA for
its seizure of YPF SA and revamping its inflation index. </p>
<p>The market has been optimistic about Argentina for a
while now due to the change in attitude toward more pragmatic
and orthodox policies, Diego Ferro, the co-chief investment
officer at Greylock Capital Management LLC in New York, said by
e-mail. In that context, regaining market access would be a
logical step. </p>
<h2>Budget Deficit </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment
on any proposals or talks with Argentina. </p>
<p>The central bank is negotiating the final details of the
loan with Goldman Sachs including guarantees, Buenos Aires-based
newspaper Pagina/12 reported, citing a government official it
didn''t identify. </p>
<p>The bond-market advance pushed down Argentina''s average
yields to 10.8 percent. As recently as Feb. 3, they were as high
as 13.61 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>The Economy Ministry said in a statement on March 30 that
while the government isn''t planning any foreign currency debt
sales in the short term, it has received proposals from
investment banks it didn''t identify. </p>
<p>Different financial entities have presented proposals to
obtain foreign financing at maturities and interest rates in
line with other countries in the region, the ministry said. </p>
<h2>Subsidy Cuts </h2>
<p>Fernandez, hamstrung by a growing fiscal deficit and a
shrinking trade surplus, has authorized her economic team led by
Economy Minister Axel Kicillof to settle decade-old investment
disputes to gain access to fresh financing before the end of her
term late next year. Argentina will begin to cut gas and water
subsidies by 20 percent beginning today. Utility rates have been
largely frozen since 2003 and an increase in gas imports have
drained reserves as domestic output declines. </p>
<p>Given what they''ve been doing in recent days like changes
to subsidies, they''re cognizant of the need to maintain this
change in policy, Marco Santamaria, a money manager at
AllianceBernstein LP, which oversees $25 billion in emerging-market debt, said by phone from New York. </p>
<p>Robert Abad, who helps oversee about $53 billion of
emerging-market debt at Western Asset Management Co., said
Argentina''s legal dispute with creditors who rejected its debt
restructurings will continue to make it difficult for Argentina
to obtain the financing it needs. </p>
<h2>Holdout Litigation </h2>
<p>Creditors led by Elliott Management Corp.''s Paul Singer
have won lower court rulings to be paid in full at the same time
Argentina services its restructured debt. The effects of the
ruling are on hold pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
About 93 percent of creditors accepted losses of 70 percent in
the restructurings. Argentina has said paying holdouts in full
could expose it to $43 billion of claims that would lead it to
default again. </p>
<p>They have a lot more work to do, a loan here and a loan
there won''t bring liquidity relief that makes the math
sustainable, Abad said in a telephone interview from Pasadena,
California. This legal issue can create a big dent to what
happens. It''s hard to set the parameters to how much they have
to set aside. </p>
<p>The government has $5.9 billion of bonds due in October
2015. </p>
<p>Argentina obtained $938 million in financing from the
Inter-American Development Bank during meetings on March 29,
Buenos Aires-based newspaper Ambito Financiero reported
yesterday. The government is also in advanced talks with the
World Bank for $3 billion of loans, Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich said yesterday. </p>
<h2>High Probability'' </h2>
<p>Argentine bonds will continue to gain, according to
Barclays Plc. Average yields are still double the average in
emerging markets. </p>
<p>Valuations are still attractive, and the market will
continue to rally, Donato Guarino, a strategist at Barclays,
said in a telephone interview from New York. There''s a high
probability that they will get back on the international
market. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will manage
funds for a Bermuda-based reinsurer that raised $1.13 billion in
capital, concentrating the investments in junk bonds. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s Highbridge Principal Strategies LLC will oversee
the assets for Watford Re Ltd., the reinsurer said yesterday in
a statement. Watford said it raised $907 million in common
equity, including a $100 million investment by Arch Capital
Group Ltd., and $226 million in preferred shares. The reinsurer
is targeting an initial public offering in two to three years,
Chief Executive Officer John Rathgeber said in an interview. </p>
<p>The reinsurer''s portfolio will be comprised primarily of
non-investment grade credit assets, which it believes will
generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for its shareholders
over the long term, Watford said. </p>
<p>Money managers including Dan Loeb have started Bermuda-based reinsurers in recent years to raise funds that are less
subject to client withdrawals and can provide tax advantages.
Pine River Capital Management LP, the hedge-fund firm founded by
Brian Taylor, was seeking to raise $500 million to $750 million
for a reinsurance company, a person familiar with the matter
said in February. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, owns Highbridge
through its investment arm, JPMorgan Asset Management.
Highbridge Principal Strategies is led by Chief Executive
Officer Scott Kapnick, who came to the firm in 2007 after 21
years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was global co-head
of investment banking. HPS had about $19 billion of assets under
management as of March, Watford said. </p>
<h2>Casualty Coverage </h2>
<p>Rathgeber was vice chairman of Arch Worldwide Reinsurance
Group. Jon Levy was named chief risk officer and Roderick Romeo
will be chief financial officer. Reinsurers shoulder risk for
primary carriers. </p>
<p>Management is aiming for annualized returns of about 15
percent over time, Rathgeber said. He plans to focus on casualty
lines such as automobile liability, workers'' compensation and
medical malpractice coverage while limiting risks tied to
natural disasters. </p>
<p>It wouldn''t make sense to have this kind of investment
strategy and be heavily into that kind of volatile, capital-intensive reinsurance exposure, he said. </p>
<p>Constantine Iordanou, the CEO of Bermuda-based Arch
Capital, has been diversifying risk through deals including an
agreement last year to add assets from bankrupt mortgage insurer
PMI Group Inc. </p>
<p>Arch slipped 0.8 percent to $57.07 at 10:17 a.m. in New
York, narrowing its gain to about 8.6 percent over the past
year. JPMorgan climbed 0.3 percent and is up 27 percent in the
past 12 months. </p>
<h2>Corporate Debt </h2>
<p>Junk-rated corporate debt worldwide returned 2.9 percent
since Dec. 31, beating global stocks and setting the stage for a
sixth year of gains, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. The bonds now yield 6.1 percent, compared with an
average of about 10 percent in the decade through 2007. Junk
bonds are high-yield, high-risk debt rated below BBB-by Standard
 Poor''s and lower than Baa3 by Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<p>We believe that non-investment-grade credit complements
Watford''s reinsurance strategy, Purnima Puri, HPS''s managing

<p>Ed Dahlberg got 40 calls in one day when he put a Gulfstream G650 up for sale in February. That''s unusual for a private jet -- especially when the asking price tops the $64.5 million on the sticker. </p> <p>We believe this plane''s going to bring north of $75 million, said Dahlberg, president of Manassas, Virginia-based Emerald Aviation Inc. and part-owner of the G650. </p> <p>Barely 15 months after its debut, the world''s biggest and fastest business jet is a corporate status symbol, with owners as high profile as Exxon Mobil Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. The waiting list is almost four years long for a factory-fresh model, whetting appetites among tycoons and chief executive officers when a used G650 hits the market. </p> <p>It''s the must-have airplane if you''re in the top end of the spectrum, said Steve Varsano, founder of London-based Jet Business, who''s sold two pre-owned G650s since November for more than $70 million each to buyers he wouldn''t identify. </p> <p>G650s are also must-have for Gulfstream parent General Dynamics Corp., the tank and submarine maker squeezed by shrinking U.S. defense budgets. The jets helped boost 2013 aerospace revenue 17 percent to $8.12 billion, while combat systems unit revenue fell 23 percent to $6.12 billion. </p> <p>The G650 is doing exceptionally well, said Peter Arment, a Sterne, Agee  Leach Inc. analyst who has a buy rating on Falls Church, Virginia-based General Dynamics. The demand for this plane is going to remain very strong. </p> <h2>Transoceanic Routes </h2> <p>Large, luxury aircraft are the bright spot in a $21 billion private-jet market recovering unevenly from the 2008-09 financial crisis. While orders remain weak for small, personal models like the Mustang from Textron Inc.''s Cessna, corporate fleet managers and billionaires are shopping again for big planes able to make transoceanic routes. </p> <p>Qualcomm''s G650 flew round trip between California and Barcelona before February''s Mobile World Congress in the Spanish city, where then-CEO Paul Jacobs collected an industry award. That jaunt, as chronicled by airline-data tracker FlightAware, was well within the jet''s advertised range of 7,000 nautical miles (12,964 kilometers), enough to reach Beijing from New York without refueling. </p> <p>Propelled by Rolls-Royce engines tucked on either side of the rear of the fuselage, the G650 can reach 627 miles an hour at 30,000 feet (9,100 meters), about 93 percent of the speed of sound. It seats as many as 18 people. To ease jet lag, the cabin air pressure is kept higher than on typical airplanes. </p> <h2>Engine Whisper </h2> <p>On a recent flight from Phoenix on a G650 owned by Honeywell International Inc., takeoff thrust pressed passengers into soft leather seats as the engines whispered. </p> <p>Wood-veneer tables popped out at the touch of a button. Entertainment options included watching satellite television from a seat-belted sofa or gazing out the windows -- billed as the largest on a business jet and fitted with powered shades -- at the red sandstone cliffs of Sedona, Arizona. </p> <p>It''s just unbelievably capable and unbelievably reliable, Honeywell pilot Andy Eldringhoff said as he guided the plane above the Arizona desert at 16,500 feet. CEO Dave Cote is among the users of the jet, which has Honeywell avionics in the cockpit. </p> <p>With more than 50 delivered so far, the G650 has reset the market for business aircraft designed for maximum speed, comfort and distance. There won''t be a competitor in the G650''s class until 2016, when Bombardier Inc.''s Global 7000 is due for its initial handover. </p> <h2>Exclusive Aura </h2> <p>Gulfstream enhances the aura of exclusivity by refusing to let buyers leapfrog by swapping or buying delivery slots, as occurs with commercial jets. The Savannah, Georgia-based company wrote a clause that strictly prohibits contract holders from selling their spots, said Steve Cass, a spokesman. </p> <p>There is no cutting in line, Cass said. Everyone that we deal with is pretty important folks. Once you go down that, it''s a pretty slippery slope. You just don''t want to go there. </p> <p>Gulfstream started taking G650 orders in March 2008 -- six months before the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy triggered a global credit freeze -- and customers stampeded to put down about $3 million and sign purchase contracts, said Jet Business''s Varsano. </p> <p>While Cass said the G650 order book held up during the economic crisis, flight trials were marred by a 2011 crash in New Mexico that killed four Gulfstream employees. U.S. safety officials concluded in 2012 that company pressure to speed up testing caused the accident. Gulfstream President Larry Flynn responded that any failings by the planemaker were inadvertent. </p> <p>Most Profitable? </p> <p>The G650 may become Gulfstream''s most profitable aircraft ever, General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic told investors on Feb. 20 at a Barclays Plc conference. The jet uses 50 percent fewer parts than the smaller G550 and G450 and is assembled at a plant designed for the G650, according to Gulfstream. </p> <p>We don''t know internally how good we can get, but we know we can get a whole lot better, Novakovic said of the plane''s profitability. </p> <p>General Dynamics soared 54 percent to $108.92 in the 12 months ended yesterday, topping the 19 percent gain for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. Montreal-based Bombardier rose 2 percent in the same period. </p> <p>Buyers'' silence about the G650 contrasts with the demand. Corporate touchiness about jet ownership only intensified after U.S. automaker CEOs drew criticism for flying company aircraft to Washington in 2008 to beg Congress for an industry bailout. </p> <h2>Owners'' Silence </h2> <p>Brooke Buchanan, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, confirmed that the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has a G650 while declining to discuss details. Emily Kilpatrick, a spokeswoman for San Diego-based Qualcomm, and Scott Silvestri, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon, declined to comment when asked about the G650s registered to the companies at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. </p> <p>A G650 registered to Dick''s Sporting Goods Inc. was sold in February, according to FAA records that didn''t list the buyer or the terms. The Coraopolis, Pennsylvania-based company didn''t respond to messages requesting comment on the transaction. </p> <p>Gulfstream is famous for secrecy about what''s on the drawing board, and General Dynamics'' Novakovic said the next jets won''t be unveiled until they''re ready to roll out on the tarmac under their own power. </p> <p>Jefferies LLC analyst Howard Rubel said a redo of the G550, the previous flagship, may be under consideration. Jet Business''s Varsano said buyers want other the Gulfstream models to get cabins like the G650''s. Dahlberg, the Virginia broker, said the G650 itself could be modified to extend its range. </p> <p>Gulfstream really hit a home run with the product, said Josh Mesinger, vice president of Mesinger Jet Sales in Boulder, Colorado. There is no other product in the world in service that will fly 7,000 miles. </p> <p>Mesinger was the broker that offered the G650 registered to Dick''s, with an asking price of $73.5 million, according to an online posting. </p> <p>It sold the day the ad appeared. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass and Ian King" date="Apr 02, 2014  2:48 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-02/microsoft-unveils-new-phone-software-with-rival-to-apple-s-siri.html"><headline>Microsoft Unveils Phone Software With Rival to Apple''s Siri</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Microsoft Corp. renewed its push to catch up with Apple Inc. and Google Inc. in mobile devices, unveiling updated Windows Phone software with voice-search features and offering it for free for small phones and tablets. </p> <p>Microsoft, which previously required a licensing fee for Windows, will offer it without charge for handsets and tablets with screens of less than nine inches, Microsoft operating systems chief Terry Myerson said at the company''s Build conference for developers in San Francisco today. Microsoft also showed off a voice-controlled digital assistant called Cortana that is similar to Apple''s Siri, which is part of a new Windows Phone 8.1 software for mobile gadgets. </p> <p>Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, who was appointed to lead the world''s largest software maker in February, is working to remake Microsoft for an era where smartphones and tablets have become central. To do so, he must strike a balance between offering Microsoft''s software for competing platforms while still keeping the company''s Windows operating system as a core focus. Today''s event was designed to re-emphasize the importance of Windows to the Redmond, Washington-based company and to spur adoption of the software. </p> <p>Related:</p>
Apple''s Maestri Takes Top Finance Role Amid Cash Scrutiny
Atop the Electronics World, Samsung Now Chasing Innovation
<p>Reinvigorating the Windows franchise continues to be a key ingredient in Microsoft''s recipe for success as it looks to offset headwinds from the secular challenges in the PC market, Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co., wrote in a note. </p> <h2>Delicate Balance </h2> <p>Nadella''s tricky balancing act was underscored by two Microsoft events last week and this week. The CEO last week debuted Microsoft Office software for Apple''s iPads and said he''ll hold nothing back to get the company''s programs across all devices, in a clear departure from the software maker''s longtime focus on Windows. </p> <p>In contrast, this week''s Build conference puts Windows front-and-center by giving developers tools and tactics to boost Microsoft''s single-digit share in phones and tablets, as well as providing money-making opportunities in a contracting personal-computer market. </p> <p>We''re going to innovate with a challenger mindset, Nadella said at the event. </p> <p>In making Windows free for smaller phones and tablets, Microsoft is working to narrow the gap with Google, which distributes its Android mobile operating system to hardware manufacturers at no cost. Android has become the most widely used software in smartphones and tablets. </p> <h2>Start Menu </h2> <p>Myerson also said the company is restoring the Windows start menu, which will be made available to users as an update. The company yanked the feature from Windows 8, triggering customer complaints. Microsoft also showed Office applications for Windows that are redesigned for use with touch controls, one week after showing similar apps for Office for the iPad. </p> <p>Microsoft Vice President Joe Belfiore said the new Windows Phone 8.1 will have an action center, which is a pull-down menu that gives people access to basic functions regardless of whether programs are already open. The software, which will start rolling out in the next few months on existing phones and on new devices later this month and in early May, also lets users customize their phone''s lock screen and offers new choices for tweaking the start screen. </p> <h2>Cortana Speaks </h2> <p>Cortana, which fully replaces the search function on Windows Phone, according to Belfiore, is named for the artificial-intelligence character in Microsoft''s best-selling Halo Xbox video-game series. </p> <p>Developers outside Microsoft can write their own apps for Cortana, Belfiore said. With users'' permission, Cortana can learn about consumers from their searches, keep track of people they interact with and set up an inner circle of the most important people and who can contact users during the times of day they set as quiet hours. </p> <p>Belfiore demonstrated how he allowed Cortana to scan his e-mail, causing the program to ask him whether to track an Alaska Airlines flight mentioned in an e-mail itinerary. The program can be used to start a Skype call, add a TV show to the user''s Hulu queue or check a friend''s Facebook posts. </p> <p>She''s great at helping me get things done, whether its by talking or typing, Belfiore said. </p> <h2>Windows Share </h2> <p>Nokia Oyj''s handset division, which is being acquired by Microsoft in a deal set to close this month, will begin selling new phones using Windows Phone 8.1, said former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop. The 930 is a high-end device that will debut in June and feature wireless charging, while two cheaper phones designed for emerging markets will become available in May, said Elop, who will become Microsoft''s executive vice president of the devices group when the transaction with Nokia is completed. </p> <p>Windows stands to be the fastest-growing smartphone operating system over the next four years with 30 percent annual growth, according to a Feb. 26 report by researcher IDC. Even at that rate, Windows Phone would only make up 7 percent of the total market in 2018, compared with Google''s Android software at 76 percent Apple''s iOS at 14 percent. </p> <p>In tablets, Windows had 3.4 percent share in 2013, IDC said. For Microsoft''s Surface tablet, the share was 1 percent. </p> <p>Global computer shipments fell a record 10 percent last year and are forecast to continue to decline this year as tablets and smartphones lure consumers away from traditional desktop and notebook designs, according to IDC. Tablet sales volume -- dominated by Apple and Google, whose operating systems account for 95 percent of that market -- will rise an average 16 percent annually through to 2017. </p> <p>One possible boon to Windows developers: Microsoft is working on obtaining tools, via acquisition or development, to make it easier for application developers to target multiple operating systems without having to rewrite software. The company is considering an acquisition or investment in Xamarin Inc., or other companies that enable mobile apps to run on different devices, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. Microsoft may also build those capabilities itself, one of the people said. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="Apr 02, 2014  1:58 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-02/microsoft-says-windows-to-be-free-for-some-mobile-devices.html"><headline>Microsoft Says Windows to Be Free for Some Mobile Devices</headline><body><![CDATA[

screens of less than nine inches, in a move to spur adoption of
the software. </p>
<p>The world''s largest software company has historically made

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and a group
of cable makers including Nexans SA (NEX) were fined a total of 301.6
million euros ($416 million) by the European Union for fixing
the price of high-voltage power cables sold to energy providers. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs shared a fine of 37.3 million euros with
Prysmian SpA (PRY), an Italian cable maker that Goldman Sachs Capital
Partners bought in 2005. Prysmian also shared a 67.3 million-euro fine with its former owner Pirelli  C. SpA. (PC) Nexans SA, the
world''s second-biggest cable maker, was fined 70.7 million
euros, less than the 200 million euros it had booked. </p>
<p>The fines add to a 953 million-euro penalty for car-parts
makers last month and a record 1.7 billion euros last year for
banks and a broker that rigged interest-rate benchmarks.
Breaking up cartels and levying high fines to deter price-fixing
is one of the EU''s priorities, according to Joaquin Almunia, the
bloc''s antitrust chief. </p>
<p>These companies knew very well that what they were doing
was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great
secrecy, Almunia said in an e-mailed statement. Despite this
and through joint efforts by several competition authorities
around the world, we have detected their anti-competitive
agreements and brought them to an end. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil (XOM) Corp., Gazprom OAO (OGZD),
Lukoil OAO (LKOD), Total SA (FP) and Edison SpA were among more than 40
energy companies attending the start of the Croatian
government''s tender for Adriatic Sea oil and gas exploration. </p>
<p>Enel SpA (ENEL), Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE), Petroceltic International
Plc (PCI), Turkish Petroleum Corp., Hunt Oil Co. and Croatia''s INA
Industrija Nafte d.d. were also present in Zagreb as tenders
went out for 29 exploration blocks of Adriatic seabed, according
to Economy Ministry spokesman Tomislav Cerovec. </p>
<p>Croatia, which is seeking new revenue to revive its
economy, will close the tenders on Nov. 3. The terms are based
on a production-sharing agreement model with a five-year
exploration phase and a 25-year production phase. </p>
<p>We have a great interest, Economy Minister Ivan Vrdoljak told reporters in Zagreb. A successful tender will
make Croatia a key gas and oil provider in this part of Europe,
and our gas will be the cheapest in the region. </p>
<p>Croatia, which joined the European Union in July, needs
investment to revive growth after five years of economic
recession. The country revised laws on hydrocarbon research in
June, easing the process for gaining permits to tap more of its
own resources and reduce dependence on Russian gas. </p>
<h2>EU Financing </h2>
<p>Croatia may also seek EU financing for a planned liquefied-natural-gas terminal on the Adriatic island of Krk, Vrdoljak
told Bloomberg News today. A location permit for the terminal
will probably be issued in June, he said. </p>
<p>INA is very interested in the tender, and may take part
in it alone or with a partner, Zoltan Aldott, head of the
management board at INA, told Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The blocks were drawn up after Norwegian seismic-data
company Spectrum ASA (SPU) completed the imaging of 35,000 square
kilometers (13,500 square miles) of Croatia''s seabed last year. </p>
<p>Croatia may hold as much oil and gas in the Adriatic Sea as
Italy does in the same branch of the Mediterranean,Vrdoljak
said on Oct. 29, citing initial results of the seismic mapping. </p>
<p>INA, Croatia''s largest refiner, operates offshore platforms
in the northern Adriatic with Edison SpA and Eni. Zagreb-based
INA, controlled by Hungary''s Mol Nyrt., has so far had a
monopoly on exploration in Croatia. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $24.1
million of notes tied to the Indian rupee, the largest such
offering since November 2010. </p>
<p>The one-year securities, issued March 28, yield a maximum
of 16.3 percent if called after 12 months, according to a
prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. If the Indian currency strengthens at all or
depreciates no more than 1.5 percent by quarterly intervals, the
bank will automatically redeem the notes. Investors suffer
losses if the rupee drops more than 15 percent. </p>
<p>The South Asian country''s currency gained 3.1 percent to
59.89 per U.S. dollar during the first three months of the year,
its biggest quarterly advance since September 2012. The currency
strengthened because India raised interest rates and changed
regulations to make it easier for foreigners to invest there,
said Win Thin, global head of emerging-market strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman  Co. in New York. </p>
<p>India hiked rates, delivering several hawkish surprises
last year, Thin said in a telephone interview. The rupee could
strengthen to around 58 per dollar in about three months, he
said. </p>
<p>The rupee reached an eight-month high on March 28. It''s the
third-best performing emerging-market currency against the
greenback, advancing 2.7 percent this year as of 5:48 p.m. in
New York. </p>
<p>Foreign investors have bought $11.1 billion of Indian
stocks and bonds this year through April 2, the most among eight
Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will move its San
Francisco offices to the city''s largest tower as it relocates to
the heart of the financial district from the technology-heavy
South of Market area. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest software maker will move in December to
Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)''s 555 California St., San Francisco''s
largest building by square footage and second-tallest, said
Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft. He wouldn''t comment further on the relocation plans. </p>
<p>San Francisco is the center of the U.S. new economy
after four years of sustained rent growth, according to
property-research firm Green Street Advisors Inc. Office rents
rose 6.8 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier to
$57.21 a square foot on average, with vacancies little changed
at 11.3 percent, brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL) said. Asking
rents have climbed 70 percent since 2010, when rates bottomed at
$33.57 a square foot. </p>
<p>Microsoft had the ability to go anywhere in the city,
David Greenbaum, president of Vornado''s New York office
division, said today in a telephone interview. The 555
California building is incredibly iconic both in San Francisco
and the country. </p>
<p>Microsoft will occupy about 50,000 square feet (4,600
square meters) on the second and third floors, said a person
with knowledge of the plans. Rent will be about $62 a square
foot for the two floors, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the details are private. </p>
<h2>Street View </h2>
<p>Greenbaum declined to comment on financial terms. He said
the tower''s second floor has 27-foot (8-meter) ceilings,
allowing Microsoft to establish a unique presence visible from
the street. </p>
<p>Asking rates in San Francisco''s north financial district
averaged $58 a square foot in the first quarter, up 7.8 percent
from a year earlier, according to Jones Lang LaSalle.
Microsoft''s Yammer Inc. unit, with 76,000 square feet in Twitter
Inc.''s headquarters building in the Central Market area, won''t
be affected by the parent company''s move, the person with
knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>The 52-story tower between Montgomery and Kearny streets
has 1.5 million square feet of office space and 45,000 square
feet of retail, according to Vornado''s website. At 779 feet, the
building is surpassed in San Francisco only by the 853-foot
Transamerica Pyramid, according to property website Emporis.com. </p>
<p>The California Street high-rise, opened in 1969, is the
main building in a complex that was known as Bank of America
Center before the financial company moved to Charlotte, North
Carolina. The skyscraper was featured in the 1974 disaster film
The Towering Inferno, according to Emporis. </p>
<p>Microsoft currently occupies space at Westfield Group (WDC)''s San
Francisco Centre, the city''s biggest mall. The property, at
Market and Fifth streets, is between the Union Square shopping
district and the SOMA area, where companies including Google
Inc. and Salesforce.com Inc. have offices. </p>

services, which include sending out account statements and other
communications to participants, is Boston-based Fidelity
Investments. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, whose recordkeeping business lags behind those of
firms such as Fidelity, Vanguard Group Inc. and Prudential
Financial Inc., is selling its unit as recordkeeping for
workers'' retirement accounts has become less lucrative for firms
that don''t have scale. The deal will catapult Great-West from
the seventh-largest recordkeeper of 401(k)-type plans by assets
in 2012, according to research firm Cerulli Associates, allowing
it to compete with the biggest firms. </p>
<p>Bringing together these platforms allows us to be a
market leader, said Robert Reynolds, who was named last month
as president and chief executive officer of Great-West Lifeco
U.S., which owns Great-West Financial and Putnam Investments.
You can make money in this business. </p>
<h2>Top Priorities'' </h2>
<p>The sale is a shift for New York-based JPMorgan, whose head
of retirement, Michael Falcon, said in March 2011 that getting a
bigger share of retirement assets was one of the top
priorities at the bank. JPMorgan at the time had roughly
doubled its sales force dedicated to retirement plans including
pitches for its recordkeeping services. </p>
<p>It''s not easy to see anything like this, Falcon, head
of retirement at JPMorgan''s asset-management unit, said in an
interview today. </p>
<p>JPMorgan will continue to sell investments to retirement
plans, Falcon said. </p>
<p>It''s a large and growing business on the investment
side, he said. </p>
<p>Americans held $23 trillion in retirement assets as of Dec.
31, of which $4.2 trillion was in 401(k) plans. Administrators
of 401(k)s are paid for their recordkeeping service also may
make money from investments in the plan if they are managed by
their own firm or through arrangements with other money managers
known as revenue-sharing. </p>
<h2>Cross-Selling </h2>
<p>Many recordkeepers also see the administration of 401(k)
accounts as an avenue for cross-selling other products to
workers such as individual retirement accounts when they retire
or change jobs. Those accounts usually have higher fees,
according to a 2011 report by the Government Accountability
Office. </p>
<p>The proliferation of lower-fee products and more cost-conscious employers have contributed to declining expenses for
401(k) investments over the past 15 years, data compiled by the
Washington-based Investment Company Institute show. </p>
<p>The transaction is expected to close during the third
quarter of this year pending regulatory approval. More than
1,000 employees of JPMorgan''s retirement-services unit will move
to Great-West. </p>
<p>The deal won''t have a material impact on JPMorgan Chase''s
earnings, according to the bank''s statement. The two companies
said workers with accounts administered by JPMorgan should
expect no disruption. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is unfreezing a
money transfer from a Russian embassy in Central Asia to an
insurer linked to U.S.-sanctioned bank after getting a go-ahead
from regulators. </p>
<p>Following consultation with our regulators, we are
processing this transaction, JPMorgan said today in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The reversal comes two days after Russia''s Foreign Ministry
decried the move by the biggest U.S. bank blocking a payment
from its embassy in Astana, Kazakhstan, to Sogaz Insurance Group
as illegal and absurd. Sogaz is part-owned by OAO Bank
Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based lender under U.S. sanctions
relating to the Ukraine crisis. </p>
<p>U.S. President Barack Obama announced the action against
Bank Rossiya last month as part of a broadening of sanctions
that targeted government officials and allies of Russian
President Vladimir Putin, whose associates own Bank Rossiya. The
embassy''s transaction was for less than $5,000, a person with
knowledge of the dispute said, asking not to be identified
because such transfers aren''t public. </p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry said the hostile action by
JPMorgan bank was a grossest violation of international law,
according to its April 1 statement. </p>
<p>A Bank Rossiya unit reduced its stake in Sogaz to 48.5
percent from 51 percent on March 11, according to a regulatory
disclosure on the insurer''s website. The U.S. added Bank Rossiya
and its billionaire shareholder Yury Kovalchuk to an extended
sanctions list on March 20 following Russia''s annexation of
Crimea. </p>
<p>Russia''s Finance Ministry picked JPMorgan last year to help
improve the country''s standing among U.S. credit-rating firms.
The bank was also short-listed to advise on the government''s
privatization program. </p>
<p>As with all U.S. financial institutions that operate
globally, we are subject to specific regulatory requirements,
New York-based JPMorgan said in an April 1 statement. We will
continue to seek guidance from the U.S. government on
implementing their recent sanctions. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein a $6 million cash
bonus to be paid out in three years if he meets certain targets,
on top of $23 million in 2013 compensation. </p>
<p>The award can shrink or grow depending on whether the firm
achieves return-on-equity and book-value targets, the New York-based bank said today in a filing. The long-term incentive was
$5 million last year and $3 million in 2012. </p>
<p>Blankfein, 59, was the highest-paid CEO among peers at the
largest U.S. banks for a second straight year. Goldman Sachs had
an 11 percent return on equity in 2013, topping its largest Wall
Street rivals, as it cut compensation costs amid revenue that
was little changed. The stock rose 39 percent last year, beating
the 33 percent gain for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials
Index. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, which already
gives a majority of top executives'' pay in restricted stock,
have been seeking ways to encourage managers to focus on long-term performance. </p>
<p>Details of Blankfein''s pay were contained in the bank''s
proxy statement for its annual shareholders'' meeting, which will
be held on May 16 in Irving, Texas. </p>
<p>Blankfein''s total compensation package of $29 million
topped the $20 million given to JPMorgan Chase  Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, 58, and the $18 million for Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, 55. Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian T. Moynihan, 54,
received $14 million and Citigroup Inc.''s Michael Corbat, 53,
got $14.5 million. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will probably
join Morgan Stanley (MS) as global coordinator on the initial public
offering of Emaar Properties PJSC''s (EMAAR) shopping malls and retail
business, three people with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>The banks were informally hired, though no documents have
yet been signed, said the people, who asked not to be named
because the information is private. Emaar is also appointing
lead managers for the sale, the people said. An official at
Emaar who didn''t want to be identified said no advisers have
been appointed. Spokesmen for JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Emaar, developer of the world''s tallest tower in Dubai,
hired Morgan Stanley to advise on what will be the largest share
sale in the Middle East and Africa since 2008, Chairman Mohamed Alabbar said in a March 18 interview. The company plans to raise
8 billion dirhams ($2.2 billion) to 9 billion dirhams from the
sale as a tourism boom adds to retail sales in Dubai. </p>
<p>Middle Eastern companies are taking advantage of rebounding
stock markets and asset prices to raise funds through IPOs and
secondary offerings. Emirates Reit, the United Arab Emirates''
first real-estate investment trust, said last week it increased
its share sale to $175 million to accommodate investor demand
for Dubai''s first IPO for at least five years. </p>

<p>Experimental breast cancer drugs from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) slowed or halted growth of advanced tumors in studies, potentially adding a new treatment option for patients and top-selling therapies for the companies. </p> <p>Pfizer''s palbociclib doubled to 20.2 months the time in which patients'' advanced breast cancer didn''t progress, the drugmaker said today. In an unrelated study, Lilly''s drug, bemaciclib, aided 61 percent of patients with metastatic, hormone-sensitive breast cancer, meaning the size of their tumors shrunk by 30 percent or didn''t increase for 24 weeks. </p> <p>Doctors and investors have been awaiting results for the medicines, part of a class called cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors. The therapies offer a new treatment avenue for about 80 percent of patients whose breast tumors are hormone receptor-positive. Palbociclib is projected to sell $3.11 billion in 2020 as it expands to fight other cancers. </p> <p>We took a new drug and asked how it works in a specific set of breast cancers based on science, said Richard Finn, an associate professor at the University of California at Los Angeles''s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, and co-principal investigator of Pfizer''s study. This is really the type of benefit we''re aiming for, and it''s the type of benefit that results from a rational development program. </p>
