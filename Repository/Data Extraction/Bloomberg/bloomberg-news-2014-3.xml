this year, including more than 800 senior bankers, after fourth-quarter profit tumbled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. SP 500 Tumbles Most Since June as Treasuries Advance With
Gold &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 3 (Bloomberg) -- The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index
dropped the most since June and emerging-market stocks extended
the worst start to a year since 2009 as data from China to the

gold rallied while copper capped its longest slump in 18 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Two Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 24 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. equities rallied, with the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index touching an intraday record and all

&lt;p&gt;Feb. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The founders of the Resolution
Project don&#8217;t dwell on generosity or charity when they describe

Economy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Janet

&lt;p&gt;Feb. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Payrolls rose less than projected in

&lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Why Marrying Your Equal Can Boost U.S. Inequality: Peter
Orszag &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Rich and poor Americans are slowly
but surely staking out separate lives. Increasingly, they have
been moving to different communities, and more and more they are
also marrying people of similar income and educational
backgrounds. This is a phenomenon social scientists call
assortative mating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Credit Suisse CEO Joins Wall Street Clueless Club: Jonathan
Weil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 27 (Bloomberg) -- One of the best lines to come out of
the financial crisis was by Michael Lewis in a March 2008 column
for Bloomberg News: &#8220;Jimmy Cayne plays bridge, and Stan O&#8217;Neal
golfs while their firms collapse, not because they don&#8217;t care
their firms are collapsing, but because they don&#8217;t know that
their firms are collapsing,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Few things in journalism are more
amusing than dueling headlines from competing news organizations
on a big breaking financial news story. And we have some doozies
to enjoy thanks to a disclosure yesterday by Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. and Graham Holdings Co., former publisher of the Washington
Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Buffett Pal Munger Is Head of Very Weird Company: Jonathan
Weil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Charles Munger is the chairman of
Daily Journal Corp., a small California newspaper publisher. He
also is Warren Buffett&#8217;s longtime business partner and Berkshire
Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s vice chairman. So it&#8217;s understandable why many
investors would be curious to know what stocks Daily Journal
owns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MULTIMEDIA &lt;/h2&gt;

to present the Fed&#8217;s semi-annual report to Congress. The

snow storm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. BMW Woos Driving Machine Purists With New M235i Coupe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 6 (Bloomberg) --Bayerische Motoren Werke AG presents
its new 2 Series model, the M235i, in a company video. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. SP 500 Extends Record as Treasuries Drop on Economic
Optimism &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose
to another record and Treasuries fell amid improving U.S.
consumer confidence and speculation the Federal Reserve will
continue to support the economy. The euro strengthened after

Advances &lt;/p&gt;

Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank may alter its

</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="Mar 03, 2014  8:11 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-03/microsoft-s-nadella-shakes-up-staff-with-mark-penn-s-appointment.html"><headline>Microsoft&#8217;s Nadella Shakes Up Staff With Penn&#8217;s Appointment</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s newly appointed
Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, in an effort to reignite
growth, is shuffling management and putting former political
operative Mark Penn in the new role of chief strategy officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Bates, who was passed over for the CEO job, is leaving
the company, with Eric Rudder, the head of advanced strategy,
taking over his duties on an interim basis, Microsoft said today
in a memo to employees. Tami Reller, the executive vice
president in charge of marketing, is also leaving and being
replaced by Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shakeup is the most extensive yet for Nadella, who was
named CEO in February after a five-month search and is tasked
with speeding up a turnaround at the world&#8217;s biggest software
maker. He&#8217;ll be leaning on a former political strategist in
Penn, who worked on Hillary Clinton&#8217;s failed 2008 presidential
bid. More recently, Penn, 60, developed Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;Don&#8217;t Get
Scroogled&#8221; advertising campaign, a political-style attack on
Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s aggressive,&#8221; Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co., said of Penn. &#8220;Maybe this will add a little
testosterone to the organization to counter the fact that Satya
is more of a deep thinker.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penn&#8217;s background is in public relations -- he spent six
years as CEO of Burson-Marsteller. His aggressive style puts him
at odds with some managers, who were uncomfortable with the
Scroogled campaign, said people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Super Bowl Ad &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#8217;s also helped develop less controversial ads like
Microsoft&#8217;s first national Super Bowl commercial this year. In
the ad, former football player Steve Gleason, who suffers from
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and can&#8217;t speak, narrated
using Microsoft technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;His focus on using data to quickly evaluate and evolve
our campaigns has driven new insights and understanding,&#8221;
Nadella said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of Penn&#8217;s job will involve helping the company decide
where to invest, and he will join the product leadership team,
said a person with knowledge of the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overhaul follows last month&#8217;s announcement that
hardware group chief Julie Larson-Green will move to the
applications and services unit. Thom Gruhler, a vice president
who oversaw Windows and Windows Phone marketing, will lead
marketing for the applications and services group, people with
knowledge of the matter said. Reller notified employees of that
change in an e-mail, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mobile Laggard &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 1.4 percent to $37.78 at the close in
New York. The stock has risen 3.9 percent since Nadella&#8217;s
appointment on Feb. 4, and has trailed the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index in three of the past four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella, a 22-year Microsoft veteran, is the company&#8217;s
third CEO after Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. He&#8217;s charged with
accelerating expansion at a company that hasn&#8217;t seen sales
growth exceed 6 percent since 2011. Microsoft&#8217;s investments in
mobile haven&#8217;t put a dent in Google and Apple Inc.&#8217;s control of
the smartphone market, while cloud applications from competitors
pose an increasing threat to Microsoft&#8217;s flagship Windows
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nadella is trying things out,&#8221; said Moerdler, who has
the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft. He said he expects
additional changes in senior leadership, including possible
outside hires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Job Split &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bates was among the leading internal candidates for the top
job, along with Nadella and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner. Bates, a former Cisco Systems Inc. executive, ran
Microsoft&#8217;s Skype unit before becoming an executive vice
president in July. He doesn&#8217;t have another job lined up and
plans to take some time to figure out his next move, said a
person familiar with his plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reller, who joined Microsoft in 2001, was also promoted to
executive vice president in July and led marketing for the
Windows 8 operating system. Capossela had been named chief
marketing officer back in 2011, though his role was reduced in
July when Ballmer split marketing between Reller and Penn, with
the latter taking on advertising strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penn&#8217;s ties to the Clintons date back to the 1990s and his
work in the re-election campaign for President Bill Clinton. He
worked on Hillary Clinton&#8217;s campaign until April 2008, when he
came under fire for his firm&#8217;s role in promoting trade with
Colombia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Microsoft, Penn has a longstanding relationship with
Ballmer and Gates and advised the company during its antitrust
case with the U.S. government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is unveiling a new
Web-based Office application that uses search and social data to
display a user&#8217;s most important files and projects, seeking to
boost sales and fend off competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app, code-named Oslo, has versions for Windows 8, the
Internet and mobile devices, including those based on Apple
Inc.&#8217;s and Google Inc.&#8217;s software for smartphones and tablets,
Jeff Teper, a Microsoft vice president, said in an interview.
The first Oslo programs, probably for Windows 8 and the Web,
will be available in the second half of 2014, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft wants to move more customers to cloud-based
versions of its Office productivity software, which are
delivered via the Internet, in order to boost growth and fend
off similar applications. Cloud programs are sold as
subscriptions, providing more regular sales compared with the
cycle of customers buying a version of Office every few years,
said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the corporate side, they have a belief they can
significantly differentiate the Microsoft offering from others
with search and social features,&#8221; Moerdler said. &#8220;They want to
make Office massively more interactive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product incorporates features from two Microsoft
acquisitions: The 2012 purchase of Yammer Inc., which provides
social-networking tools for companies, and the acquisition in
2008 of Norway&#8217;s Fast Search  Transfer ASA, a search technology
developer. The Oslo code name is a nod to the Norwegian unit&#8217;s
team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Office Graph &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of opening Outlook, Word or Excel, users of the new
app will have a dashboard of projects and files they&#8217;re working
on, as well as topics they should know about and those popular
among co-workers. Oslo will also let users search by categories,
such as &#8220;modified by me,&#8221; &#8220;shared with me&#8221; and &#8220;trending
around me.&#8221; Clicking on a colleague brings up not just that
person&#8217;s manager, peers and direct reports, but others working
on projects across an entire company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underlying Oslo is what Microsoft is calling the Office
Graph, an idea similar to the social graph, a term popularized
by Facebook Inc. for the depiction of personal relationships,
said Adam Pisoni, the Yammer co-founder who is now a Microsoft
vice president. The Office graph would act as a repository of
data culled from a user&#8217;s social relationships and actions.
Microsoft will also open up the data so other business-software
developers can create apps that can exchange such information
between Office and their programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Office unit now part of the same business as
Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search, future versions of Oslo will integrate
Web-search data from Bing, said Teper. Microsoft is still
working on pricing and will begin testing the software with a
few chosen customers in the next month or so, Teper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Don&#8217;t think of this as the version of Word you&#8217;ve got on
your machine,&#8221; Teper said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a really new experience for
how the office should work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank
that was lead underwriter on Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s May bond offering,
named the technology firm&#8217;s chief financial officer, Peter Oppenheimer, to its board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oppenheimer, 51, whose appointment expands the board to 13
members, is joining immediately and will sit on all four of its
committees, New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, was
chosen to underwrite the majority of Apple&#8217;s then-record $17
billion bond offering last year. It was the Cupertino,
California-based company&#8217;s first issuance in 17 years. Apple
also hired Goldman Sachs in 2012 to help it improve transparency
and governance, including what to do with its more than $100
billion in cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Peter&#8217;s 25 years of broad experience across important
industries will add a valuable perspective to our board of
directors,&#8221; Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReNew Power Ventures Pvt., a clean-energy developer backed by Goldman Sachs Group (GS) Inc., won the
most capacity in a government solar auction in the central
Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReNew was awarded a license to build a 30-megawatt
photovoltaic plant after bidding to sell power at 6,970 rupees
($112) a megawatt-hour, according to S.R. Mohanty, secretary of
new and renewable energy in the state. That&#8217;s about 19 percent
below the global average price for electricity generated by
panels, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India, the third-biggest energy consumer on Earth, plans a
six-fold increase in solar capacity by 2017 to reduce blackouts
as plunging panel prices help photovoltaic projects compete on
costs with coal and gas-fired plants. The government is using
competitive tenders to avoid European-style subsidies, where
above-market tariffs for wind and solar farms are common. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madhya Pradesh awarded 100 megawatts of capacity in total.
Developers promising to sell power at the cheapest rates won.
Himgiri Energy Ventures offered the lowest bid of 6,470 rupees a
megawatt-hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winners also included Today Homes  Infrastructure
Pvt., Bhadresh Trading Corp., Ujaas Energy Ltd. (UJEL)&#8217;s unit KRBL and
Focal Energy Holdings Ltd., according to a list sent by Mohanty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) and Samsung Electronics
Co. (005930) joined Chinese mobile phone makers in expressing concern to
China that Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s bid to take over Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s phone
business may result in higher patent licensing fees, two
government officials familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and Samsung asked China&#8217;s Ministry of Commerce to
make sure that the 5.44 billion euro ($7.5 billion) bid doesn&#8217;t
result in higher fees on wireless technology patents that will
remain with Nokia, the two officials said, asking not to be
identified because the request wasn&#8217;t made public. They&#8217;re also
concerned Microsoft will gain more power over the smartphone
market and may abuse its patents, according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies join domestic vendors including Huawei
Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. that asked China&#8217;s regulators to
set conditions on the deal, according to the officials.
Microsoft and Nokia announced the deal in September after the
Finnish company lost ground in the smartphone market to Apple
Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone and devices running Google&#8217;s Android platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, Microsoft is buying the hardware business
while leaving most of the wireless patents in Nokia&#8217;s control.
Microsoft won European Union approval for the bid on Dec. 4,
while regulators said they would monitor Nokia&#8217;s licensing
practices after the close of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Ministry of Commerce is conducting an anti-monopoly
review and is likely to approve the deal, the officials said.
The question is whether the ministry will demand the companies
guarantee that the agreement doesn&#8217;t result in higher patent
fees, the officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ministry Review &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google spokesman Taj Meadows and Samsung spokeswoman Jini
Park declined to comment on whether their companies had raised
any such concerns with regulators in China. Two phone calls
today to the press office of the Ministry of Commerce in Beijing
went unanswered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This merger application is currently under MOFCOM&#8217;s
review and we have no further comment,&#8221; Joanna Li, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Microsoft, said in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZTE Corp. (763) plans to add Windows Phone devices to its
offerings, Microsoft said last month. Samsung Electronics Co.
and Huawei Technologies Co. already make Windows phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portion of mobile phones running Windows is projected
to almost double to 7 percent in 2018, from 3.9 percent this
year, Framingham, Massachusetts-based market researcher
International Data Corp. reported in February. The share running
Google&#8217;s Android system will drop to 76 percent, from 78.9
percent in the same period, IDC reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) won a U.S. judge&#8217;s ruling that a multibillion-dollar pollution judgment issued in Ecuador was procured by fraud, making it less likely that plaintiffs will collect the $9.5 billion award. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan said today that the second-largest U.S. oil company provided enough evidence that a 2011 judgment on behalf of rain forest dwellers in the country&#8217;s Lago Agrio area was secured by bribing a judge and ghostwriting court documents. Kaplan oversaw a seven-week nonjury trial over Chevron&#8217;s allegations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision in the Lago Agrio case was obtained by corrupt means,&#8221; Kaplan said in an opinion that gave Chevron a sweeping victory. &#8220;The defendants here may not be allowed to benefit from that in any way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, was ordered to pay $19 billion to a group of farmers and fishermen by the Ecuadorean court. The award was reduced to $9.5 billion on Nov. 12 by the Ecuadorean National Court of Justice, the nation&#8217;s highest tribunal. That's almost half of its 2013 profit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Ecuadorean villagers, and activists working on their behalf, argued the oil producer should be held financially responsible for pollution of the Amazon rainforest by Texaco Inc. from the 1960s through the early 1990s. Chevron, which bought Texaco in 2001, claims the company already paid $40 million to clean up its share of the drilling contamination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s former Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said he&#8217;s sorry he didn&#8217;t combine hardware and software development sooner after the company missed out on Apple Inc.&#8217;s smartphone success. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The thing I regret is that we didn&#8217;t put the hardware and the software together soon enough,&#8221; Ballmer said in a talk at Oxford University&#8217;s Said Business School today. Still, &#8220;if you really want to bring a vision to market, it is helpful to be able to conceive and deliver the hardware and the software. Our company is in the process of building new muscle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the world&#8217;s largest software maker fell behind in mobile, Microsoft has had more success than most and is building up the capabilities to catch up, he said. Ballmer stepped down from the CEO role at Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft last month, replaced by the company&#8217;s head of enterprise and cloud services, Satya Nadella, after a five-month search. Ballmer remains on the board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re pretty genius in our business if you&#8217;re a one-trick pony,&#8221; Ballmer said. &#8220;In our company, I&#8217;m very proud of the fact that we&#8217;ve done at least two tricks. Tricks are worth billions and billions of dollars.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those two tricks were the invention of the modern personal computer, with its Windows operating system and Office software, and bringing microprocessor technology into data centers, he said. For the next, Ballmer agreed to a $7.2 billion deal to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset unit in September, accelerating Microsoft&#8217;s expansion into hardware. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Excessive Price? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a note today, credit-ratings company Fitch Ratings called the price Microsoft is paying for Nokia&#8217;s handset business &#8220;excessive.&#8221; The firm cited a deterioration in the user base for Windows-based phones and said Microsoft may incur significant future severance costs from the deal, though it also said the acquisition is &#8220;a function of strategic necessity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer said it&#8217;s also tricky to measure success at new technology companies. He pointed to Facebook Inc.&#8217;s $19 billion deal for the messaging platform WhatsApp Inc. as an example of how difficult it can be to value increasingly cheap-to-build startups. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If your goal was to sell the company, they had the right goal set -- low cost to 450 million, or whatever the heck number of users, and sell for $19 billion,&#8221; Ballmer said. &#8220;Is it a fad? Well, probably not. I don&#8217;t know whether they&#8217;ll be successful or not, but you do have to really sit there and say, what&#8217;s my goal? Will that asset ever be worth anything?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cost of starting up companies for cloud-based services is becoming cheaper, and companies should look beyond user numbers to measure success. WhatsApp will ultimately be deemed successful when they convert their user base into something that generates &#8220;enough revenue to pay off.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Amy Thomson in London at athomson6@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nikkei 225 Stock Average futures and
options contracts stopped trading in Osaka for more than 20
minutes today due to a &#8220;human operational error,&#8221; the
derivatives bourse operator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikkei 225 large and mini contracts halted a little after
11 a.m. Tokyo time, Naoya Takahashi, a spokesman for Japan
Exchange Group Inc., said by telephone. They resumed at about
11:30 a.m., he said. Nikkei 225 options also stopped trading,
according to a statement on the Osaka Securities Exchange
website. The bourse operator has confirmed the problem was
caused by human error, OSE spokesman Masahiro Yada said.
Takahashi earlier said it could have been due to a system issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Japanese equity measure are traded in Osaka, 
Singapore and Chicago. Contracts due March 14 traded at 14,720 
in Osaka as of 11:04 a.m., and 14,710 at 11:30 a.m., according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts rose 0.6 percent to
14,720 as of 1:42 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The exchange will be worried that Singapore Exchange will
be seen as a better exchange by clients and more robust,&#8221;said
Stuart Beavis, head of institutional equity derivatives at
Vantage Capital Markets in Hong Kong. &#8220;Some clients can only
trade Osaka so they will not be happy. Basically most option
traders use Osaka, so during that period virtually nothing was
traded and not many people switched to Singapore.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Previous Disruption &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disruption comes exactly one year after a software
error forced a halt to trading of some derivatives on the Osaka
bourse, causing volume to plunge more than 90 percent. The Tokyo
and Osaka derivatives exchanges plan to merge their systems to
use Osaka Securities Exchange&#8217;s J-Gate trading function on March
24. Whether this will continue as planned will be announced on
March 22, Takahashi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nikkei 225 Stock Average, a measure of the underlying
cash equities, surged 57 percent last year amid efforts by Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe and the Bank of Japan to stimulate the
economy and exit deflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPX earned about 7.3 billion yen ($72 million) from Nikkei
225 futures and options participation fees in the nine months
through Dec. 31. Trading volume for its futures surged 61
percent in the period from a year earlier, while options
turnover soared 124 percent, according to an earnings release. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dish Network Corp. (DISH) reached a
groundbreaking agreement to carry Walt Disney Co. programming,
gaining rights to offer Disney, ABC and ESPN shows over the Web
in addition to its satellite pay-TV service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiyear deal, which also ends legal standoff between
the companies over Dish&#8217;s AutoHop ad-skipping technology, is the
first between Disney and a pay-TV provider to include so-called
over-the-top program rights. It will allow Englewood, Colorado-based Dish to offer Disney shows as part of a future  Web-based
subscription-TV service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The creation of this agreement has really been about
predicting the future of television with a visionary and
forward-leaning partner,&#8221; Joseph P. Clayton, Dish&#8217;s chief
executive officer, said in a statement yesterday. The deal
creates &#8220;a model from which to deliver exciting new services
tomorrow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In signing Disney, Dish and its chairman, Charlie Ergen,
gain a head start against other pay-TV providers contemplating
selling monthly programming packages over the Internet. Such
products would break cable-TV companies free of their geographic
boundaries, and allow satellite systems such as Dish to offer
interactive features their services now lack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phones, Tablets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Disney agreement, Dish customers will have access
to shows via televisions, smartphones, tablets, game consoles
and other connected devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish, the second-largest U.S. satellite-TV service, and
Disney, the largest entertainment company, reached the deal
after months of negotiations. As part of the accord, Dish will
delay the availability of its AutoHop feature, which lets
customers skip ads on recorded programs on the broadcast
networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AutoHop will now be available three days after the original
broadcast. Previously it was available after 24 hours. The
three-day window is important to broadcast networks because they
can sell advertising based on the extended viewing, Disney
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said in a
conference call last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We knew early on we had a responsibility with this deal
to not only do what was best for our business, but to also
position our industry for future growth,&#8221; Anne Sweeney, co-chairman of Disney&#8217;s Media Networks division, said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AutoHop Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is the first content renewal for Dish with a major
television network since it launched AutoHop, Drew Crum, an
analyst with Stifel, Nicolaus  Co., said in a research note. It
provides opportunities for incremental revenue at Disney and
removes the risk of a blackout, said the analyst, who recommends
buying Disney stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AutoHop, introduced in May 2012, embroiled Dish in
litigation with ABC, CBS Corp., Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s NBC and 21st
Century Fox Inc.&#8217;s Fox over the feature. The deal announced
yesterday dismisses the litigation between Disney and Dish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish was little changed yesterday at $58.88 in New York
trading. Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 1.7 percent
to $79.46. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and the
World Bank said they will invest $132 million to push banks in
developing economies to lend to women-owned businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money will fund a new facility run by the World Bank&#8217;s
private-sector arm that will extend lines of credit and share
risks with local banks to ensure they give female entrepreneurs
access to financing for their small and medium-size companies.
The two contributors plan to raise an additional $468 million
from other investors, the World Bank said today in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gender equality is smart economics and a key driver of
development,&#8221; World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in a
speech in Washington announcing the partnership today. &#8220;We need
to do more so that investing in women becomes mainstream by
businesses and financial institutions alike.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank estimates that women-owned companies face a $300
billion credit gap, made worse in some countries by unfavorable
regulation. Closing that gap would raise income per capita
across the main developing economies, with Brazil and Vietnam
gaining the most, according to Goldman Sachs research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank&#8217;s International Finance Corp. unit will
invest $100 million in the so-called Women Entrepreneurs
Opportunity Facility, with Goldman Sachs providing $32 million,
the World Bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

Isabelle Ealet and Ashok Varadhan, co-heads of the firm&#8217;s
securities division. He was named a partner in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
has said his New York-based firm is committed to its commodities
unit, even as rivals such as Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. exit parts of theirs. The Federal Reserve said earlier this
year that it&#8217;s considering new limits on banks&#8217; trading and
warehousing of physical commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Karl has had a substantial commercial impact on our
market-leading commodities franchise,&#8221; Ealet, Salame and
Varadhan wrote in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spark Spread reported the departure earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payment networks, retailers and
banks will continue to face significant costs to address fraud
as hackers find new ways to steal data, according to Byron Pollitt, chief financial officer of Visa Inc. (V) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an investment cycle that never ends,&#8221; Pollitt
said today at a technology conference in San Francisco. &#8220;The
resourcefulness, the intellect, the level of innovativeness in
the fraud sector is absolutely amazing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders and merchants are under pressure to convert from
magnetic strips to microchip technology that thwarts hackers
after millions of consumer records were breached at retailers
including Target Corp. One reason the conversion hasn&#8217;t happened
yet is because it&#8217;s expensive for merchants to upgrade their
systems and for lenders to issue new cards, said Pollitt, whose
company is the world&#8217;s biggest bank-card network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s high investment and in the absence of a Target
catalyst, I doubt that we would be on the track we are on
today,&#8221; Pollitt said. The chip will address about 70 percent of
fraud, he said. Including a requirement that consumers enter
personal identification numbers, or PINs, would &#8220;dramatically&#8221;
slow its implementation because about two-thirds of retailers
don&#8217;t have the necessary equipment, Pollitt said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express Co., Foster City, California-based Visa
and MasterCard Inc. have given most U.S. merchants and issuers
until October 2015 to adopt chips -- named EMV for founders
EuroPay International, MasterCard and Visa. Those that refuse
would assume liability for counterfeit card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are also pushing retailers to use &#8220;tokenization,&#8221;
where some account information is replaced with a digital ID for
online and mobile purchases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
generated one-third of its profit from trading last year, hired
Kayhan Mirza from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) as global head of
foreign-exchange trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirza accepted a position as partner at Goldman Sachs,
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said
today by phone. DuVally declined to comment on reporting lines
in the business. Guy Saidenberg has held the role of global head
of foreign-exchange trading at Goldman Sachs. He declined to
comment when reached at his office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
investment banks declined 9 percent in 2013, according to
industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in October that the
bank&#8217;s currency business had &#8220;difficulty managing inventory&#8221;
in the third quarter as the firm posted its worst fixed-income
trading revenue since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lost at least two partners from its currency-trading business this year. Leland Lim, co-head of macro trading
for Asia ex-Japan, left to start a hedge fund. Steven Cho,
global head of spot and forward trading of G-10 currencies in
New York, also departed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least a dozen regulators are investigating allegations
first reported by Bloomberg News in June that traders colluded
to rig benchmarks in the $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market.
That is boosting demand from clients for greater transparency in
pricing and transaction charges, accelerating a longer-term
shift in trading onto electronic platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Electronic Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic dealing, which accounted for 66 percent of all
currency transactions in 2013 and 20 percent in 2001, will
increase to 76 percent within five years, according to Aite
Group LLC, a Boston-based consulting firm that reviewed Bank for
International Settlements data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirza had served as JPMorgan&#8217;s head of foreign-exchange
trading in Europe, Middle East and Africa and global head of FX
options trading. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISS Holding A/S has demand for all
the shares being sold in an initial public offering valuing the
cleaning company at as much as 31.7 billion kroner ($5.8
billion), according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS, whose owners include Goldman Sachs (GS) Capital Partners
and EQT Partners AB, sent a message on demand for the sale to
institutional investors, the people said, asking not to be
identified while the transaction is on. The company set a price
range of 140 to 175 kroner a share on March 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS, based in Soeborg, Denmark, said on Feb. 18 it would
raise 8 billion kroner to repay debt. The IPO, the largest in
Denmark in 20 years, comes amid a revival in investor interest
in Europe, where the volume of initial sales approximately
doubled in 2013, compared with the previous year, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering will also include shareholders Goldman Sachs
and EQT selling some of their stakes. Nordea Bank AB, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG are joint global coordinators, ISS
said. Lazard is acting as financial adviser to ISS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS shares are worth buying at 155 kroner, equivalent to a
valuation of 29 billion kroner, Sydbank A/S said in a note to
clients today. ISS will announce the final share price no later
than March 17. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard A. Friedman, head of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s merchant banking division, said he sees
opportunities to invest in middle-sized companies as some other
private-equity firms sell their investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My peers, I see them at conferences, and they talk about
how it&#8217;s the greatest selling environment -- I actually think
it&#8217;s a good investing environment,&#8221; Friedman, 56, said today in
a CNBC interview. &#8220;We have continued improvement in the
economy, we have very low interest rates and access to capital,
and also for the first time, I&#8217;d say, in years, our CEOs can
actually put business plans together with more confidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s merchant banking unit makes investments in
private-equity and real estate assets using client funds and the
company&#8217;s own money. The firm&#8217;s investments are included in its
investing and lending segment, which produced $4.33 billion of
pretax earnings in 2013, the most profit of any of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s four business units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has said it&#8217;s cutting its own stakes in private-equity funds to comply with the Volcker Rule, which limits such
investments. Still, the firm can often make direct investments
in debt or equity securities with its own money outside of fund
structures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s merchant banking division has raised more
than $82 billion for investment funds in corporate equity and
debt since 1986, according to its website. The bank is
considering a different strategy than buying large companies to
take them private, which was popular before the financial
crisis, Friedman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Not Happening&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we&#8217;re looking at is actually buying mid-sized
companies or making early-stage investments and growing
companies, as opposed to what happened in 2005 through 2007,
which was a buying spree of taking companies private,&#8221; Friedman
said. &#8220;That&#8217;s just not happening anymore.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman said he doesn&#8217;t expect interest rates to rise in
the near future. When that happens, it will probably lower
valuation multiples on companies, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman has worked at Goldman Sachs for more than 30 years
and was named a partner in 1990. He and Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein are the only two executives to sit on the
firm&#8217;s management committee since it was created in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s (XOM) biggest
international exploration opportunity may be imperiled by
Russian President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s Ukrainian foray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S.-based companies could face restrictions on doing
business in Russia if Putin&#8217;s regime is slapped with sanctions
by western governments or the United Nations for its
intervention in Ukraine&#8217;s Crimea region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, under the terms of a 2011 contract with state-controlled OAO Rosneft, owns drilling rights across 11.4 million
acres of Russian land, its biggest exploration holding outside
the U.S. Sanctions could stall Exxon&#8217;s plans to begin drilling
in the Russian Arctic later this year in partnership with
Rosneft, and threaten the lucrative Sakhalin-1 oil license off
Russia&#8217;s Pacific Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
agreed to invest billions of dollars and allow Rosneft to buy
stakes in premier North American projects in exchange for access
to Russia&#8217;s vast Arctic, deep-water and shale resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 61-year-old University of Texas-trained engineer is
seeking to reverse sliding oil and natural gas output at the
world&#8217;s biggest energy producer by market value. Since assuming
the leadership post of Exxon in January 2006, the company&#8217;s
stock has increased 65 percent, lagging the 77 percent advance
in the price of crude, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drilling Rights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s 11.4 million acres of Russian drilling rights are
eclipsed in size only by the company&#8217;s 15.1 million acres in its
home country, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission on Feb. 26. The next largest Exxon holdings
are in Canada, Germany and Indonesia, where the company owns
rights to 6.3 million acres, 5 million acres and 2.3 million
acres, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has repeatedly declined to comment on the impact the
Russian imbroglio in Ukraine may have on its operations or
investment decisions. Tillerson is scheduled to take questions
from analysts and the media later today at the company&#8217;s annual
strategy presentation at the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s interests in the region aren&#8217;t confined to Russian
oil fields. The company dispatched high-level executives to the
Ukraine&#8217;s capital of Kiev six weeks ago to discuss exploring the
country&#8217;s vast shale deposits, Interfax reported on Jan. 23,
citing the website of then-President Viktor Yanukovych. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yanukovych was ousted amid violent streets protests in late
February and has since fled to Russia. The January meetings
included Exxon executives Stephen Greenlee and Kevin Biddle,
according to the Interfax report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rising Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian turmoil comes at a time when Exxon&#8217;s
exploration effort have stalled worldwide and costs to pump oil
and gas from the ground are rising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company found commercial quantities of oil or gas in 67
percent of the exploratory wells it drilled in 2013, unchanged
from 2012, according to the Feb. 26 regulatory filing. At the
same time, Exxon&#8217;s costs to produce the equivalent of a barrel
of crude jumped to $11.48 last year from $9.91 in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Russian drilling rights include 11.3 million acres
in the Kara and Black seas under the agreement with Rosneft, and
another 85,000 offshore acres beneath the Sea of Okhotsk near
Sakhalin Island. Rosneft is a partner in the Sakhalin-1
development, which began producing crude in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and the
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board are set to invest in
holdings from a 2002 fund managed by J.W. Childs Associates LP
in a deal valued at $1 billion, said three people with knowledge
of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyout firm J.W. Childs will give existing investors an
option to sell stakes in its $1.75 billion buyout fund to CPPIB,
Canada&#8217;s second-biggest public pension manager, and Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s asset-management unit, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction is expected to be valued at about $1
billion, the people said. The J.W. Childs fund holds stakes in
five companies, including Sunny Delight Beverages Co., Mattress
Firm Holding Corp. and retailer Brookstone, according to the
buyout firm&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is the latest transaction in which private-equity
managers are giving investors the chance to sell stakes or roll
them into new vehicles. London-based Argan Capital began talks
in January to sell holdings in the 425 million-euro ($583
million) fund it manages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John W. Childs, 72, and Adam Suttin founded Boston-based
J.W. Childs in 1995. The firm hasn&#8217;t raised a fund since 2002,
abandoning efforts to raise another one in 2007, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokeswomen for Goldman Sachs and Toronto-based CPPIB
declined to comment. A spokesman for J.W. Childs didn&#8217;t respond
to e-mailed requests seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. judge handed Chevron Corp. a key victory in the energy company&#8217;s long-fought battle against a multibillion-dollar pollution lawsuit in Ecuador, ruling the American lawyer leading the case resorted to bribery and fraud. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan agreed with Chevron yesterday that attorney Steven Donziger had paid off a judge and engaged in money laundering to secure a $9.5 billion judgment from an Ecuadorean court against the global oil giant. The ruling leaves Donziger, who spent the past two decades fighting Chevron, with a slimmer chance of securing compensation for rain forest dwellers in the country&#8217;s Lago Agrio area who claimed their land was turned into a toxic dumping ground for foreign oil interests. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York plaintiffs&#8217; attorney went over &#8220;to the dark side&#8221; and made a &#8220;bargain with the devil,&#8221; to obtain the 2011 judgment from the court in Ecuador, Kaplan said in a 500-page opinion yesterday. He ruled U.S. courts can&#8217;t be used to collect the award, cut in half from an original $19 billion by Ecuador&#8217;s highest court on Nov. 12. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendants here may not be allowed to benefit from that in any way,&#8221; the judge wrote. The ruling may also make it more difficult for Donziger and his clients to collect the Ecuador court&#8217;s award by seizing Chevron assets outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donziger would need to win a reversal of the decision on appeal in order to salvage a payday for himself and his clients after decades of litigation. Kaplan&#8217;s detailed findings will make winning an appeal more difficult, said Cassandra Burke Robertson, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who has followed the case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The appellate court would have to conclude that the district court&#8217;s finding is clearly erroneous, which is a very hard standard to meet,&#8221; Robertson said. &#8220;Donziger definitely has an uphill battle to seek reversal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Other Countries &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company by market value, has waged a battle across multiple countries to prevent Donziger from collecting the award, which was almost half of its 2013 profit of $21.4 billion. Kaplan&#8217;s bar on profiting from the judgment &#8220;applies anywhere in the world,&#8221; even though it doesn&#8217;t stop Donziger from trying to make his case in foreign courts, Randy Mastro, a lead lawyer for Chevron, said yesterday in a conference call. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chevron claims Kaplan&#8217;s opinion should be respected by courts in other countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Canada, where Chevron has assets and where Donziger and his team have already sued to try to collect on the judgment. The Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled in December that the 47 villagers have the right to pursue Chevron&#8217;s Canada assets. The other cases are pending. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Brazil, Canada &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chevron General Counsel R. Hewitt Pate said yesterday that the company plans to share Kaplan&#8217;s ruling with judges overseeing proceedings in Brazil, Argentina and Canada. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In view of the findings here about what really went on in this case, we don&#8217;t think any serious court will entertain enforcement of the fraudulent judgment,&#8221; Pate said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ecuadorean villagers and activists working on their behalf had argued that Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, should be held financially responsible for pollution of the Amazon rainforest in the Lago Agrio area by Texaco Inc. from the 1960s through the early 1990s. Chevron, which bought Texaco in 2001, claimed the company already paid $40 million to clean up its share of the drilling contamination. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Secret Account &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case in Ecuador included &#8220;things that normally come only out of Hollywood -- coded e-mails among Donziger and his colleagues describing their private interactions with and machinations directed at judges and a court-appointed expert,&#8221; Kaplan wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donziger and his team paid off a supposedly neutral court expert from a secret account, promised $500,000 to a judge handling the case who was so inexperienced he used an 18-year-old typist to do legal research, and wrote the judgment themselves, Kaplan said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Donziger began his involvement in this controversy with a desire to improve conditions in the area in which his Ecuadorean clients live,&#8221; said Kaplan, who oversaw a seven-week non-jury trial on the judgment. &#8220;In the end, however, he and the Ecuadorean lawyers he led corrupted the Lago Agrio case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The length of the opinion gives the parties more ammunition to continue their fight,&#8221; said Robertson, the Case Western professor. &#8220;I would be surprised if the ruling were upheld in full, but I think the ruling prohibiting Donziger from benefiting financially from the case will likely stand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Helpful&#8217; Ruling &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;John Watson, Chevron&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, told reporters yesterday at the IHS CERAWeek energy conference in Houston that &#8220;having a judgment like this from a reputable court in the United States will certainly be helpful in preventing enforcement actions elsewhere.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chevron has also brought an arbitration case against Ecuador over its alleged failure to uphold agreements releasing predecessor Texaco from legal cases over the pollution. The arbitration in The Hague is pending. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Embassy of Ecuador said yesterday that Kaplan&#8217;s ruling &#8220;explicitly does not exonerate Chevron from its own legal and moral responsibilities resulting from its decades of contamination of the rainforest that has endangered the lives, culture, and environment of countless poor, indigenous people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The embassy said Ecuador isn&#8217;t a party in Chevron&#8217;s case against Donziger. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a statement, Donziger called Kaplan&#8217;s ruling &#8220;an appalling decision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Wrong, Wrong &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe Judge Kaplan is wrong on the law and wrong on the facts and that he repeatedly let his implacable hostility toward me, my Ecuadorean clients, and their country infect his view of the case,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donziger said he will pursue an &#8220;immediate and expedited appeal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lawyer has argued that he did nothing wrong in Ecuador and that any aggressive tactics he may have used were no worse than Chevron&#8217;s actions. He said that Kaplan &#8220;made it clear he would rule against us&#8221; well before the trial began by refusing a request to hold the proceeding before a jury. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Appellate lawyer Deepak Gupta, who joined Donziger&#8217;s team after the trial concluded, said in a statement that Kaplan &#8220;has taken the extraordinary and unprecedented step of appointing itself a worldwide fact-finding commission,&#8221; issuing &#8220;what is in effect a global anti-collection injunction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Appalling Verdict &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This decision also effectively outlaws core activity protected by the First Amendment such as bringing lawsuits, holding protests, issuing press releases, and engaging public officials,&#8221; he said, referencing tactics mentioned in Kaplan&#8217;s decision. &#8220;This is particularly appalling given that this case is about holding a corporation accountable for refusing to clean up decades of toxic pollution in the Amazon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donziger, a Harvard Law School graduate, joined the case in a junior role in the late 1990s and gradually rose to a position as a strategist and fundraiser. He contends that Ecuador-based lawyers are now in charge of the case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He is &#8220;intelligent, resourceful, and a master of public and media relations,&#8221; Kaplan said in the decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some celebrities supported the campaign against Chevron, including Trudie Styler, who founded the Rainforest Foundation with her husband, musician Sting, and helped to start a project to make clean water available to forest inhabitants in Ecuador. Styler attended some of the New York court proceedings, bringing her husband to watch Donziger testify. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Actress Mia Farrow and actor Danny Glover also voiced support for the campaign, and the case was featured in a documentary, &#8220;Crude,&#8221; by filmmaker Joe Berlinger. Chevron won access to hundreds of hours of outtakes from the film, which it contended showed Donziger acting inappropriately. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The racketeering case is Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 11-cv-00691, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Christie Smythe in Brooklyn at csmythe1@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Hytha at mhytha@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Satya Nadella puts his stamp on Microsoft Corp., he&#8217;s coming to grips with the tug of war over strategy and the clash of personalities that marked Steve Ballmer&#8217;s final years at the helm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella, who succeeded Ballmer one month ago, took a step this week by unraveling part of a restructuring his predecessor put in place in one of his last acts as chief executive officer. Nadella appointed onetime Democratic political operative Mark Penn to the just-invented post of strategy chief and shuffled other executives to resolve an unwieldy setup Ballmer had established in the marketing department. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new CEO is seeking to reshape a company whose main businesses are losing steam as efforts to expand on the Web and in mobile devices have been thwarted by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) Nadella will also exert his influence on the push into hardware, a strategy shift that fueled some of Ballmer&#8217;s fiercest arguments with the board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Ballmer Says Microsoft a &#8216;Two-Trick Pony,&#8217; Working on Third&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the announcement in August that he would be retiring, some directors were so exasperated they talked about how they might ease him out, including by hiring someone he admired, Ford Motor Co. CEO Alan Mulally, to succeed him, according to people with knowledge of the matter; Mulally later fell out of favor when members viewed him as behaving as though the job should be handed to him without so much as a formal interview, according to the people, who weren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly about the situation. A spokeswoman for Mulally declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is cutting 700 jobs,
a quarter of the employees at its interactive unit, in a
realignment of its video-game and Internet advertising
businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future games for consoles such as Sony Corp.&#8217;s PlayStation
and Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Xbox will be licensed, James Pitaro,
president of Disney Interactive, said today in an interview.
Burbank, California-based Disney is also paring its online ad
sales team to focus on &#8220;fewer and bigger partners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will continue to invest in interactive,
including the Infinity game system and the upcoming &#8220;Fantasia&#8221;
title, mobile game development in Japan and short-form videos on
the Web. It&#8217;s also extending the Club Penguin online virtual
world to iPhone and Android platforms. The cuts announced today
are part of an effort to make the division profitable on a
consistent basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactive division lost $87 million on sales of $1.06
billion in the year ended Sept. 28. While the unit made a profit
of $55 million in this year&#8217;s first quarter ended in December,
Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said in February results this
period would be comparable to the $54 million loss in the second
quarter of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The division had one of the top 10 video games of 2013 with
its Infinity system, according to researcher NPD Group Inc.
Mobile traffic on its websites has about doubled since a
redesign two years ago, according to data from ComScore Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web Ads &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling ads based on the mobile traffic has been
challenging, Pitaro said, explaining why the company is shifting
to more extensive sponsorships from display ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playdom, a maker of games for social media that Disney
acquired for $563 million in 2010, has also struggled to come up
with hits as the business shifted to mobile and customers balked
at paying even 99 cents for games, Pitaro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The industry has shifted from social games to mobile
games,&#8221; Pitaro said. &#8220;Our focus is now mobile first.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitaro became sole president of interactive in November. He
previously shared that title with former Playdom Chief Executive
Officer John Pleasants, who left at that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose less than 1 percent to $83.34 at the close in
New York. The stock has advanced 9.1 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama said the U.S. and its allies will keep raising pressure on Russia to back down in Ukraine and held open the possibility of further sanctions if Vladimir Putin&#8217;s government doesn&#8217;t respond. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama spoke at the White House after his administration restricted visas for Ukrainian officials and others, including Russians, who it says are threatening Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty. He also authorized financial sanctions, leaving the imposition of any restrictions until later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;These decisions continue our efforts to impose a cost on Russia,&#8221; Obama said, adding that the actions were taken in close coordination with European allies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More on the Crisis in Ukraine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also said a proposed referendum pushed by separatist leaders in Russian-majority Crimea to return the Black Sea peninsula to Russia would violate the Ukrainian constitution as well as international law. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are well beyond the days when borders can be redrawn over the heads of democratic leaders,&#8221; Obama said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The impact of U.S. actions depends on whether the European Union joins in. Leaders of the 28-nation bloc meeting in Brussels today halted trade and visa negotiations with Russia and prepared sanctions against selected Russian officials amid disagreements about how fast to move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) hired bank takeover
specialists Tannon Krumpelman and Doug Simons as Switzerland&#8217;s
biggest lender rebuilds its financial-services practice to cope
with a prolonged dealmaking slump in that industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krumpelman joins Zurich-based UBS from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Simons comes to the firm from Credit Suisse Group AG,
according to Greg Kennedy and Steve Pierson, co-heads of UBS&#8217;s
financial-services group for the Americas. Krumpelman and Simons
are managing directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hires are part of a broader overhaul of UBS&#8217;s
investment bank, which exited most of its fixed-income trading
to boost profits. UBS recruited Kennedy and Pierson, who
previously worked together at Credit Suisse, to oversee a
makeover of its financial-services coverage out of New York. In
the past year, the group has cut more than 20 junior people and
replaced about half of its dozen senior bankers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to be exactly the right size so all of the
business we are doing is profitable business,&#8221; Kennedy said in
an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were $95 billion in announced deals for U.S. banks,
insurance companies, specialty lenders and other financial
services companies in 2013, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That reflects a 6 percent drop from 2012, and is less
than half of the $217 billion in deals announced in 2007, before
the credit crisis suffocated financial-services MA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downturn requires a leaner group staffed with
rainmakers, Pierson said. The turnaround in UBS&#8217;s financial
performance has made recruiting easier, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank&#8217;s profit before tax rose to $2.3
billion in 2013 from $267 million a year earlier on lower
expenses and higher income, according to a company investor
presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krumpelman spent nine years at Goldman Sachs and started
its small- to mid-sized bank merger practice, advising Bankia SA
last year on the $883 million sale of its U.S. susidiary, City
National Bank of Florida. Simons has more than 20 years of
experience advising large depositories such as BBT Corp. and
Wells Fargo  Co. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Union governments halted
trade and visa negotiations with Russia and prepared sanctions
against selected Russian officials to protest the Kremlin&#8217;s
assertion of control over Ukraine&#8217;s southern Crimea region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU leaders sent the diplomatic signals at a summit in
Brussels today that pitted western European countries keen to
offer Russia more time to pull back its forces before imposing
sanctions against eastern countries demanding retribution now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We must consider measures that have far-reaching
consequences for the EU-Russia relationship,&#8221; U.K. Prime
Minister David Cameron told reporters after the meeting. Cameron
cited the potential &#8220;consequences&#8221; of such action on the
U.K.&#8217;s banks or on France&#8217;s defense industry, saying they were
worth it &#8220;if you are going to stand up to aggression.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some western European leaders had sought to delay
sanctions, shifting to a tougher stance after the parliament of
Crimea voted today to hold a referendum on March 16 on becoming
part of Russia. The EU was also swayed by the presence of
Ukraine&#8217;s new pro-western prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who
accused the Kremlin of putting up a new Berlin Wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;This Wall&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tear down this wall, the wall of intimidation, the wall
of military aggression,&#8221; Yatsenyuk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time-out on the commercial talks echoed the bloc&#8217;s
response to Russia&#8217;s invasion of another neighbor, Georgia, in
2008. Those contacts were resumed after two months and failed to
dislodge the Russian troops that remain on parts of Georgia&#8217;s
territory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU President Herman Van Rompuy said things will be
different this time, noting that Russia is keen on expanded
trade and improved European travel opportunities for its
citizens. Van Rompuy called today&#8217;s EU decisions a surprise for
the outside world and said the leaders &#8220;were very determined.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides suspending talks on trade and the easing of travel
visas, the leaders ordered the EU foreign service to draw up a
list of Russian officials who could be targeted with asset
freezes in a future round of sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That decision followed yesterday&#8217;s freezing of European
bank accounts of 18 members of Ukraine&#8217;s former pro-Russian
regime, including the ousted President Viktor Yanukovych. The
U.S. targeted some unidentified Russians today in restricting
visas deemed a threat to Ukraine&#8217;s security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Rompuy declined to say whether a future blacklisting
would cover Russian President Vladimir Putin or members of his
inner circle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Black Sea &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit had loomed as a deadline for Putin to withdraw
forces to bases which Russia leases in Crimea, where its Black
Sea Fleet is headquartered. On March 3, EU foreign ministers
demanded that Russia &#8220;immediately&#8221; take &#8220;de-escalating
steps&#8221; or face consequences. Putin says the Russian troops
stationed there have only been securing their bases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU leaders called again today for an immediate withdrawal
and demanded that Russia stop blocking access to Crimea by
monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe. A statement urged Russia to enter roundtable talks over
Ukraine&#8217;s future, without setting a fixed deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine standoff plunged the EU back into the
emergency diplomacy that dominated the euro-area debt crisis.
The divide between the richer north and poorer south that marked
the economic crisis gave way today to a renewal of the east-west
divisions over ties with Russia that have plagued the bloc since
it absorbed former Soviet satellite countries a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;No Enthusiasm&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said a pledge by
Ukraine&#8217;s Yatsenyuk to sign a European trade pact shifted the
mood among the 28 leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no enthusiasm for tough steps like sanctions,&#8221;
Tusk said. &#8220;But everybody understands that Russia&#8217;s stance
today, combined with Ukraine&#8217;s situation and the EU&#8217;s
obligations, requires such measures.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s fiscal crisis also cast an economic shadow over
the meeting, lessening the will to curb commercial ties with
Russia. Germany, Europe&#8217;s largest economy, relies on Russia for
35 percent of its gas and oil imports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France, for example, won&#8217;t yet suspend military contracts
with Russia, President Francois Hollande said. Russia in 2011
bought two &#8220;Mistral&#8221; warships from France for more than $1
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We respect the contracts that we have signed,&#8221; Hollande
said. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t reached that level yet. And we want to avoid
getting there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German Chancellor Angela Merkel held out the prospect of
additional steps against Russia including &#8220;a broad palette of
economic measures&#8221; if Crimea is further destabilized. She said
EU leaders might meet again before their regularly scheduled
March 20-21 gathering to decide on possible further sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders also agreed to add 1 billion euros ($1.4
billion) to the 610 million euros in emergency aid that the EU
plans to disburse once Ukraine strikes a standby agreement with
the International Monetary Fund. Those cash injections to avert
a Ukrainian default would form the nucleus of a package of
grants and project loans that could top 11 billion euros over
seven years, the European Commission said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firms from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
to Deutsche Bank AG are putting their faith in India&#8217;s rupee as
the country looks forward to the biggest improvement in its
broadest measure of trade in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which ranked India as the most vulnerable
Asian market in September, now predicts the rupee will beat
peers from Brazil to South Africa and Turkey. Deutsche Bank, the
largest foreign-exchange trader, and Barclays Plc say it&#8217;s their
favorite emerging-market currency. The rupee has risen 6.8
percent against the dollar over the past six months, the most
among 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are seeking safe, high-yielding assets as the
U.S. Federal Reserve reduces stimulus and after a slowdown in
China contributed to the worst start to a year for emerging-market currencies since 2009. For many, India fits the bill, as
policy makers take steps to reverse a slump that sent the rupee
tumbling to a record last August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;India looks in much better shape now than it did six
months back,&#8221; Kim Jin Ha, a global fixed-income fund manager in
Seoul at Mirae Asset Management Co., which oversees about $59
billion, said by e-mail March 3. &#8220;Capital flows can continue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Funds Return &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee&#8217;s recovery bodes well for India&#8217;s efforts to curb
the fastest consumer-price inflation after Argentina among the
Group of 20 nations, and to boost inflows to help revive the
slowest economic growth in a decade. Less than three months into
2014, foreigners have already plowed back more than half of the
$8 billion they pulled from local bonds last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s rupee climbed as much as 1.1 percent today to
61.1050 per dollar, the strongest level since Dec. 10, and was
at 61.1150 as of 10:33 a.m. in New York. It has risen from an
all-time low of 68.845 on Aug. 28. The rupee weakened 13 percent
in the second and third quarters of last year amid a decline in
the country&#8217;s manufacturing industry and monetary tightening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee may get a boost after India&#8217;s current-account
deficit narrowed to a four-year low as the world&#8217;s second-largest bullion-consuming nation raised gold-import tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortfall in the broadest measure of trade, which
tracks goods, services and investment income, was $4.2 billion
last quarter, down from $5.2 billion in the prior three months,
the Reserve Bank of India said yesterday in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deficit will shrink to $45 billion in the year ending
March 31, from $88 billion in the prior period, Finance Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram predicted last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Small Long&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in February that it saw the rupee at 62
in three months&#8217; time, while its asset-management arm opened
this year what it called a &#8220;small long&#8221; position on the
currency. HSBC Holdings Plc advises buying the rupee and selling
Indonesia&#8217;s rupiah, while Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley
predict India&#8217;s currency will strengthen against the Brazilian
real, according to client notes last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. may buy Indian assets because
the economy is less exposed to China&#8217;s faltering growth than
nations including South Korea, Emmanuel Ng, a strategist at the
Singapore-based firm, said by e-mail on Feb. 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I see the inflows continuing,&#8221; said Rajeev De Mello, who
oversees $10 billion as the head of Asian fixed income at
Schroder Investment Management Ltd. in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Big Doubts&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg lifted the median mid-year
forecast for the rupee to 62.6, from 63.25 three months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that&#8217;s a bigger increase than for any of its Asian
peers, it still signals a drop of more than 1 percent by June
30. Credit Agricole SA says the rupee will weaken to 70 per
dollar by mid-year as a clampdown on bullion shipments boosts
unofficial imports and India prepares for elections next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;India&#8217;s external position is not as good as it looks,&#8221;
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at France&#8217;s
third-biggest bank, said in an interview on March 4. &#8220;India&#8217;s
imports of gold have actually increased. I have big doubts
whether the government that will come out of the elections will
be welcomed by the markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan lifted interest rates three
times since taking office in September, boosting returns to
rupee investors and helping slow inflation to 8.8 percent in
January, from 11.2 percent in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He boosted capital inflows by offering discounted foreign-exchange swaps for dollar deposits and debt raised by local
banks. That helped increase foreign-exchange reserves by $20
billion, from September&#8217;s three-year low of $247 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar-based investors can make a return of 6.5 percent,
including interest, by holding the rupee until the end of 2014,
the biggest gain in Asia, according to data based on
appreciation estimates and deposit rates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Current-account numbers have been the key driver because
it&#8217;s a very transparent measure of whether the policy
prescriptions are having an impact,&#8221; Philip Moffitt, the
Sydney-based head of Asia-Pacific fixed income at Goldman Sachs
Asset Management, which oversees more than $1 trillion, said in
an interview. &#8220;If you can find something that&#8217;s relatively
cheap and the fundamentals appear to be improving, it&#8217;s usually
a good mix.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank (DBK) AG&#8217;s compliance chief,
Andrew Procter, will leave for law firm Herbert Smith Freehills
LLP as the company grapples with regulatory probes and lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procter, who was also Deutsche Bank&#8217;s head of government
and regulatory affairs, will join the law firm&#8217;s financial
services regulatory practice as a partner in June, London-based
Herbert Smith Freehills said in a statement on its website
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procter, 52, will work at Deutsche Bank with deputy
compliance chief Daniela Weber-Rey and regional compliance heads
during a transitional period, the bank said in an e-mail to
staff. Regina Schueller, a spokeswoman for the Frankfurt-based
company, confirmed the contents of the memo by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, Europe&#8217;s biggest investment bank by revenue,
had more than 2.5 billion euros ($3.43 billion) of legal costs
last year and still faces investigations into whether it rigged
benchmark interest rates as well as litigation related to the

&lt;p&gt;Arqaam Capital Ltd., a Dubai-based
investment bank focusing on emerging markets, said it plans to
trade African bonds and derivatives after opening a brokerage in
Johannesburg in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arqaam became the first broker to join Johannesburg&#8217;s stock
exchange in three years, pitting it against research teams from
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Renaissance Capital Holdings Ltd., Standard
Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re under no illusions that this is a tough market,&#8221;
Ross Abbott, head of Arqaam in South Africa, said in an
interview in Johannesburg yesterday. &#8220;We believe we&#8217;ll be the
first Cape-to-Cairo broker. We started with cash equities and
we&#8217;re looking at the bond market, derivatives and maybe asset
management with an Africa fund.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arqaam plans to extend its coverage to the mining industry
from the 49 African financial-services stocks it covers, before
building research on consumer, real estate, aviation and other
sectors, Abbott said. The firm plans to trade over-the-counter
bonds and is focusing on countries including Kenya, Ghana,
Nigeria, Morocco and Egypt, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RenCap, the Russian investment bank controlled by
billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, said Feb. 24 it had hired Rupert Preece to head sub-Saharan fixed-income trading as demand for
African bonds increases. Last year Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)
switched its coverage of fixed income in sub-Saharan Africa from
London to Johannesburg to boost emerging market revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Big Angle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our Middle Eastern products are the big angle here; we&#8217;re
the only ones in South Africa offering that reach,&#8221; Abbott
said. &#8220;And we have North Africa. RenCap also wants to be there
-- we believe we&#8217;ll be first.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zambia joins other African nations including Ghana and
Kenya in selling dollar-denominated debt this year. Countries in
the continent may sell as much as $5 billion in bonds by June,
according to Johannesburg-based ETM Analytics Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s probably a space for someone with feet on the
ground in North Africa,&#8221; said Arno Lawrenz, chief investment
officer at Cape Town&#8217;s Atlantic Asset Management. &#8220;But taking
on North Africa credit risk right now -- that&#8217;s like going into
distressed debt. Do you need to go into that sort of environment
to get a decent return? My sense is no.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arqaam, which offers trading and research services to
institutions, has been visiting exchanges across the continent
and there may be a &#8220;strong push for sukuk,&#8221; Abbott said,
commenting on Shariah-compliant bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa plans to sell a debut $500 million
international sukuk this year and introduce two long-term
domestic bonds as the nation diversifies its debt portfolio to
reduce refinancing risks, the National Treasury said on Feb. 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would like to chat with the central bank about this,&#8221;
Abbott said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albert Dombrowski, head of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s special situations group in the Americas, has
left the firm after 12 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dombrowski wasn&#8217;t included on a list of partners in a
regulatory filing today by the New York-based bank. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, confirmed that Dombrowski
had departed from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special situations group trades distressed debt and has
made investments in companies including pizza chain Sbarro Inc.
The unit is part of investing and lending, which produced $4.33
billion of pretax earnings last year, the most profit of any of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s four segments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dombrowski joined the firm in 2002, according to employment
records with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. He was
named a partner in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julian Salisbury became global head of the special
situations group in May, replacing Jason Brown. Salisbury, now
based in New York, previously ran the European portion of the
unit from London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
generated one-third of its profit from trading last year, is
restarting Middle East and North Africa equity sales in Dubai,
according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets is hiring Veer Ramlugon as part of the plans, one of the people said, asking
not to be identified because the matter isn&#8217;t public. Ramlugon,
who declined to comment when contacted by mobile phone earlier
this week, previously worked in Middle East equity and equity-derivative sales at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Dubai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is joining banks from Renaissance Capital to
Arqaam Capital Ltd. in expanding coverage in the Middle East and
Africa as local markets rally and economic growth surges.
Dubai&#8217;s benchmark index has advanced the most among 50 of the
world&#8217;s largest equity gauges this year with a gain of 23
percent as the United Arab Emirates&#8217; real-estate and banking
industries recover from a property crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.A.E. was raised to emerging-market status from
frontier by index provider MSCI Inc. in 2013, potentially paving
the way for greater foreign investment in the nation. Dubai, the
Arab world&#8217;s business hub, is gearing up to host the World Expo
in 2020 with $8 billion of infrastructure spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring the sheikhdom&#8217;s debt against non-payment with credit-default swaps was quoted at 189 basis points
at the end of February, the least since the 187 reached in May,
according to prices compiled by CMA. They traded at 192 basis
points as of 3:02 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renaissance, the Russian investment bank controlled by
billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, is planning to open an office in
the city to take advantage of the rising demand for assets in
the oil-rich region, while Dubai-based Arqaam will start trading
African bonds and derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to give
mortgage-bond trustees evaluating a proposed $4.5 billion
settlement over bad loans an extra three months to consider
signing onto the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline was extended to June 16, according to a letter
posted to a website for the settlement. Trustees including Bank
of New York Mellon Corp., Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)
had asked the New York-based bank for the change in a letter
dated March 4. Stephen Cutler, JPMorgan&#8217;s general counsel,
agreed to the request, the document shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous deadline was March 16, according to an earlier
letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s tentative deal to offer payments to bond
investors for mortgages that failed to match their promised
quality is part of an effort by the largest U.S. bank to move
past legal troubles tied in part to the housing crisis. The
accord was announced in November during the week before the
company agreed to a record $13 billion settlement with
government agencies over faulty mortgage securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan, confirmed that
the deadline was pushed back and declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $4.5 billion proposed accord was negotiated between
JPMorgan and 21 institutional investors including BlackRock Inc. (BLK)
and Pacific Investment Management Co. Trustees representing all
investors in individual transactions must accept the deal. Hedge
fund Fir Tree Partners has said it will seek to continue
separate lawsuits over some of the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathy Patrick, a lawyer at Gibbs  Bruns LLP representing
the investors who negotiated the deal, declined to comment, as
did Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York, and Ari Cohen
of Deutsche Bank and Jen Hibbard of Wells Fargo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the hip-hop duo Outkast once
opined, &#8220;You can plan a pretty picnic, but you can&#8217;t predict
the weather.&#8221; Big Boi and Andre 3000 could&#8217;ve been describing
the commodity markets so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From drought in Brazil to the arctic blast that swept
across North America, extreme weather drove coffee, sugar and
natural gas into bull markets just as escalating political
tension in Ukraine created supply risks for energy and grains.
The rally for raw materials was a surprise to banks from
Citigroup Inc. to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. that had forecast
2014 would mark a continuation of last year&#8217;s slump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity funds recorded inflows of $1.57 billion last
month, the first gain since September, after withdrawals last
year reached a record $43.3 billion, according to EPFR Global, a
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based researcher. Investors who shunned
gold as the metal slumped into a bear market in 2013 increased
holdings through exchange-traded funds in February for the first
time since 2012. Dryness in Brazil erased the prospect of a
record coffee crop as prices jumped, after the longest slide in
two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a series of mostly unrelated factors that are
catching commodities at a time when they&#8217;ve already been heavily
sold,&#8221; said Paul Christopher, the St. Louis-based chief
international strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, which manages
$1.4 trillion. &#8220;A lot of these factors are weather related and
will fade. I don&#8217;t think this is a viable opportunity for a
long-term investor. It&#8217;s more of a trading opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2014 Gains &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Spot Index (BUSY) of 24 commodities
climbed 3.3 percent this year, led by a 79 percent surge for
coffee and gains for hogs, corn and gold. The MSCI All-Country
World Index of equities rose 0.7 percent, and the Bloomberg
Dollar Spot Index, a gauge against 10 major trading partners,
slid 0.3 percent. The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index rose
1.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GSCI gauge fell 2.2 percent last year, the first
decline since the global recession in 2008, as a decade of
higher prices spurred producers to build new mines, drill more
wells and expand crop planting. Increased supply combined with
slowing growth in China, the biggest user of everything from
soybeans to zinc and cotton, prompted New York-based Goldman and
Citigroup to declare an end to the commodity super cycle that
caused raw materials to almost quadruple since 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many investors &#8220;threw in the towel&#8221; after last
year&#8217;s slump, they shouldn&#8217;t give up on commodities, said
Michael Aronstein, who correctly predicted the plunge in raw
materials in 2008 and the 2009 rebound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global Expansion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Commodities will just be normal cyclical participants in
an accelerating expansion globally,&#8221; said Aronstein, the
president and chief investment officer of Marketfield Asset
Management LLC in New York. &#8220;You&#8217;re returning to local supply-demand functions in commodities.&#8221; Aronstein said he started
buying commodity-related equities at the end of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy will grow 2.9 percent this year,
accelerating from 1.9 percent in 2013, a Bloomberg survey shows.
The euro area will expand by 1.1 percent after a contraction of
0.5 percent last year. Eighteen of the 24 commodities in the
GSCI index climbed in 2014, and seven of them have posted gains
of 10 percent or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s been a year full of surprises, no doubt about
that,&#8221; said David Rosenberg, the Toronto-based chief economist
at Gluskin Sheff  Associates, which manages about $6.8 billion.
&#8220;There is a time-worn relationship between overall global
growth and the commodity complex. Between what the U.S. is going
to do this year and what Europe is going to do, global growth is
going to be accelerating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bean Variety &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee, the bean variety favored by Seattle-based
Starbucks Corp., reached a two-year high this week amid the
driest summer since 1972 for Brazil, the biggest grower. Crude
oil jumped to the highest since September, reaching $105.22 a
barrel in New York on March 3 as tensions escalated between
Ukraine and Russia, the biggest energy exporter. Unusually
frigid weather in the U.S. boosted demand for heating fuel,
while supplies of natural gas and coal will decline to six-year
lows by the end of this month, government data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supply-and-demand outlook for individual commodities,
rather than macroeconomics, is now driving prices, said Michael Haigh, the head of commodities research at Societe Generale SA
in New York. Raw materials don&#8217;t have &#8220;much more downside&#8221;
because prices are near the cost of production, while the
outlook for slowing growth in China and emerging markets in
general has already been factored in, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;More Neutral&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup has turned &#8220;more neutral,&#8221; though the bank
still isn&#8217;t bullish, said Aakash Doshi, a vice president of
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in New York. Geopolitical risk and
weather spurred this year&#8217;s rally, and increased supplies will
mean prices probably will decline in the second half of the
year, especially for grains, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn reserves in the U.S., the biggest grower, will jump 80
percent before this year&#8217;s harvest to 1.48 billion bushels after
farmers collected a record crop in 2013, the government said
Feb. 10. Global copper production will outpace consumption by
81,000 metric tons in 2014, after posting a deficit of 175,000
tons a year earlier, London-based Barclays Plc said in a report
Feb. 12. The U.S. is extracting the most oil since 1989 as
producers tap shale-rock formations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index, Goldman&#8217;s preferred
measure, will drop 4.3 percent in the next 12 months, analysts
led by Jeffrey Currie said in a report last month. Declines will
be led by a 14 percent drop for precious metals, while
agriculture products will fall 9 percent, the bank said in the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman View &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2014 rebound is &#8220;more of a transient weather shock as
opposed to something more persistent,&#8221; Currie said in an
interview March 5. &#8220;It would need to be persistent before we
would significantly change our view.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold prices, already down about 30 percent from a record in
2011, will slip toward $1,100 an ounce by the end of the year as
the U.S. recovery picks up momentum and the dollar gains,
according to Michael Lewis, the head of commodities research at
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG. Futures in New York settled at
$1,351.80 yesterday. Commodities may &#8220;struggle to attract
financial flows&#8221; as investors buy more equities, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullion funds have attracted $522 million since the start
of the year as investors returned to the precious metal amid the
escalating turmoil in the Ukraine and slower-than-forecast
economic growth in the U.S., data from EPFR show. That compares
with a record outflow of $38.99 billion for 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gold Buyers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of gold jumped 11 percent since December,
rebounding from the 28 percent plunge last year that was the
biggest decline since 1981. Increasing demand from buyers of
coins, jewelry and bars will help to sustain bullion&#8217;s rally
this year, according to James Steel, chief precious metals
analyst at HSBC Securities Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palladium futures in New York reached a one-year high of
$785 an ounce yesterday as the U.S. and its allies considered
sanctions against Russia, the biggest supplier. Output of the
metal already has been disrupted by labor unrest in South
Africa, the second-biggest producer. Miners have vowed not to
back down from a strike that started in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coldest Start &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coldest start to a year since 2011 means consumers
won&#8217;t see the normal seasonal drop in power prices. Natural gas
is up 29 percent compared with a year ago, adding to costs for
home heating and power generation. Nationwide, consumers may pay
an average of 12.28 cents per kilowatt hour from March to May,
2.5 percent more than a year earlier, according to U.S. Energy
Information Administration data. Prices will be highest in New
England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigid weather may also limit meat supplies as low
temperatures force hogs and cattle to use more energy battling
the cold, slowing weight gains. A deadly pig virus is
compounding the outlook for shrinking U.S. pork supplies. Cattle
and hog futures reached records in Chicago on March 5,
increasing costs for retailers including Austin, Minnesota-based
Hormel Foods Corp., the maker of Spam meat spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World food prices posted the biggest gain in 19 months in
February on concern that cold weather and drought in the U.S.,
the biggest exporter of wheat, and dryness in top-sugar producer
Brazil will harm crops. An index of 55 food items rose 2.6
percent to 208.1 from 202.9 in January, the United Nations&#8217; Food
 Agriculture Organization in Rome said yesterday. The gauge is
still down 2.1 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coffee Harvest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s coffee harvest will reach 47.7 million bags, down
10 percent from a previous estimate, Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based coffee importer Wolthers Douque, said March 5. A bag
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee prices in New York tumbled 23 percent in 2013, the
third straight decline and the longest slump since 1993. The
driest January since 1954 for Brazil erased the outlook for a
record crop, prompting investors to more than triple their bets
on a rally last month, government data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re in a period of rising unpredictability around
climate change,&#8221; said Stephen Diggle, managing director and co-founder of Singapore-based Vulpes Investment Management, which
manages $250 million. &#8220;We see it as a significant and rising
threat to food production. The planet is going to experience
more disruptions in food production in the coming years than it
has in the past. That means we expect to see more volatility in
prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR), the
largest U.S. producer of coal used to make steel, slumped the
most in seven months after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
rating to sell and lowered price estimates for the commodity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha dropped 8.2 percent to $5.03 at 10:23 a.m. in New
York, after earlier falling as much as 9.9 percent, the most
intraday since Aug. 2. Other U.S. metallurgical-coal producers
also declined: Walter Energy Inc. slid as much as 9.2 percent,
Peabody Energy Corp. was down 4.4 percent and Arch Coal Inc.
fell 3.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman cut its metallurgical coal price estimate for this
year to $141 a metric ton from $150 and lowered projections for
next year and 2016. The move follows increased Australian
output, an expected slowdown in the growth of Chinese imports,
and &#8220;limited U.S. supply rationalization,&#8221; Neil Mehta and
Vinit Joshi, analysts at Goldman, said in a note yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect this oversupply level will increase in the
coming years,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman previously had a hold recommendation on Bristol,
Virginia-based Alpha. It cut its price target for the stock to
$4 from $6. Goldman lowered its target price for Birmingham,
Alabama-based Walter to $10 from $12 while maintaining a hold
rating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Financial
Officer Marianne Lake said the $27 billion profit outlook the
bank laid out at an investor conference last month wasn&#8217;t a
target and the firm can earn more than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s not a forecast, that&#8217;s not a budget, it&#8217;s a
simulation, and it was really predicated only on those things
that we&#8217;re really certain of,&#8221; Lake said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview with Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker.
&#8220;I think there&#8217;s every reason to believe that it&#8217;s biased to
the conservative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $27 billion outlook compares with net income of $17.9
billion last year and $21.3 billion in 2012. At the firm&#8217;s
investor day in 2013, JPMorgan presented a scenario in which
earnings could increase to $27.5 billion, while saying its
target was $24 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&#8217;s outlook only factored in the impact of higher
interest rates and investments the firm has made in its business
over the past few years, Lake said. It didn&#8217;t include higher
trading revenue, even as the bank &#8220;absolutely expects&#8221; that
business to grow over the next five years, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lake also said that rising costs from regulation will be
&#8220;somewhat permanent.&#8221; Still, JPMorgan holds the &#8220;best hand&#8221;
among large banks and will continue to outperform rivals,
according to Lake. She declined to forecast the maximum the bank
could earn in the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
two biggest payment networks, created a working group with
banks and merchants to accelerate the adoption of EMV chip
technology to thwart fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group was established following recent retail data
breaches, Purchase, New York-based MasterCard said today in an
e-mailed statement. The group, whose other members weren&#8217;t
identified, will focus on security issues that address in-store
and online purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders and merchants are under pressure to convert card
security from magnetic strips to microchips after millions of
consumer records were breached at retailers including Target
Corp. American Express Co., Visa and MasterCard have given most
U.S. merchants and issuers until October 2015 to adopt chips --
named EMV for founders EuroPay International, MasterCard and
Visa. Those that refuse would assume liability for counterfeit
card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Networks are also pushing retailers to use
&#8220;tokenization,&#8221; where some account information is replaced
with a digital ID for online and mobile purchases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Deutsche Bank
AG, UBS AG (UBSN) and Depfa Bank Plc won a bid to overturn a conviction
for overseeing fraud by their bankers in the sale of derivatives
to the city of Milan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeals court in Milan cleared the banks and individuals
at the firms because &#8220;the alleged crimes didn&#8217;t take place,&#8221;
Judge Luigi Martino said as he read out the verdict today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the appeals trial, prosecutor Piero de Petris had argued
that the banks, in their roles as advisers to the municipality,
should have disclosed how much the derivatives were costing the
borrower. Defense lawyers cited testimony by municipal officials
during the lower-court trial as proof the city was aware the
four banks were making money on the trades and of the magnitude
of those commissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Deutsche Bank (DBK) welcomes today&#8217;s verdict in the Appeals
Court of Milan, which has confirmed that Deutsche Bank and its
employees acted properly and in compliance with all laws and
regulation,&#8221; the German bank said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recoup Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Municipalities from Detroit to Naples have lost money on
derivatives that were meant to lower borrowing costs and instead
backfired. Italian local governments, including the city of
Florence and the region of Piedmont, have sought to recoup their
losses through legal action at home and in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ginni Rometty, chief executive
officer of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), said the
company fell short of expectations last year and must address
its struggling hardware businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We must acknowledge that while 2013 was an important year
of transformation, our performance did not meet our
expectations,&#8221; Rometty, who is also chairman, said over the
weekend in a letter to investors in the company&#8217;s annual report.
&#8220;While we continue to remix to higher value, we must also
address those parts of the business that are holding us back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has struggled in a shift to the cloud era, where data
and information are delivered online instead of being stored
onsite. Falling demand for hardware and weak sales in growth
markets have dragged down revenue for the last seven quarters,
prompting Rometty to sell assets, fire and furlough workers, buy
back shares and cut taxes to help meet profit goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company announced today that Michael Eskew, the former
chairman and CEO of United Parcel Service Inc. who has been on
the IBM board since 2005, will become IBM&#8217;s first presiding
director on May 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the newly created position, Eskew will serve as a
liaison between the chairman and independent directors and be
able to call meetings of independent directors, according to a
regulatory filing. The presiding director also will be available
to speak with major shareholders, if requested, after
discussions with Rometty. Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. is IBM&#8217;s largest shareholder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leadership Structure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Board members &#8220;as a whole accepted the recommendation of
Mrs. Rometty and believe that this leadership structure will
provide the company with the continued benefits of combining the
leadership role of chairman and CEO, while also recognizing the
unique strengths and capabilities of IBM&#8217;s board members,&#8221; the
company said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s sales fell 5 percent last year, and the stock was the
only decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That led top
executives to forgo annual bonuses and shrink the company&#8217;s
headcount for the first time in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no bonus, Rometty&#8217;s 2013 pay, calculated using U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission rules, fell 14 percent from a
year earlier to $14 million. On the recommendation of the
board&#8217;s compensation committee, IBM&#8217;s independent directors
approved a long-term incentive plan for Rometty of $12.75
million in performance-based stock awards for the period ending
in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The committee believes Mrs. Rometty performed well in
shifting investments into key segments of the portfolio and
advancing innovative solutions, creating a strong foundation for
transformation in 2014,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maintaining Goal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as revenue has tumbled, Rometty reaffirmed IBM&#8217;s goal
of $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015 -- up from $11.67 in
2010, the letter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $186.39 at the close
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO said the company will continue shifting its focus
to cloud services and data analytics while making changes to its
hardware products. The company agreed in January to sell most of
its low-end server business for $2.3 billion to Lenovo Group
Ltd. (992) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After buying cloud provider SoftLayer Technologies Inc.
last year for $2 billion, IBM is integrating existing hardware
and data analytics with its services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM will use its Power Systems servers to help deliver its
Watson tool through the cloud, the company said last month. The
company is spending $1 billion on building a new business group
around the technology, which analyzes troves of information and
answers questions in plain English. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follows a $1.2 billion commitment to bolster
SoftLayer&#8217;s cloud offerings by adding new data centers and an
expansion of the services to lure new customers as it faces off
with competitors like Amazon.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s dollar has tumbled 15
percent from its high last year and strategists forecast more
pain ahead. For Goldman Sachs Group Inc., it&#8217;s the perfect time
to develop Sydney as a hub for trading local-currency assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s stable AAA credit rating makes it a haven and
encourages sovereign-wealth funds to allocate more money there,
said Simon Rothery, the chief executive officer of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s operations in the country and neighboring New Zealand.
The New York-based firm moved its Australian credit derivatives
business from Hong Kong to Sydney last month after bringing over
bond and swaps trading last year, Rothery said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Aussie dollar is an ever more important part of
sovereign-wealth funds, central banks and global accounts,&#8221;
Rothery said in a Feb. 27 interview in Sydney. &#8220;Everybody wants
to play the China story, but you can&#8217;t get exposure directly so
people gain access through Australia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sign of Australia&#8217;s rising prominence, the
International Monetary Fund began breaking out central banks&#8217;
holdings of the local dollar at the end of 2012. Before that, it
was lumped together in the organization&#8217;s &#8220;other currencies&#8221;
category. Offshore investors boosted their holdings of the
country&#8217;s government bonds -- the highest-yielding top-rated
sovereign securities -- by A$28 billion ($25 billion) in 2013,
to a record A$217.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is
sticking with its recommendation to buy Chinese stocks, the
biggest losers worldwide this year, after valuations fell to the
lowest level in a decade versus global peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given how share prices have corrected and given where the
valuations are, from a risk-reward standpoint we still think we
can make a positive case on Chinese equities,&#8221; Kinger Lau, a
strategist at Goldman Sachs, said in an interview in Hong Kong
on March 4. He predicts the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)
will climb to 12,000 in the next 12 months, a 24 percent advance
from last week&#8217;s close, versus the brokerage&#8217;s December forecast
for the measure to reach 13,600 by the end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index of Chinese shares in Hong Kong lost 10 percent
this year through last week, the most among 93 global benchmark
indexes tracked by Bloomberg, as factory gauges pointed to a
slowdown in the economy and concern grew that more companies
will struggle to repay debt after the nation&#8217;s first onshore
corporate bond default on March 7. The gauge trades at a 45
percent discount to the MSCI All-Country World Index, the most
in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s leaders are trying to balance clampdowns on the
shadow-banking industry and local-government debt with measures
to support growth in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy.
Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science  Technology Co. (002506) became the
first company to default in China after failing to pay full
interest due last week on onshore bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Relative Value &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China index is valued at 1.1 times net
assets, the biggest discount since September 2003 to MSCI&#8217;s
global index, which has a multiple of 2. The H-share measure
slid 1.7 percent to 9,540.10 as of 1:41 p.m. in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. today named Helen Zhu as head of China
equities, luring the New York bank&#8217;s chief China equity
strategist away from Goldman Sachs. The appointment takes effect
on April 7 and Zhu may start managing funds later this year,
BlackRock said in a statement. The New York-based firm is the
world&#8217;s largest money manager, overseeing about $4.3 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China
Construction Bank Corp. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. all
trade at about the same level as their net assets, while Bank of
China Ltd. has a price-to-book ratio of 0.8. The four lenders
are the nation&#8217;s biggest by market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any clear and concrete policy measures in terms of
dealing with shadow banking loans and local government debt
would likely be positive catalysts for banks,&#8221; Lau said.
&#8220;Valuations for Chinese banks have already priced in a very
significant crisis scenario.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regulated Borrowing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premier Li Keqiang told the National People&#8217;s Congress last
week that China will develop a regulated regional borrowing
mechanism, after local-government liabilities surged to 17.9
trillion yuan ($2.9 trillion) as of June 2013 from 10.7 trillion
yuan at the end of 2010. Authorities have also started a cleanup
of the $6 trillion shadow-banking industry and identified
sectors of the economy in need of consolidation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Chinese banks&#8217; non-performing loans rose by 28.5
billion yuan in the last quarter of 2013 to 592.1 billion yuan,
the highest since September 2008, bad loans only accounted for 1
percent of total lending, the China Banking Regulatory
Commission said Feb. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank valuations currently imply a non-performing loan ratio
of about 7 percent, Lau said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An improving global economic outlook may also be a catalyst
for a rally in Chinese shares, Lau said, declining to name
specific stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank raised its 2014 growth forecasts for
advanced nations in January to 2.2 percent from 2 percent, while
cutting its estimates for developing nations to 5.3 percent from
5.6 percent. China is the world&#8217;s biggest exporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China last week retained a target for 7.5 percent growth in
2014 for the $9 trillion economy. Gross domestic product
expanded 7.7 percent in 2013, the same pace as in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A purchasing managers&#8217; index from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics dropped to a seven-month low of 48.5, the
companies said March 3. A similar gauge from the government with
a larger sample size fell to 50.2, the lowest since June, a
report showed March 1. Numbers above 50 signal expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas shipments unexpectedly declined 18.1 percent in
February from a year earlier, customs data showed March 8,
compared with analysts&#8217; median estimate for a 7.5 percent
increase. Producer prices fell 2 percent, the most since July,
according to a statistics bureau report yesterday, extending the
longest decline since 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Share Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China gauge has tumbled 16 percent since Noah Weisberger, a New York-based analyst at Goldman Sachs, predicted
on Dec. 2 that the H-share measure would rally 18 percent by the
end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s forecast formed part of a trade
recommendation in which the bank told investors to buy Chinese
stocks while selling copper as a bet that commodities would lag
the rally in equities. Goldman Sachs called the trade its fourth
top recommendation for 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world&#8217;s fourth-largest energy producer by market value, reduced its 2017
production estimate and said it will sell $10 billion in assets
during the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron lowered its production forecast by 6.1 percent as
it slows U.S. natural gas drilling and higher crude prices
reduce its share of production in some nations, the company said
during a presentation to analysts in New York today. The company
now sees output equivalent to 3.1 million barrels of crude a day
from a previous estimate of 3.3 million. Last year Chevron
produced the equivalent of 2.6 million barrels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower-than-expected U.S. gas prices prompted the company to
curtail some drilling in Pennsylvania&#8217;s Marcellus Shale gas
formation, said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson. New discoveries and acquisitions only added enough oil
and gas to reserves to replace 85 percent of the company&#8217;s
production last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our growth strategy remains intact, though some things
have changed,&#8221; Watson said. Higher crude prices will also have
a negative impact on output under production agreements in some
nations that curb a company&#8217;s share as prices escalate, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rising Production &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is spending $39.8 billion this year on gas-export
terminals, offshore crude platforms and other capital projects
to reverse a three-year drop in production. Chevron is alone
among the world&#8217;s three-largest energy companies in forecasting
a production increase this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s 2017 output target assumes crude prices will
average about $110 a barrel, the San Ramon, California-based
company said in a slide presentation prepared for today&#8217;s
meeting with analysts. That compares with the $79 price
assumption that underlaid the prior forecast from March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to increase drilling in the U.S. Permian
Basin by 8.6 percent this year to 505 wells, according to the
slides. The company&#8217;s production from the formation that
straddles the Texas-New Mexico border will double by the end of
2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. is the world&#8217;s largest energy producer,
followed by Royal Dutch Shell Plc and PetroChina. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. analysts
see Bitcoin as an innovative payments technology while doubting
that it will evolve into a true alternative currency, according
to a research report released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the report, titled &#8220;All About Bitcoin,&#8221; the
researchers write that they examined multiple views of the
digital currency by people inside and outside of Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So where does that leave us? With the conclusion that
Bitcoin likely can&#8217;t work as a currency, but some sense that the
ledger-based technology that underlies it could hold promise,&#8221;
the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin emerged from source code written by an anonymous
developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto
in 2009, and attracted a following motivated in part by the
ability to escape the strictures of traditional currency,
notably government control. The report by Goldman Sachs lends
credibility to the virtual currency, said Michael Terpin, co-founder of BitAngels, a group of angel investors in early stage
Bitcoin startups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The tone overall is conservative and measured,&#8221; Terpin
said of the report. &#8220;People will read it and draw their own
conclusions. It&#8217;s nice they are paying attention to it, and
don&#8217;t have a Bitcoin-is-evil view.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biggest Hurdle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominic Wilson and Jose Ursua, the researchers at Goldman
Sachs who wrote the report, said that the ability to pay for
goods and services using Bitcoin is growing, saying that
&#8220;obstacles to Bitcoin being used more broadly in the payments
system are arguably not insurmountable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roman Leal, an analyst at Goldman Sachs covering
information-technology services, said Bitcoin&#8217;s &#8220;biggest
hurdle&#8221; will be maintaining its cost advantage in the face of
greater regulation, higher operating costs, and competition from
entrenched players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While it is too early to tell how banks and payment
processors will react to the threat of Bitcoin, we believe that
it is only a matter of time before major incumbents develop a
digital currency strategy,&#8221; Leal wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, faces competition to its $3 billion arthritis pill
Celebrex in May after a federal judge invalidated a patent that
would have extended protection through December 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), Mylan Inc., and Lupin
Ltd. (LPC) were among the generic-drug makers who successfully argued
that New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s patent wasn&#8217;t different enough from
the one expiring in May. Pfizer &#8220;will pursue all available
remedies, including an immediate appeal of the court&#8217;s
decision,&#8221; the company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrex, which belongs to a class of drugs called COX-2
inhibitors, helps arthritis patients reduce pain by blocking a
chemical reaction in the body that causes inflammation. The
medicine had been projected to generate $2.5 billion between May
and when the 2015 patent was slated to expire, according to
sales estimates surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It seems likely that odds are in favor of generics
launching early,&#8221; said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. Pfizer&#8217;s earnings per share will be
cut by 4 percent this year and 8 percent in 2015 if copycats do
make it to market, he wrote in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S.-based companies added $206 billion to their stockpiles of offshore profits last year, parking earnings in low-tax countries until Congress gives them a reason not to. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The multinational companies have accumulated $1.95 trillion outside the U.S., up 11.8 percent from a year earlier, according to securities filings from 307 corporations reviewed by Bloomberg News. Three U.S.-based companies -- Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Apple Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. -- added $37.5 billion, or 18.2 percent of the total increase. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The loopholes in our tax code right now give such a big reward to companies that use gimmicks to make it look like they earn their profits offshore,&#8221; said Dan Smith, a tax and budget advocate at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which seeks to counteract corporate influence. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even as governments around the world cut tax rates and try to keep corporations from shifting profits to tax havens, the U.S. Congress remains paralyzed in its efforts. The response of U.S.-based companies over the past few years has been consistent: book profits offshore and leave them there. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Congress hasn&#8217;t acted because of disagreements over whether to be tougher on U.S. companies operating abroad amid broader disputes over government spending and taxation. The stalemate has prevented the U.S. from tapping a pot of money that President Barack Obama and the top Republican tax writer in Congress have eyed for such projects as rebuilding highways. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Deferring Taxes &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) vice president Fabrice Tourre, found liable for his part in a failed $1 billion investment, was ordered to pay more than $825,000 in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan ruled today that Tourre must pay $650,000 in civil penalties and give up $175,463 of his 2007 bonus, plus interest. He can&#8217;t seek reimbursement of the penalties from Goldman Sachs, the judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tourre, 35, was found liable Aug. 1 after a jury trial at which the SEC claimed he intentionally misled investors in a subprime-mortgage vehicle called Abacus 2007-AC1. Tourre lied about the role played by billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s Paulson  Co. hedge fund, which helped choose the securities underlying Abacus then made a billion-dollar bet it would fail, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was one of the government&#8217;s most prominent efforts to fix responsibility for the housing market crash, which helped precipitate the worst economic downturn since the 1930s. Critics have faulted the SEC for not doing more to police the abuses that helped lead to the crisis or to pursue top financial executives they say are responsible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s allegations against Tourre and Goldman Sachs helped spur Congress in 2010 to enact the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, aimed at averting future crises. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Lee, the JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) chief equity strategist who has called for gains in American
stocks (SPX) for six straight years and got them in four, is leaving
the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee, 44, is stepping down tomorrow after holding the job
since 2007, Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New York-based
firm, said in a telephone interview. Lee wants to take time away
from work, according to a memo sent to employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee, who worked for JPMorgan for 15 years, is among almost
two dozen Wall Street strategists who try to predict the
direction of the stock market and advise investors on which
companies to buy and sell. He had one of the highest year-end
forecasts for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, telling investors
last week to stay bullish and buy health-care, technology and
financial stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s just one of the best strategists in the game,&#8221;
Philip Orlando, who helps oversee nearly $400 billion as chief
equity-market strategist at Federated Investors Inc., said in a
phone interview. &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised and disappointed that a young
guy at the top of his game would be resigning.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee, a managing director at the largest U.S. bank, didn&#8217;t
respond to a telephone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Always Bullish &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was bullish at the start of each of six full years as
chief equity strategist, forecasting an average annual rise of
14 percent in the SP 500 over the period. He was more accurate
than the average of strategist forecasts in four of the six
years, including 2012 and 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like every one of his competitors tracked by Bloomberg, Lee
failed to foresee the stock-market decline in 2008. He called
for an 8.3 percent increase in the SP 500 that year. The
benchmark gauge plummeted 38 percent in its worst annual
performance since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before taking the strategist job, he covered the wireless
and telecommunications industry from 1999 to 2007 and added
small-cap stocks in 2004, being recognized by Institutional
Investor magazine every year since 1998, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He held positions at Oppenheimer  Co., Kidder Peabody 
Co. and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. He received a bachelor&#8217;s
degree in economics in 1991 from the Wharton School at the
University of Pennsylvania with dual concentrations in finance
and accounting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Good Reputation&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He has a good reputation,&#8221; Hugh Johnson, who oversees $2
billion as chairman of Albany, New York-based Hugh Johnson
Advisors LLC. Strategists &#8220;are helpful in thinking about
issues,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They can tell you what the issues are and
give you interesting ways to analyze the issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 will probably end the year at 2,075, Lee said
in a March 7 report. Only Weeden  Co. and Canaccord Genuity
Securities LLC have higher estimates, according to a survey
compiled by Bloomberg of 21 strategists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, Lee stuck to his bullish
stance even as the SP 500 slid as much as 5.8 percent in
February. He was ultimately proved correct as the equities
benchmark recovered the losses by the end of the month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His predictions during the rebound were more accurate. His
target of 1,100 for the U.S. equity benchmark in 2009 was only
off by 15 points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;His viewpoints have been very much on the money and he
will do well wherever he goes,&#8221; John Manley, who helps oversee
about $233 billion as chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo
Funds Management in New York, said in a phone interview.
&#8220;Hopefully, he reappears somewhere else.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wind Point Partners LP is near an
agreement to sell snack maker Hearthside Food Solutions LLC to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s private-equity arm and Vestar Capital
Partners Inc. for about $1.1 billion, people with knowledge of
the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal may be announced as soon as tomorrow, said the
people, asking not to be identified discussing private
information. BC Partners Holdings Ltd. and Oak Hill Capital
Partners LP also made offers for the business, people said
earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearthside, which makes snacks including pretzels and
cookies sold under consumer-product companies&#8217; brand names, was
acquired by Wind Point in 2009. The company sold its ready-to-eat cereals and granola-making business to Post Holdings Inc.
last year, according to its website. Barclays Plc started an
auction for Downers Grove, Illinois-based Hearthside late last
year, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a New York-based spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs declined to comment on its interest in Hearthside as did
Carol Makovich, a spokeswoman for Vestar. Marc Hazelton a
spokesman for Barclays also declined to comment, while officials
at Wind Point couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vestar was part of a group of buyout funds that acquired
Del Monte Foods Co. in a $5.3 billion deal in 2011. Vestar also
acquired a stake in grocery wholesaler American Roland Foods
Corp. in August and has owned consumer brands including Birds
Eye Foods and Celstial Seasonings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago-based Wind Point, which manages about $2.8 billion
of assets, also owns snack food maker Shearer&#8217;s Foods LLC and
meat product maker Rupari Food Services Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Buse, a top executive at
Visa (V) Inc. who previously ran most of the firm&#8217;s international
business, is leaving after more than 16 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buse, 53, was most recently the head of the global-solutions group, Foster City, California-based Visa said today
in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Buse is retiring March 31, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Throughout her career, Elizabeth has worked tirelessly to
build a stronger, more effective and engaged Visa,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Charlie Scharf, 48, said in a statement. &#8220;I
am thankful for the foundation she has created for us to work
from and wish her well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa also said today that Ramon Martin, a former president
of merchant services at American Express Co. (AXP), will be joining
the firm. Martin will lead work related to merchant products
that Buse previously did, according to a person familiar with
the matter who asked not to be identified because the plans are
private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buse was appointed to her role in the new global-solutions
unit in May. She started her career at Visa in the product-organization group and was the first executive to oversee the
firm&#8217;s business in the Asia Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe,
Middle East and Africa regions, the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Visa fell 2.3 percent to $220.83 at 3:28 p.m. in
New York. They have decreased less than 1 percent this year, and
were the sixth-best performer in the 30-company Dow Jones
Industrial Average for 2013, rising 47 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) discovered
pricing errors in the firm&#8217;s dark pool trading venue and sent
checks to customers to compensate for the mistakes, according to
people with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank sent the money to clients and other Wall Street
firms that use its Sigma X pool for equity trades made in August
2011, said the people, who requested anonymity because the
communications and payments aren&#8217;t public. Concerns that Greece
would default on its debt that month led to a sharp decline in
stock markets and dramatic price swings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the refunds probably weren&#8217;t large relative to
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s trading revenue, the errors show the potential
risks to operators of dark pools, which were created to let
major investors trade big blocks of stock without having news of
the orders move prices. Sigma X is one of the largest dark pools
in the U.S., accounting for 1 percent of total daily trading in
January, data from Rosenblatt Securities Inc. show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refunds were sent to customers whose trades were
executed at a certain point beyond the national best bid and
offer, according to one of the recipients. Stock venues in the
U.S. are obliged to price trades at the NBBO or better. Goldman
Sachs appears to have taken the action voluntarily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) face a European Union complaint as soon as next month as the bloc&#8217;s antitrust chief races to fine a quartet of financial companies that snubbed rate-rigging settlements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joaquin Almunia, whose term ends on Oct. 31, is determined to punish the two banks as well as Credit Agricole SA (ACA) and interdealer broker ICAP Plc (IAP) before he leaves office, said three people familiar with the probe who asked not to be named because the process is private. To meet the target, he plans to send so-called statements of objections in the Euribor and Libor cases close to Easter, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;He will want to end on a high note,&#8221; Pierre-Henri Conac, a professor specializing in banking at the University of Luxembourg, said in an interview. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be happy to say: &#8216;I did it.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Almunia, 65, sees the fines as unfinished business after the four holdouts ruined his attempt to get a clean sweep of settlements in rate-rigging cases, part of a global scandal that tarnished the reputation of some of the world&#8217;s biggest lenders. The next seven months are the last chance for the former Spanish economist to burnish his legacy after he pledged to quit political life when he leaves the European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management is
reducing its holdings of Europe&#8217;s higher-yielding debt as it
bets a rally in the bonds is ending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gains have sent yields from Greece to Spain tumbling to the
lowest since at least 2010 this month as data from gross
domestic product to manufacturing output add to evidence the
euro-area recovery is gathering pace. The rally has pushed the
securities to levels that are no longer good value for
investors, according to JPMorgan London-based money manager
Talib Sheikh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A year ago we were pounding the table that European
peripheral debt was really cheap,&#8221; Sheikh said in an interview
on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Countdown&#8221; with Anna Edwards and
Mark Barton. &#8220;With valuations where they are it&#8217;s hard to make
the case that peripheral bonds look a buying opportunity here so
we&#8217;ve been reducing our exposure pretty aggressively into this
rally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management oversees the equivalent of $1.6
trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy&#8217;s 10-year bond yield fell to 3.36 percent on March
10, the lowest level since October 2005. The additional yield
investors demand to hold the securities over similar-maturity
German bunds slid to 173 basis points on March 11, the least
since June 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate on Spanish bonds due in April 2024 dropped to an
eight-year low of 3.30 percent on March 10, reducing the
security&#8217;s yield spread over bunds to 165 basis points. That&#8217;s
the lowest level since October 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these spreads can narrow further &#8220;it&#8217;s hard to say
that there&#8217;s real value in those bonds any more,&#8221; Sheikh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish bonds have returned 5.2 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italy&#8217;s have gained
4.4 percent and Greece&#8217;s have surged 17 percent. German
securities have earned 2.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) said it will appeal a

treating osteoarthritis with the active ingredient in Celebrex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in Virginia ruled yesterday that a
magistrate judge properly excluded testimony related to the
patent&#8217;s validity. New York-based Pfizer had sued manufacturers
after they filed applications to produce generic forms of the

&lt;p&gt;Keurig Green Mountain Inc. (GMCR), the maker of single-serve
coffee brewing systems, lost its appeal of a lower-court ruling
in a patent-infringement case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Washington-based appeals court ruled yesterday that the
lower court properly found that JBR Inc.&#8217;s One Cup single-serve
containers didn&#8217;t infringe a Keurig patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, a federal judge in Boston said the designs of
containers by Waterbury, Vermont-based Keurig and JBR were
dissimilar. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal affirmed that
decision without issuing an opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal is Keurig Inc. v. JBR Inc., 13-1478, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The lower court case is
Keurig Inc. v. JBR Inc., 11-cv-11941, U.S. District Court,

&lt;h2&gt;Fracking Fluid Recipes Get No Blanket Protection in Wyoming &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wyoming Supreme Court said a lower court erred when it
said recipes for fluids used to fracture rock formations in gas
and oil exploration are exempt from freedom of information
requests, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high court ruled yesterday that lower courts must
decide on a case-by-case basis whether a particular fracking
fluid ingredient list is a trade secret, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s top investment banks
may see combined revenue from trading, underwriting and advising
on mergers drop 11 percent in the first quarter as clients cut
back on activity, JPMorgan Cazenove analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) and UBS AG (UBSN) may post the biggest declines
compared with the year-earlier period, down 15 percent and 14
percent respectively, analysts led by Kian Abouhossein wrote in
a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decline in price swings and margins will contribute to a
19 percent contraction in revenue from trading fixed-income,
currencies and commodities, the analysts wrote. Sales from
trading stocks are on course for a 6 percent decline in the
quarter while revenue from advising on mergers and underwriting
securities sales may rise 1 percent, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the global securities firms tracked by JPMorgan,
Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s investment-banking revenue may fall the least,
or 7 percent, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) 8 percent and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS is JPMorgan&#8217;s top pick because of its greater exposure
to equity trading relative to FICC, while Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) is
the analysts&#8217; favored stock with a large FICC business because
of the firm&#8217;s reorganization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISS Holding A/S, the world&#8217;s
largest cleaning company, jumped as much as 13 percent in its
first day of trading in Denmark&#8217;s biggest initial public
offering in 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS&#8217;s new shares traded as high as 180 kroner in
Copenhagen, compared with the IPO price of 160 kroner. The
initial price range set during the offer was 140 kroner to 175
kroner. ISS said it raised gross proceeds of 8.04 billion kroner
($1.5 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale of ISS, whose owners include Goldman Sachs Capital
Partners and EQT Partners AB, will be the largest IPO in Denmark
since the 1994 listing of TDC A/S. Companies in Europe raised
$10 billion from listings so far this year, about three times
the amount in the same period in 2013, as investors bet on an
economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ISS&#8217;s defensive business model gives new investors the
prospect of stable growth, stable earnings, a good cash-flow and
very solid dividends,&#8221; Soeren Loentoft Hansen, an analyst with
Aabenraa, Denmark-based Sydbank A/S, said in a note. He&#8217;s
starting coverage of ISS with a buy recommendation, and sees
room for the shares to advance as much as 25 percent from the
IPO price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Existing Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS&#8217;s new stock traded at 179.3 kroner at 9:59 a.m. in
Copenhagen with 4.09 million shares traded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 50.2 million new shares sold by ISS,
Goldman Sachs and EQT will sell 1 million existing shares. ISS
will have a market value of about 29.6 billion kroner, excluding
the value of treasury shares held by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have received very positive feedback from investors,&#8221;
ISS Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gravenhorstsaid in today&#8217;s
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. retailers Poundland Group Plc and Pets at Home Ltd.
began trading yesterday after closing their sales early because
of high demand from investors. Poundland gained 23 percent, and
Pets at Home fell about 3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS said about 10 percent of its shares were allocated to
Danish retail investors while the rest went to institutional
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS, based in Soeborg, Denmark, said on Feb. 18 it would
raise 8 billion kroner to repay debt. The company said on March
11 it would close the share sale early after receiving strong
demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which has more than 530,000 employees, offers
facility management services in more than 50 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS pulled an IPO in March 2011, citing market uncertainty.
Later that year, G4S Plc said it abandoned a takeover pursuit of
ISS after the security services provider&#8217;s shareholders
revolted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordea Bank AB, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG are
sale managers. Lazard is acting as financial adviser to ISS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. wanted to find out who was behind a company called Suffolk Technologies LLC that accused the world&#8217;s largest search engine&#8217;s owner of using its Internet-search technology without permission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turns out, the tangled ownership history included big names: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BT Group Plc&#8217;s British Telecom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tired of fighting sometimes frivolous patent-infringement suits that cost millions of dollars in legal fees, companies such as Google and Apple Inc. are using ownership questions to help their court cases. Unveiling litigants can get a suit dismissed, disclose the real entity behind a case or identify a target for revenge. Even before Suffolk lost its case, Google retaliated last year by filing a patent-infringement suit against British Telecom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You would think that determining who owns a patent is a pretty straightforward process,&#8221; said Stephen Korniczky, co-chairman of the intellectual property practice of Sheppard Mullin in Del Mar, California. &#8220;If a patent is assigned to a company, then it&#8217;s recorded with the patent office. The problem really lies in who owns the company or entity to whom the patents have been assigned.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google, Cisco Systems Inc. and other technology companies have persuaded Congress to consider legislation requiring patent owners to disclose the &#8220;real party in interest.&#8221; The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is considering rules to make public the &#8220;attributable ownership&#8221; of a patent. It will hold hearings on the proposal today in Alexandria, Virginia, and March 26 in San Francisco. The challenge may be figuring out what those terms mean and what information must be disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, faces competition to its $3 billion arthritis pill
Celebrex in May after a federal judge invalidated a patent that
could have delayed generic versions of the medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A patent expiring in December 2015 was invalid because it
wasn&#8217;t different enough from one ending in May, a federal judge
in Norfolk, Virginia, said yesterday in a victory for companies
including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), Mylan Inc., and
Lupin Ltd. (LPC) Pfizer &#8220;will pursue all available remedies,
including an immediate appeal of the court&#8217;s decision,&#8221; the
company said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrex, which belongs to a class of drugs called COX-2
inhibitors, helps arthritis patients reduce pain by blocking a
chemical reaction in the body that causes inflammation. The
medicine had been projected to generate $2.5 billion between May
and when the 2015 patent was slated to expire, according to
sales estimates surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It seems likely that odds are in favor of generics
launching early,&#8221; said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. Pfizer&#8217;s earnings per share will be
cut by 4 percent this year and 8 percent in 2015 if copycats do
make it to market, he wrote in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There would be little to no impact to EPS from 2016
onwards because we have already been modeling generics in late
2015,&#8221; Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell 1.4 percent to $31.98 yesterday in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reimburse Pfizer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actavis Plc (ACT) said it plans to begin selling a generic
Celebrex in May, as long as it gets regulatory approval. Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, said
the company is pleased with the decision. Officials with Mylan
didn&#8217;t immediately return messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the generic-drug companies enter the market and
later lose the appeal, they could be ordered to reimburse Pfizer
for any profits it loses from the low-cost competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeals court in 2008 had invalidated the patent, saying
it just covers a method of administering a &#8220;therapeutically
effective amount&#8221; of the compounds covered by the patent that
ends in May. New York-based Pfizer asked the patent office to
reissue it with modifications to work around the appeals court
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District Judge Arenda Wright Allen said that the
modification sought by Pfizer wasn&#8217;t allowed under the law, so
the Federal Circuit&#8217;s reasoning stands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is G.D. Searle LLC v. Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
13cv121, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia (Norfolk). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yen gained for a fifth day
versus the dollar, the longest stretch in 10 months, as
investors sought haven assets before a referendum this weekend
that may lead to Crimea&#8217;s secession from Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble dropped versus all except two of its 31 major
counterparts as Russia remained on a collision course with the
West after six hours of talks between the country&#8217;s top
diplomats failed to ease tensions. The euro jumped as much as
0.5 percent versus the dollar amid speculation technical signals
triggered automatic selling orders, known as stops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Definitely the market is very nervous on Russia, the
Ukraine situation and the Crimea vote this weekend -- it&#8217;s
driving all risk off,&#8221; said Masafumi Takada, a New York-based
director at BNP Paribas SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen climbed 0.5 percent to 101.36 per dollar at 5 p.m.
in New York, extending this week&#8217;s gain to 1.9 percent, the most
since Jan. 24. It last ended a five-day winning streak on May 1.
Japan&#8217;s currency advanced 0.2 percent to 141.03 per euro. The
shared currency gained 0.3 percent to $1.3914 and touched
$1.3937. The Swiss franc appreciated 0.3 percent to 87.24
centimes per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It looks like a few euro-dollar stops have been taken
out,&#8221; Stephen Collins, global head of dealing at the money
manager London  Capital Group Ltd., said in a telephone
interview from London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Higher Volatility &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s Currency Volatility Index, based on
three-month implied volatility on nine major currency pairs,
rose for a second day. It increased to 7.63 percent, the highest
since March 3, after falling to 7.14 percent on March 12, the
lowest level since December 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble depreciated 0.2 percent to 36.6326 per dollar and
touched 36.7037, the weakest level since March 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met in London with
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to press the nation to
halt a takeover of Ukraine&#8217;s Crimean peninsula. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mostly Russian-speaking region is scheduled to vote on
secession on March 16. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
yesterday Russia is risking &#8220;massive&#8221; political and economic
damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s president, Vladimir Putin, &#8220;is not prepared to
make any decision regarding Ukraine until after the referendum
on Sunday,&#8221; Kerry told a news conference after the meeting.
Russia &#8220;will respect the will of the Crimean peoples,&#8221; Lavrov
told a separate news conference, saying there&#8217;s &#8220;no common
vision&#8221; on resolving the crisis. Russia has no plans to invade
the region, Lavrov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Position Defensively&#8217;   &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has asked the U.S. for military assistance and
equipment, according to an American defense official, who asked
not to be identified discussing private communications. Pentagon
officials have indicated the focus at the moment should be on
diplomatic and economic aid, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Markets will continue to position defensively ahead of
the Crimean referendum on Sunday, with investors wary of
potential further escalation of geopolitical risks,&#8221; said
Valentin Marinov, head of European Group-of-10 currency strategy
at Citigroup Inc. in London. &#8220;Liquid safe havens like the yen
and Swiss franc should do well. The market is turning short U.S.
dollars against the majors.&#8221; A short position is a bet an asset
will fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Net Longs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures traders increased their bets the franc will gain
against the dollar, figures from the Washington-based Commodity
Futures Trading Commission show. The difference in the number of
wagers by hedge funds and other large speculators on an advance
in the franc versus those on a drop -- so-called net longs --
was 8,957 on March 11, compared with net longs of 2,168 a week
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in the number of wagers by large speculators
on a decline in the yen against the greenback versus those on a
gain -- so-called net shorts -- increased to 99,356, compared
with net shorts of 79,709 a week earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  dollar remained lower versus the yen as the Labor
Department reported the U.S. producer price index fell 0.1
percent after a 0.2 percent rise the prior month. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.2 percent
increase. Over the past 12 months, wholesale prices increased
0.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a fair bit lower than our expectation,&#8221; Brian Daingerfield, a Stamford, Connecticut-based currency strategist
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;The reaction has been fairly muted in the foreign-exchange space.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yen&#8217;s Advance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen has risen 3.4 percent this year, the best performer
after New Zealand&#8217;s dollar of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 0.4 percent, while the U.S. dollar fell 0.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Japan maintained record stimulus this week,
keeping ammunition amid speculation a sales-tax increase in
April will hurt the economy. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
predict the economy will shrink 3.8 percent in the second
quarter, when an increase in the consumption tax is scheduled to
take effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa&#8217;s rand was the biggest winner among the
dollar&#8217;s major counterparts, gaining 1.3 percent to 10.6711 to
the greenback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&#8217;s won, the biggest loser, declined 0.3 percent
to 1,072.78 to the greenback. It had its largest weekly drop in
almost two months, 1.1 percent,  as slowing economic growth in
China, the nation&#8217;s biggest foreign market, prompted investors
to seek safer assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas investors sold $1.2 billion more South Korean
stocks than they bought this week as official data showed
exports in China contracted the most since 2009 in February and
factory output rose less than forecast in the past two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian currency, the second-biggest loser, declined
0.3 percent to C$1.1105 per U.S. dollar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Lee, the JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) chief equity strategist who has called for gains in American
stocks (SPX) for six straight years and got them in four, is leaving
the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee, 44, is stepping down today after holding the job since
2007, Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New York-based firm,
said in a telephone interview. Lee wants to take time away from
work, according to a memo sent to employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee, who worked for JPMorgan for 15 years, is among almost
two dozen Wall Street strategists who try to predict the
direction of the stock market and advise investors on which
companies to buy and sell. He had one of the highest year-end
forecasts for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, telling investors
last week to stay bullish and buy health-care, technology and
financial stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s just one of the best strategists in the game,&#8221;
Philip Orlando, who helps oversee nearly $400 billion as chief
equity-market strategist at Federated Investors Inc., said in a
phone interview. &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised and disappointed that a young
guy at the top of his game would be resigning.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee, a managing director at the largest U.S. bank,
confirmed the move in an e-mail to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have enjoyed the last 15 years at the firm
enormously,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I would like to spend a bit of time

&lt;p&gt;Neway competed unfairly with other valve makers including

&lt;p&gt;The state said that although the company may have as many

&lt;h2&gt;Pfizer Seen Facing Celebrex Copies in May After Patent Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, faces
competition to its $3 billion arthritis pill Celebrex in May
after a federal judge invalidated a patent that could have
delayed generic versions of the medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A patent expiring in December 2015 was invalid because it

in Norfolk, Virginia, said March 12 in a victory for companies
including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), Mylan Inc., and

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer &#8220;will pursue all available remedies, including an
immediate appeal of the court&#8217;s decision,&#8221; the company said in
a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actavis Plc (ACT) and Mylan said they plan to begin selling a
generic Celebrex in May, as long as they get regulatory
approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is G.D. Searle LLC v. Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
13-cv-00121, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia
(Norfolk). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overstock Says Patent Firms Drop Cases After Pledge to Fight &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overstock.com Inc. (OSTK), the online discount retailer, won
dismissal of two lawsuits brought by firms that specialize in
acquiring patents to obtain royalties from other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overstock, based in Salt Lake City, said in a statement
yesterday that after it pledged not to settle the infringement
cases, the plaintiffs, which it described as &#8220;patent trolls,&#8221;
&#8220;just walked away.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &#8220;patent troll&#8221; is sometimes used to disparage
companies that don&#8217;t make the products covered by the patents
they own and instead sue others for infringement to force a cash
settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One suit, brought by Eclipse IP LLC in April, accused
Overstock of infringing three patents. That case was dismissed
Feb. 24, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other suit was brought in May 2012, alleging that
Overstock infringed a single patent. Plaintiff Execware LLC
dropped that case in a March 7 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Eclipse IP LLC v. Overstock.com Inc., 2:13-cv-00293, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas
(Marshall); and Execware LLC v. Overstock.com Inc., 1:12-cv-00559, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Toshiba Corp. Memory Secrets Allegedly Leaked to Competitor &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ex-employee of a chipmaker that worked with Toshiba
Corp. (6502) is being questioned in connection with allegations he
leaked the company&#8217;s data to a South Korean company, the Yomiuri
Shimbun of Japan reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secrets he&#8217;s accused of leaking are related to a
Toshiba memory product, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former employee of the chipmaker allegedly copied
research data onto a storage device and brought it with him to a
new job with the Korean company, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narendra Modi, the front-running
prime ministerial candidate of India&#8217;s opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party, will contest national elections that begin next
month from Hinduism&#8217;s holiest city to boost his party&#8217;s support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi will contest from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, India&#8217;s
most populous state, in the north of the country, Ananth Kumar,
a senior BJP leader, said at a press conference in New Delhi
yesterday. Modi has previously only won elections from his home
state of Gujarat in western India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Modi is trying to project himself as a pan-Indian leader,
not just a Gujarat leader,&#8221; said A.S. Narang, professor of
political science at the New Delhi-based Indira Gandhi National
Open University. &#8220;By fighting from Uttar Pradesh, Modi is also
trying to mobilize rank and file in this critical state.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi is contesting from Uttar Pradesh to galvanize
supporters in a region that is critical to his chances of being
the country&#8217;s next leader. Uttar Pradesh, a 900-kilometer (560-mile) swath of India stretching southeast from New Delhi, is the
country&#8217;s biggest political prize, supplying a seventh of all
lawmakers in the lower house of the national parliament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polls show Modi&#8217;s party winning the most seats in the
election while falling short of a majority in the lower house of
parliament. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s ruling Congress
party has seen its popularity slump while overseeing the slowest
economic growth in a decade in the nation of 1.2 billion people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Opinion Poll &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BJP is on course to be the largest party in Uttar
Pradesh. The party will win 40 of the 80 available seats, up
from 10 currently, according to an opinion poll published by ABP
News television channel and Nielsen last month. In the past 15
national elections, only four times has the ruling party formed
a government without winning the most seats in Uttar Pradesh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, Varanasi is represented by former BJP president
Murli Manohar Joshi, who has indicated his reluctance to
relocate, according to the Indian Express newspaper. Joshi will
now contest from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, Kumar said. The BJP
President Rajnath Singh will contest the elections from Lucknow
in Uttar Pradesh, a seat once held by former BJP prime minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varanasi is where many Indians believe that anyone dying on
the banks of the river Ganges attains instant enlightenment and
a dip in the water atones for all sins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourists from across the world come to the city, attracted
by the more than 100 ghats, or a paved flight of stairs leading
to the river bank, where pilgrims offer prayers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. sued Torrent
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (TRP) in a bid to block sales of a generic
version of erectile-dysfunction drug Viagra while the largest
U.S. drugmaker&#8217;s patent is still in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torrent is seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for generic Viagra, also known as sildenafil
citrate, before Pfizer&#8217;s U.S. patent expires on Oct. 22, 2019,
according to a complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer reported $1.88 billion in Viagra sales in 2013, or
3.6% of total revenue, according to Bloomberg data. Pfizer has
sued other drug companies in the same court over similar claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company seeks an order permanently barring Ahmedabad,
India-based Torrent, its officers, agents and employees from
&#8220;making, using, selling, selling, marketing, distributing or
importing&#8221; the allegedly infringing drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. reached a
settlement that permits the Israeli drugmaker to market a
generic version of Viagra in the U.S. on Dec. 11, 2017, or
earlier under certain circumstances, New York-based Pfizer said
in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer Inc. (PFE) v. Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd.,
14-cv-01831, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell the most in almost two weeks as better-than-forecast
industrial production data overshadowed tension in Ukraine.
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) sold $5.5 billion of bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
to speculate on creditworthiness, declined 2.7 basis points to
65 basis points at 5:37 p.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the steepest intraday decline
since March 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors pushed the index lower as factory production in
the U.S. rose in February by the most in six months, boosting
confidence that a firming U.S. economy will bolster companies&#8217;
ability to repay debt. The U.S. and the European Union imposed
sanctions on Russia in their worst dispute since the Cold War
after a vote paved the way for President Vladimir Putin to annex
Crimea from Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We know the economy is going in the right direction,&#8221;
William Larkin, a fixed-income money manager who helps oversee
about $500 million at Cabot Money Management Inc., said in a
telephone interview from Salem, Massachusetts. Investors are
&#8220;focusing on the economic fundamentals right now,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;This whole thing with Russia is going to have a pretty limited
impact unless sanctions really become powerful.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 0.8 percent gain at U.S. manufacturers followed a
revised 0.9 percent slump the prior month, figures from the
Federal Reserve in Washington showed today. The median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.3 percent
advance. Total industrial production rose 0.6 percent, more than
projected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exxon Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swaps gauge typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon issued $750 million of three-year, floating-rate
notes that yield 4 basis points more than the three-month London
interbank offered rate and $500 million of five-year, floating-rate debt that yields 15 basis points more than Libor, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest energy producer by market value also
sold $1.75 billion of 1.819 percent, five-year securities that
yield 25 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, $1
billion of 3.176 percent, 10-year debentures that yield 48 basis
points more than benchmarks and $1.5 billion of 0.921 percent,
three-year notes with a relative yield of 15 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Meeting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds may be used to finance capital spending, for
acquisitions and to refinance commercial paper borrowings,
according to a regulatory filing today from the Irving, Texas-based company. Corporations sell commercial paper, typically
maturing in 270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such
as rent and salaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon last issued bonds in 1993, according to Bloomberg
data based on dollar-denominated sales of at least $250 million
and restricted to U.S. units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee
will hold its first meeting led by Chair Janet Yellen, who
succeeded Ben S. Bernanke in February. The central bank has
reduced monthly bond buying to $65 billion from $85 billion in
December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index, tied to the debt of 100 speculative-grade
companies, narrowed 10.7 basis points to 324.1, Bloomberg prices
show. Speculative-grade bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and less than BBB- at Standard  Poor&#8217;s. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold investment-grade
corporate bonds rather than government debt decreased 0.5 basis
point to 100.9, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) sold $5.5 billion
in its biggest bond offering on record as the world&#8217;s largest
energy producer by market value ends a more than two-decade
hiatus from the U.S. bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which commands top AAA credit ratings from Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s, issued fixed- and
floating-rate notes in a five-part sale. The Irving, Texas-based
company may use proceeds to finance capital spending, for
acquisitions and to refinance commercial paper borrowings,
according to a regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new securities will add to the company&#8217;s $22.7 billion
of total debt, which accounted for about 39 percent of its
trailing 12-month cash flow at year-end, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s a lower leverage level than the
71-percent ratio at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which has similar rankings
of Aaa at Moody&#8217;s and AAA at SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon sold $1 billion of 10-year, 3.176 percent coupon
bonds that yield 48 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $1.75 billion of five-year debt with a 1.819 percent
coupon and a yield spread of 25 basis points and $1.5 billion of
three-year, 0.921 percent debt that pays 15 basis points more
than benchmarks. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal also includes $750 million of three-year floating-rate securities that pay four basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate and $500 million of five-year floating-rate debt yielding 15 basis points more than that
benchmark. Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow
from one another, was set at 0.23 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon last issued bonds in 1993, according to Bloomberg
data based on dollar-denominated sales of at least $250 million
and restricted to U.S. units. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK) hired JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Christopher Jones as chief investment officer for stocks
in the Americas as the world&#8217;s biggest money manager seeks to
bolster its active equity business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones, who was CIO for JPMorgan Asset Management&#8217;s growth
and small-cap U.S. equity team, will join New York-based
BlackRock in a few months as head of the active stock unit in
the Americas, according to an internal memo provided by
BlackRock and sent today to the firm&#8217;s employees. Jones, 53,
replaces Chris Leavy, who went on medical leave in June of last
year. He will also serve as global co-head of fundamental
equity, alongside Nigel Bolton, head of BlackRock&#8217;s European
equity team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, who built
BlackRock through a series of acquisitions to manage $4.3
trillion, is seeking to improve fund performance in the stock
unit to attract assets amid a five-year rally in equities. A
push by Leavy to replace managers and focus on returns helped
BlackRock&#8217;s active U.S. stock funds beat 54 percent of rivals
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a great opportunity to take market share in many
areas of the actively managed business over the next few
years,&#8221; Quintin Price, global head of active strategies, said
in the memo. &#8220;I am sure Chris Jones&#8217;s arrival will help us
maximize our impact,&#8221; said Price, who had been filling in for
Leavy on an interim basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Replacement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones managed strategies including JPMorgan&#8217;s $15.5 billion
Large Cap Growth Fund (OLGAX) and $1.2 billion Small Cap Growth Fund.
The retail shares of the large cap fund returned an annual 23
percent a year over the past five years, ahead of 82 percent of
similarly managed funds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The small cap one delivered 29 percent annually over
the past five years, beating 83 percent of peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in
history in 1982, Jones joined Robert Fleming  Co. which was was
bought by Chase Manhattan in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eytan Shapiro, who has worked on JPMorgan&#8217;s small cap team
since 1992, will take over as head of the growth team, according
to Kristen Chambers, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan.
Shapiro will report to Paul Quinsee, head of U.S. equity at
JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improving Performance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leavy, 42, joined BlackRock in 2010 from OppenheimerFunds
Inc. and in 2012 added oversight of the large-capitalization
stock funds previously led by former equity chief investment
strategist Robert Doll. Tasked with improving performance he
brought in money managers such as Bartlett Geer from Putnam
Investments LLC and UBS AG&#8217;s Lawrence Kemp. During his tenure
Leavy replaced managers at strategies that represented about 40
percent of the division&#8217;s $115 billion at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While performance has picked up, BlackRock&#8217;s active U.S.
stock funds still trail 62 percent of peers on an annualized
basis in the three years ended Dec. 31,  according to Chicago-based research firm Morningstar Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients pulled $15.4 billion from BlackRock&#8217;s active stock
funds last year, while depositing $74 billion into its exchange-traded funds, according to a company filing. Industrywide,
investors put $161 billion into equity mutual funds in 2013,
based on data from the Investment Company Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Continue Overseeing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price said in the memo that Leavy, who left in June to
treat his diabetes and a related cardiovascular condition, won&#8217;t
be returning to BlackRock this year. Leavy has been aware and
supportive of the plan to identify a new CIO if he couldn&#8217;t
return to his role, Price said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, BlackRock said Bolton, also the CIO of
international fundamental equity, was facing a civil proceeding
by an Italian securities regulator alleging he used nonpublic
information to avoid losses for clients last year. A BlackRock
spokesman at the time said the firm had fully cooperated with
the regulator and conducted its own investigation and found no
evidence to support the regulator&#8217;s allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Stournaras will continue to oversee BlackRock&#8217;s
large-cap funds, such as the $1.8 billion BlackRock Large Cap
Core Fund and the $864 million BlackRock Large Cap Value Fund,
which he had co-managed with Leavy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Replicate Success &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fink has said he hopes the equity unit can replicate the
success of BlackRock&#8217;s bond unit in improving performance and
attracting deposits. In 2012, the firm reorganized its bond
business to give unit heads Rick Rieder and Kevin Holt greater
autonomy and accountability. In 2013, BlackRock&#8217;s active bonds
attracted $10.4 billion, as fixed-income rivals such as Pacific
Investment Management Co. faced redemptions amid investor fears
of rising interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see a huge market for us in the active equity space,&#8221;
Fink said during a conference call with analysts in January.
&#8220;You have to start with performance before you can get
involved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) are set for a fee bonanza with both banks playing roles on
the sale of Vivendi SA (VIV)&#8217;s French wireless unit, and Vodafone
Group Plc (VOD)&#8217;s purchase of a Spanish cable company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based banks are advisers on Altice SA (ATC)&#8217;s effort
to acquire Vivendi&#8217;s SFR unit in a $28 billion deal, and also
Vodafone&#8217;s agreement to buy Grupo Corporativo Ono SA for $10
billion. If completed, the SFR purchase will be the second-largest globally this year, and the two transactions could
generate as much as $173 million in advisory fees for Morgan
Stanley, JP Morgan and other banks, according to estimates from
New York-based research firm Freeman  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan are currently the top advisers
so far this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Dealmakers
are having their strongest start to the year since before the
global financial crisis amid growing economic confidence and
rising share prices. Deals in technology, media and
telecommunications continue to drive overall activity, with five
of the top 10 being in that space, including the proposed SFR
purchase, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivendi is in exclusive talks with Altice to sell for an
enterprise value of 20 billion euros, or $28 billion, according
to its billionaire owner Patrick Drahi. A deal could be
completed by the end of the month, Drahi said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that deal closes, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley could
split as much as $52 million as advisers to Altice, while
Vivendi&#8217;s banks Citigroup Inc. and Lazard Ltd. could share as
much as $59 million, according to Freeman estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, JPMorgan will share in up to $35 million of fees
with three other banks that advised Ono on its 7.2 billion euro
sale to Vodafone. Deutsche Bank AG was the lead adviser to Ono&#8217;s
shareholders, and Bank of America Corp. and UBS AG were co-advisers along with JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For its part as an adviser to Vodafone, Morgan Stanley will
split as much as $27 million with Robertson Robey Associates
LLP, which separately advised the buyer&#8217;s board, Freeman&#8217;s
estimates show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) says
investors should favor debt from better quality companies, after
yield premiums jumped the most in almost six months last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The headlines from China and emerging markets have caused
volatility in the Asia credit market,&#8221; analysts led by Hong
Kong-based Kenneth Ho wrote in a March 15 note. &#8220;We think
investors should look at stronger quality corporates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to borrow in dollars for companies in Asia outside
Japan climbed 11.1 basis points last week, the most since the
period ended Sept. 27, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.
indexes. Bond risk in the region advanced, with a gauge of 40
investment-grade issuers gaining 8.5 basis points, the most in
seven weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market investors from Europe have mixed views on
Asia, according to Goldman Sachs. Defaults in China, where
Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science  Technology Co. failed to
fully pay a debt coupon earlier this month, are contributing to
caution, the analysts wrote. China bond funds extended their
longest streak of outflows since early in the third quarter of
2013 in the week to March 12, EPFR Global said in an e-mailed
report dated March 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk appetite weakened amid slowing Chinese industrial
output and emerging-market uncertainty, Goldman Sachs said.
Factory production rose 8.6 percent in January and February from
a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said last
week, the weakest start to a year since 2009. Voters in Crimea
chose to become part of Russia in a referendum deemed illegal by

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although China high yield, especially the real estate
sector, has underperformed this year, we think it&#8217;s too early to
turn positive as we expect more credit differentiation and more
headline news on defaults to come,&#8221; Ho said in the note. &#8220;We
also maintain our preference for better quality corporates and
banks in India and Indonesia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Australia gauge rose 1 basis point to

highest close since Feb. 4, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the

&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) reached a
compromise with shareholders, saying it will split the roles of
chairman and chief executive officer in the future under what
the company called &#8220;normal&#8221; circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, amended
governance guidelines that already say the chairman will be an
independent director, unless the board decides &#8220;the best
interests of shareholders would be otherwise better served,&#8221;
according to a regulatory filing today. The change outlines
steps to be taken when the chairman isn&#8217;t independent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move averted a showdown at Disney&#8217;s annual meeting,
held today in Portland, Oregon, and led by Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger. A group of investors had sought a
shareholder vote on a measure to let owners of 3 percent or more
of the stock nominate board candidates. That plan was withdrawn
after talks with the company, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal was submitted by Hermes Equity Ownership
Services, the California State Teachers Retirement System and
the Connecticut Retirement Plans  Trust Funds, according to a
January filing by Burbank, California-based Disney. They cited
the board&#8217;s decision to make Iger chairman and CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut &#8220;expressly reserves its rights to re-file the
resolution for the 2015 proxy season, if the engagement between
the co-filers and Disney does not continue to demonstrate
transparency on board leadership issues,&#8221; state Treasurer
Denise L. Nappier said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annual Review &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its filing today, Disney said that, when the chairman
isn&#8217;t independent, it will evaluate the arrangement annually and
include a written explanation in proxy materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger, 63, has been CEO since 2005 and added the role of
chairman in 2012. The board has turned back calls to split the
positions in previous years. Disney appointed an independent
chairman in 2004 amid a shareholder revolt against then-CEO
Michael Eisner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At today&#8217;s meeting, investors voted 80 percent in favor of
the company&#8217;s executive compensation plan, an increase from less
than 60 percent the past two years. They also rejected a
shareholder proposal to limit accelerated executive pay in the
event of a change in control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger earned $34.3 million in total compensation in fiscal
2013, a 15 percent decline as Disney failed to beat its targets
as handily as in the prior year. The company posted record sales
and profit for the third straight year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adviser&#8217;s Take &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., an advisory firm,
recommended that investors back the executive pay plan this year
after suggesting they reject it in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;CEO pay and company performance are reasonably aligned
for the year in review, and CEO total pay decreased, for the
first time since 2009,&#8221; ISS said in a Feb. 25 report. &#8220;The
company has engaged with shareholders to seek input following
notable investor dissent to the say-on-pay proposal last year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So-called say-on-pay proposals, required by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, give shareholders a
nonbinding advisory vote on executive pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, Iger said the company plans a pirate-themed
land in Shanghai Disneyland when it opens at the end of 2015. He
announced a third installment to &#8220;Cars,&#8221; the Pixar film
series, and said the &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; picture scheduled for 2015
will take place 30 years after &#8220;Return of the Jedi.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose 0.7 percent to $81.99 at the close in New York.
The stock has advanced 7.3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones SA, Chile&#8217;s second-largest wireless operator,
rose the most in six months after JPMorgan Chase  Co. said it
offers faster growth than competitors at an attractive price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares advanced 5.1 percent to 6,530 pesos at 4:30 p.m.
in Santiago, the most since Sept. 23. It was the best performer
on the benchmark IPSA index, which rose 1.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its recommendation on Entel to the
equivalent of buy from neutral. The company&#8217;s earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will climb at an
average annual rate of 9 percent through 2018, compared with 6
percent for Tim Participacoes SA and 1 percent for America Movil
SAB, according to analysts at the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Current valuations do not reflect Entel&#8217;s superior growth
profile,&#8221; analysts Andre Baggio and Marcelo Santos wrote in a
report dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock price is 10.3 times its trailing 12 months of
earnings, versus an average 15.7 times for regional peers,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entel&#8217;s shares have lost 33 percent since April 4, when
Entel said it would pay $400 million for Nextel Peru, a unit of
NII Holdings Inc. The IPSA fell 17 percent in the same span. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nextel Peru had a loss before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization of $36 million in 2012, according to an April 4
report from JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe investors overreacted to this acquisition, and
that Entel is a compelling stock,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financing arrangments in China
using commodities from copper to rubber as collateral to obtain
credit may be unwound in 12 to 24 months, driven by increased
yuan volatility, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as 1 million metric tons of copper and 30 million
tons of iron ore could be released if the deals unwind, the bank
said in a report today. The unwinding would be bearish &#8220;given
relatively limited physical liquidity to absorb the shock,&#8221;
analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote. For now, the deals remain
profitable and an &#8220;abrupt government crackdown&#8221; on them is
unlikely given the potential effect on the country&#8217;s economic
growth, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our view is that Chinese commodity financing deals will
gradually unwind over the medium term, driven by an increase in
foreign exchange hedging costs, which would slowly erode
financing deal profitability and eventually close the interest
rate arbitrage,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transactions using commodities as collateral made as
much as $160 billion, or 31 percent of China&#8217;s total short-term
foreign-exchange loans, the report showed. Gold, copper and iron
ore are most commonly used as collateral, followed by soybeans,
palm oil, rubber, nickel, zinc and aluminum, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Hot Money&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe Chinese commodity financing deals are ongoing
and facilitating &#8216;hot money&#8217; inflows into China by providing a
mechanism to import low-cost foreign financing,&#8221; the analysts
wrote. The deals &#8220;create excess physical demand and tighten the
physical markets artificially; in contrast, an unwind creates
excess supply and thus is bearish to prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of iron ore, profitability of most
hedged arrangements remains &#8220;substantial&#8221; because of positive
yuan- and dollar-based interest-rate differentials, limited
depreciation of the yuan last month and abundant commodity
supply, which limits hedging costs, the bank said. Continued
weakening of the yuan may spur some of the deals to unwind
sooner than expected, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s yuan had the biggest three-day decline since at
least 2007 on concern rising financial risks will weaken growth
in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. The yuan has dropped 2.4
percent from a 20-year high of 6.0406 per dollar reached on Jan.
14, after strengthening 2.9 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1 Million Tons &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returns from using copper as collateral are still more than
10 percent and up to 1 million tons of the metal may be tied to
such arrangements, Goldman Sachs said. That&#8217;s up from 500,000
tons nine months ago, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imports of copper and iron ore into China rose to records
in January on financing demand, before sliding in February as
the currency weakened and the state moved to rein in shadow
banking. About 40 percent of iron-ore stockpiles at Chinese
ports are linked to finance deals, Mysteel Research estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financing arrangements probably lie behind a surge in
Chinese gold imports from Hong Kong, Goldman Sachs said. The
deals involve physical imports of gold and exports of semi-fabricated products to bring foreign exchange into China,
according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of commodities used for financing increased
since mid-2013 as the government cut the amount of money that
could be borrowed per commodity unit, Goldman Sachs said. Copper
financing may account for about $23 billion worth of short-term
foreign exchange loans, iron ore for $10.4 billion and soybeans
for $7.7 billion in a base case, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s animated picture &#8220;Frozen&#8221; has become Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)&#8217;s best-ever selling kids movie, the online retailer said today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The film is No. 1 in both DVD/Blu-ray disc sales and digital downloads, Stacey Keller, a spokeswoman for Seattle-based Amazon, said in an e-mail. The sales include advance orders which, for the DVD versions, began on Nov. 27. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s two-disc Blu-ray and DVD pack sells for $19.96 on Amazon.com, while the digital download costs $14.99 for the standard version and $19.99 for the high-definition version through Amazon Instant Video. The Blu-ray and DVD versions were released yesterday, according to Disney. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many of the buyers have already seen the movie and want to watch it over and over again with their kids,&#8221; said Paul Dergarabedian, senior analyst for the research firm Rentrak Corp. &#8220;This film is unstoppable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, made &#8220;Frozen&#8221; available for digital download on Apple Inc.&#8217;s iTunes store as part of the introduction of its Disney Movies Anywhere application on Feb. 25. The movie was first available for advance ordering on iTunes when it opened in wide release in November, according to Christine Monaghan, an Apple spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Box Office &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bob Iger, Disney&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, said yesterday at the company&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting that &#8220;Frozen&#8221; would pass the company&#8217;s own &#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; to become the top-grossing animated film of all time.

&lt;p&gt;Javier Martin-Artajo, the former
JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  Co. banker fighting U.S. extradition from Spain
over trading losses that surpassed $6.2 billion, is challenging
the U.K. financial regulator in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, who oversaw synthetic credit trading at the
bank&#8217;s chief investment office in London, filed the case against
the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority at a tribunal last week,
according to the court&#8217;s website. No other details about the
claim were available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was indicted in Manhattan federal court in September for
allegedly helping to hide losses caused by Bruno Iksil, the
Frenchman who became known as the London Whale. The U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission said in a parallel lawsuit
that Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout, a trader who worked for
him, engaged in a scheme to enhance the portfolio&#8217;s apparent
performance and thereby curry favor with their supervisors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achilles Macris, who led the international CIO at New York-based JPMorgan during the losses, filed a separate challenge
against the FCA in October. Macris was &#8220;deprived of the
opportunity of responding&#8221; to the regulator regarding its
findings in the case, his lawyers said at the time. The
documents in both cases aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCA fined JPMorgan 138 million pounds ($228 million) in
September and found that the CIO&#8217;s London management
deliberately misled them. Neither Macris nor Martin-Artajo were
mentioned by name in the regulator&#8217;s report on the fine, and
neither were accused of wrongdoing by the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finance Tribunal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo&#8217;s cases were filed at a finance tribunal
which is limited to reviewing disputes involving challenges to
decisions by U.K. regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lara Joseph, a spokeswoman for the FCA, declined to
comment. Lista Cannon, a lawyer for Martin-Artajo in London, and
William Leone, his attorney in New York, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, a Spanish citizen, asked a court in Madrid
in November not to extradite him because the alleged events
happened in the U.K. rather than the U.S., and because he has
roots in Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leone told a court in New York earlier this year that his
client isn&#8217;t a fugitive. Grout and Martin-Artajo have denied
wrongdoing, while Iksil is cooperating in the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are SEC v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cv-05677, and U.S.
v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cr-00707, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s benchmark peso bonds
climbed the most since July and the peso rallied after JPMorgan
Chase  Co. said it planned to raise the Andean country&#8217;s
weighting on two of its indexes starting May 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of peso bonds, or TES, maturing in 2024 climbed
1.955 centavos to 122.484 centavos per peso at the close in
Bogota trading, according to data from the central bank. Yields
plunged 24 basis points, or 0.24 percentage point, to 6.88
percent, the lowest level since Jan. 22. The peso gained 1
percent to 2,009.60 per U.S. dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s weighting on the GBI-EM Global Diversified index
may rise to 8.05 percent from 3.24 percent and that on the GBI-EM Global index may increase to 5.6 percent from 1.81 percent,
JPMorgan said. Turkey, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia and Hungary
may have a reduced weighting, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are anticipating more inflows into the TES
market,&#8221; Juan David Ballen, an analyst at Alianza Valores
brokerage, said in a phone interview in Bogota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s TES bonds will probably rally further, according
to Kenneth Lam, a Latin America currency and rates strategist at
Citigroup in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The weight increase should generate very significant
inflows into TES bonds,&#8221; Lam wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weightings will be increased &#8220;as a result of improved
transparency and accessibility for international investors in
the local TES market,&#8221; JPMorgan said in its report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five securities including TES due in 2016, 2018, 2022, 2024
and 2028 will be included in a &#8220;phased approach&#8221; starting May
30 and ending Sept. 30, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact on the peso &#8220;could be more muted compared to
bonds, since a portion of the inflow is likely to be hedged,&#8221;
Citi&#8217;s Lam wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will sell its
physical commodities unit to Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. for $3.5
billion, ending a five-year foray into owning and storing raw
materials amid pressure from regulators to leave the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, disclosed in a statement from New York-based
JPMorgan today, takes the bank out of industries such as
petroleum products and power while cementing Mercuria&#8217;s standing
among the world&#8217;s biggest commodity traders. JPMorgan will
continue to provide services and products tied to commodities
including financing, market-making and the vaulting and trading
of precious metals, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our goal from the outset was to find a buyer that was
interested in preserving the value of JPMorgan&#8217;s physical
business,&#8221; Blythe Masters, head of the company&#8217;s global
commodities operations, said in the statement. &#8220;Mercuria is a
global leader in the commodities markets and an excellent long-term home.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is selling amid concern among regulators that
banks could control prices if they own commodities as well as
trade them, or suffer catastrophic losses that would endanger
the financial system. The Federal Reserve said in July it might
force insured lenders to get out, and JPMorgan agreed later that
month to pay $410 million to settle claims that it manipulated
power markets, without admitting wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) appointed Asif
Raza to lead its corporate banking business for the Middle East
and North Africa as it expands in the oil-rich region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raza will report to Sjoerd Leenart, senior country officer
for MENA and Jose Linares, head of the corporate banking
division for Europe, Middle East and Africa, according to a memo
obtained today by Bloomberg News. The contents of the document
were confirmed by a bank spokeswoman. Raza was previously head
of treasury and investor services in the region for JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank is boosting its presence in the
Middle East, hiring executives from banks including Nomura
International Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc. It promoted Rayan Fayez
as senior country officer for Saudi Arabia in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender appointed Ali Moosa as head of treasury
services for MENA, replacing Raza. Moosa will also retain his
role as senior country officer for Bahrain, Egypt  Lebanon and
also report to Leenart, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) employee
was charged with stealing the software maker&#8217;s trade secrets,
including code for a program to protect against copyright
infringement, and leaking them to a blogger in France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Kibkalo, a Russian national, was arrested yesterday

filings in Seattle. He admitted to Microsoft&#8217;s investigators
that he provided the confidential information to the blogger,
according to the criminal complaint filed by U.S. prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was alerted to the theft in 2012 by an

product developed for internal Microsoft use only, according to
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;

released a study on the economic effects of trade-secret theft.
The study identified &#8220;malicious insiders&#8221; as one of five

others were nation states, competitors, transnational organized
crime and what the report&#8217;s authors called &#8220;hactavists.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activist investors agreed to
withdraw a resolution to be voted on at Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s (XOM)
annual shareholders&#8217; meeting calling on the world&#8217;s largest oil
company to disclose its exposure to stricter climate-change
laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arjuna Capital, a unit of closely-held Baldwin Brothers
Inc., and environmental activist group As You Sow said today
they dropped the resolution after Exxon agreed to provide
shareholders with details on oilfields and other assets that may
become obsolete as governments around the world restrict carbon
emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Silvestri, a spokesman at Irving, Texas-based Exxon,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) and other U.S.
producers of metallurgical coal slumped after Bank of America
Corp. said supply and demand fundamentals for the commodity will
be &#8220;depressed&#8221; for the next several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter dropped 12 percent to $7.97 at 9:35 a.m. in New
York. Earlier it fell 15 percent, the biggest intraday decline
since July. Arch Coal Inc. slid as much as 4.4 percent and Alpha
Natural Resources Inc. dropped 5.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark contract prices for metallurgical coal, which is
used to make steel, are at $143 a ton in the first quarter, the
lowest since 2010. Quarterly prices will be in a range of $130
to $150 a ton in the next several years, Timna Tanners, a New
York-based analyst at Bank of America, said today in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanners cited excess supply, the falling marginal cost of
production, the use of substitute raw materials, and the
resistance of mining companies to making production cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She cut her target price for Birmingham, Alabama-based
Walter to $2 from $8. She also cut her target for Arch to $2.50
from $3; Alpha to $3 from $4; and Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) to $18
from $19. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) leapfrogged Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last year to be the largest bank in raw materials revenue before announcing the $3.5 billion sale of its physical commodities business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman, which earned the most money from raw materials among the top 10 investment banks in 2012, ranked second last year and Morgan Stanley was third, London-based analytics company Coalition said in a report e-mailed today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two of the top three banks by commodities revenue, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, are selling parts of the business amid slumping revenue and concern among regulators that banks could control prices if they own commodities as well as trade them, or suffer losses that would endanger the financial system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Commodities revenue at the 10 largest banks slumped 18 percent last year to $4.5 billion because of a &#8220;depressed client environment&#8221; and low volatility, Coalition estimated in February. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials dropped last year for the first time since 2008. The gauge&#8217;s 100-day historic volatility fell to as low as 10.5 percent in April, from as much as 23.8 percent in January 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve said in July it might force insured lenders to get out of physical commodities, and JPMorgan agreed later that month to pay $410 million to settle claims that it manipulated power markets, without admitting wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) declined to comment on the Coalition report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mercuria Purchase &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said yesterday it&#8217;s selling its physical commodities unit to Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. for $3.5 billion. The unit had $3.3 billion in assets and generated $750 million in annual operating profit before compensation costs, according to people who have seen documents related to the sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank will continue to provide services and products tied to commodities including financing, market-making and the vaulting and trading of precious metals, it said yesterday. JPMorgan was the top lender to mining and energy companies last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley agreed in December to sell its global oil merchant unit to OAO Rosneft. The terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Barclays Plc and BNP Paribas SA were among &#8220;tier two&#8221; performers, rated No. 4 to No. 6 for commodity revenue, Coalition said, without providing specific rankings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the largest investment bank, with $23.3 billion in revenue and $12.5 billion in fixed income, currencies and commodities, Coalition said. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Deutsche Bank and Citigroup Inc. (C) tied for second place in investment banking revenue, it said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Maria Kolesnikova in London at mkolesnikova@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Claudia Carpenter at ccarpenter2@bloomberg.net Andrew Reierson &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s peso posted the biggest
weekly gain among all of the world&#8217;s currencies on speculation
inflows will rise after JPMorgan Chase  Co. said it planned to
raise the country&#8217;s weighting on two of its indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso appreciated 2.4 percent to 1,994.51 per U.S.
dollar this week, the most since June 2012. The currency fell
0.1 percent at the close of trading in Bogota today after the
central bank held the target lending rate at 3.25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said March 19 that it will probably more than
double the weighting of Colombia&#8217;s peso bonds in its GBI-EM
Global Diversified Index to 8.05 percent from 3.24 percent
starting May 30, citing the government&#8217;s effort to increase
access to foreigners. The index is used as a benchmark by firms
that manage around $195.7 billion, JPMorgan strategists
including Holly Huffman wrote in a separate report that day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The possible amount of portfolio inflows that could
arrive to Colombia is significant,&#8221; Credit Suisse analyst Juan Lorenzo Maldonado wrote today in a research report to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Credit Director Michel Janna said in an interview
last week that the nation may reduce a tax on foreigners&#8217; bond
profits to less than 5 percent or eliminate it entirely.
Colombia chopped foreigners&#8217; taxes to 14 percent from 33 percent
in January 2013 to spur demand and cut borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said that it will add Colombian peso bonds, or
TES, due in June 2016, November 2018, May 2022, July 2024 and
April 2028 to its index in a &#8220;phased approach&#8221; starting May 30
and ending Sept. 30. The bank will also include the securities
in its GBI-EM Global index, probably boosting the weighting to
5.6 percent from 1.81 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dollar Purchases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s central bank announced today it will extend its
dollar purchase program to as much as $1 billion from April to
June. Policy makers had said the bank will buy as much as $1
billion in the first quarter. It bought $11.5 million today and
has purchased $542.5 million this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers left the overnight lending rate unchanged
today at 3.25 percent for a 12th straight month, as expected by
all 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The decision was
unanimous, central bank Governor Jose Dario Uribe told reporters
in Bogota after the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weighting increase &#8220;can compensate to some degree the
impact that the adjustment in global liquidity has on the
exchange rate and interest rates in the Colombian market,&#8221; the
central bank said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of benchmark peso bonds maturing in 2024 climbed
0.545 centavo to 124.375 centavos per peso today, according to
data from the central bank. Yields fell six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 6.66 percent. They were down 46 basis
points for the week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, Exxon Mobil has walked around with an environmentalist target on its chest. So it was news when the world&#8217;s biggest oil company by market value agreed to share its plans for dealing with climate change. A look at what we already know about Exxon&#8217;s climate strategy shows why disclosure may be a savvy move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows how companies estimate the future cost of carbon pollution. Right now, few countries outside Europe regulate it. That&#8217;s changing and is likely to intensify in the lead-up to key UN climate negotiations in 2015. Some companies use a so-called shadow price to anticipate the future cost from climate policy when planning new projects. Of 30 U.S. companies that use a shadow carbon price, Exxon&#8217;s is among the most aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg BNA &#8212; Exxon Mobil Corp. has agreed to publish a report describing its plans for a future in which market forces and stricter climate regulation may leave some of its carbon reserves unburnable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is the first oil and gas producer in the U.S. to commit to reporting on its risks of stranded assets due to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commitment came in response to a shareholder resolution filed in the fall of 2013 by wealth management firm Arjuna Capital and shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. The resolution was withdrawn after months of negotiations with Exxon Mobil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have increasingly raised concerns that stranded assets, also known as a &#8220;carbon bubble,&#8221; could occur if fossil fuel reserves are suddenly revalued under future government policies for climate change or greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its report, Exxon Mobil will let shareholders know what types of reserves it holds&#8212;from deep sea drilling, tar sands or elsewhere&#8212;so that &#8220;investors have a better idea of where the risks lie and how well the company can withstand those risks,&#8221; Danielle Fugere, As You Sow's president, told Bloomberg BNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That kind of differentiation is important to shareholders as they decide which company to invest in,&#8221; Fugere said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report will also discuss how climate risks could affect Exxon Mobil's capital expenditure plans. The report will be posted on Exxon Mobil's website by the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exxon Mobil's Response
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement at Arjuna Capital, said she was &#8220;very impressed&#8221; by Exxon Mobil's responsiveness to the shareholder resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the past, they've been seen as a climate denier,&#8221; Lamb told Bloomberg BNA. Exxon Mobil seems to be making more of an effort to engage with shareholders on climate change and related issues, &#8220;in part because you can only hide under a rock for so long,&#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lamb said Exxon Mobil made a &#8220;big move&#8221; recently when it disclosed to CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, that it has included a carbon proxy cost in its long-term business plans since 2007. Exxon Mobil is one of about 30 companies in the U.S. that put an internal price on carbon pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon Mobil invests billions of dollars in energy projects which take decades to plan and execute,&#8221; Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers told Bloomberg BNA in December. &#8220;Although climate policies remain uncertain today, for the purposes of our business planning we assume that governments will continue to gradually adopt a wide variety of more stringent policies to help stem greenhouse gas emissions.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil declined to comment on the shareholder resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Setting Standard
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Exxon Mobil has the potential to set a standard for other energy companies in terms of what kind of information is important to investors, Fugere said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 10 energy companies, including Chevron Corp., Hess Corp. and Anadarko Petroleum Corp., have received similar shareholder resolutions on carbon asset risk so far during the 2014 proxy season. Discussions with these companies are &#8220;in various stages,&#8221; with some proposals leaning toward withdrawals, while many of the other resolutions will likely go to a vote, Fugere said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As You Sow filed the first shareholder resolution on carbon asset risk with CONSOL Energy last proxy season. The resolution went to a vote and received about 20 percent support, which is considered high among shareholder resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, CONSOL has divested nearly half of its carbon-heavy coal holdings in favor of less carbon-intensive natural gas, which Fugere said is an indication of where the energy market is going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies need to acknowledge that preparing for a low-carbon future is a necessity, not a choice,&#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more about Bloomberg BNA, click here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Andrea Vittorio in Washington at avittorio@bna.com&lt;/p&gt;


  
</body></entry><entry author="By Andras Gergely" date="Mar 21, 2014 12:35 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-21/goldman-sees-forint-slump-to-2-year-low-as-rate-cuts-hit-yields.html"><headline>Goldman Sees Forint Slump to 2-Year Low as Rates Hit Yields</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The forint will probably drop to a
two-year low after Hungary&#8217;s central bank cut interest rates to
a record, pushing bond yields to a level that doesn&#8217;t compensate
investors for currency risk, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forint, which depreciated 5.1 percent this year to
313.21 per euro, will probably slide toward 320, which would be
the weakest since January 2012, New York- and London-based
analysts Themistoklis Fiotakis and Magdalena Polan wrote in an
e-mailed note yesterday. Hungarian policy makers will probably
signal an end to easing after a 10 basis-point cut next week and
won&#8217;t increase rates in the coming months, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forint&#8217;s slump was caused by a reduction in Federal
Reserve stimulus and the crisis in Ukraine and is beyond the
government&#8217;s control, Hungary&#8217;s Economy Minister Mihaly Varga
said in an interview with Gazdasagi Radio on March 18. Hungarian
bonds yield an average 286 basis points above U.S. Treasuries,
compared with an emerging-market average of 315, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Recent statements by Hungarian officials argue that there
still may be some way to go before tolerance to currency
depreciation runs out,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;Dovish surprises
are likely to maintain the tightening pressure on local currency
premia and bring EUR/HUF to 320.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives trading shows there is a 38 percent chance the
forint will weaken past 320 per euro in the next year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The probability it will
strengthen to 300 is 30 percent. The forint decline this year is
the fourth-worst performance among 24 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, following the Argentine peso, the Russian
ruble and Chile&#8217;s peso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed, Ukraine &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gauge of 20 emerging-market currencies has fallen 1.5
percent in 2014. The Fed voted on March 19 to reduce its bond-purchase program to $55 billion a month. Russian President
Vladimir Putin signed legislation today to complete the process
of Crimea&#8217;s accession to Russia. The move is against the wishes
of Ukraine, last month ousted pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Yanukovych. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magyar Nemzeti Bank cut its benchmark rate to a record 2.7
percent last month in 19 consecutive steps. The Monetary Policy
Council will probably cut the rate by 10 basis points next week,
in line with Goldman&#8217;s estimate, according to the median of 22
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forint is vulnerable because the extra yield on
Hungary&#8217;s local-currency bonds over hard currency-denominated
assets offer little or no reward, the Goldman analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local Spread &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on securities included in the Bloomberg Hungary
Local Sovereign Bond Index are 54 basis points below the
constituents of an index of Hungary&#8217;s dollar-denominated bonds.
That compares with a premium of as much as 200 basis points on
forint-denominated bonds before the monetary easing started in
2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic policy will have to adapt to a weak forint after
Hungary&#8217;s April 6 parliamentary election, said Varga, whose
Fidesz party is poised to win the vote according to all opinion
polls. The next administration should strengthen export-oriented
industries to exploit the currency&#8217;s weakness, rather than
trying to influence the exchange rate, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and directors
including Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon were sued by an
investor for creating &#8220;a culture of lawlessness&#8221; that led to
billions of dollars in settlements tied to mortgage-backed
securities and Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Dimon&#8217;s leadership, the New York-based company sold
low-quality residential mortgage-backed securities, failed to
report questionable activity by Madoff, manipulated energy
markets and engaged in fraudulent credit-card billing
strategies, the Iron Workers Mid-South Pension Fund said in
papers filed March 17 in Delaware Chancery Court and partly
unsealed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, CEO since December 2005 and chairman since December
2006, &#8220;knowingly, recklessly, or with gross negligence created
a culture of lawlessness&#8221; that resulted in fines, penalties
settlements and related costs totaling at least $20 billion last
year, the fund said. At the same time, Dimon received a
74 percent pay raise to $20 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, agreed in
November to a $13 billion settlement of government allegations
that it misled investors and public when it sold bonds backed by
faulty residential mortgages. U.S. and state officials blamed
JPMorgan&#8217;s actions for helping to cause the credit crisis that
led to the worst recession since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are abandoning their
sell ratings on Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) as the stock
posts its best quarterly rally since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three banks raised their recommendations on Teva, the
world&#8217;s biggest maker of generic drugs, to neutral from sell in
the past two weeks as the stock soared to a three-year high in
New York trading. The analysts said the company is making
progress in its push to maintain market share of its best-selling drug Copaxone while a boom in mergers and acquisitions
in the industry yields deals of as much as $21 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva have rallied 23
percent this year. The stock, the biggest investment in
billionaire George Soros&#8217;s fund, is the third-best performer on
the Market Vectors U.S. Listed Pharmaceutical 25 Price Index
after trailing the 21 other companies in the measure in 2013.
Mounting concern about the company&#8217;s leadership and growth
outlook has sent Teva&#8217;s valuation to 11 times estimated
earnings, the second-lowest multiple among 15 global generic
drug makers tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The upgrades are not saying everything is great but, at
the valuation it got to&#8221; investors are reconsidering their
positions, Jacob de Tusch-Lec, who helps oversee about $23
billion in equities at Artemis Investment Management LLP in
London, said by phone on March 20. &#8220;Essentially things have not
gotten worse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weekly Rally &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index rose 2.5 percent to
119.39 last week, the most since Feb. 14, extending its gain
this year to 7.3 percent. The TA-25 Index advanced 0.7 percent
at today&#8217;s close in Israel, extending its 2014 advance to 4.7
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leslie Shribman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, Lauren Bellmare at Morgan Stanley, and Amanda Smith at JPMorgan
declined to comment on their analysts&#8217; reports. Denise Bradley,
a spokeswoman for Teva in North Wales, Pennsylvania, didn&#8217;t
respond to an e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been advising clients to buy Mylan Inc. (MYL), the
biggest U.S. generic-drug maker, since October 2007. The shares
have more than tripled since then. Morgan Stanley rated Perrigo
Co. (PRGO), a maker of generic over-the-counter medicines, the
equivalent of buy on Feb. 4, 2013, before a 50 percent rally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva converted 8.7 percent of 20-milligram Copaxone
prescriptions to its 40-milligram version in the week ended Feb.
28, according to Bloomberg Industries. Leerink Partners and
Cowen  Co. analysts said the results mean the company may
deliver on its plan to get 30 percent to 50 percent of patients
on the three-times-weekly injection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$4 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving patients to the new version is key because the
remaining U.S. patent on the $4 billion-drug expires at the end
of May, while the new version will be protected from generic
competition until 2030. Teva&#8217;s next hurdle will be persuading
insurers in the U.S. to continue paying for the branded, three-times-a-week shot once a cheaper copycat of the daily version
becomes available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen out of the 29 analysts tracked by Bloomberg
recommend buying Teva&#8217;s shares, the highest level since
September. Thirteen analysts have a hold rating, while one says
sell, the data showed. The shares declined 1.4 percent to 172.60
shekels, or the equivalent of $49.54, today in Tel Aviv. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wave of mergers and acquisitions among generic drug
companies has also triggered a rally in Teva&#8217;s shares, according
to Jason Kolbert, an analyst at Maxim Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actavis Plc (ACT) agreed to purchase Forest Laboratories Inc. for
$25 billion last month, and Mylan Inc. Chief Executive Heather Bresch said Feb. 27 that the generic-drug maker may make a large
acquisition this year. Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh said
March 4 that Teva is open for deals as the pace of industry
consolidation quickens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Hot Topic&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The acquisition of generic companies has now become a
very hot topic,&#8221; Kolbert, who has a buy rating for Teva, said
in a March 20 phone interview from New York. Actavis&#8217; purchase
was a &#8220;gift&#8221; for the Israeli drugmaker, he said. &#8220;That was
the trigger that got people focusing on Teva.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros Fund Management LLC, the family office of billionaire
George Soros, boosted its stake in Teva in the last three months
of 2013, making the Israeli drugmaker its largest holding in the
fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) agreed to buy Maker
Studios, a supplier of online video content to YouTube, for $500
million, gaining technology and experience with short-form
entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney also agreed to pay as much as $450 million more if
Maker Studios meets &#8220;strong&#8221; performance targets, the Burbank,
California-based company said today in a statement. That could
boost the total to $950 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Maker Studios, Disney is following DreamWorks
Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) into an online video business with expanding
audiences and little profit. DreamWorks Animation, producer of
the &#8220;Shrek&#8221; movies, bought AwesomenessTV, a smaller competitor
of Maker Studios, for $33 million plus as much as $117 million
in incentives last year. The online outlets could help media
companies build awareness for films and TV shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Short-form online video is growing at an astonishing pace
and with Maker Studios, Disney will now be at the center of this
dynamic industry with an unmatched combination of advanced
technology and programming expertise and capabilities,&#8221;&#160;Robert A. Iger, Disney&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, said in
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than 55,000 channels, 380 million subscribers and
5.5 billion views a month on Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube, Culver City,
California-based Maker has established itself as one of the top
online video networks for young audiences, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buying Again &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a lot of good happening in digital video
networks,&#8221; Mike Vorhaus, a technology consultant at Magid
Advisors, said in an interview. &#8220;There are a ton of eyeballs
and the content isn&#8217;t expensive to produce. There just hasn&#8217;t
been a lot of meaningful profit yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition is one of the biggest for Disney, the
world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, since the $4 billion
purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012. In the online space, Maker
could potentially exceed the $563.2 million Disney spent in 2010
on mobile game maker Playdom. Disney paid $350 million in 2007
for Club Penguin online world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose 0.4 percent to $79.84 in extended trading at
7:53 p.m. New York time after the deal was announced. The stock
fell 1.1 percent to $79.49 at the close and has gained 4 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maker Studios will report to Jay Rasulo, Disney&#8217;s chief
financial officer, according to the statement. The online
company was founded in 2009, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney had $4.4 billion in cash at the end of September,
according to regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) named ABC News
President Ben Sherwood as co-chairman of its media networks,
filling the vacancy created by the planned departure in January
of Anne Sweeney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherwood will begin the transition immediately as co-president of the Disney/ABC Television Group and will continue
to oversee news until a successor is named, the Burbank,
California-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger is
moving quickly to fill a key executive role that oversees the
company&#8217;s largest division. Sherwood, 50, who will work
alongside ESPN President John Skipper as media co-chairman, will
be responsible for the Disney channels, the ABC broadcast
network and the ABC Family cable channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ben is one of those unique executives who combine rich
creative experience with great business acumen,&#8221; Iger said in
the statement. &#8220;He&#8217;s also focused, strategic and competitive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being named ABC News president in December 2010,
Sherwood oversaw &#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; as it surpassed NBC&#8217;s
&#8220;Today&#8221; show in viewers and narrowed the ratings gap between
ABC&#8217;s &#8220;World News&#8221; and NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Nightly News&#8221; in the evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ABC News partnership with Yahoo! Inc. under Sherwood
boosted the news division&#8217;s online exposure and he helped
developed Fusion, a cable-TV channel joint venture with
Univision Communications Inc. that targets English-speaking
Latinos with news and lifestyle programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney&#8217;s Largest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, fell 1.1
percent to $79.49 at the close in New York. The stock has risen
4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media networks division, led by ESPN and the Disney-branded channels, is Disney&#8217;s largest, generating $6.82 billion
in operating income, 64 percent of the company&#8217;s total, in the
most recent fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweeney, 56, announced plans on March 11 to leave Disney
before the contest heats up to replace Iger, who plans to retire
in June 2016. Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and parks
division head Thomas Staggs have been mentioned frequently by
analysts as leading contenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Sweeney&#8217;s direction, the Disney Channel quintupled
its subscriber base. She supervised the introduction of related
channels, including Disney XD, aimed at boys, and Disney Junior,
targeting preschoolers. In 2005, ABC became the first network to
make its shows available at Apple Inc.&#8217;s iTunes store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other broadcast networks, ABC has struggled with
declining viewership of traditional television as consumers turn
to cable TV and Web-based options such as Netflix Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the television season that started in September, ABC is
averaging 7.42 million viewers in prime-time, a decline of 5.1
percent from a year earlier, according to Nielsen data. In the
advertiser-targeted group ages 18 to 49, ABC is in last place,
down 7.9 percent to 2.68 million viewers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior member of India&#8217;s main
opposition party said he&#8217;d run as an independent in next month&#8217;s
election after being passed over for a seat, underscoring leader
Narendra Modi&#8217;s challenge in keeping members unified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaswant Singh, a former BJP finance and foreign affairs
minister, filed to contest as an independent candidate from
Barmer constituency in the western Indian state of Rajasthan.
Singh, 76, was a founding member of the party and represented it
in parliament for more than three decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The BJP has humiliated some of the older, more educated,
and urbane members of the party,&#8221; said Neera Chandhoke, a
retired professor of politics at Delhi University. &#8220;What you
are left with is a more hardcore Hindu party that may turn up
some voters, particularly outside of northern India.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh&#8217;s departure exposes a generational divide within the
BJP that threatens to derail Modi&#8217;s efforts to attract allies to
form a stable government and pass measures to bolster India&#8217;s
economy. Opinion polls show the party winning the most seats
while falling short of a majority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BJP on March 21 fielded Sonaram Choudhary, who recently
defected from the ruling Congress party, as its candidate from
Barmer. Singh then urged party workers to differentiate between
the &#8220;real BJP&#8221; and &#8220;fake BJP.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They decided to go for somebody who jumped the styles and
walked into the party,&#8221; Singh, who had helped draft the BJP&#8217;s
election manifesto, said yesterday. &#8220;I feel greatly aggrieved
and that has forced me to take the step that I did.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Pained&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sushma Swaraj, the party&#8217;s most senior leader in the lower
house of parliament, said she was &#8220;pained&#8221; at the decision to
deny Singh a ticket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would have been better if this situation had not
arisen and he didn&#8217;t go to that extent,&#8221; Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, a
BJP spokesman, said in New Delhi yesterday. &#8220;If he goes, the
party cannot do anything.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BJP is on course to win 195 of 543 seats up for grabs
in the lower house of parliament, according to an opinion poll
released March 14 by NDTV Television channel and Hansa Research.
The ruling Congress party, in power for a decade, may get 106
seats, its worst-ever performance, the poll indicated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have been disrespectful and dishonorable to the
principles of the party,&#8221; Singh said at a rally in Barmer
yesterday. &#8220;The manner in which the decision was taken reeks of
plain dictatorship.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BJP Veterans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other BJP veterans have also expressed displeasure during
the process to select candidates for the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Lal Krishna Advani, a former home
minister and deputy prime minister, expressed anger after the
party slotted him to run in Modi&#8217;s state of Gujarat against his
wishes. Advani, who led the campaign of BJP in 2004 and 2009
elections, said on March 20 he was &#8220;deeply touched&#8221; when the
party said he could contest wherever he wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murli Manohar Joshi, a former BJP president, was also
unhappy that he had to give up his seat in Varanasi for Modi,
who wanted to contest from one of Hinduism&#8217;s holiest cities, the
Indian Express reported, citing unidentified sources. Joshi will
contest from Kanpur, another seat in Uttar Pradesh, the
country&#8217;s most populous state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), working to complete the
sale of its mobile-phone division to Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), said the
5.44 billion-euro ($7.5 billion) transaction will be delayed
until next month as Asian regulators review it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is buying the
business and licensing some patents to challenge Apple Inc. and
Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)&#8217;s dominance of the smartphone market.
Espoo, Finland-based Nokia is selling the unprofitable unit to
try to stem losses by focusing on wireless-network equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies had previously projected a completion by the
end of March. The transaction is pending approvals from
&#8220;certain antitrust authorities in Asia,&#8221; and the companies
remain committed to the deal, Nokia said today. In a blog
posting, Microsoft said the regulatory approval process is
nearing the final stages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rival mobile-phone makers including Huawei Technologies Co.
and Samsung have expressed concern to China that the deal may
result in higher patent licensing fees, government officials
familiar with the matter said this month. China&#8217;s Ministry of
Commerce is conducting an anti-monopoly review and is likely to
approve the deal, the officials said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fang Fang, JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co.&#8217;s
chief executive officer of investment banking for China, is
leaving after more than 12 years at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 48-year-old banker told New York-based JPMorgan that he
wanted to retire, according to an internal memo obtained by
Bloomberg News today. Frank Gong was named chairman of China
investment banking in the message from Therese Esperdy, co-head
of Asia-Pacific banking at the firm. Marie Cheung, a spokeswoman
in Hong Kong, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fang&#8217;s impending departure comes amid an investigation into
JPMorgan&#8217;s Asian hiring practices. U.S. authorities are
examining whether the firm employed people in Asia so that their
relatives in government would steer business to the bank, people
with knowledge of the probes have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fang joined JPMorgan in August 2001 and was a former vice
president of Beijing Enterprises Holdings Ltd., an investment
company controlled by the government of China&#8217;s capital. He
became head of JPMorgan&#8217;s China investment-banking business in
2007 and was made vice chairman for Asia investment banking in
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banker submitted his resignation last week as he wants
to spend more time with his family, a person with knowledge of
the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is protesting Saudi
Arabia&#8217;s denial of a visa to a Jerusalem Post journalist who
wants to cover President Barack Obama&#8217;s visit there this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A journalist&#8217;s employer shouldn&#8217;t &#8220;count against their
ability to do their job,&#8221; Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said at a briefing today. He said the U.S. reached out
through &#8220;multiple channels&#8221; to protest the denial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Wilner, White House correspondent for the Jerusalem
Post, was the only member of the White House press corps
traveling with Obama this week to be denied a visa by Saudi
Arabia, the White House Correspondents Association said today in
an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilner planned to cover only the Saudi Arabia part of
Obama&#8217;s six-day trip, which also includes stops in the
Netherlands, Belgium and the Vatican, the group said. In Saudi
Arabia, Obama plans to discuss Syria, Iran and the Mideast peace
talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The denial is an affront not only to this journalist, but
to the entire White House press corps and to the principle of
freedom of the press that we hold so dear,&#8221; Steve Thomma, the
group&#8217;s president, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilner is a U.S. citizen and is Jewish, according to an

&lt;p&gt;When former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
executive Mike Cavanagh arrives at Carlyle Group LP (CG) this summer,
he&#8217;ll be asked to expand a firm that&#8217;s fallen behind rivals even
as it delivers some of the best returns in private equity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle, the second-largest manager of alternative
investments such as private-equity funds and real estate, has
increased its assets at a 13 percent annual rate in the past two
years, the slowest pace among peers, according to calculations
by Bloomberg. Blackstone Group LP (BX), the largest private-equity
manager, expanded at a 26 percent pace, the same as KKR  Co.
and Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) grew at a 46 percent rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh, 48, until today co-chief of investment banking at
JPMorgan and a close deputy to Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, will need to find ways to further diversify Carlyle from
private equity and expand assets. He will share a co-president
role with Glenn Youngkin, a 19-year veteran of the firm,
Washington-based Carlyle said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youngkin, 47, who became chief operating officer in 2011,
has spent the past three years deciding which businesses Carlyle
should enter and which it shouldn&#8217;t, a role Cavanagh will share
as the firm&#8217;s founders seek ways to give more daily
responsibilities to deputies. The move puts two executives in
their late-40s in charge of running the buyout firm underneath
its three billionaire founders, Bill Conway, Dan D&#8217;Aniello and
David Rubenstein, who are in their mid-60s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fresh Perspectives&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh &#8220;will help ensure that Carlyle continues to
innovate and grow for another quarter-century,&#8221; Conway and
Rubenstein, the firm&#8217;s co-CEOs, said in the statement. The
executives, who started Carlyle in 1987 with D&#8217;Aniello, expect
Cavanagh&#8217;s hire to &#8220;enable fresh perspectives in an environment
that embraces change.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle fell 1 percent to close at $31.35 in New York as
JPMorgan declined 0.2 percent to $60.93. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle&#8217;s stock has trailed rivals, gaining 2.1 percent in
the past 12 months, compared with 67 percent at Blackstone, 42
percent at Apollo and 24 percent at KKR. Blackstone, Apollo and
KKR are all based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adena Friedman, Carlyle&#8217;s chief financial officer, said on
a February call with investors that expenses have increased as
the firm hires for fundraising and makes strategic purchases to
boost revenue. Carlyle last year agreed to acquire Diversified
Global Asset Management Co. to broaden its hedge-fund offerings,
bought Metropolitan Real Estate Equity Management LLC as a
property fund-of-funds operation, and added the remaining 40
percent of Dutch investment manager AlpInvest Partners NV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High Expenses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We should expect the fact that our expenses will grow,&#8221;
Friedman said on the Feb. 19 call. &#8220;But so should our revenues.
When we make investments in new initiatives and new funds, we do
try to make sure that we do it properly, but it should result in
revenue growth for us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with recent acquisitions, Carlyle relies more on
leveraged buyout profits, which are produced in lumpy intervals,
and less on predictable management fees than its peers,
according to Morgan Stanley analyst Matt Kelley in New York.
Public investors put a higher value on stable fees, which can
keep analysts and investors &#8220;on the sidelines,&#8221; he said in a
January note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Carlyle plans to start three new investment
strategies a year on average, Youngkin said in November at the
firm&#8217;s first investor day. Rapid expansion is &#8220;part of the
game&#8221; that Blackstone, Apollo and KKR are also engaged in, said
Youngkin, who until now has largely overseen the rollout of new
business lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Great Hire&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh and Carlyle began talks over a potential role in
the second half of last year, according to a person familiar
with the discussions, who requested anonymity to discuss private
plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a great hire for Carlyle,&#8221; Chris Kotowski, an
analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York, said of Cavanagh&#8217;s
move in a telephone interview. &#8220;He&#8217;s an incredibly competent
and versatile manager.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Ullman, a Carlyle spokesman, declined to comment on
Cavanagh&#8217;s role beyond the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle said Cavanagh will be a member of its executive
group, currently a six-person committee that makes strategic
decisions for the firm. He joins the three founders, Youngkin,
Friedman and Jeff Ferguson, the company&#8217;s general counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle earlier this month hired former General Motors Co.
CEO Dan Akerson as vice chairman of the board, under Chairman
D&#8217;Aniello. Akerson was head of global buyouts and co-head of
U.S. buyouts at the firm before joining GM in 2009 after its
rescue by the U.S. government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lee, Chappuis &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Carlyle looked outside the firm for a deputy
chief investment officer under Conway, hiring Kewsong Lee from
private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC. Lee had been at New
York-based Warburg Pincus for 21 years and was instrumental in
dozens of deals, including the buyout of Neiman Marcus Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the year, Jacques Chappuis left Morgan Stanley
to run Carlyle&#8217;s funds-of-funds business. Chappuis was hired to
expand the solutions group in the same way Mitch Petrick, who
joined the firm from Morgan Stanley in 2010, was asked to build
Carlyle&#8217;s Global Markets Strategies unit, which manages more
than $35 billion in hedge-fund and structured-credit
investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 31, the buyout firm had invested in more than
470 corporate transactions, returned an average of 30 percent
annually to investors, and oversaw almost $189 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is the biggest broker on the upstart U.S. stock platform created by IEX Group Inc., according to a memo IEX sent some clients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said last week that markets would be well-served if the five-month-old venue achieved &#8220;critical mass.&#8221; The dark pool, which has ambitions to become an exchange, was built with defenses against the fastest traders. Yesterday, in a memo obtained by Bloomberg News, IEX said Goldman Sachs has more than double the volume of the No. 2 broker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit surprising to see a major broker be such an active and vocal supporter of IEX early on,&#8221; Justin Schack, partner and managing director for market structure analysis at Rosenblatt Securities Inc., said in a phone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s an important vote of confidence in IEX.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gerald Lam, a spokesman for New York-based IEX, declined to comment on the memo or the endorsement from Goldman Sachs. Tiffany Galvin, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, said the New York-based firm has no comment beyond last week&#8217;s memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has played kingmaker before in the exchange industry. It was an early investor in IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. and was among the firm&#8217;s largest shareholders when it went public in 2005. Atlanta-based ICE, which now owns the New York Stock Exchange, has grown to become the world&#8217;s second-biggest bourse owner by market value at $23 billion. Goldman Sachs was also a shareholder of Direct Edge Holdings LLC, which merged this year with Bats Global Markets Inc. to form an exchange operator with about 20 percent of American volume. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Mike Cavanagh, who served as a close deputy to Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon for more than two decades, will leave to become co-chief operating officer of Carlyle Group LP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cavanagh, 48, was seen internally as a potential successor to Dimon, 58, who has told people he wants to remain CEO for another five years, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing personnel. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Top bankers and traders have left the biggest Wall Street firms for more lucrative jobs in private equity and at hedge funds, as regulation of lenders has intensified following the financial crisis and lower returns have pushed banks to cut the amount of revenue they set aside for compensation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The regulatory landscape definitely makes it less enticing for some of these great managers to stay at the big banks, and the talent drain will continue,&#8221; said Glenn Schorr, an analyst at New York-based International Strategy  Investment Group LLC. &#8220;It&#8217;s a significant loss for JPMorgan and a huge win for Carlyle, no two ways about it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Uncertainty about when the CEO job would become available also may have contributed to Cavanagh&#8217;s decision, Matt Burnell, a Wells Fargo  Co. analyst, wrote in a note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) agreed to buy Maker
Studios, a supplier of online video content to YouTube, for at
least $500 million, gaining technology and experience with
short-form entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney also agreed to pay as much as $450 million more if
Maker Studios meets &#8220;strong&#8221; performance targets, according to
a statement yesterday by the Burbank, California-based company.
That could boost the total to $950 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Maker Studios, Disney is following DreamWorks
Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) into an online video business with expanding
audiences and little profit. DreamWorks Animation, producer of
the &#8220;Shrek&#8221; movies, bought AwesomenessTV, a smaller competitor
of Maker Studios, for $33 million plus as much as $117 million
in incentives last year. The online outlets could help media
companies build awareness for films and TV shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Short-form online video is growing at an astonishing pace
and with Maker Studios, Disney will now be at the center of this
dynamic industry with an unmatched combination of advanced
technology and programming expertise and capabilities,&#8221;&#160;Robert Iger, Disney&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than 55,000 channels, 380 million subscribers and
5.5 billion views a month on Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube, Culver City,
California-based Maker has established itself as one of the top
online-video networks for young audiences, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online Space &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a lot of good happening in digital video
networks,&#8221; Mike Vorhaus, a technology consultant at Magid
Advisors, said in an interview. &#8220;There are a ton of eyeballs
and the content isn&#8217;t expensive to produce. There just hasn&#8217;t
been a lot of meaningful profit yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition is one of the biggest for Disney, the
world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, since the $4 billion
purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012. In the online space, Maker
could potentially exceed the $563.2 million Disney spent in 2010
on mobile game maker Playdom. Disney paid $350 million in 2007
for the kids&#8217; social network Club Penguin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose 0.4 percent to $79.84 in extended trading after
the deal was announced yesterday. The stock fell 1.1 percent to
$79.49 at the close in New York and has gained 4 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maker Studios will report to Jay Rasulo, Disney&#8217;s chief
financial officer, according to the statement. The online
company was founded in 2009, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney had $4.4 billion in cash at the end of September,
according to regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), Mexico&#8217;s
biggest broadcaster, rose to the highest since at least 1994 on
speculation proposed regulations will hinder America Movil SAB&#8217;s
television expansion plans for at least two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa shares rose 2.8 percent to 85.33 pesos at 11:16
a.m. in Mexico City, making it the best performer on Mexico&#8217;s
benchmark IPC index. Analysts expect Televisa, which draws
almost 70 percent of broadcast viewers, to benefit from rules
that would require America Movil&#8217;s Telmex subsidiary to wait at
least two years before applying for pay television licenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If America Movil enters that sector it will be very
competitive,&#8221; Valeria Romo, an analyst with Banco Monex SA,
said in a phone interview from Mexico City. &#8220;In the short term,
Televisa can propel growth in television.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil, controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim, has
fallen 5.2 percent since President Enrique Pena Nieto announced
the proposal March 24, the biggest two-day decline since August.
Mexico City-based Televisa rose 3.8 percent in that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed restrictions on America Movil stem from the
government&#8217;s efforts to clamp down on its dominance in the
telecommunications industry, where it services 70 percent of
Mexico&#8217;s mobile-phone users and 80 percent of fixed lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restriction on America Movil &#8220;opens Televisa up to
participate in other sectors of telecommunications&#8221; as it
maintains its TV strategy, Romo said. &#8220;The regulation in media
is less aggressive than in telecommunications.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is negotiating to bring OAO Rosneft (ROSN) into oil and gas licenses in Iraq&#8217;s Kurdistan region, people familiar with the talks said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The talks show the largest U.S. and Russian oil companies forging ahead with a global alliance even as relations between the two governments stand at their lowest ebb since the end of the Cold War. Rosneft is considering the proposal and a deal isn&#8217;t guaranteed, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are confidential. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon and Rosneft are working on ventures to explore the Arctic Ocean, test the potential of shale oil in Russia and pump crude in Texas. So far, sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European Union in response to President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s decision to annex Crimea haven&#8217;t had an impact on the work of international oil companies in Russia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kurdistan, an autonomous region in northern Iraq, is ramping up oil production and trying to resolve a dispute with the government in Baghdad over pipeline exports. Exxon reduced its stake in one of the biggest oilfields in southern Iraq after moving into Kurdistan, where the power to award exploration licenses has been the subject of dispute between the central and regional administrations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rosneft shares rose 0.5 percent to close at 232.6 rubles in Moscow after earlier gaining as much as 2.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon signed six production-sharing contracts covering more than 848,000 acres in Kurdistan in October 2011, according to the Irving, Texas-based company&#8217;s 2013 annual report on its website. Exxon began a seismic survey on four of six blocks in 2013 and has begun drilling one well, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sakhalin Island &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon is an important and large partner of Rosneft&#8217;s in a wide range of projects,&#8221; Alexander Kornilov, an oil an gas analyst at Alfa Bank said by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An Exxon-operated venture with Rosneft at Sakhalin Island plans to begin pumping oil from the Arkutun-Dagi project off Russia&#8217;s Pacific coast this year, Senior Vice President Mark Albers said on Mar. 5. The companies additionally plan a well in the remote and prospective Russia&#8217;s Kara Sea this August. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rosneft&#8217;s press service and an Exxon representative in Moscow declined to comment as did an official at the Kurdistan Regional Government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Stephen Bierman in Moscow at sbierman1@bloomberg.net; Brian Swint in London at bswint@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Will Kennedy at wkennedy3@bloomberg.net Amanda Jordan &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peregrine Financial Group Inc.&#8217;s
trustee agreed to settle a dispute with JPMorgan Chase  Co. in
a deal that will bring more than $15 million to creditors of the
commodities firm, which filed for bankruptcy after its founder
looted client accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Chicago, JPMorgan will pay $1.25 million and release
$14 million in cash it&#8217;s holding as collateral for its claim
against Peregrine. JPMorgan also agreed to reduce the size of
that claim, the trustee, Ira Bodenstein, said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal &#8220;secures a favorable compromise that
substantially reduces the estate&#8217;s costs and downside risk with
respect to the JPMorgan claims,&#8221; according to Bodenstein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peregrine, a Cedar Falls, Iowa-based commodities firm with
offices in Chicago, filed for bankruptcy to liquidate in 2012
after the National Futures Association said more than $200
million in customer funds were missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s founder, Russell Wasendorf Sr., now serving a
50-year prison sentence for fraud and embezzlement, stole mostly
from customers who traded on U.S. exchanges, the trustee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of customers that had sued Wasendorf and JPMorgan
for $200 million also agreed to be part of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the bankruptcy was filed, New York-based JPMorgan
claimed Peregrine owed it $2.2 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
comment on the trustee&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Peregrine Financial Group Inc., 12-bk-27488, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said he will &#8220;hold nothing back&#8221; to get the company&#8217;s programs across all devices, in a clear departure from the software maker&#8217;s longtime focus on its Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At his first public speech since taking the CEO job last month, Nadella unveiled Office software for Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad, the first time Microsoft is putting the popular productivity programs onto the tablet. Nadella also said the company&#8217;s goal is to get its Internet-based Office 365 service on any gadget, even if it reduces sales of Windows-based personal computers or other products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not a tradeoff, because it&#8217;s about going where customers are going,&#8221; Nadella said after the company event in San Francisco. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about today&#8217;s share position based on today&#8217;s form factors, because in the full arc of time there will be many new platforms that will require Office, from small screens to large screens.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella is presiding over Microsoft&#8217;s shift to a more open approach. While former CEO Steve Ballmer kept more of a focus on Windows, including pushing the operating system onto smartphones, Nadella is indicating that he proactively wants to get Microsoft software onto Apple&#8217;s iOS and Google Inc.&#8217;s Android-based gadgets. Since Apple and Android devices dominate in mobile, Microsoft risks having its software locked out if it can&#8217;t sell its programs for those platforms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New Sheriff &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a new sheriff in town,&#8221; Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co., wrote in a note about Nadella&#8217;s presentation. &#8220;We believe the Office for iPad was a major positive step in the right direction and signals a strategic change at Microsoft.&#8221; Ives has the equivalent of a hold on the stock. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 1 percent to $39.36 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Office for iPad, which now includes Word, PowerPoint and Excel, also heralds a new business model for the software, which has been a paid product. Now users will be able to view their Office documents for free on their iPad, though to edit or create documents they will need to pay $99 a year for a subscription to Office 365. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, Microsoft released paid versions of Office apps for the iPhone, which required a subscription to Office 365. That product cost $99.99 a year for a home version that works on five devices and $69.99 for a version that works for just one computer and one tablet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re excited that Office is coming to iPad &#8212; now part of the more than 500,000 apps designed specifically for iPad,&#8221; said Trudy Muller, a spokeswoman for Apple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mobile, Cloud &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On his first day as CEO, Nadella emphasized the Redmond, Washington-based company&#8217;s focus on devices and Web-based cloud services and said those priorities would &#8220;define Microsoft going forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the event today, Nadella reiterated that the intersection of mobile and cloud is the &#8220;most critical,&#8221; though he added that it was just &#8220;one aspect of our overall strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also rolled out technology to enable developers to create what he called a &#8220;cloud for everyone on every device.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella said Windows remains &#8220;a massive agenda for us&#8221; and the company plans to innovate with the operating system. The CEO said Microsoft will unveil more of its strategy as soon as next week at its Build developer conference in San Francisco, where Windows will be front and center. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bigger Opportunity &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft is in the process of migrating the lion&#8217;s share of its business to the cloud and subscription,&#8221; Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., wrote in a note to clients last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The iPad version of Office, a suite of software that includes Microsoft&#8217;s Word, Excel, Outlook and other programs, may add $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion in consumer Office subscription revenue a year, Moerdler said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is taking a risk by asking people to pay $99 a year to edit, rather than just look at, their documents, said Milind Gadekar, CEO of CloudOn Inc., which makes a free mobile application that lets users access and edit their Office documents on mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consumers expect editing to be free,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have to find other advanced features to charge for.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Milind said that while Microsoft is becoming more open, its new strategy still requires Office 365 users to use its OneDrive online storage system, rather than popular alternatives such as Dropbox, Box.net and Evernote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Productivity Programs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, consumers are spending more than twice as much time using mobile productivity apps than they did a year ago, according to research measuring usage between January and March by Flurry, a mobile analytics firm which tracked usage on both phones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s announcement of Office for iPad couldn&#8217;t be more timely,&#8221; the company said in a blog post. &#8220;In fact, it can define Microsoft and its newly appointed CEO&#8217;s tenure in the post-PC world.&#8221; The study included phones and tablets with both iOS and Android. &#8220;This growth rate eclipsed all other categories including Messaging, Games and News.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Asked if selling Office on other devices would cause big changes in sales of Windows-based PCs, phones and tablets, Nadella said at the event, &#8220;I would leave it to Wall Street to do the analysis, but we are going after huge opportunities that are ahead of us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net; Peter Burrows in San Francisco at pburrows@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net Reed Stevenson &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors&#8217; confidence in companies
making acquisitions is emboldening management to execute deals,
spurring a mergers and acquisitions boom, according to Michael Carr, co-head of Americas MA at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders have been embracing the acquiring companies,
Carr said today at the 26th annual Tulane University Corporate
Law Institute in New Orleans, signaling faith in the lasting
value of transactions as well as challenging the conventional
wisdom that they should brace for a selloff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public U.S. companies worth more than $1 billion have risen
an average of 5.2 percent in 2014 the day after announcing they
are acquiring a target, a reversal from the 1.9 percent one-day
decline buyers experienced five years ago, according to data
from Goldman Sachs. Almost 75 percent of acquiring companies
have gone up following deal announcements in the fourth quarter
of 2013 and the first quarter this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is all about shareholder sentiment,&#8221; Carr said.
&#8220;Shareholders are accepting the companies&#8217; view of synergies
and cost savings, and they&#8217;re giving a lot more credit than they
did.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been more than 6,500 deals announced globally in
the year to date, valued at almost $650 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the most volume in the first
three months of the year since the first quarter of 2007, when
volume reached $960 billion, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first-quarter volume reflects a 28 percent jump from
the year-earlier quarter, and a 12 percent increase from the
fourth quarter of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strategic Shift &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More companies are shifting toward strategic MA in 2014
and away from financial engineering, such as share buybacks,
Carr said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp.&#8217;s $45.2 billion agreement to buy Time Warner
Cable Inc. was the largest announced in the first three months
of the year, topping a failed hostile bid from Charter
Communications Inc. Actavis Plc&#8217;s $21 billion offer for
drugmaker Forest Laboratories Inc. and Facebook Inc.&#8217;s $19
billion takeover of mobile messaging service WhatsApp Inc.
followed the cable combination to round out the quarter&#8217;s top
three acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&#8217;s deals have been motivated by &#8220;expansion of
market presence and consolidation,&#8221; rather than many of 2013&#8217;s
biggest takeovers, which were &#8220;clean-up trades,&#8221; Carr said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp.&#8217;s buyout of the remainder of NBCUniversal
from General Electric Co., and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)&#8217;s
acquisition of Verizon Wireless from Vodafone Group Plc were two
2013 deals driven by financial concerns and cheap debt, rather
than &#8220;building influence in their particular industries,&#8221; Carr
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The character of the market feels different than a good
part of 2013.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shareholder Sentiment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index has gained more than
65 percent since September 2011, earnings growth has risen just
14 percent in the same time period, indicating the market is
expecting profits to rise from deals, he said. This supports
deal advisers, who must count on shareholder sentiment to propel
future acquisitions, Carr said. It&#8217;s &#8220;very, very hard for MA
activity to pick up&#8221; without that optimism, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast&#8217;s Time Warner Cable acquisition, the largest U.S.
cable deal since Comcast&#8217;s $72 billion merger with ATT
Broadband in 2001, helped propel Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. to the top rankings for fees for the quarter, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley advised Time Warner Cable and JPMorgan
advised Comcast, according to the press release announcing that
deal. Bankers earned about $143 million on that merger, the
third-largest payday for any deal since 2009, according to New
York-based research firm Freeman  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley has advised on 58 deals this year, valued at
more than $215 billion, followed by JPMorgan&#8217;s $162 billion for
59, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs landed in third place for advising on
$132 billion of deals, it worked on more transactions than
either bank, at 77. Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc rounded out
the top five. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and Suzuki Motor
Corp. (7269) are among companies pushing demand for transportation of
machinery to Myanmar to bottle drinks and make trucks, after the
country&#8217;s five decades of isolation during military rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, which opened a bottling plant in Myanmar last
year, plans to invest $200 million over five years while Suzuki
restarted production of trucks last year after leaving the
market in 2010. Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. (2502), Japan&#8217;s biggest
beermaker, said this month it&#8217;s forming a venture to start
operations there this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because much of the machinery is too big to fit in regular
containers, Japan&#8217;s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. and other shippers
are increasingly using vessels that can handle oversized cargo.
The Southeast Asian nation, formerly known as Burma, is
importing basic materials to improve infrastructure after the
U.S., Europe and Japan eased sanctions following elections in
2012 in which the country&#8217;s leading dissident, Aung San Suu Kyi,
a political prisoner for 15 years, was elected to parliament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will take time for Myanmar to be a big manufacturing
country,&#8221; said Masayuki Kubota, chief strategist at Rakuten
Securities Economic Research Institute. &#8220;They&#8217;re buying
machinery now as part of the process to become a big
manufacturing country. It needs a huge amount of investment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Vladimir Putin said
Russia must develop its own payments network, with companies
that blocked some transactions following U.S. sanctions on
Russian individuals and a bank at risk of losing market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This wasn&#8217;t our decision,&#8221; Putin said at a meeting with
lawmakers outside Moscow today, adding that developing a
domestic system will take time. &#8220;We need to defend our
interests. And we&#8217;ll do that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) stopped processing cards for
Bank Rossiya after the U.S. placed the lender on its sanctions
list. SMP Bank, which also had its cards blocked by the two
biggest card networks, said March 23 that services would resume
soon. SMP Bank&#8217;s co-owners Arkady Rotenberg and brother Boris
were also hit with sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sanctions prohibit U.S. firms or individuals from doing
business with Bank Rossiya, the U.S. Treasury said on its
website on March 20. Russia&#8217;s 17th biggest lender has about $10
billion in assets, &#8220;numerous relationships&#8221; with banks in the
U.S. and Europe, and was targeted because its owners are close
associates of President Vladimir Putin, the Treasury said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putin last week said he would open his personal account in
the bank targeted by the U.S. and have his salary payments
transfered there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early this month, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) stopped managing an investment account for a prominent client: the charitable foundation of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, one of the U.S.&#8217;s largest fraternities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank was concerned about SAE&#8217;s bad publicity, according to Anthony Alberico, a JPMorgan vice president who dealt with the foundation. SAE has had 10 deaths linked to drinking, drugs and hazing since 2006, more than any other fraternity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If JPMorgan is going to turn us down, who&#8217;s next?&#8221; said Bradley Cohen, SAE&#8217;s national president. &#8220;What if universities start saying SAE&#8217;s not welcome?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More from the Broken Pledges series:&lt;/p&gt;
Fraternity Grapples With &#8216;Historic&#8217; Pledging Ban
U.S. Fraternity Abolishes Pledging for New Members
Frat&#8217;s Icy &#8216;Torture&#8217; of Pledges Evokes Tarantino Films
&lt;p&gt;The snub by the largest U.S. bank validated a startling decision that Cohen, seeking to protect future members, had already reached. On March 7, the same day JPMorgan formally cut ties with the fraternity, the 51-year-old Cohen announced an end to one of SAE&#8217;s defining traditions: pledging, the months-long initiation where recruits sometimes fall prey to brutal hazing. The move catapulted Cohen into national prominence and drew criticism from alumni such as Texas oilman-turned-investor T. Boone Pickens. SAE became one of only a handful of 75 national fraternities to eliminate pledging. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;How much longer can we sustain these losses -- loss of life, loss of credibility to those who join and drop out because they were lied to, loss of valuable resources and loss of our reputation as leaders and as true gentlemen,&#8221; Cohen told SAE brothers this month at the University of La Verne in California during his first public address since the announcement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Secret Handshake &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen, who took office only nine months ago, faced intense pressure to change the culture of SAE, according to him and other top fraternity officials. Besides JPMorgan, Lloyd&#8217;s of London was threatening to cancel SAE&#8217;s insurance coverage because of injuries, deaths and lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Family considerations also motivated Cohen. He wanted to protect his older son, Devon, a high school freshman who is determined to join SAE in college. Devon wears bow ties in purple and gold -- SAE&#8217;s colors -- and knows its secret handshake. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t want him to be scarred mentally from hazing,&#8221; said Brad Cohen, relaxing with his family in their home near Los Angeles. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want him to want to join SAE so badly that he&#8217;ll do anything he&#8217;s told.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Backlash Stirred &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen&#8217;s pledging ban has stirred a backlash from some student and alumni members of SAE, which was founded at the University of Alabama in 1856 and has more than 240 chapters and 14,000 college members. Cohen, who must step down at the end of his term next year, took the chance that traditionalists could unseat his allies on the board at the fraternity&#8217;s next convention in 2015, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Renowned as a Wall Street pipeline, SAE boasts prominent alumni such as hedge fund managers David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital and Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corp. Pickens, whom Cohen consulted before announcing the pledging ban, said through a spokesman that he has reservations about it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Pickens believes pledgeship is a key part of fraternity life and helps those who go through it gain an appreciation for the rich history tied to each fraternity,&#8221; spokesman Jay Rosser said in an e-mail. Pickens supports a &#8220;greater focus&#8221; on alcohol and drug awareness, Rosser said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Either way, he appreciates the tough choice Brad Cohen has made,&#8221; Rosser said. &#8220;Time will tell if it was a good one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SAE chapters will still extend recruits a &#8220;bid,&#8221; or invitation to join. But students who accept will become full members almost immediately. They will be required to complete additional training, including alcohol education. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Insta-Bros.&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Angry student members are deriding those inducted immediately into the order as &#8220;insta-bros.&#8221; They also question whether the SAE board has authority under its bylaws, as Cohen maintains, to impose the ban on local chapters. Their posts warning that brotherly bonds will fade or pledging will go underground pack a Facebook page called &#8220;SAE Cause for Change.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Doing away with the pledge program is like giving all the kids on a youth soccer team trophies at the end of the season for doing &#8216;a good job,&#8217;&#8221; one critic wrote. &#8220;People need to face adversity in order to feel accomplished.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;E-mails and phone messages praising Cohen&#8217;s move poured in from administrators, fraternity members and families affected by hazing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Brave Leader&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We feel like he&#8217;s a strong, brave leader for taking this organization forward,&#8221; said Scott Starkey, who called Cohen to applaud the decision. Starkey&#8217;s son, Carson, died of alcohol poisoning in 2008 as a freshman during an SAE hazing at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The son of an Olympic athlete, the 6-foot-1-inch Cohen has a square jaw and a commanding presence. Owner and chief executive officer of a real estate company based in Newport Beach, California, he has spent almost 30 years in volunteer leadership roles at SAE. His brother and nephew belong to the order, and his father was an honorary member. Cohen counts his induction into SAE among the most meaningful ceremonies of his life, along with his wedding and the naming of his three children. SAE awards cover the walls in his study. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He tries to live by SAE&#8217;s &#8220;perfect&#8221; creed, the &#8220;True Gentleman,&#8221; which all members must memorize, he said. It is a kind of golden rule of fraternity life, which begins: &#8220;The true gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety, and whose self-control is equal to all emergencies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Unusual Background &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In many ways, Cohen has an unusual background for an SAE leader. He&#8217;s the first Jewish president of SAE, which used to limit membership to &#8220;members of the Caucasian race&#8221; without a parent who was a &#8220;full-blooded Jew,&#8221; according to a 1903 book of rituals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holding the black volume aloft, Cohen read that passage to his audience at the University of La Verne. When SAE renounced racism and anti-Semitism in 1952, he reminded the crowd, it faced the same complaints that change would ruin the fraternity that traditionalists now make about the pledging ban. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Type 1 diabetic diagnosed at age 11, Cohen abhors forced drinking, which is often part of fraternity hazing. He worries that alcohol consumption, which can wreak havoc on a diabetic&#8217;s blood-sugar levels, endangers students with all kinds of health issues. Cohen, who wears an insulin pump, serves on the executive board of the University of California at Irvine diabetes research center. His son, Devon, also has the disease and held a diabetes fundraiser for his bar mitzvah in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;South Africa &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen is also SAE&#8217;s first foreign-born leader, and speaks in the lilting accent of his native South Africa. His late father, Desmond Vernon Cohen, was an obstetrician-gynecologist, as well as a swimmer and water polo player on two South African Olympic teams. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fearing racial strife over the government&#8217;s apartheid policy, the family left South Africa in the late 1970s when Cohen was 16. When he announced the pledging ban, Cohen compared the treatment of new members as &#8220;second-class citizens&#8221; to the abuse of blacks under apartheid. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Feeling lost and alone as a foreign student at the University of Arizona, Cohen helped alumni reopen the SAE chapter there. It had been shut down years before for hazing, including branding pledges on their buttocks with &#8220;Phi Alpha,&#8221; the SAE salutation and motto, Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Leopard Print &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Cohen&#8217;s pledging didn&#8217;t include physical hazing, he was subjected to practical jokes, such as taking a fake national exam, he said. Once initiated, he made lifelong friends. In his study, he flips through old photos of himself with his fraternity buddies, including one at a party where he is dressed as a Zulu warrior, in a scanty leopard-print outfit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After graduating from Arizona with a bachelor&#8217;s in psychology and business administration in 1985, Cohen worked for two years at SAE&#8217;s headquarters in Evanston, Illinois. As director of expansion, he helped establish more than 20 new chapters, including one at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen moved to Southern California in 1988. After a stint at Xerox Corp. (XRX), he started working in the title insurance business. In 2009, he opened his own company, Granite Escrow Services Inc., which has annual revenue of more than $10 million, almost 100 employees and seven offices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hazing Tragedies &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;By then, Cohen had joined the Supreme Council, SAE&#8217;s governing board. He was also increasingly dismayed by hazing-related tragedies, including Starkey&#8217;s death after downing beer, rum and 151-proof liquor in an initiation ritual. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His wife, Kim, a former singer and actress who is also from South Africa, shared his concerns. Devon and their younger son, Zachary, wouldn&#8217;t have been allowed to join certain SAE chapters before pledging was eliminated, she said. &#8220;As a mother, I would have been scared to put them in an environment like that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Cohen rose through SAE&#8217;s ranks, he pushed for a more comprehensive safety program, called &#8220;Minerva&#8217;s Shield,&#8221; which includes rules about alcohol and sexual consent, as well as a prohibition on hazing. It was adopted in 2004. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, universities have disciplined more than 100 SAE chapters since 2007, some repeatedly, according to a list published on the organization&#8217;s website as a result of a legal settlement. Colleges suspended or closed at least 15 SAE chapters in the past three years. In 2011, a sophomore pre-medical student at Cornell University died from alcohol poisoning after being blindfolded by SAE pledges in an initiation ritual. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Supreme Archon &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last June, when Cohen became president -- or officially, Eminent Supreme Archon -- he signaled his commitment to significant change by backing a proposal to ban alcohol in chapter houses. At the convention in Chicago, it failed to get the two-thirds vote needed to pass. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen settled for a symbolic step. The council told chapters to stop using the word pledge and refer to recruits simply as &#8220;new members.&#8221; The goal was that they would be treated more humanely. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen should have continued to focus his fight on alcohol abuse, said Nicholas Syrett, an associate professor at the University of Northern Colorado and author of a book about the history of fraternities. Ending pledging &#8220;doesn&#8217;t seem like it will change anything about the binge drinking at parties that doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with pledging,&#8221; Syrett said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Insurance Risk &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As deaths and injuries mounted, Lloyd&#8217;s of London became increasingly concerned about the risk of insuring SAE. It threatened to drop coverage because the fraternity poses too great a risk, according to Gregory Brandt, a state judge in Iowa, and Steven Churchill, executive director of the American Medical Association, both SAE council members. Loss of coverage could shut down SAE, they said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lloyd&#8217;s warning was a turning point that &#8220;changed the way&#8221; SAE officials viewed the fraternity&#8217;s &#8220;future viability,&#8221; Churchill said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Members already pay a base fee of $340 a year for liability coverage, among the highest rates of any fraternity. The SAE national&#8217;s deductible is $1.5 million a year, Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SAE&#8217;s insurance broker, James R. Favor  Co., declined to comment, as did Lisa Hunter, a Lloyd&#8217;s spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Media pressure on SAE also mounted. A December Bloomberg News article, which called SAE the &#8220;deadliest fraternity,&#8221; revealed previously unreported hazing at Salisbury University in Maryland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;German Rock &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;During an eight-week initiation in 2012, SAE brothers at Salisbury forced pledges to drink until they almost passed out and demanded they recite the True Gentleman pledge wearing only their underwear while standing in trash cans filled with ice, Bloomberg reported. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fraternity members confined recruits for as long as nine hours in a dark basement without food, water or a bathroom, while blasting the same German rock song at ear-splitting volume, according to two former pledges and the findings of the university&#8217;s disciplinary board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Bloomberg article, Cohen asked Dwight &#8220;Duke&#8221; Marshall, the volunteer alumni adviser for SAE&#8217;s Salisbury chapter, about what happened in the basement. Marshall said brothers had played the music only to prevent pledges from hearing secret SAE rituals taking place upstairs, according to Cohen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen fired off an e-mail to Marshall and other alumni that likened confining students in the dark, amid deafening German music, to something out of Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Taking Offense &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I take offense to that as a Jew,&#8221; he remembered saying in the e-mail. &#8220;I take offense as a member of SAE.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marshall and others downplayed the seriousness of hazing at Salisbury to the national fraternity, Cohen said. On Feb. 2, SAE suspended the chapter&#8217;s charter and said brothers will lose membership privileges. The university has suspended the chapter through the summer of 2015. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview this week, Marshall said he didn&#8217;t mislead Cohen and found his e-mail offensive. Still, he said he respects Cohen&#8217;s opinion. &#8220;He&#8217;s our leader,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen and the rest of the Supreme Council began considering a pledging ban. At a Jan. 19 meeting in Tucson, Arizona, they debated the idea and alternatives such as shortening the initiation period. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The final decision to stop pledging came on a Feb. 3 conference call. Cohen said the council kept its plan under wraps for fear that hazers would accelerate abuse of pledges before the program was eliminated. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;How many more new members have to die before everyone is willing to change the way we operate?&#8221; SAE Executive Director Blaine Ayers said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bank&#8217;s Rebuff &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A rebuff from an unexpected quarter reaffirmed the council&#8217;s resolve. SAE&#8217;s charitable foundation had an investment account with New York-based JPMorgan containing about $500,000, which was primarily used to make payments on a loan and occasionally to sell stock gifts. The account dated back to the mid-2000&#8217;s, Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, in February, JPMorgan said that it was reconsidering the relationship to avoid tarnishing its reputation, according to Todd Buchanan, vice president of the foundation and one of Cohen&#8217;s predecessors as SAE&#8217;s leader. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was shocking,&#8221; Buchanan said. &#8220;It really spoke to why we needed to make a stand. We&#8217;re better than this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank, which has said it would pay more than $23 billion to resolve regulatory and criminal investigations, has cut ties since last year with about 2,000 clients that could attract scrutiny, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Emily Sackett, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Terminated Ties &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen and Buchanan said they learned March 6 that JPMorgan had decided to quit doing business with SAE&#8217;s foundation. On March 7, the bank sent a letter terminating the relationship. That day, Cohen announced the pledging ban. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;As an organization, we have been plagued with too much bad behavior, which has resulted in loss of lives, negative press and large lawsuits,&#8221; he said in a video address. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A week later, during a student leadership conference at the University of La Verne, Cohen milled around with undergraduates from chapters across Southern California. Some admired his purple and gold tie, adorned with tiny phoenixes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re like the Phoenix,&#8221; Cohen told them. &#8220;We&#8217;re rising from the ashes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Filing into the arena under a huge American flag, SAE brothers wore khakis, blazers and crisp white shirts, and ties in the fraternity&#8217;s colors. Sorority women in high heels acted as hostesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Guiding Light&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The brothers shouted the SAE motto, &#8220;Phi Alpha,&#8221; before joining in a medley of fraternity songs, filling the arena with rich baritones: &#8220;And to Phi Alpha with its guiding light, And to the lion who will fight, fight, fight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For half an hour, Cohen made his case that the Supreme Council had no choice but to ban pledging: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;No parent should ever have to suffer the loss of a child because that child was simply trying to join a fraternity -- our beloved fraternity, where we claim to be true gentlemen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the speech, Alexi Sciutto, who just graduated from California State University at Northridge, buttonholed Cohen to offer support. His SAE brothers helped him cope with his mother&#8217;s death from breast cancer, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ll do whatever needs to be done to keep SAE alive,&#8221; he told Cohen. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll do it until I die.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christian Couch, 21, a junior from California State University at Long Beach who attended Cohen&#8217;s speech, said he disagreed with the new policy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Easy Out&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t feel right. You just sign up and you&#8217;re automatically in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the easy way out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the speech, Cohen joined other fraternity staff and volunteers in workshops about the revamped program for new members, called &#8220;The True Gentleman Experience.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leaning against a wall in a classroom with 25 SAE members, Cohen said that brothers must still learn rituals, including the SAE creed. &#8220;They don&#8217;t need to learn the True Gentleman standing in a tub of ice, half naked,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back in Cohen&#8217;s family room, his 14-year-old son, Devon, said he&#8217;s pleased that SAE eliminated pledging. His parents support his ambition to join the fraternity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The brothers I&#8217;ve met are so cool, so nice, so welcoming,&#8221; Devon said. &#8220;They really are true gentlemen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: John Hechinger in Boston at jhechinger@bloomberg.net; David Glovin in New York at dglovin@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Daniel Golden at dlgolden@bloomberg.net Chris Staiti &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get AS, Norway&#8217;s second-largest cable operator, is being put up for sale by its private-equity owners and may fetch as much as 7.7 billion kroner ($1.3 billion), according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s buyout unit, GS Capital Partners, and Quadrangle Capital Partners, which bought Get AS in 2007 for 5.8 billion kroner, are sounding out buyers about a sale process or potential initial public offering expected to start this year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Get AS, which competes with larger Telenor ASA (TEL)&#8217;s Canal Digital unit, is the latest cable company to join a flurry of mergers and acquisitions as demand for bundled broadband, pay-TV and wireless services increases. Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) this month agreed to buy Spain&#8217;s Grupo Corporativo Ono SA for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion) including debt. Cable tycoon Patrick Drahi&#8217;s Numericable SA (NUM) is competing with Bouygues SA (EN) to combine with Vivendi SA&#8217;s French mobile-phone unit SFR. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A London-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while representatives for Quadrangle and Oslo-based Get didn&#8217;t respond to e-mails requests seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Quadrangle haven&#8217;t made a final decision on the sale and could decide to retain the business, one of the people said. Get, which offers TV and broadband-Internet access, has about 1 million customers in Norway, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms typically pool money from pension plans and insurance companies. They usually charge a management fee of as much as 2 percent and keep 20 percent of the profits from investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Kiel Porter in London at kporter17@bloomberg.net; Aaron Kirchfeld in London at akirchfeld@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net Ville Heiskanen &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President
Gary Cohn said prices in global markets don&#8217;t reflect the risks
from geopolitical conflicts such as Russia&#8217;s annexation of
Crimea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the last six to 12 months, markets for some reason
have been ignoring a lot of the geopolitical risk,&#8221; Cohn, 53,
said in an interview with Canadian television network CBC.
&#8220;Russia, Crimea, Ukraine: this is not the first or newest
geopolitical risk we&#8217;ve had in the last year or so.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn cited tensions between China and Japan as well as
continuing violence in the Middle East as risks that haven&#8217;t
halted a climb in global equities over the last 12 months.
Investors with a lot of cash have felt pressure to deploy it,
preventing a sustained downturn in prices, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anytime we get any sell-off in the market, there&#8217;s new
investors coming into the market, so we haven&#8217;t seen that
repricing,&#8221; Cohn said. Investors are saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to put
cash to work, and maybe these situations are going to be with us
for a long time, and I can&#8217;t sit on cash at the bank earning no
return forever,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Cohn said the U.S. stock market seems fairly valued,
given low interest rates and bond yields that will probably
climb. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index has risen 18 percent in
the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a lot of respects, owning equities in the world today
seems like the least risky opportunity for cash out there,&#8221;
Cohn said. &#8220;Each of the alternatives has its own negative
potential consequences to it, and then you evaluate all the
alternatives in relationship to each other, and then you end up
in a scenario where I think equities provide the most upside
versus the downside.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghana&#8217;s cedi, the worst-performing
African currency in the first quarter, could depreciate another
20 percent this year as foreign-exchange reserves recede and
inflation (GHCPALLY) accelerates, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased risk of outflows from the &#8220;heavily&#8221; foreign-owned local bonds, uncertainty around commodity prices and fewer
signs of a &#8220;real turnaround in the country&#8217;s fiscal situation&#8221;
add to the cedi&#8217;s weaker outlook, Giulia Pellegrini, sub-Saharan
Africa economist at JPMorgan, said in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. investment bank, which cut Ghana&#8217;s gross domestic
product forecast for 2014, said lower growth will affect revenue
generation and widen the budget deficit to 10 percent of GDP
against the government&#8217;s target of 8.5 percent. Inflation
quickened to 14 percent in February, climbing for a sixth
consecutive month, as the government stopped utility subsidies
and the cedi weakened. It climbed from 13.8 percent in January,
above the central bank&#8217;s target of 9.5 percent plus or minus 2
percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bank of Ghana has revised up its inflation forecasts,&#8221;
Pellegrini said. &#8220;It sees inflation staying above the target
band until 2015, with risks tilted to the upside on the
weakening cedi and slower-than-planned fiscal consolidation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan cut the economic growth forecast to 5.2 percent
given the West African nation&#8217;s erratic power supply and
uncertainty around commodity prices, Pellegrini said. The
government&#8217;s GDP estimate for this year is 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghana&#8217;s gross foreign-exchange reserves dropped to $5.3
billion in January from $5.6 billion the previous month, the
central bank said March 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency of the world&#8217;s second-biggest cocoa producer
slumped 20 percent against the dollar last year. It is 12
percent weaker in the first quarter, the most among 24 African
currencies monitored by Bloomberg. The cedi slipped 0.1 percent
to 2.6925 per dollar by 4:40 p.m. in Accra, the capital,
declining for a second day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is seeking to
become one of the world&#8217;s three biggest stock brokers, lifting a
division that has fallen behind its capital markets, equity
derivatives and investment banking units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank is trying to boost electronic trading
and increase commission pools to climb from sixth place in cash-equities trading, said Tim Throsby, global head of equities in
London. JPMorgan is ranked first in investment banking, equities
origination, fixed income, commodities and currencies, while it
comes second for derivatives products, according to research
firm Coalition Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the big themes for the firm is to bring cash
equities up to that same level,&#8221; Throsby said in an interview
in London. &#8220;There are some very obvious areas where we are
working to improve, and where we think there is a great
opportunity. Third or fourth place would be a realistic medium-term ambition, with second or third in the long term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender isn&#8217;t planning to hire more staff to accomplish
the task, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is betting that investments in electronic
platforms and hedge-fund services will help it leap over rivals
in an industry that has suffered from declining volume and
profitability. The New York-based bank was late in boosting
those offerings as it focused on advisory and sales, said
analysts including Derek de Vries at UBS AG. (UBSN) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donskoy Tabak, Russia&#8217;s largest independent tobacco company, is working with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to help it find a buyer amid a government crackdown on smoking, according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Privately held Donskoy Tabak may get interest from potential bidders such as Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, Europe&#8217;s second-biggest tobacco company, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The process may slow or even be halted due to the recent Russian conflict with Ukraine, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for Donskoy, Imperial Tobacco and JPMorgan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s second-biggest tobacco market is consolidating after the government boosted taxes and restricted both points of sale and smoking in public places in a bid to reduce usage. The biggest tobacco wholesaler, Megapolis Distribution BV, sold a 40 percent stake in December to Philip Morris International Inc. and Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donskoy Tabak sales climbed 26 percent to 36.2 billion rubles ($1 billion) last year, helped by the tax hike, according to the company&#8217;s website. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization were 4.6 billion rubles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The unrest in the region has already led to two other consumer companies halting plans to sell shares in Russian businesses to the public. Metro AG last week delayed the initial public offering of its Russian Cash  Carry unit because market conditions were no longer appropriate. The ruble has dropped about 7.7 percent against the euro this year amid the worst diplomatic crisis since the Cold War. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donskoy Tabak, owned by entrepreneur Ivan Savvidis, sells own-brand cigarettes in Russia and exports to countries including Ukraine. Savvidis&#8217;s Agrokom Group, based in the southern Russian city of Rostov, also processes meat and owns a fishery and real-estate business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Manuel Baigorri in London at mbaigorri@bloomberg.net; Aaron Kirchfeld in London at akirchfeld@bloomberg.net; Gabi Thesing in London at gthesing@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Aaron Kirchfeld at akirchfeld@bloomberg.net Celeste Perri &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Canada (RY) joined Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in voicing support for IEX Group Inc.&#8217;s five-month-old U.S. stock market, which was designed to mitigate the
influence of computerized high-speed traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s RBC Capital Markets unit executed the first
trade on IEX in October, according to an internal memo from
RBC&#8217;s head of global equities, Greg Mills, and the U.S. equities
chief, Bobby Grubert. Royal Bank also supported the market&#8217;s
development while its founders were still employed at the bank,
according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank has positioned itself as a champion of making
the stock market more fair. It built a software defense known as
THOR that tries to protect clients&#8217; orders from the fastest
traders. Also, the Toronto-based bank doesn&#8217;t run a dark pool,
shunning a common practice among the world&#8217;s biggest brokerages.
On broker-owned dark pools, customers&#8217; orders are executed
privately instead of being sent to public exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have always been strongly opposed to predatory trading
strategies,&#8221; according to the memo. &#8220;RBC and IEX are fully
aligned and have a shared philosophy of creating a fair and open
market structure for investors and all industry participants.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kait Conetta, a Royal Bank spokeswoman, confirmed the
document is authentic and declined to comment further. The
company is Canada&#8217;s second-largest lender by assets. Neither
Royal Bank nor any other broker owns a stake in IEX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attorney General &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endorsements of IEX come amid heightened scrutiny of
the structure and vulnerabilities of the U.S. stock market,
where more than 50 electronic venues compete to match buyers
with sellers. &#8220;Flash Boys&#8221; by author Michael Lewis, scheduled
for release next week, in part tells the story of IEX Chief
Executive Officer Brad Katsuyama, according to excerpts from the
book. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said last week
that he&#8217;s investigating whether exchanges and other venues are
giving high-speed traders improper advantages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, IEX has captured only a small slice of stock
trading. Average daily volume increased to 14.7 million shares
in February from 9.1 million in January, and is about 18 million
in March, according to IEX. That&#8217;s less than 1 percent of the
2014 daily average of 6.9 billion on all U.S. markets, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IEX attempts to declaw high-speed traders by delaying
reports of order executions by 350 millionths of a second,
enough to curb the fastest firms. IEX also shuns the use of the
maker-taker business model, in which exchanges and other venues
pay rebates to market makers for providing bids and offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank has urged regulators to consider alternatives to
that system, saying it creates a conflict of interest for
brokers who may pick a venue because of its rebates rather than
the best interests of clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Normally Private &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a challenge to other dark pools, IEX last year released
its normally private regulatory filing that explains how it
operates. While currently organized as a dark pool, IEX has
ambitions to officially become an exchange, Katsuyama said
during an interview with Bloomberg News last year. There are 13
stock exchanges in the U.S., including the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in its memo last week that &#8220;it would be
best for the overall market if IEX achieved critical mass, even
if that results in reduced volumes&#8221; on Sigma X, the Goldman
Sachs dark pool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founders of IEX worked on their business plan for
months while still at RBC, according to the RBC memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While it was hard to part with such strong talent, it was
the right thing to do for our clients,&#8221; the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are at the forefront of significant market structure
reform,&#8221; Royal Bank said. &#8220;While we may see other industry
participants potentially amending their practices based on
recent developments, our approach as the client advocate has
been consistent from day one and we will continue to stand by
this philosophy in the months and years to come.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s peso is poised to snap
its best monthly rally in two years, trading patterns suggest,
providing relief to a government that&#8217;s counting on a weaker
currency to boost the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso&#8217;s 4.2 percent gain this month, its biggest advance
since January 2012, pushed the currency through the lower line
of its 20-day Bollinger band, while the 14-day relative-strength
index gave an overbought signal for the first time since January
2013. The currency will be due a correction at about 1,950 per
dollar, or 0.7 percent stronger than current levels, according
to Brown Brothers Harriman  Co. and Banco de Bogota SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The peso has shot up too fast,&#8221; said Andres Munoz, the
head currency trader in Bogota at Corporacion Financiera
Colombiana, a unit of the nation&#8217;s largest banking group.
&#8220;We&#8217;re starting to see investors buying dollars at these
levels. Technical levels show a reversal is coming soon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s currency reached a two-month high of 1,957.07
per dollar today after a surge that made it this month&#8217;s best
performer among 24 emerging-market peers tracked by Bloomberg.
The peso was supported after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said March 19
it could more than double the weighting of the nation&#8217;s local-currency bonds in two of its key debt indexes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) failed to
persuade a federal judge to again throw out a securities lawsuit
over residential mortgage-backed securities it sold in 2007
after an appeals court overturned an earlier decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum in Manhattan,
who had dismissed the lawsuit by the Police and Fire Retirement
System of the City of Detroit twice before, ruled yesterday that
a 2012 appellate decision overturning her findings in a related
lawsuit had &#8220;significantly changed the landscape.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012 the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York reversed
Cedarbaum&#8217;s ruling that the NECA-IBEW Health and Welfare Fund,
which had sued Goldman Sachs in 2008, had failed to claim a
sufficient loss from the investments. The appeals panel also
threw out her ruling that the fund couldn&#8217;t represent investors
in offerings of the securities it hadn&#8217;t bought itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s ruling follows a New York state appeals court
decision in January that Goldman Sachs must face fraud claims in
a $1 billion lawsuit filed by an Australian hedge fund, Basis
Capital Funds Management Ltd.&#8217;s Basis Yield Alpha Fund, over
collateralized debt obligations sold by the bank before the
financial crisis of 2008. In 2010, Goldman Sachs reached a $550
million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission to resolve claims over the marketing of CDOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Judge Reversed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the federal case, the Detroit pension fund filed a
separate lawsuit in 2010 on behalf of investors that bought
securities from the trust for which Cedarbaum had said NECA
couldn&#8217;t bring claims. The judge had dismissed the Detroit
fund&#8217;s lawsuit twice largely on her determination that it didn&#8217;t
adequately allege how Goldman Sachs&#8217;s purported
misrepresentations caused any loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the higher court&#8217;s ruling, &#8220;the fact that PFRS
received payments throughout the life of the certificates, and
was arguably aware of the risk that there would not be a
secondary market for its certificates, is immaterial,&#8221;
Cedarbaum said in yesterday&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is The Police and Fire Retirement System of the
City of Detroit v. Goldman, Sachs  Co., 10-04429, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) are among about 20 banks and their
affiliates that must face an investor lawsuit accusing them of
manipulating benchmark interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan said in a
decision yesterday that the investor, who alleges losses from
short positions on euroyen Tibor futures contracts, can proceed
against all the banks with his claim under the Commodity
Exchange Act for price manipulation and aiding and abetting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investor, Jeffrey Laydon, who seeks to represent other
investors in a group lawsuit, or class action, said in an
amended complaint last year that the banks conspired to fix the
euroyen Tokyo interbank offered rate and the London interbank
offered rate for the yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators around the world have been probing whether firms
colluded to manipulate interest-rate benchmarks including Libor,
which affects more than $300 trillion of securities worldwide.
Financial institutions have paid about $6 billion so far to
resolve criminal and civil claims in the U.S. and Europe that
they manipulated benchmark interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probes have have led to fines and settlements for
lenders including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Barclays
Plc (BARC), UBS AG (UBSN) and Rabobank Groep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) won dismissal
of a lawsuit filed on behalf of current and former employees
over losses in their retirement accounts allegedly stemming from
the $6.2 billion &#8220;London Whale&#8221; trading debacle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels in Manhattan today
dismissed the suit by participants in the retirement plan who
lost money on company stock after the bank reported a $2 billion
trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employees said the bank made misstatements about its
financial health from January to April 2012, allowing its stock
to trade at inflated prices. They claim they lost money when
JPMorgan disclosed its losses publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trading losses came on synthetic credit products, which
are derivatives tied to credit performance. In disclosing the $2
billion loss on transactions he said were intended to manage
risk, JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
cited &#8220;egregious&#8221; failures by the bank&#8217;s chief investment
office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniels is overseeing lawsuits against New York-based
JPMorgan tied to trading losses allegedly caused by its chief
investment office and Bruno Iksil, known as the &#8220;London Whale&#8221;
because of the size of his bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re JPMorgan Chase  Co. Erisa Litigation,
12-cv-04027, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS) rallied to a
one-week high after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended buying
the online fashion retailer, citing its significant growth
potential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American depositary shares of Vipshop climbed 8.2 percent
to $149.30 in New York, extending the company&#8217;s surge this year
to 78 percent. Vipshop has climbed 23-fold since its U.S. debut
in March 2012. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. advanced 0.4 percent to 99.12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retailer&#8217;s share of the Chinese apparel market is
expected to grow to 1.5 percent in 2016 from 1 percent this
year, translating into revenue of $6 billion in 2016, Goldman
Sachs analysts led by Weibo Hu wrote in a note dated yesterday.
Vipshop on March 3 forecast first-quarter sales will double to
as much as $650 million, above an average analyst estimate of
$544 million at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vipshop&#8217;s &#8220;growing credibility as a leader in discount
retail in China will allow it to introduce more global brands,
thereby attracting more customers, creating a virtuous cycle,&#8221;
the analysts said. &#8220;We expect the company to seek expansion
into further product categories, such as maternal and baby
products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) New Chief Executive
Officer Satya Nadella announced new leadership roles for Scott Guthrie and Phil Spencer, adding to management moves aimed at
rebooting growth in cloud and devices at the world&#8217;s largest
software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella, who took over as CEO last month, wrote in an e-mail to employees that he had appointed Guthrie to lead
company&#8217;s cloud and enterprise organization. Spencer will run
the Xbox business and former Nokia Oyj CEO Stephen Elop will
join as executive vice president of the devices group when
Microsoft completes its acquisition of Nokia&#8217;s handset unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO earlier this month named a chief strategy officer
and disclosed the exits of several top executives. Nadella, who
was promoted to replace Steve Ballmer, is lining up his
leadership team as he seeks growth in devices and cloud
services. Nadella is also replacing executives who&#8217;ve left after
Ballmer&#8217;s management overhaul in July and Nadella&#8217;s own
appointment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes among executives show &#8220;how we&#8217;re continuing to
evolve and tune our organization for maximum focus and impact,&#8221;
Nadella wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guthrie, who has been named a new executive vice president,
has been the acting head of the cloud unit for the past two
months, replacing Nadella. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer, who had previously overseen the company&#8217;s video
game and television studios, will add Xbox software and the Xbox
Live online service and report to operating systems chief Terry Myerson. Marc Whitten, who left Microsoft this month, had
previously been responsible for Xbox software and Xbox Live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CEO Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elop&#8217;s role was initially announced in September when
Microsoft unveiled the Nokia acquisition and initially included
oversight of games and TV studios. Xbox hardware remains in
Elop&#8217;s group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft holds its developer conference, called Build, in
San Francisco this week. Last week, Nadella made his first
public appearance since taking on his CEO job when he unveiled
Microsoft Office software for Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad. At the event,
the CEO said he will &#8220;hold nothing back&#8221; to get the Redmond,
Washington-based company&#8217;s programs across all devices, in a
clear departure from the software maker&#8217;s longtime focus on its
Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
earned a third of its profit from trading last year, moved Guy Saidenberg from head of global foreign-exchange trading to allow
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Kayhan Mirza to assume the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saidenberg, who was named to the currencies post last year,
becomes global co-head of commodities trading with Greg Agran in
June, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a March 28 internal
memo. That&#8217;s when Mirza joins as a partner and London-based
chief of the unit that Saidenberg ran, the bank said in a
separate memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, confirmed
the appointments and declined further comment, as did JPMorgan&#8217;s
Brian Marchiony. Saidenberg declined to comment through an
associate in his office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
investment banks declined 9 percent in 2013, according to
industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in October that the
firm&#8217;s currency business had &#8220;difficulty managing inventory&#8221;
in the third quarter as the company posted its worst fixed-income trading revenue since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saidenberg joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 on the interest-rate products trading desk and was named a managing director in
2005 and partner the following year, according to the memo. He
will also continue as head of Europe, Middle East and Africa
emerging markets trading, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported Goldman Sachs&#8217;s hiring of Mirza,
who oversaw JPMorgan&#8217;s EMEA foreign-exchange trading and was
global head of FX options trading, on March 5. The Wall Street
Journal reported Saidenberg&#8217;s new role earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMC Financial Markets is in talks to
buy Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s New York Stock Exchange market-making unit, two people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is seeking as much as $30 million for the
business, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified
because the negotiations are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. (ICE)&#8217;s NYSE relies on
traders known as designated market markers, or DMMs, to
facilitate the buying and selling of shares. Barclays Plc and
KCG Holdings Inc. are the biggest DMMs, followed by Goldman
Sachs and Virtu Financial Inc., according to a person with
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMC, which stands for International Marketmakers
Combination, is a trading firm and asset manager founded in
Amsterdam in 1989. It has U.S. offices in Chicago and New York,
and trades on more than 90 exchanges around the world, according
to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remco Lenterman, an IMC managing director, and Tiffany Galvin of New York-based Goldman Sachs said their respective
companies don&#8217;t comment on speculation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) employee Alex
Kibkalo pleaded guilty to leaking company trade secrets to a
blogger in France and agreed to pay $22,500 in restitution and
spend three months in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kibkalo, a Russian national who worked for Microsoft in
Lebanon, admitted he uploaded pre-release updates for Windows 8
and a software development kit for guarding against copyright
infringement to his online backup storage in July and August
2012, according to a plea agreement filed yesterday in federal
court in Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kibkalo provided the blogger with links to the files in his
account, encouraging him to share the development kit with
others who might be able to write &#8220;fake activation&#8221; codes
based on the software, according to the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kit&#8217;s value &#8220;is substantial to Microsoft because it
prevents software piracy across the line of Microsoft
products,&#8221; according to the agreement, which is subject to a
judge&#8217;s approval. Sentencing is scheduled for July 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was alerted to the theft in 2012 by an individual
who asked that his identity not be disclosed. He learned of
Kibkalo&#8217;s theft when the blogger contacted him for help
examining code for the Microsoft Activation Server Software
Development Kit, a product developed for internal Microsoft use
only, according to the criminal complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internal Investigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company&#8217;s internal
investigation traced the leaked information to Kibkalo, a seven-year employee who was working as a software architect in
Lebanon, prosecutors said. He has worked for another U.S.
technology company since he returned to Russia, prosecutors
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the company&#8217;s internal investigation, Microsoft
gained access to the blogger&#8217;s Hotmail account, which contained
e-mail messages from Kibkalo with pre-release &#8220;hot fixes&#8221; for
Windows 8 for mobile devices that weren&#8217;t publicly available,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While Microsoft&#8217;s terms of service make clear our
permission for this type of review, this happens only in the
most exceptional circumstances,&#8221; the company said in a March 20
statement. &#8220;We apply a rigorous process before reviewing such
content.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v Kibkalo, 14-00087, U.S. District Court,
Western District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darden Restaurants (DRI) Inc., the owner
of Olive Garden and Red Lobster, said splitting off its real
estate holdings wouldn&#8217;t increase shareholder value, rejecting a
strategy pushed by activist investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darden spurned the idea after consulting with financial
advisers Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), according
to a statement today. The company&#8217;s board also worked with law
firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen  Katz to assess the demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darden is facing increased pressure from activists,
including Starboard Value LP and Barington Capital Group LP, to
spin off its restaurant properties and shake up company
management. The real estate is worth about $4 billion, Starboard
said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A real estate separation would not enhance long-term
shareholder value,&#8221; Darden responded in today&#8217;s statement.
&#8220;The company will review the latest Starboard materials and
looks forward to addressing them in its ongoing conversations
with Darden shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the Orlando, Florida-based company have declined
5.3 percent this year. The stock gained 1.4 percent to $51.48 at
the close today in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Barington asked Darden to consider replacing
Chief Executive Officer Clarence Otis, saying the company has
underperformed during his tenure and that his restructuring plan
may destroy value. Otis, who became CEO in 2004 and chairman in
2005, is working to separate Darden&#8217;s Red Lobster seafood chain
through a tax-free spinoff or sale. Starboard has joined
Barington in opposing Otis&#8217;s plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is seeking a buyer for its New York Stock Exchange designated market-making business acquired through the 2000 purchase of Spear, Leeds  Kellogg, a person briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank is in the early stages of the process and has held talks with potential buyers, according to the person, who requested anonymity because the discussions are private. The Financial Times reported on the planned sale earlier today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which reaps the most revenue from equities trading among banks globally, paid about $5.4 billion in stock and cash for Spear Leeds. The purchase remains the biggest in the history of the firm, which is the world&#8217;s largest adviser on mergers and acquisitions in 11 of the past 13 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The business for sale is now valued at about $30 million, the FT reported, citing analysts it didn&#8217;t identify. Last year, Goldman Sachs agreed to sell a majority stake in its Redi trading-technology unit that was based on software acquired when it bought Spear Leeds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, said the company doesn&#8217;t comment on speculation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The NYSE, purchased in November by Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc., relies on traders known as designated market makers, or DMMs, to facilitate buying and selling. The firms help run the opening and closing auctions of NYSE-listed stocks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s effort to repair ties
with overseas investors is starting to yield results in the bond
market as the country tries to stem a plunge in foreign-currency
reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its dollar-denominated notes surged by the most of any
emerging market, adding to a 9.2 percent rally in March, after
the government said it received loan proposals from
international investment banks. The statement was in response to
a newspaper report on March 30 that said Argentina is close to
getting a two-year, $1 billion loan from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. at an interest rate of 6.5 percent, less than the nation&#8217;s
similar-maturity bonds that yield 11.28 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loan would provide Argentina, which hasn&#8217;t issued
overseas bonds since its $95 billion default in 2001, with a
crucial source of hard currency at a time when the reserves it
uses to pay debt are at a seven-year low. The financing would
also show President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is succeeding
in restoring investor confidence after settling creditor
disputes at the World Bank, agreeing to compensate Repsol SA for
its seizure of YPF SA and revamping its inflation index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market has been optimistic about Argentina for a
while now due to the change in attitude toward more pragmatic
and orthodox policies,&#8221; Diego Ferro, the co-chief investment
officer at Greylock Capital Management LLC in New York, said by
e-mail. &#8220;In that context, regaining market access would be a
logical step.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Budget Deficit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment
on any proposals or talks with Argentina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank is negotiating the final details of the
loan with Goldman Sachs including guarantees, Buenos Aires-based
newspaper Pagina/12 reported, citing a government official it
didn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bond-market advance pushed down Argentina&#8217;s average
yields to 10.8 percent. As recently as Feb. 3, they were as high
as 13.61 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Economy Ministry said in a statement on March 30 that
while the government isn&#8217;t planning any foreign currency debt
sales in the short term, it has received proposals from
investment banks it didn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Different financial entities have presented proposals to
obtain foreign financing at maturities and interest rates in
line with other countries in the region,&#8221; the ministry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subsidy Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernandez, hamstrung by a growing fiscal deficit and a
shrinking trade surplus, has authorized her economic team led by
Economy Minister Axel Kicillof to settle decade-old investment
disputes to gain access to fresh financing before the end of her
term late next year. Argentina will begin to cut gas and water
subsidies by 20 percent beginning today. Utility rates have been
largely frozen since 2003 and an increase in gas imports have
drained reserves as domestic output declines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given what they&#8217;ve been doing in recent days like changes
to subsidies, they&#8217;re cognizant of the need to maintain this
change in policy,&#8221; Marco Santamaria, a money manager at
AllianceBernstein LP, which oversees $25 billion in emerging-market debt, said by phone from New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Abad, who helps oversee about $53 billion of
emerging-market debt at Western Asset Management Co., said
Argentina&#8217;s legal dispute with creditors who rejected its debt
restructurings will continue to make it difficult for Argentina
to obtain the financing it needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Holdout Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creditors led by Elliott Management Corp.&#8217;s Paul Singer
have won lower court rulings to be paid in full at the same time
Argentina services its restructured debt. The effects of the
ruling are on hold pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
About 93 percent of creditors accepted losses of 70 percent in
the restructurings. Argentina has said paying holdouts in full
could expose it to $43 billion of claims that would lead it to
default again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have a lot more work to do, a loan here and a loan
there won&#8217;t bring liquidity relief that makes the math
sustainable,&#8221; Abad said in a telephone interview from Pasadena,
California. &#8220;This legal issue can create a big dent to what
happens. It&#8217;s hard to set the parameters to how much they have
to set aside.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has $5.9 billion of bonds due in October
2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina obtained $938 million in financing from the
Inter-American Development Bank during meetings on March 29,
Buenos Aires-based newspaper Ambito Financiero reported
yesterday. The government is also in &#8220;advanced talks&#8221; with the
World Bank for $3 billion of loans, Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;High Probability&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentine bonds will continue to gain, according to
Barclays Plc. Average yields are still double the average in
emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Valuations are still attractive, and the market will
continue to rally,&#8221; Donato Guarino, a strategist at Barclays,
said in a telephone interview from New York. &#8220;There&#8217;s a high
probability that they will get back on the international
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

In return, the groups agreed to withdraw a shareholder resolution on the topic that would have been voted on at Exxon's annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more about Bloomberg BNA, click here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit www.bloomberg.com/sustainability for the latest from Bloomberg News about energy, natural resources and global business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will manage
funds for a Bermuda-based reinsurer that raised $1.13 billion in
capital, concentrating the investments in junk bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Highbridge Principal Strategies LLC will oversee
the assets for Watford Re Ltd., the reinsurer said yesterday in
a statement. Watford said it raised $907 million in common
equity, including a $100 million investment by Arch Capital
Group Ltd., and $226 million in preferred shares. The reinsurer
is targeting an initial public offering in two to three years,
Chief Executive Officer John Rathgeber said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reinsurer&#8217;s portfolio will be &#8220;comprised primarily of
non-investment grade credit assets, which it believes will
generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for its shareholders
over the long term,&#8221; Watford said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers including Dan Loeb have started Bermuda-based reinsurers in recent years to raise funds that are less
subject to client withdrawals and can provide tax advantages.
Pine River Capital Management LP, the hedge-fund firm founded by
Brian Taylor, was seeking to raise $500 million to $750 million
for a reinsurance company, a person familiar with the matter
said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, owns Highbridge
through its investment arm, JPMorgan Asset Management.
Highbridge Principal Strategies is led by Chief Executive
Officer Scott Kapnick, who came to the firm in 2007 after 21
years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was global co-head
of investment banking. HPS had about $19 billion of assets under
management as of March, Watford said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Casualty Coverage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rathgeber was vice chairman of Arch Worldwide Reinsurance
Group. Jon Levy was named chief risk officer and Roderick Romeo
will be chief financial officer. Reinsurers shoulder risk for
primary carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management is aiming for annualized returns of about 15
percent over time, Rathgeber said. He plans to focus on casualty
lines such as automobile liability, workers&#8217; compensation and
medical malpractice coverage while limiting risks tied to
natural disasters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t make sense to have this kind of investment
strategy and be heavily into that kind of volatile, capital-intensive reinsurance exposure,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constantine Iordanou, the CEO of Bermuda-based Arch
Capital, has been diversifying risk through deals including an
agreement last year to add assets from bankrupt mortgage insurer
PMI Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arch slipped 0.8 percent to $57.07 at 10:17 a.m. in New
York, narrowing its gain to about 8.6 percent over the past
year. JPMorgan climbed 0.3 percent and is up 27 percent in the
past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corporate Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk-rated corporate debt worldwide returned 2.9 percent
since Dec. 31, beating global stocks and setting the stage for a
sixth year of gains, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. The bonds now yield 6.1 percent, compared with an
average of about 10 percent in the decade through 2007. Junk
bonds are high-yield, high-risk debt rated below BBB-by Standard
 Poor&#8217;s and lower than Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that non-investment-grade credit complements
Watford&#8217;s reinsurance strategy,&#8221; Purnima Puri, HPS&#8217;s managing
director, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan advised on the capital structuring,
and Clifford Chance LLP was Watford&#8217;s outside counsel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citic Pacific Ltd.&#8217;s perpetual bonds
have jumped by a record since the steelmaker said last week it
will buy its parent&#8217;s main operating unit, a move Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. says may help improve corporate governance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices on the manufacturer&#8217;s dollar-denominated 8.625
percent notes with no set maturity have leapt 9.9 cents on the
dollar since March 25 to 107.01, the most for any five-business-day period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company
said on March 26 it will absorb about $36 billion of assets from
state-owned parent Citic Group Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman removed Citic Pacific&#8217;s perpetual securities from a
list of its least favored bonds, according to a research note
dated March 30. The deal comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping
advocates the most sweeping changes since Deng Xiaoping&#8217;s
liberalization in 1978, including loosening yuan trading and
allowing more private investments in state businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the transaction is completed, we believe it should
help to improve corporate governance for the group,&#8221; said
analysts led by Hong Kong-based Kenneth Ho in a March 31 note.
&#8220;If the Citic Pacific acquisition does materialize, and this is
accompanied by significant equity injection, then we would view
it as a clear credit positive for Citic Pacific.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to sell about $4 billion of shares to
restore its public float after absorbing assets from Citic
Group, people with knowledge of the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shinhan Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the dollar bond market in Asia, South Korea&#8217;s
Shinhan Bank is marketing a three-year floating-rate debenture
at about 80 basis points more than the three-month London
interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring corporate and sovereign bonds from
default in Asia-Pacific fell today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 2 basis points to 125 basis
points as of 8:41 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia  New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is poised for a third
straight day of declines, the longest streak of losses since the
period ended March 7, according to data provider CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 0.5 basis point
to 100.3 as of 11:24 a.m. in Sydney, according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. The benchmark is poised for its lowest close since Feb.
18 after a 1.9 basis point drop last week, CMA data shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 0.3 basis point to
84 basis points as of 9:25 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup prices show.
The measure, which fell 4.3 basis points last week, the most
since the five-day period ended Feb. 21, is on track for its
lowest close since March 19, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed Dahlberg got 40 calls in one day when he put a Gulfstream G650 up for sale in February. That&#8217;s unusual for a private jet -- especially when the asking price tops the $64.5 million on the sticker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe this plane&#8217;s going to bring north of $75 million,&#8221; said Dahlberg, president of Manassas, Virginia-based Emerald Aviation Inc. and part-owner of the G650. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barely 15 months after its debut, the world&#8217;s biggest and fastest business jet is a corporate status symbol, with owners as high profile as Exxon Mobil Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. The waiting list is almost four years long for a factory-fresh model, whetting appetites among tycoons and chief executive officers when a used G650 hits the market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the must-have airplane if you&#8217;re in the top end of the spectrum,&#8221; said Steve Varsano, founder of London-based Jet Business, who&#8217;s sold two pre-owned G650s since November for more than $70 million each to buyers he wouldn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;G650s are also must-have for Gulfstream parent General Dynamics Corp., the tank and submarine maker squeezed by shrinking U.S. defense budgets. The jets helped boost 2013 aerospace revenue 17 percent to $8.12 billion, while combat systems unit revenue fell 23 percent to $6.12 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The G650 is doing exceptionally well,&#8221; said Peter Arment, a Sterne, Agee  Leach Inc. analyst who has a buy rating on Falls Church, Virginia-based General Dynamics. &#8220;The demand for this plane is going to remain very strong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Transoceanic Routes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Large, luxury aircraft are the bright spot in a $21 billion private-jet market recovering unevenly from the 2008-09 financial crisis. While orders remain weak for small, personal models like the Mustang from Textron Inc.&#8217;s Cessna, corporate fleet managers and billionaires are shopping again for big planes able to make transoceanic routes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Qualcomm&#8217;s G650 flew round trip between California and Barcelona before February&#8217;s Mobile World Congress in the Spanish city, where then-CEO Paul Jacobs collected an industry award. That jaunt, as chronicled by airline-data tracker FlightAware, was well within the jet&#8217;s advertised range of 7,000 nautical miles (12,964 kilometers), enough to reach Beijing from New York without refueling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Propelled by Rolls-Royce engines tucked on either side of the rear of the fuselage, the G650 can reach 627 miles an hour at 30,000 feet (9,100 meters), about 93 percent of the speed of sound. It seats as many as 18 people. To ease jet lag, the cabin air pressure is kept higher than on typical airplanes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Engine Whisper &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a recent flight from Phoenix on a G650 owned by Honeywell International Inc., takeoff thrust pressed passengers into soft leather seats as the engines whispered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wood-veneer tables popped out at the touch of a button. Entertainment options included watching satellite television from a seat-belted sofa or gazing out the windows -- billed as the largest on a business jet and fitted with powered shades -- at the red sandstone cliffs of Sedona, Arizona. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s just unbelievably capable and unbelievably reliable,&#8221; Honeywell pilot Andy Eldringhoff said as he guided the plane above the Arizona desert at 16,500 feet. CEO Dave Cote is among the users of the jet, which has Honeywell avionics in the cockpit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With more than 50 delivered so far, the G650 has reset the market for business aircraft designed for maximum speed, comfort and distance. There won&#8217;t be a competitor in the G650&#8217;s class until 2016, when Bombardier Inc.&#8217;s Global 7000 is due for its initial handover. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exclusive Aura &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gulfstream enhances the aura of exclusivity by refusing to let buyers leapfrog by swapping or buying delivery slots, as occurs with commercial jets. The Savannah, Georgia-based company wrote a clause that strictly prohibits contract holders from selling their spots, said Steve Cass, a spokesman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no cutting in line,&#8221; Cass said. &#8220;Everyone that we deal with is pretty important folks. Once you go down that, it&#8217;s a pretty slippery slope. You just don&#8217;t want to go there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gulfstream started taking G650 orders in March 2008 -- six months before the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy triggered a global credit freeze -- and customers stampeded to put down about $3 million and sign purchase contracts, said Jet Business&#8217;s Varsano. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Cass said the G650 order book held up during the economic crisis, flight trials were marred by a 2011 crash in New Mexico that killed four Gulfstream employees. U.S. safety officials concluded in 2012 that company pressure to speed up testing caused the accident. Gulfstream President Larry Flynn responded that any failings by the planemaker were inadvertent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most Profitable? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The G650 may become Gulfstream&#8217;s most profitable aircraft ever, General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic told investors on Feb. 20 at a Barclays Plc conference. The jet uses 50 percent fewer parts than the smaller G550 and G450 and is assembled at a plant designed for the G650, according to Gulfstream. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t know internally how good we can get, but we know we can get a whole lot better,&#8221; Novakovic said of the plane&#8217;s profitability. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;General Dynamics soared 54 percent to $108.92 in the 12 months ended yesterday, topping the 19 percent gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. Montreal-based Bombardier rose 2 percent in the same period. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buyers&#8217; silence about the G650 contrasts with the demand. Corporate touchiness about jet ownership only intensified after U.S. automaker CEOs drew criticism for flying company aircraft to Washington in 2008 to beg Congress for an industry bailout. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Owners&#8217; Silence &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brooke Buchanan, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, confirmed that the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has a G650 while declining to discuss details. Emily Kilpatrick, a spokeswoman for San Diego-based Qualcomm, and Scott Silvestri, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon, declined to comment when asked about the G650s registered to the companies at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A G650 registered to Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods Inc. was sold in February, according to FAA records that didn&#8217;t list the buyer or the terms. The Coraopolis, Pennsylvania-based company didn&#8217;t respond to messages requesting comment on the transaction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gulfstream is famous for secrecy about what&#8217;s on the drawing board, and General Dynamics&#8217; Novakovic said the next jets won&#8217;t be unveiled until they&#8217;re ready to roll out on the tarmac under their own power. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jefferies LLC analyst Howard Rubel said a redo of the G550, the previous flagship, may be under consideration. Jet Business&#8217;s Varsano said buyers want other the Gulfstream models to get cabins like the G650&#8217;s. Dahlberg, the Virginia broker, said the G650 itself could be modified to extend its range. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gulfstream really hit a home run with the product,&#8221; said Josh Mesinger, vice president of Mesinger Jet Sales in Boulder, Colorado. &#8220;There is no other product in the world in service that will fly 7,000 miles.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mesinger was the broker that offered the G650 registered to Dick&#8217;s, with an asking price of $73.5 million, according to an online posting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It sold the day the ad appeared. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Black in Dallas at tblack@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Ed Dufner at edufner@bloomberg.net Anne Reifenberg &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blythe Masters, who rose from being a JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) intern to global head of a commodities powerhouse over 27 years, plans to exit after she helps the bank complete the $3.5 billion sale of units she oversees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Masters, 45, &#8220;has informed us of her intention to leave the firm, take some well-deserved time off and consider future opportunities,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, and investment-banking head Daniel Pinto, 51, said today in a memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan announced the sale of its physical commodities business to Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. last month amid pressure from regulators and lawmakers concerned that banks handling raw materials and energy could manipulate prices or endanger the financial system. That raised the question of whether Masters would join Mercuria, a decade old Geneva-based trader, or remain at JPMorgan to manage a diminished business. She chose neither. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was little reason for her to stay at JPMorgan given that her baby is being sold from underneath her,&#8221; said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC in New York. &#8220;I&#8217;m not shocked she didn&#8217;t end up at Mercuria because they have a senior group that is probably tightknit, and she would&#8217;ve been a substantial person to try and integrate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. renewed its push to catch up with Apple Inc. and Google Inc. in mobile devices, unveiling updated Windows Phone software with voice-search features and offering it for free for small phones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which previously required a licensing fee for Windows, will offer it without charge for handsets and tablets with screens of less than nine inches, Microsoft operating systems chief Terry Myerson said at the company&#8217;s Build conference for developers in San Francisco today. Microsoft also showed off a voice-controlled digital assistant called Cortana that is similar to Apple&#8217;s Siri, which is part of a new Windows Phone 8.1 software for mobile gadgets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, who was appointed to lead the world&#8217;s largest software maker in February, is working to remake Microsoft for an era where smartphones and tablets have become central. To do so, he must strike a balance between offering Microsoft&#8217;s software for competing platforms while still keeping the company&#8217;s Windows operating system as a core focus. Today&#8217;s event was designed to re-emphasize the importance of Windows to the Redmond, Washington-based company and to spur adoption of the software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;
Apple&#8217;s Maestri Takes Top Finance Role Amid Cash Scrutiny
Atop the Electronics World, Samsung Now Chasing Innovation
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Reinvigorating the Windows franchise continues to be a key ingredient in Microsoft&#8217;s recipe for success as it looks to offset headwinds from the secular challenges in the PC market,&#8221; Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co., wrote in a note. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Delicate Balance &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella&#8217;s tricky balancing act was underscored by two Microsoft events last week and this week. The CEO last week debuted Microsoft Office software for Apple&#8217;s iPads and said he&#8217;ll &#8220;hold nothing back&#8221; to get the company&#8217;s programs across all devices, in a clear departure from the software maker&#8217;s longtime focus on Windows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In contrast, this week&#8217;s Build conference puts Windows front-and-center by giving developers tools and tactics to boost Microsoft&#8217;s single-digit share in phones and tablets, as well as providing money-making opportunities in a contracting personal-computer market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to innovate with a challenger mindset,&#8221; Nadella said at the event. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In making Windows free for smaller phones and tablets, Microsoft is working to narrow the gap with Google, which distributes its Android mobile operating system to hardware manufacturers at no cost. Android has become the most widely used software in smartphones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Start Menu &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Myerson also said the company is restoring the Windows start menu, which will be made available to users as an update. The company yanked the feature from Windows 8, triggering customer complaints. Microsoft also showed Office applications for Windows that are redesigned for use with touch controls, one week after showing similar apps for Office for the iPad. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Vice President Joe Belfiore said the new Windows Phone 8.1 will have an action center, which is a pull-down menu that gives people access to basic functions regardless of whether programs are already open. The software, which will start rolling out in the next few months on existing phones and on new devices later this month and in early May, also lets users customize their phone&#8217;s lock screen and offers new choices for tweaking the start screen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cortana Speaks &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cortana, which &#8220;fully replaces the search function on Windows Phone,&#8221; according to Belfiore, is named for the artificial-intelligence character in Microsoft&#8217;s best-selling Halo Xbox video-game series. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developers outside Microsoft can write their own apps for Cortana, Belfiore said. With users&#8217; permission, Cortana can learn about consumers from their searches, keep track of people they interact with and set up an &#8220;inner circle&#8221; of the most important people and who can contact users during the times of day they set as &#8220;quiet hours.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Belfiore demonstrated how he allowed Cortana to scan his e-mail, causing the program to ask him whether to track an Alaska Airlines flight mentioned in an e-mail itinerary. The program can be used to start a Skype call, add a TV show to the user&#8217;s Hulu queue or check a friend&#8217;s Facebook posts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;She&#8217;s great at helping me get things done, whether its by talking or typing,&#8221; Belfiore said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Windows Share &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj&#8217;s handset division, which is being acquired by Microsoft in a deal set to close this month, will begin selling new phones using Windows Phone 8.1, said former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop. The 930 is a high-end device that will debut in June and feature wireless charging, while two cheaper phones designed for emerging markets will become available in May, said Elop, who will become Microsoft&#8217;s executive vice president of the devices group when the transaction with Nokia is completed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Windows stands to be the fastest-growing smartphone operating system over the next four years with 30 percent annual growth, according to a Feb. 26 report by researcher IDC. Even at that rate, Windows Phone would only make up 7 percent of the total market in 2018, compared with Google&#8217;s Android software at 76 percent Apple&#8217;s iOS at 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In tablets, Windows had 3.4 percent share in 2013, IDC said. For Microsoft&#8217;s Surface tablet, the share was 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Global computer shipments fell a record 10 percent last year and are forecast to continue to decline this year as tablets and smartphones lure consumers away from traditional desktop and notebook designs, according to IDC. Tablet sales volume -- dominated by Apple and Google, whose operating systems account for 95 percent of that market -- will rise an average 16 percent annually through to 2017. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One possible boon to Windows developers: Microsoft is working on obtaining tools, via acquisition or development, to make it easier for application developers to target multiple operating systems without having to rewrite software. The company is considering an acquisition or investment in Xamarin Inc., or other companies that enable mobile apps to run on different devices, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. Microsoft may also build those capabilities itself, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net; Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net Ben Livesey &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is making its
Windows licenses free for mobile phones and tablets that have
screens of less than nine inches, in a move to spur adoption of
the software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software company has historically made
Windows available to hardware makers for a licensing fee. That
has put Microsoft at a disadvantage to Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android
mobile operating system, which is offered for free to device
manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co. and which has
become the most widely used software in smartphones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft made the announcement at its Build developer
conference in San Francisco where it also showed off its new
Windows Phone 8.1 mobile software with a voice-search feature
called Cortana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows stands to be the fastest-growing smartphone
operating system over the next four years with 30 percent annual
growth, according to a Feb. 26 report by researcher IDC. Even at
that rate, Windows Phone would only make up 7 percent of the
total market in 2018, compared with Google&#8217;s Android software at
76 percent and Apple&#8217;s iOS at 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tablets, Windows had 3.4 percent share in 2013, IDC
said. For Microsoft&#8217;s Surface tablet, the share was 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wiet Pot, co-head of the Dutch high-speed trading firm that&#8217;s said to be bidding for Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.&#8217;s floor-trading business, is a former partner of the
investment bank who once helped run its equities division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pot&#8217;s IMC Financial Markets has expanded from Amsterdam to
Chicago and Sydney, where it uses algorithms to make markets in
stocks, commodities and currencies. Pot serves with Rob Defares,
one of IMC&#8217;s founders, as co-chief executive officer at IMC,
which he joined in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right to make markets on the New York Stock Exchange
floor was once a license to mint money by collecting the
customary 12.5-cent spread between purchases and sales. The
huddles of traders at the Big Board have been shrinking since
regulators allowed brokers to quote prices in pennies.
Computerized traders like IMC are still able to eke out profits
on the smaller spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the biggest high-frequency firms, Virtu Financial
Inc. and KCG Holdings Inc., have already taken over much of what
used to be called the specialist business, the niche that
Goldman Sachs is now exiting. Goldman Sachs, which valued its
market-making rights at $502 million in 2007, is seeking just
$30 million for the operation, a person familiar with the matter
has said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avolon Aerospace Leasing Ltd., the
private-equity backed aircraft financing company, has hired
JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley to explore a possible
initial public offering or sale, according to people familiar
with its plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avolon, owned by Oak Hill Capital Partners LP, Cinven Ltd.,
and CVC Capital Partners Ltd., may seek a U.S. listing should it
opt for an IPO, said one of the people, who asked not to be
named because the discussions are private. The company, with the
youngest fleet of any large aircraft lessor and 198 planes in
its portfolio and on order, also counts Singapore&#8217;s sovereign
wealth fund among its investors, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avolon Chief Executive Officer Domhnal Slattery said last
year he was encouraged by transactions including Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc.&#8217;s $7.3 billion purchase of Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc&#8217;s aviation unit and that he would explore
strategic options as early as 2014. Companies in Europe have
raised about $17 billion in IPOs this year, more than triple
what they did a year earlier in the same period, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Avolon, based in Dublin, Oak Hill,
Cinven, CVC, Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growing Role &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airfinance Journal reported earlier today that Avolon and
lessor Awas Aviation Capital Ltd. are exploring options for a
sale, with Awas hiring Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
Inc. It didn&#8217;t identify bankers hired by Avolon to explore
options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airlines buying large commercial aircraft will require $100
billion in financing this year, according to Avolon estimates.
Lessors make up about 40 percent of the aircraft financing
market now, a figure that is set to rise in coming years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support growth, the companies rely increasingly on
external funding, including capital markets, and transactions
including lessors have picked up. In December, AerCap Holdings
NV (AER) agreed to buy International Lease Finance Corp. from American
International Group Inc. for $15 billion to create a lessor
rivaling General Electric Co.&#8217;s Gecas unit for size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avolon has raised $7.2 billion in capital since its launch,
with its four owners putting in $1.4 billion in equity
investments. Its most recent financing closed last month, when
it secured a $500 million debt facility to finance aircraft
purchases this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mubadala Development Co., Abu Dhabi&#8217;s investment and
development company, is considering an initial public offering
for its Swiss SR Technics aircraft-maintenance business, people
with knowledge of the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other lessor transactions in the last 24 months include the
purchase of Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK)&#8217;s Jackson Square Aviation
to Mitsubishi UFJ Lease  Finance Co. for about $1.1 billion,
and Babcock  Brown Aircraft Management&#8217;s sale of a 50 percent
stake in December 2012 to Onex Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slattery himself previously set up the RBS aircraft leasing
division, and left three years before it was sold to Sumitomo.
Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte agreed to enter Avolon
as a shareholder in October 2011, a little more than a year
after the lessor&#8217;s formation in May 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for GIC did not immediately respond to
telephone requests seeking comment outside of regular business
hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and a group
of cable makers including Nexans SA (NEX) were fined a total of 301.6
million euros ($416 million) by the European Union for fixing
the price of high-voltage power cables sold to energy providers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shared a fine of 37.3 million euros with
Prysmian SpA (PRY), an Italian cable maker that Goldman Sachs Capital
Partners bought in 2005. Prysmian also shared a 67.3 million-euro fine with its former owner Pirelli  C. SpA. (PC) Nexans SA, the
world&#8217;s second-biggest cable maker, was fined 70.7 million
euros, less than the 200 million euros it had booked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fines add to a 953 million-euro penalty for car-parts
makers last month and a record 1.7 billion euros last year for
banks and a broker that rigged interest-rate benchmarks.
Breaking up cartels and levying high fines to deter price-fixing
is one of the EU&#8217;s priorities, according to Joaquin Almunia, the
bloc&#8217;s antitrust chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These companies knew very well that what they were doing
was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great
secrecy,&#8221; Almunia said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Despite this
and through joint efforts by several competition authorities
around the world, we have detected their anti-competitive
agreements and brought them to an end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil (XOM) Corp., Gazprom OAO (OGZD),
Lukoil OAO (LKOD), Total SA (FP) and Edison SpA were among more than 40
energy companies attending the start of the Croatian
government&#8217;s tender for Adriatic Sea oil and gas exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enel SpA (ENEL), Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE), Petroceltic International
Plc (PCI), Turkish Petroleum Corp., Hunt Oil Co. and Croatia&#8217;s INA
Industrija Nafte d.d. were also present in Zagreb as tenders
went out for 29 exploration blocks of Adriatic seabed, according
to Economy Ministry spokesman Tomislav Cerovec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Croatia, which is seeking new revenue to revive its
economy, will close the tenders on Nov. 3. The terms are based
on a production-sharing agreement model with a five-year
exploration phase and a 25-year production phase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a great interest,&#8221; Economy Minister Ivan Vrdoljak told reporters in Zagreb. &#8220;A successful tender will
make Croatia a key gas and oil provider in this part of Europe,
and our gas will be the cheapest in the region.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Croatia, which joined the European Union in July, needs
investment to revive growth after five years of economic
recession. The country revised laws on hydrocarbon research in
June, easing the process for gaining permits to tap more of its
own resources and reduce dependence on Russian gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU Financing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Croatia may also seek EU financing for a planned liquefied-natural-gas terminal on the Adriatic island of Krk, Vrdoljak
told Bloomberg News today. A location permit for the terminal
will probably be issued in June, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INA is &#8220;very interested&#8221; in the tender, and may take part
in it alone or with a partner, Zoltan Aldott, head of the
management board at INA, told Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blocks were drawn up after Norwegian seismic-data
company Spectrum ASA (SPU) completed the imaging of 35,000 square
kilometers (13,500 square miles) of Croatia&#8217;s seabed last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Croatia may hold as much oil and gas in the Adriatic Sea as
Italy does in the same branch of the Mediterranean,Vrdoljak
said on Oct. 29, citing initial results of the seismic mapping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INA, Croatia&#8217;s largest refiner, operates offshore platforms
in the northern Adriatic with Edison SpA and Eni. Zagreb-based
INA, controlled by Hungary&#8217;s Mol Nyrt., has so far had a
monopoly on exploration in Croatia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s (JPM) former global
head of equity finance and three other bankers have started a
London hedge-fund firm, as they try to profit from Europe&#8217;s
economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Angelone, who spent 20 years at JPMorgan, and Amit Jain, previously an equity derivatives trader for the New York-based bank, both left last year to start a hedge fund with
Simone Russo, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managing
director, and Guido Miani, previously a fixed-income trader at
UBS AG. The firm, Amagis Capital Ltd., will invest in companies
pursuing acquisitions, share buybacks and other transactions,
hoping to benefit from an increase in corporate activity as
Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt-crisis fades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is an opportunity right now in the European market
to deliver superior returns because of recovering activity,&#8221;
Angelone, Amagis&#8217; chief executive offer, said in an interview.
&#8220;After many years on the sell side we have the experience and
knowledge to be able to deploy a slightly different approach in
the event-driven space.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing number of traders have left banks for hedge funds
since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008
prompted regulators to try to limit risk-taking by lenders.
Banks including JPMorgan shut proprietary trading desks after
the U.S. Congress approved the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, which
restricts lenders from using their own capital to make bets on
stocks and bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a gap that we can capitalize on&#8221; with banks
moving away from proprietary trading, Angelone said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amagis will begin trading May 1 with $35 million from six
investors, Angelone said. The firm, which plans to open an
office in Monaco, seeks to manage $100 million by the end of
2014 and $500 million in three years., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deepak Gulati, a former head of global equity proprietary
trading at JPMorgan, begin investing at his hedge-fund firm last
June after raising about $300 million. Argentiere Capital AG,
based in Zug, Switzerland, focuses on volatility trades, betting
on the rate at which stocks rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) said
it will file an immediate appeal when the final judgment is
entered in its patent dispute with Carnegie Mellon University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hamilton, Bermuda-based chipmaker made the statement
after a federal judge in Pittsburgh on March 31 added another
$367 million to the damages Marvell must pay the school for
patent infringement. That ruling brought total damages to more
than $1.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge did reject the school&#8217;s request for double or
triple damages, saying the company wasn&#8217;t sufficiently
capitalized to withstand such a penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Carnegie Mellon University v. Marvell
Technology Group Ltd., 09-cv-00290, U.S. District Court, Western
District of Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple-Samsung Jury Is Seated in $2 Billion Patent Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s and Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)&#8217;s opening
arguments in a $2 billion trial over smartphone technology were
heard by a jury that includes a retired International Business
Machines Corp. software systems manager, a medical billing
administrator and a community service officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury was chosen March 31 in the same San Jose,
California, courtroom where jurors two years ago found that
Samsung infringed Apple&#8217;s patents and awarded $1.05 billion in
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 12-cv-00630, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patent &#8216;Troll&#8217; Dig Gets Congress to Ponder What&#8217;s in a Name &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes &#8220;patent trolls,&#8221; even if they&#8217;re not quite
sure what they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a term without clear definition and yet it&#8217;s being
used to push Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court right now to
curb abusive litigation without damaging a centuries-old system
designed to promote advances in science and industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers and companies like Google Inc. (GOOG) say they are too
often targets of lawsuits and have taken out newspaper and radio
advertisements deriding &#8220;trolls.&#8221; Companies like 3M Co. (MMM), Eli
Lilly  Co. and General Electric Co. (GE) warn that proposals to
limit litigation could go too far and damage a part of the
economy that the Commerce Department says generated 5.3 percent
of U.S. gross domestic product in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase &#8220;patent troll&#8221; originated with Intel Corp.,
which was sued for libel in 1999 after its spokesman, Chuck
Mulloy, called a firm that had sued the chipmaker a &#8220;patent
extortionist&#8221; in the Wall Street Journal. A group of company
lawyers came up with the replacement phrase, Mulloy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel executives have said over the years the term refers
to anyone who stands under the bridge of progress exacting a
toll on those who try to cross, a reference to the Three Billy
Goats Gruff fairy tale. One of the lawyers who came up with the
name, Peter Detkin, now works for Bellevue, Washington&#8217;s
Intellectual Ventures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disney Tells U.S. It May Oppose &#8216;DeadMau5&#8217; Mark Issuance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), holder of the Mickey Mouse trademarks,
told the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office it may try to block
issuance of a trademark to DeadMau5, a performer who wears a
mouse head mask with crossed-out eyes, according to the
Hollywood Reporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel Zimmerman, who performs as DeadMau5, filed the
application in the name of his Ronica Holdings Ltd. and said he
plans to use the mark -- a mouse-head caricature -- on products
including food and BMX bikes and in entertainment, the newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;False Assignment Papers Don&#8217;t Bar Settlement Pay, Court Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal magistrate judge overstepped his authority in a
copyright-infringement case by ordering the repayment of money
received in settlement from various plaintiffs, a Minnesota
court ruled March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling came in a case involving alleged unauthorized
film downloading. A California court found that the copyright
assignment documents used in both courts were fraudulent. The
magistrate then ordered the law firm representing the plaintiff
-- a maker of adult films -- to repay money received in the
settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal court in Minnesota said the submission of the
assignment documents -- &#8220;legitimate or not, authorized or not&#8221;
-- didn&#8217;t amount to a fraud on the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are AF Holdings LLC v. Doe, 12-cv-01445, 12-cv-01446, 12-cv-01447, 12-cv-01448 and 12-cv-01449, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;The Kardashian family, described in court papers as &#8220;among
the most famous, recognizable and widely viewed public figures
today,&#8221; asked a federal judge to seal documents relating to the
family&#8217;s licensing agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family is involved in a 2012 trademark dispute with Lee
Tillett, a Florida makeup artist, over its use of &#8220;Khroma.&#8221;
Releasing the details of various licensing deals &#8220;could be used
by other prospective licensors and competitors of the
Kardashians, to their advantage,&#8221; the family said in a March 26
court filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nordea Bank AB (NDA) jumped to the top of
the Nordic region&#8217;s bond underwriter rankings in the first
quarter as the lender helped companies such as Telenor ASA sell
cross-border deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Nordic bank underwrote $6.3 billion in bonds,
boosting its market share by 5 percentage points from a year
earlier to 12.7 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. SEB AB rose to second spot from fourth, grabbing 8
percent of the market through $3.9 billion in deals. The figures
include corporate and financial issuance and exclude public-sector bonds and financing on their own behalf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen increasing willingness by Nordic corporates to
consider issuance in Nordic currencies other than their own,&#8221;
Thomas Begley, Nordea&#8217;s head of fixed income in Helsinki, said
in a phone interview last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norwegian companies led the way in the period in selling
bonds outside their home market, targeting Swedish investors
hungry for yield. Cross-border deals helped Nordea withstand a
broader decline in debt sales in the first quarter as issuance,

benchmark is 1.5 percent, delayed a plan to raise borrowing
costs by at least a year to the summer of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is looking to sell its New York Stock Exchange market-making unit to a Dutch investment firm, as computers replace traders who once dominated the business at the corner of Wall and Broad streets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IMC Financial Markets is negotiating to buy the floor-trading business, according to two people familiar with the matter, who asked for anonymity because talks are private. Goldman Sachs is seeking as much as $30 million, one person said. The investment bank, which joined the NYSE in 1896, bought the operations in 2000 as part of a $5.4 billion purchase of Spear, Leeds  Kellogg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The NYSE&#8217;s huddles of traders have been shrinking for years as more transactions are handled electronically, making humans less integral. Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. pledged to preserve the trading floor in lower Manhattan when it agreed to buy the exchange in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The business has evolved away from humans on the exchange,&#8221; said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Group Inc. &#8220;Only a fraction is being done on the floor with humans versus how much is being done electronically.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IMC, which stands for International Marketmakers Combination, is a high-frequency trading firm and asset manager founded in Amsterdam in 1989. It has offices in Chicago and New York, and conducts transactions on more than 90 exchanges around the world, according to its website. Remco Lenterman, an IMC managing director, and Tiffany Galvin of New York-based Goldman Sachs said their companies don&#8217;t comment on speculation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $24.1
million of notes tied to the Indian rupee, the largest such
offering since November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one-year securities, issued March 28, yield a maximum
of 16.3 percent if called after 12 months, according to a
prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. If the Indian currency strengthens at all or
depreciates no more than 1.5 percent by quarterly intervals, the
bank will automatically redeem the notes. Investors suffer
losses if the rupee drops more than 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Asian country&#8217;s currency gained 3.1 percent to
59.89 per U.S. dollar during the first three months of the year,
its biggest quarterly advance since September 2012. The currency
strengthened because India raised interest rates and changed
regulations to make it easier for foreigners to invest there,
said Win Thin, global head of emerging-market strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman  Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;India hiked rates, delivering several hawkish surprises
last year,&#8221; Thin said in a telephone interview. The rupee could
strengthen to around 58 per dollar in about three months, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee reached an eight-month high on March 28. It&#8217;s the
third-best performing emerging-market currency against the
greenback, advancing 2.7 percent this year as of 5:48 p.m. in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign investors have bought $11.1 billion of Indian
stocks and bonds this year through April 2, the most among eight
Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rates Rise &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India kept its benchmark repurchase
rate unchanged at 8 percent at an April 1 review after lifting
it 0.75 percentage point since September to counter price gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York, didn&#8217;t
respond to messages seeking comment about the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. sold $50 million of six-month notes linked
to the rupee on November 12, 2010, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts with
values derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will move its San
Francisco offices to the city&#8217;s largest tower as it relocates to
the heart of the financial district from the technology-heavy
South of Market area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest software maker will move in December to
Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)&#8217;s 555 California St., San Francisco&#8217;s
largest building by square footage and second-tallest, said
Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft. He wouldn&#8217;t comment further on the relocation plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco is the &#8220;center of the U.S. new economy&#8221;
after four years of sustained rent growth, according to
property-research firm Green Street Advisors Inc. Office rents
rose 6.8 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier to
$57.21 a square foot on average, with vacancies little changed
at 11.3 percent, brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL) said. Asking
rents have climbed 70 percent since 2010, when rates bottomed at
$33.57 a square foot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft had the ability to go anywhere in the city,&#8221;
David Greenbaum, president of Vornado&#8217;s New York office
division, said today in a telephone interview. The 555
California building is &#8220;incredibly iconic both in San Francisco
and the country.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will occupy about 50,000 square feet (4,600
square meters) on the second and third floors, said a person
with knowledge of the plans. Rent will be about $62 a square
foot for the two floors, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the details are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Street View &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenbaum declined to comment on financial terms. He said
the tower&#8217;s second floor has 27-foot (8-meter) ceilings,
allowing Microsoft to establish a unique presence visible from
the street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking rates in San Francisco&#8217;s north financial district
averaged $58 a square foot in the first quarter, up 7.8 percent
from a year earlier, according to Jones Lang LaSalle.
Microsoft&#8217;s Yammer Inc. unit, with 76,000 square feet in Twitter
Inc.&#8217;s headquarters building in the Central Market area, won&#8217;t
be affected by the parent company&#8217;s move, the person with
knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 52-story tower between Montgomery and Kearny streets
has 1.5 million square feet of office space and 45,000 square
feet of retail, according to Vornado&#8217;s website. At 779 feet, the
building is surpassed in San Francisco only by the 853-foot
Transamerica Pyramid, according to property website Emporis.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Street high-rise, opened in 1969, is the
main building in a complex that was known as Bank of America
Center before the financial company moved to Charlotte, North
Carolina. The skyscraper was featured in the 1974 disaster film
&#8220;The Towering Inferno,&#8221; according to Emporis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft currently occupies space at Westfield Group (WDC)&#8217;s San
Francisco Centre, the city&#8217;s biggest mall. The property, at
Market and Fifth streets, is between the Union Square shopping
district and the SOMA area, where companies including Google
Inc. and Salesforce.com Inc. have offices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. lender, agreed to sell its large-market 401(k)
recordkeeping business to a division of Canadian life insurer
Great-West Lifeco (GWO) Inc. Terms of the transaction weren&#8217;t
disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal will make Great-West the second-largest
recordkeeper of 401(k)-type retirement plans by participants,
serving 6.8 million workers with a combined $387 billion in
assets, the company said today in a statement from Winnipeg,
Canada. The largest provider of retirement recordkeeping
services, which include sending out account statements and other
communications to participants, is Boston-based Fidelity
Investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose recordkeeping business lags behind those of
firms such as Fidelity, Vanguard Group Inc. and Prudential
Financial Inc., is selling its unit as recordkeeping for
workers&#8217; retirement accounts has become less lucrative for firms
that don&#8217;t have scale. The deal will catapult Great-West from
the seventh-largest recordkeeper of 401(k)-type plans by assets
in 2012, according to research firm Cerulli Associates, allowing
it to compete with the biggest firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bringing together these platforms allows us to be a
market leader,&#8221; said Robert Reynolds, who was named last month
as president and chief executive officer of Great-West Lifeco
U.S., which owns Great-West Financial and Putnam Investments.
&#8220;You can make money in this business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Top Priorities&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale is a shift for New York-based JPMorgan, whose head
of retirement, Michael Falcon, said in March 2011 that getting a
bigger share of retirement assets was &#8220;one of the top
priorities&#8221; at the bank. JPMorgan at the time had roughly
doubled its sales force dedicated to retirement plans including
pitches for its recordkeeping services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not easy to see anything like this,&#8221; Falcon, head
of retirement at JPMorgan&#8217;s asset-management unit, said in an
interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will continue to sell investments to retirement
plans, Falcon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a large and growing business on the investment
side,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans held $23 trillion in retirement assets as of Dec.
31, of which $4.2 trillion was in 401(k) plans. Administrators
of 401(k)s are paid for their recordkeeping service also may
make money from investments in the plan if they are managed by
their own firm or through arrangements with other money managers
known as revenue-sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cross-Selling &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many recordkeepers also see the administration of 401(k)
accounts as an avenue for cross-selling other products to
workers such as individual retirement accounts when they retire
or change jobs. Those accounts usually have higher fees,
according to a 2011 report by the Government Accountability
Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of lower-fee products and more cost-conscious employers have contributed to declining expenses for
401(k) investments over the past 15 years, data compiled by the
Washington-based Investment Company Institute show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction is expected to close during the third
quarter of this year pending regulatory approval. More than
1,000 employees of JPMorgan&#8217;s retirement-services unit will move
to Great-West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal won&#8217;t &#8220;have a material impact on JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s
earnings, according to the bank&#8217;s statement. The two companies
said workers with accounts administered by JPMorgan should
expect no disruption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto Co. (MON) may attract an activist
investor after its shares underperformed since a breakup of the
world&#8217;s largest seed company may create more value for
investors, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think there is a reasonable possibility of an activist
appearance at Monsanto, although we have neither intimations nor
knowledge of any activist intentions,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts led by
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas said today in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsanto could explore the sale of its Agricultural
Productivity segment, which makes Roundup herbicide, said
Zekauskas, who raised his rating on the stock to buy from hold.
The St. Louis-based company could also take on $11 billion in
debt to buy back shares, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activist shareholders have already targeted Monsanto&#8217;s two
largest U.S. competitors in the past year. Daniel Loeb&#8217;s Third
Point LLC has called for a breakup of Dow Chemical Co., which
produces genetically modified seeds as well as petrochemicals.
DuPont Co., another chemicals-and-seeds conglomerate, is
spinning off its titanium-dioxide business after Nelson Peltz&#8217;s
Trian Fund Management LP amassed a stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one at Monsanto could immediately be reached for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsanto rose 1.6 percent to $116.30 at 8:47 a.m. before
the start of regular trading in New York. It gained 9.5 percent
in the year through yesterday while the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index climbed 22 percent. Monsanto yesterday posted fiscal
second-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is unfreezing a
money transfer from a Russian embassy in Central Asia to an
insurer linked to U.S.-sanctioned bank after getting a go-ahead
from regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Following consultation with our regulators, we are
processing this transaction,&#8221; JPMorgan said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reversal comes two days after Russia&#8217;s Foreign Ministry
decried the move by the biggest U.S. bank blocking a payment
from its embassy in Astana, Kazakhstan, to Sogaz Insurance Group
as &#8220;illegal and absurd.&#8221; Sogaz is part-owned by OAO Bank
Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based lender under U.S. sanctions
relating to the Ukraine crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barack Obama announced the action against
Bank Rossiya last month as part of a broadening of sanctions
that targeted government officials and allies of Russian
President Vladimir Putin, whose associates own Bank Rossiya. The
embassy&#8217;s transaction was for less than $5,000, a person with
knowledge of the dispute said, asking not to be identified
because such transfers aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Ministry said &#8220;the hostile action&#8221; by
JPMorgan bank was &#8220;a grossest violation of international law,&#8221;
according to its April 1 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bank Rossiya unit reduced its stake in Sogaz to 48.5
percent from 51 percent on March 11, according to a regulatory
disclosure on the insurer&#8217;s website. The U.S. added Bank Rossiya
and its billionaire shareholder Yury Kovalchuk to an extended
sanctions list on March 20 following Russia&#8217;s annexation of
Crimea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s Finance Ministry picked JPMorgan last year to help
improve the country&#8217;s standing among U.S. credit-rating firms.
The bank was also short-listed to advise on the government&#8217;s
privatization program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As with all U.S. financial institutions that operate
globally, we are subject to specific regulatory requirements,&#8221;
New York-based JPMorgan said in an April 1 statement. &#8220;We will
continue to seek guidance from the U.S. government on
implementing their recent sanctions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd. (LNVGY) must convince
government officials that buying a server unit from
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) won&#8217;t give China back-door
access to U.S. secrets and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wrinkle is that the Pentagon, the FBI and the nation&#8217;s
biggest telecommunications companies buy the IBM servers,
according to people familiar with the matter and an analysis by
Bloomberg Industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of the servers by the government, telephone networks
and other potentially sensitive customers will spark close
scrutiny from the interagency group known as the Committee on
Foreign Investment in the U.S., which investigates national-security risks of foreign acquisitions of domestic companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of the perfect storm of issues,&#8221; said Anne
Salladin, a former Treasury Department official who worked on
CFIUS reviews and is now at Stroock  Stroock  Lavan LLP in
Washington. &#8220;Any foreign acquirer with this kind of asset
purchase is very likely to be something that CFIUS would want to
take a look at.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing-based Lenovo (992), which announced the $2.3 billion IBM
purchase Jan. 23, has formally sought approval for the deal from
CFIUS, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Acquisitions of U.S. businesses by Chinese buyers are rising,
increasing tension in Washington over Chinese access to U.S.
technology. CFIUS reviews can take as many as 75 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Briefing Officials &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo fell 1 percent to close at HK$8.91 in Hong Kong. The
stock has lost 5.5 percent this year after advancing 34 percent
in 2013. IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $191.77 at the
close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo, which bought IBM&#8217;s personal computer business in
2005, has been briefing officials on the deal, pointing out that
it won&#8217;t have access to the servers because IBM will continue
maintenance on the equipment, according to a person familiar
with the matter. That agreement lasts for five years and could
be extended, said the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service agreement may help ease the security review by
CFIUS, which examined more than double the number of
transactions by Chinese investors in 2012 than it did the
previous year, making them the most scrutinized foreign buyers
of American assets ahead of the U.K., according to the
committee&#8217;s most recent report to Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breakup Fee &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government is going to take a look at the degree of
penetration of&#160;the servers, where they are, how old they are,
what&#160;the&#160;reach-back capability might be,&#8221; Mario Mancuso, an
attorney at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver  Jacobson LLP.
&#8220;Could they use the servers as a means of insertion&#160;into U.S.
government networks and&#160;data systems?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo agreed to pay a fee that&#8217;s more than double the
typical size should it fail to aquire IBM&#8217;s low-end server unit,
people familiar with the matter said in January. The breakup
charge of about $200 million, according to one of the people,
highlights the risk the Chinese company has chosen to bear for
its largest-ever purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials will also examine any use of the servers in
critical infrastructure, such as chemical plants and electric-utility companies, Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China
Economic and Security Review Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exfiltration and infiltration are the issues,&#8221; Wessel
said. &#8220;Can they get access to servers in some way and take data
out or can they infiltrate the system to put in trap doors,
viruses, malware or be able to take down systems in a potential
conflict situation?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contract Data &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bloomberg Industries analysis of federal contract data
shows government purchasers of IBM BladeCenter servers include
the Pentagon, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Padilla, the company&#8217;s vice president for
governmental programs, told Bloomberg in January that IBM
servers are used by the U.S. government, without identifying
which agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Damien Pickart, a spokesman
for the Pentagon, acknowledged that the Lenovo-IBM transaction
is pending before CFIUS and added that the Defense Department,
which is a member of the committee, would be involved in the
deliberations. He declined to comment further and referred
questions to Treasury, which chairs the committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Telephone Networks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holly Shulman, a CFIUS spokeswoman, declined to comment.
Spokesmen for the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security
didn&#8217;t respond to requests seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The servers are also embedded in telephone networks
operated by ATT Inc. (T), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Sprint
Corp., according to three people familiar with the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM spokeswoman Deirdre Murphy Ramsey declined to comment
on the Armonk, New York-based company&#8217;s clients. IBM is prepared
for a &#8220;comprehensive review&#8221; by CFIUS and is &#8220;confident of a
positive outcome,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Siegel, an ATT spokesman, Richard Young, a Verizon
spokesman, and John Taylor, a Sprint spokesman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers and the Obama administration have tried to
prevent China&#8217;s Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. from doing
business in the U.S. A 2012 report by the House Intelligence
Committee cited security threats posed by Chinese
telecommunications companies and urged the government to block
transactions by Huawei and ZTE. The companies provide &#8220;a wealth
of opportunities&#8221; for Chinese intelligence agencies to insert
malicious hardware or software into U.S. telecommunications
networks, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Deep Concerns&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke expressed &#8220;deep
concerns&#8221; to Sprint in 2010 that Huawei might win a contract to
upgrade the mobile-phone carrier&#8217;s network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anything now with China gets attention,&#8221; said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies. &#8220;But Lenovo, because it&#8217;s not a state-owned enterprise and because they&#8217;ve done deals successfully in
the past, they&#8217;re really well placed to get through.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo would get IBM servers that use x86 processors, an
industry-standard technology. The transaction includes
BladeCenter and Flex System blade-style servers -- slim devices
that slide into racks -- along with switches that run corporate
computer networks. IBM will keep its System z mainframes, Power
servers and other higher-end hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Working Cooperatively &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo is working cooperatively with CFIUS to win
clearance, spokesman Brion Tingler said in a statement. The
company has had three previous acquisitions cleared by the
committee, including the 2005 IBM deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the companies say they expect to win clearance from
CFIUS, Lenovo will probably have to agree to restrictions on the
business, according to lawyers who advise companies on deals
that require U.S. security review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those agreements can include requirements that only U.S.
citizens handle certain services, independent audits, guidelines
for handling government contracts, and termination of certain
business activities, according to CFIUS&#8217;s most recent report to
Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not just some Chinese company you&#8217;ve never heard
of,&#8221; said Stephen Paul Mahinka, a lawyer at Morgan, Lewis 
Bockius LLP. &#8220;There are ways in which you can protect U.S.
interests while at the same time not preventing the
acquisition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While servers can store large collections of sensitive
data, the risks associated with them are about the same as that
from laptops and smartphones, which consume the same data and
have access to the servers, said Michael Belton, a security
expert at cybersecurity company Rapid7. Once installed in a
network, servers are also more heavily defended and monitored,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a large difference between a server and a
laptop,&#8221; Belton said. &#8220;Modern laptops can and do store as much
sensitive data as a server.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leon Black, who made billions by
buying up debt of companies in the U.S. and Europe that others
deemed worthless, is turning to emerging markets as the next
source of growth for his $161 billion money management firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo Global Management LLC (APO), the private equity and
distressed debt specialist co-founded by Black, is starting a
unit to primarily buy investment-grade and high-yield corporate
debt from Latin America and Asia, according to Tolga Uzuner, the
41-year-old heading the group. The New York-based firm will also
invest in infrastructure, project financing and special
situations, said Uzuner, a former managing director in the
London branch of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s chief investment office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo and firms such as Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK) that
have largely focused on developed-market credit, are turning to
emerging markets, where the amount of corporate debt outstanding
tripled to $1.1 trillion over the past five years, according to
data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For Apollo, which
increased its credit business to more than $100 billion in
assets from $4 billion seven years ago by scooping up everything
from distressed assets to leveraged loans, this is one of the
largest untapped frontiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was a strategic decision that this was an asset
class that has the potential to move the needle at Apollo,&#8221;
said Uzuner. &#8220;A lot of the credit-underwriting skills and
requirements for emerging markets are similar to those in the
firm&#8217;s other areas of focus.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Background &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be the first time Apollo has created funds
dedicated to developing countries, though some investments were
previously made from buyout and credit funds, said Uzuner, who
Apollo recruited in October as he was looking to raise money for
his own hedge-fund firm, Brocade Capital Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uzuner left JPMorgan last year, where his duties included
investing the bank&#8217;s excess cash in high-quality emerging market
corporate debt. The investment office was at the center of the
London Whale trading strategy that caused a $6.2 billion trading
loss for the New York-based bank. JPMorgan has said it will fold
the operation into its Treasury unit, according to an internal
memo obtained yesterday by Bloomberg. Uzuner, who also worked at
Bankers Trust and Credit Suisse Group AG, wasn&#8217;t involved in the
trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve triggered a pullback from
emerging-markets in June, when the central bank signaled it
would reduce stimulus prompting international investors to pull
money out of assets considered more risky. The shift accelerated
as slowing economic growth in Brazil and China led to ratings
cuts and an increase in non-performing loans, with money only
recently returning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apollo Hires &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo also hired Stuart Firth, who worked at Brocade and
previously ran European distressed-debt trading at Credit
Suisse, and Richard Martin, founding partner of Longwood Credit
Partners LP. The firm plans to start multiple funds during the
next several years, said Uzuner, declining to comment on the
potential size of Apollo Emerging Markets LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo is expanding as some of the largest emerging
economies -- including Brazil --  decelerate, geopolitical
tensions escalate and corporate defaults increase, often in
countries where legal frameworks can heighten investment risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even places like Chile and Brazil, which are very highly
rated countries, have encountered a lot of defaults for a
variety of reasons, mainly failed government policies,&#8221; said
David Hinman, the chief investment officer of SW Asset
Management LLC, a Newport Beach, California, firm that invests
in emerging-market corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brazil Challenge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges in those markets were highlighted by one of
Carlyle Group LP&#8217;s first investments in Brazil. Real-estate
developer Urbplan Desenvolvimento Urbano SA, has been hit with
hundreds of lawsuits, in part for failing to complete home sites
across Brazil, according to court and regulatory filings.
Partners at the private equity firm have reached into their own
pockets to help rescue the investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar-based default rate on Latin American corporate
debt soared to 7.6 percent last year from 2.5 percent in 2012
and 0.8 percent in 2011, according to data from JPMorgan. Hinman
estimates there is about $50 billion of distressed debt now
available in the region, including some $3.6 billion of dollar-denominated debt issued by Eike Batista&#8217;s Oleo  Gas
Participacoes SA (OGXP3), the Rio de Janeiro-based energy company that
filed for bankruptcy protection in October. The average yield on
a JPMorgan index of emerging market corporate bonds rose to 6.1
percent in September from a low of 4.4 percent in January 2013.
The yield has since dropped to 5.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Headline Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a lot of unknowns and a lot of headline risk,&#8221;
said Ted Neild, chief investment officer of Gresham Partners
LLC, which manages almost $5 billion for some 80 family offices
and set up Gresham Emerging Markets Strategies LP to increase
its allocation to the sector. &#8220;But if we can get the right
companies at the right prices, we think there is a good long-term opportunity.&#8221; The Chicago-based firm will primarily invest
in stocks instead of bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York and Chicago-based
manager that oversees more than $1 billion of emerging-market
debt in separate accounts, anticipates continued pressure on the
sector. Still, it plans to increase the number of debt and
equity funds it devotes to developing economies. The firm is
adding capabilities as most other firms don&#8217;t commit new
resources, Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer for
Guggenheim Partners LLC, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oaktree Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small number of distressed debt specialists are joining
that bet. Oaktree has raised $842 million for emerging market
corporate debt and has about $1 billion under management in
emerging-market equities, the Los Angeles-based firm said in
February. Cerberus Capital Management LP, the New York-based
firm run by Stephen Feinberg, incorporated Cerberus South
American Investments LLC this year to make potential investments
in the region, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our emerging market debt strategy may well become one of
the most substantial parts of our business,&#8221; John Frank,
Oaktree&#8217;s managing principal, said on an earnings call in
February. The firm had $83.6 billion in assets under management
as of Dec. 31, a figure that has more than doubled since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo prides itself on being a contrarian. It got its
start from one of the best-known distressed debt opportunities
of the early 1990s, when the firm received financial backing
from the French bank Credit Lyonnais to bid on a portfolio of
junk bonds held by the insolvent Executive Life Insurance Co.
Black, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. banker, won the
auction with a bid of $3.25 billion, or about 50 cents on the
dollar, and ultimately reaped fees totaling as much as $350
million from the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year the firm exited its investment from
LyondellBasell Industries NV, capping a gain of more than $10
billion, the largest ever for a private-equity deal, after
buying debt in the chemicals maker at the height of the
financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo now oversees $161 billion, as of Dec. 31 and Black
has an estimated net worth of $6.2 billion, according to the
Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Apollo shares fell 2.5 percent to
$31 at the close in New York, paring the gain to 29 percent in
the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s clearly a large market opportunity,&#8221; Uzuner said.
&#8220;Emerging markets is deemed an asset class that has size, depth
and breadth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein a $6 million cash
bonus to be paid out in three years if he meets certain targets,
on top of $23 million in 2013 compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award can shrink or grow depending on whether the firm
achieves return-on-equity and book-value targets, the New York-based bank said today in a filing. The long-term incentive was
$5 million last year and $3 million in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 59, was the highest-paid CEO among peers at the
largest U.S. banks for a second straight year. Goldman Sachs had
an 11 percent return on equity in 2013, topping its largest Wall
Street rivals, as it cut compensation costs amid revenue that
was little changed. The stock rose 39 percent last year, beating
the 33 percent gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials
Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, which already
gives a majority of top executives&#8217; pay in restricted stock,
have been seeking ways to encourage managers to focus on long-term performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of Blankfein&#8217;s pay were contained in the bank&#8217;s
proxy statement for its annual shareholders&#8217; meeting, which will
be held on May 16 in Irving, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein&#8217;s total compensation package of $29 million
topped the $20 million given to JPMorgan Chase  Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, 58, and the $18 million for Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, 55. Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian T. Moynihan, 54,
received $14 million and Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Michael Corbat, 53,
got $14.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TCL Multimedia Technology Holdings
Ltd. (1070) will make a game console in China after the nation lifted a
14-year ban on the devices, challenging competitors including
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and ZTE Corp. (000063) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCL Multimedia&#8217;s T2 game player features a joystick that&#8217;s
compatible with mobile games for Google Inc.&#8217;s Android system so
they can be played on any TV, the Hong Kong-based company said
in a statement. The video-game industry in China will generate
about $10 billion in 2015 revenue, according to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities reversed course in January on a
nationwide ban on video-game consoles that was implemented in
2000 to protect youths from perceived corrupting influence.
Microsoft and the potential China market entry of devices from
Sony Corp. or Nintendo Co. will pose a challenge for TCL, said
Christopher Tse, a Hong Kong-based analyst at RHB Research
Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It does not have the content base to draw gamers from the
Xbox and Playstation crowd,&#8221; Tse said of TCL&#8217;s device. &#8220;Even
though it has secured exclusive titles from Gameloft, I think
stronger titles are needed to kick start the platform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCL Multimedia shares rose 2.6 percent to close at HK$3.16
in Hong Kong trading today. They have lost 12 percent so far
this year, compared with a 3.4 percent drop in the benchmark
Hang Seng Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft, ZTE &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZTE, China&#8217;s second-biggest maker of phone-network
equipment, announced a venture last month with online game
developer The9 Ltd. (NCTY) to make a gaming console called the Fun Box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the lifting of China&#8217;s console ban,
Microsoft and BesTV New Media Co., a subsidiary of Shanghai
Media Group, formed a $79 million gaming venture in September.
Microsoft didn&#8217;t say whether the venture would offer its Xbox
console or a new device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCL Multimedia is one of three listed subsidiaries of TCL
Corp. (000100), China&#8217;s largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, which
was founded in 1981. TCL will make the console hardware, to be
sold exclusively through JD.com Inc. Gameloft SE (GFT) will provide
games, while China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (762) will help develop and
operate a dual-screen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to its game console, TCL also announced a
series of TCL &#8220;Game TVs,&#8221; with six models featuring panels
sized from 40 inches to 65 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest pension fund
overhauled its Japanese stock strategy, adding new managers and
investment styles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 128.6 trillion yen ($1.24 trillion) Government Pension
Investment Fund will reduce passive investments based on the
Topix index and add the JPX-Nikkei 400 Index among new
benchmarks, the fund said today in a statement. Traditional
active investments will be trimmed to make room for smart-beta
strategies, according to GPIF. The JPX-Nikkei 400, a stock gauge
that is the brainchild of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
started in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;GPIF is changing in several ways, or at least I sense
their will to change,&#8221; said Kazuyuki Terao, Tokyo-based chief
investment officer at Allianz Global Investors Japan Co. &#8220;JPX-Nikkei 400 is designed to encourage investment in stocks with
high return on equity, which aims to change corporate governance
using the power of the market. Plus, they&#8217;re trying to boost
returns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy changes come amid pressure on GPIF, which has
more than half its assets in Japanese bonds, to achieve higher
returns to cover pension payouts for an aging population. A
panel handpicked by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last year
recommended that the fund move beyond passive stock investments
using the Topix as a benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPIF selected 14 active and 10 passive investment managers,
eight of which had existing mandates from the fund, according to
today&#8217;s statement. It also said it will make passive and active
investments in Japanese real-estate investment trusts. The fund
will introduce a performance-based fee structure for active
managers, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smart Beta &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart beta occupies a middle ground between passive funds
and active management. Designers of the benchmarks used in the
strategy build their own indexes or change existing ones, trying
to boost returns by ranking companies not by price, but by
measures such as volatility and dividend payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPIF&#8217;s three smart-beta managers will include Goldman Sachs
Asset Management Co., according to today&#8217;s announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset&#8217;s benchmark is the SP GIVI Japan
index, which weights stocks based on their &#8220;intrinsic value&#8221;
calculated by assessing the value of each company&#8217;s assets and
their forecast earnings growth, according to the website of SP
Dow Jones Indices LLC, which created the gauge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPIF said it named Diam Co., Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank
Ltd. and Mitsubishi UFJ Trust  Banking Corp. to oversee passive
JPX-Nikkei 400 investments, with BlackRock Japan Co. using the
MSCI Japan Index and Mizuho Trust  Banking Co. investing based
on the Russell Nomura Prime Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All shares were generally bought together in the past,
but that&#8217;s going to change, with some being chosen and others
not,&#8221; Allianz&#8217;s Terao said. &#8220;The government is trying to use
that to improve corporate governance and profitability. I hope
that&#8217;ll help improve Japan&#8217;s financial markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will probably
join Morgan Stanley (MS) as global coordinator on the initial public
offering of Emaar Properties PJSC&#8217;s (EMAAR) shopping malls and retail
business, three people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks were informally hired, though no documents have
yet been signed, said the people, who asked not to be named
because the information is private. Emaar is also appointing
lead managers for the sale, the people said. An official at
Emaar who didn&#8217;t want to be identified said no advisers have
been appointed. Spokesmen for JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emaar, developer of the world&#8217;s tallest tower in Dubai,
hired Morgan Stanley to advise on what will be the largest share
sale in the Middle East and Africa since 2008, Chairman Mohamed Alabbar said in a March 18 interview. The company plans to raise
8 billion dirhams ($2.2 billion) to 9 billion dirhams from the
sale as a tourism boom adds to retail sales in Dubai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle Eastern companies are taking advantage of rebounding
stock markets and asset prices to raise funds through IPOs and
secondary offerings. Emirates Reit, the United Arab Emirates&#8217;
first real-estate investment trust, said last week it increased
its share sale to $175 million to accommodate investor demand
for Dubai&#8217;s first IPO for at least five years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimental breast cancer drugs from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) slowed or halted growth of advanced tumors in studies, potentially adding a new treatment option for patients and top-selling therapies for the companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s palbociclib doubled to 20.2 months the time in which patients&#8217; advanced breast cancer didn&#8217;t progress, the drugmaker said today. In an unrelated study, Lilly&#8217;s drug, bemaciclib, aided 61 percent of patients with metastatic, hormone-sensitive breast cancer, meaning the size of their tumors shrunk by 30 percent or didn&#8217;t increase for 24 weeks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors and investors have been awaiting results for the medicines, part of a class called cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors. The therapies offer a new treatment avenue for about 80 percent of patients whose breast tumors are hormone receptor-positive. Palbociclib is projected to sell $3.11 billion in 2020 as it expands to fight other cancers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We took a new drug and asked how it works in a specific set of breast cancers based on science,&#8221; said Richard Finn, an associate professor at the University of California at Los Angeles&#8217;s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, and co-principal investigator of Pfizer&#8217;s study. &#8220;This is really the type of benefit we&#8217;re aiming for, and it&#8217;s the type of benefit that results from a rational development program.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government Pension Investment
Fund revamped its 22.1 trillion yen ($214 billion) Japanese
stock portfolio, adding new managers and investment styles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest pension fund will reduce passive
investments that track the Topix index and add the JPX-Nikkei
400 Index among new benchmarks, according to an April 4
statement. Traditional active investments will be trimmed to
make room for smart-beta strategies, GPIF said. The JPX-Nikkei
400, a stock gauge that is the brainchild of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, started in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We aimed for an overhaul that would show just what kind
of stock investment GPIF is targeting,&#8221; Tokihiko Shimizu,
director of general of the research department at GPIF, said
April 4. &#8220;We made bold changes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new strategy comes amid pressure on GPIF, which has
more than half its 128.6 trillion yen of assets in Japanese

eight of which had existing mandates from the fund, according to
last week&#8217;s statement. It also said it will make passive and
active investments in Japanese real-estate investment trusts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund will introduce a performance-based fee structure
for active managers, it said. GPIF paid fees to domestic stock
managers equating to 0.04 percent of the assets they oversaw in
the year ended March 31, 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smart Beta &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart beta occupies a middle ground between passive funds
and active management. Designers of the benchmarks used in the
strategy build their own indexes or change existing ones, trying
to boost returns by ranking companies not by price, but by
measures such as volatility and dividend payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPIF&#8217;s three smart-beta managers will include Goldman Sachs
Asset Management Co., according to last week&#8217;s announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset&#8217;s benchmark is the SP GIVI Japan
index, which weights stocks based on their &#8220;intrinsic value&#8221;
calculated by assessing the value of each company&#8217;s assets and
their forecast earnings growth, according to the website of SP
Dow Jones Indices LLC, which created the gauge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPIF said it named Diam Co., Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank
Ltd. and Mitsubishi UFJ Trust  Banking Corp. to oversee passive
JPX-Nikkei 400 investments, with BlackRock Japan Co. using the
MSCI Japan Index and Mizuho Trust  Banking Co. investing based
on the Russell Nomura Prime Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shares Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPX-Nikkei 400 slid 6.3 percent this year through last
week, compared with a 6.6 percent decline for the 1,780 member
Topix and 7.5 percent for the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All shares were generally bought together in the past,
but that&#8217;s going to change, with some being chosen and others
not,&#8221; Allianz&#8217;s Terao said. &#8220;The government is trying to use
that to improve corporate governance and profitability. I hope
that&#8217;ll help improve Japan&#8217;s financial markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 1 (Bloomberg) -- Author Michael Lewis&#8217;s argument that

Table &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 4 (Bloomberg) -- Companies powered the U.S. job

If I wasn&#8217;t, then why would I yell I am? You see, this be the
home of Spike Lee.  Folks think it&#8217;s dangerous -- I don&#8217;t know

steppin&#8217; down.  Cause certain neighborhoods they never put they
weapon down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
