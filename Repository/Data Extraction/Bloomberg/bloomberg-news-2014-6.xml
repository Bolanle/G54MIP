&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) named
Stephen Scherr as the firm&#8217;s chief strategy officer to replace
Andrew Chisholm, who&#8217;s retiring after 29 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scherr, 50, will remain head of Latin America in addition
to the new role, according to an internal memo today from Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary Cohn.
David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, confirmed
the memo&#8217;s contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein&#8217;s strategy since the financial crisis has been to
remain in the firm&#8217;s primary businesses even as some competitors
more aggressively exit areas of trading. While Goldman Sachs has
cut costs and assets, Blankfein has said he won&#8217;t risk missing
out on the opportunities of a rebound in trading activity for
short-term gains in profitability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs earned an 11 percent return on equity last
year, higher than peers while one-third of the returns it posted
before the financial crisis. Cohn said last month that the
current environment is &#8220;abnormal&#8221; and features trading clients
that are the least active in years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scherr&#8217;s role will include seeking opportunities for
revenue growth even if broader market conditions don&#8217;t improve
in the near term, said a person with direct knowledge of the
assignment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecuador agreed to transfer more than
half its gold reserves to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for three
years to give the government easier access to cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank said it will send 466,000 ounces of gold
to Goldman Sachs, worth about $580 million at current prices,
and get the same amount back three years from now. In return,
Ecuador will get &#8220;instruments of high security and liquidity&#8221;
and expects to earn a profit of $16 million to $20 million over
the term of the accord. The central bank didn&#8217;t detail
additional terms of the transactions, such as any fees or
financing costs paid to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal comes as the South American country&#8217;s government,
which defaulted on about $3.2 billion of bonds five years ago,
seeks to cover a budget deficit forecast by the Finance Ministry
to swell to a record $4.94 billion this year. President Rafael Correa said in April he also planned to sell about $700 million
of foreign debt this year in the country&#8217;s first international
bond sale since the 2008 and 2009 default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gold that was not generating any returns in vaults,
causing storage costs, now becomes a productive asset that will
generate profits,&#8221; the central bank said in the statement.
&#8220;These interventions in the gold market represent the beginning
of a new and permanent strategy of active participation by the
bank, through purchases, sales and financial operations, that
will contribute to the creation of new financial investment
opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reserves Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. Central Bank President Diego
Martinez didn&#8217;t respond to requests made through the bank&#8217;s
press office seeking more information on the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s gold reserves fell by $605 million, or 55
percent, to $493 million in the week ending May 23, according 
to a separate report on the central bank&#8217;s website. The bank, 
which was stripped of its autonomy in a 2008 constitutional
referendum, had about 845,000 troy ounces of gold as of April
14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman Sachs proposed a swap with Venezuela to
provide $1.68 billion in cash to be backed by $1.85 billion of
that country&#8217;s gold, documents obtained by Bloomberg News
showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, which wasn&#8217;t completed, would have carried an
interest rate of 7.5 percent plus the three-month London
interbank offered rate. Venezuela would have kept its exposure
to gold, with the nation posting the precious metal or cash to a
margin account if the price fell and Goldman Sachs posting U.S.
dollars if it rose, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuador&#8217;s deal with Goldman Sachs is a signal the central
bank is short on cash, Vicente Albornoz, the dean of the
Universidad de las Americas business school in Quito, said in a
telephone interview. The funds should help prop up government
spending this year needed to drive economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;About the only thing that&#8217;s clear is that they&#8217;re
converting part of their reserves into some sort of cash
equivalent,&#8221; Albornoz said. &#8220;If the government doesn&#8217;t find
funds to finance the deficit, it&#8217;ll have to cut spending.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to pay $325
million to settle a lawsuit brought by health-care benefit
providers who claimed the drugmaker marketed the epilepsy drug
Neurontin for unapproved uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, which needs approval from a federal judge
in Boston, would end a case over claims that the company&#8217;s
Parke-Davis unit schemed to market the drug for unapproved
conditions as early as 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord was disclosed in court papers filed May 30 in
Boston federal court, about six weeks after New York-based
Pfizer agreed to a $190 million settlement over Neurontin in a
separate case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boston accord will resolve &#8220;all third-party payer
claims regarding off-label promotion&#8221; and state antitrust
claims over Neurontin sales, Steve Danehy, a company spokesman,
said in a statement. Pfizer didn&#8217;t admit wrongdoing, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After more than ten years of hard-fought litigation, the
parties have reached a settlement that will bring this
litigation to a close,&#8221; lawyers for the benefit firms said in a
memorandum filed May 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies alleged that Parke-Davis, part of Warner-Lambert Co., paid kickbacks to doctors to encourage them to
prescribe the anti-seizure drug for unapproved uses such as
bipolar and panic disorders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert in 2000 and &#8220;deliberately
expanded the promotion of off-label uses,&#8221; lawyers for the
benefits firms said in an amended complaint filed in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unapproved Uses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies including Louisiana Blue Cross/Blue Shield sought
to recover &#8220;billions of dollars&#8221; they paid as a result of a
scheme to market and sell Neurontin &#8220;for a variety of uses for
which it is not approved or medically efficacious,&#8221; according
to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug is approved for the treatment of epilepsy and pain
from shingles or herpes zoster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the other settlement, disclosed in April, Pfizer agreed
to pay $190 million to end a suit over claims it violated U.S.
antitrust law by delaying generic versions of Neurontin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker delayed competition by &#8220;improperly listing
certain patents with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
engaging in illegal promotion and sales of Neurontin for
unapproved uses, filing and maintaining sham litigations with
respect to certain patents, and making misrepresentations to the
patent courts,&#8221; according to the 12-year-old lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketing case is In re Neurontin Marketing, Sales
Practices and Products Liability Litigation, 1:04-cv-10981, U.S.
District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). The
antitrust case is In re Neurontin Antitrust Litigation, 02-cv-1390, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KKR  Co. (KKR) is shutting its equity
hedge fund, about three years after hiring former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. proprietary trader Bob Howard to run it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have decided to close KKR Equity Strategies and return
capital to investors,&#8221; New York-based KKR said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;We would like to thank Bob Howard and the team for
their dedication to the firm and exceptional professionalism in
serving our clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $510 million KKR Equities Strategies fund, which was
started in August 2011, was liquidated last week, according to a
person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. The fund had less
than 20 outside clients who had $337 million invested, money
that will be returned starting this month, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howard is the latest former proprietary trader to leave an
investment bank and join the $2.7 trillion hedge-fund industry,
only to struggle with making money and attracting assets.
Pierre-Henri Flamand, who ran Goldman Sachs&#8217;s global
proprietary-trading unit before setting out on his own, shut his
hedge-fund firm in 2012 after two years because of losses and as
assets dwindled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howard&#8217;s fund gained about 15 percent since inception, the
person said. That compares with a 7.1 percent return from equity
hedge funds in the same period, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Alumni &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dozen employees who made up the KKR Equity Strategies
team were notified of the decision to shutter the fund on May
30, the person said. Most of them worked with Howard at Goldman
Sachs, where he ran the U.S. desk of its principal strategies
group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howard joined KKR in 2010 to start its first hedge fund.
KKR gave Howard, a partner at the firm, $100 million to start
the fund, according to marketing documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arvind Raghunathan, 50, the former head of Deutsche Bank
AG&#8217;s global arbitrage business who left with his team in 2009 to
start Roc Capital Management LP, shuttered that hedge fund last
year after losing money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portman Square Capital LLP, founded by ex-Citigroup Inc.
proprietary-trading unit head Sutesh Sharma, 51, last year
opened with about $100 million, less than a fifth of the amount
originally sought. CEO Andy Mack resigned this year and the firm
is reducing operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flamand closed his Edoma Partners LLC in November 2012, a
little more than two-and-a-half years after starting the hedge-fund firm. Man Group Plc said last month that Flamand will join
the company as a senior money manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;KKR Prisma &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR said it will be focusing on KKR Prisma, a unit that has
invested more than $10 billion in hedge funds, and the building
of strategic stakes and backing of the firms. Last year KKR
agreed to buy a 24.9 percent stake in Nephila Capital Ltd., a
Bermuda-based firm that makes reinsurance-related investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR said it will also concentrate on its credit hedge funds
that have about $800 million in assets. The firm last year
bought Avoca Capital to expand its European credit business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyout firms including Blackstone Group LP and Carlyle
Group LP have built hedge fund investment units to diversify
beyond private equity. Blackstone has grown its hedge fund
investing unit, Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, into
the world&#8217;s largest with $58 billion, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bidding war for Hillshire Brands
Co. (HSH) is proving costly for the Brazilian bankers at JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After firing Morgan Stanley from a bond sale, Sao Paulo-based JBS SA (JBSS3) pulled JPMorgan from a stock offering because the
two banks are helping Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) counter its bid for
Hillshire, two people familiar with the situation said, asking
not to be identified as the matter is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two investment banks are advising Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson in a $6.2 billion offer for the maker of Jimmy Dean
sausages that trumped a $5.6 billion proposal from JBS, the
world&#8217;s largest meat producer. The Brazilian company&#8217;s firing of
JPMorgan follows at least a dozen bond sales that the bank
helped manage for JBS since 2006 and a $6.3 billion takeover of
Bertin SA in 2009 where it acted as one of JBS&#8217;s advisers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tyson, the world&#8217;s No.2 meat producer, announced its bid
and said it hired the two New York-based banks two days after
JBS&#8217;s May 27 offer, saying JPMorgan is also likely to join
Morgan Stanley (MS) in providing bridge financing for the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah O&#8217;Callaghan, investor relations director for JBS,
declined to comment, as did Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman
for Morgan Stanley, andVeronica Navarro Espinosa, a spokeswoman
for JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is the No. 2 global deals adviser this year,
handling $394 billion of announced mergers and acquisitions and
trailing only Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan is fifth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan ranks second among underwriters of Latin American
dollar- and euro-denominated bonds in 2014, while Morgan Stanley
is 10th, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First IPO &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JBS is seeking regulatory approval to sell shares of its
JBS Foods SA unit in what would be Brazil&#8217;s first initial public
offering this year. Voting shares of the unit holding JBS&#8217;s
Brazilian pork, poultry and food-processing operations will be
listed in Brazil&#8217;s Novo Mercado subject to regulatory approval
and market conditions, it said in a May 20 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit was formed after JBS agreed to buy Seara food-processing assets from Marfrig Global Foods SA for 5.85 billion
reais ($2.6 billion) in June 2013. JBS hired units of JPMorgan
and Banco Bradesco for a 3 billion-real IPO of the unit, two
people with direct knowledge of the matter said in April. JBS
also hired Banco Itau BBA SA, Banco Santander SA, Grupo BTG
Pactual and Banco do Brasil SA to underwrite the share offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. was helping manage JBS&#8217;s planned $750
million bond sale, which the meatpacker has temporarily
withdrawn as it seeks a new leading coordinator, according to a
May 29 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reviewing Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of JBS rose 0.8 percent today to 7.56 reais as of
11:22 a.m. in Sao Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JBS has spent $17 billion on acquisitions in the past
decade to overtake Tyson in the meat industry. JBS&#8217;s Pilgrim&#8217;s
Pride Corp. unit offered $45 a share for Hillshire, compared
with Tyson&#8217;s $50 offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Tyson&#8217;s May 29 bid, Pilgrim&#8217;s is reviewing its
options, according to a person familiar with the matter. It&#8217;s
too early to say whether the company will raise its offer, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the
deliberations are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of Hillshire, potentially JBS&#8217;s largest
takeover since the acquisition of Bertin in 2009, would boost
the company&#8217;s debt levels to at least the highest in four years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Realty Capital Hospitality
Trust Inc. agreed to pay $1.93 billion for a group of hotels
that&#8217;s indirectly owned by funds managed by Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., creating one of the biggest hospitality-focused real
estate investment trusts in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is buying 126 hotels in 35 states operated by
brands including Holiday Inn, Hilton Garden Inn and Hyatt Place,
the New York-based company said in a statement today. The
properties, known as the Equity Inn portfolio, are the largest
ever acquisition by ARC Hospitality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the five largest U.S.-based global hotel operators
have raised revenue forecasts for the year as the strengthening
global economy has boosted demand for hotels. ARC Hospitality&#8217;s
purchase gives it access to hotels that offer limited food and
beverage services to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The select-service hotel segment offers tremendous value
given the economic recovery in the U.S., higher profit margins
and reduced operational risks,&#8221; ARC Hospitality Chairman
Nicholas Schorsch said in the statement. &#8220;Now is an opportune
time to acquire well-located, high-quality hotels in the upscale
and upper midscale tiers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter,
according to the statement. Realty Capital Securities LLC
advised ARC Hospitality while Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG
advised the sellers. The two banks will provide financing to ARC
Hospitality in connection with the purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new rule requiring U.S. companies to report information about their suppliers was designed to discourage them from doing business with mines controlled by armed thugs in Africa. But the conflict-mineral filings show a startling trend happening in another continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 1,277 U.S. companies that reported before yesterday''s deadline, 68 listed the Central Bank of the DPRK in their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. DPRK stands for the Democratic People''s Republic of Korea &#8212; as in North Korea, as in the country run by a 31-year-old dictator who had his uncle killed last year just to prove a point. The U.S. has had economic sanctions against North Korea since 1950, and the United Nations maintains sanctions of its own to deter further development of nuclear weapons there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claigan Environmental, a corporate-compliance firm, compiled the data showing dozens of companies listing North Korea''s central bank as a supplier and shared its findings with Bloomberg. International Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard were among those reporting that North Korea was in their supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In January, upon learning that the Central Bank of DPRK may be used by a small number of HP suppliers, we took immediate action to launch investigations," said Michael Thacker, a spokesman for HP. "To date, the information we have received indicates no minerals obtained from Central Bank of DPRK were included in HP products."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecuador, one of only eight countries
to adopt the U.S. dollar as its official currency, swapped gold
with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for liquid assets in a sign the
nation is short on cash, according to Loomis Sayles  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It does raise a red flag,&#8221; Bianca Taylor, a sovereign
analyst who helps oversee $210 billion at Loomis Sayles, said
yesterday in a phone interview from Boston. &#8220;Whenever a country
needs to sell or monetize its gold reserves, it&#8217;s definitely a
signal that the sovereign is strapped for cash.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Rafael Correa is stepping up his search for
financing at home and abroad after borrowing more than $11
billion from China since defaulting on $3.2 billion of foreign
debt five years ago. Ecuador&#8217;s use of the dollar means it can&#8217;t
finance deficits by printing money like other countries. Correa,
a self-described revolutionary socialist, is now planning to
raise about $700 million in an overseas bond sale this year and
agreed to allow the International Monetary Fund to perform an
economic review for the first time since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuador&#8217;s central bank, stripped of its autonomy in a
constitutional referendum a year after Correa took power in
2007, says it &#8220;invested&#8221; the gold with Goldman Sachs in return
for assets that can be liquidated within seven days. The country
will get the same quantity of gold back three years from now and
expects to earn a profit of $16 million to $20 million from the
deal, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Productive Asset &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation didn&#8217;t imply any payment of financing costs
by the central bank to Goldman Sachs, the bank said today in an
e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. The central
bank said it also doesn&#8217;t need the liquidity to finance
spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gold that was not generating any returns in vaults,
causing storage costs, now becomes a productive asset that will
generate profits,&#8221; the central bank said in the statement on
its website disclosing the operation. &#8220;These interventions in
the gold market represent the beginning of a new and permanent
strategy of active participation by the bank, through purchases,
sales and financial operations, that will contribute to the
creation of new financial investment opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry said yesterday the deal wasn&#8217;t a sale
and was a normal operation of investing reserves for profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Puzzling Transaction&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction covers 466,000 ounces of gold, according to
the central bank. That&#8217;s 1,165 gold bars, worth about $580
million at yesterday&#8217;s prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clue to the operation came last week, when the central
bank reported a $605 million drop in its gold reserves to $493
million during the week ending May 23. Net currency reserves
rose by $434 million. At the time the central bank didn&#8217;t
explain the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not clear what Goldman Sachs plans to do with the
bullion, said George Gero, a vice president and precious-metals
strategist in New York at RBC Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s really a puzzling transaction,&#8221; Gero said yesterday
in a telephone interview. &#8220;The idea that there was a large sale
and you don&#8217;t know when it will come out into the market is
probably pressuring prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Venezuela Proposal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot gold prices had fallen for five straight days before
today, when they rose 0.1 percent to 1,244.96 an ounce as of
2:31 p.m. in New York. They&#8217;re still down 34 percent from a peak
of $1,900.20 an ounce in September 2011. Prices have gained 3.6
percent so far this year and will fall to $1,240 by the end of
the year, according to the median estimate of 34 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers cut their net-long position, or bets on
higher gold prices, by 24 percent in the week ended May 27,
based on U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Short
holdings, or bets on a gold-price decrease, surged 72 percent,
the most in six months, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman Sachs proposed a swap with Venezuela to
provide $1.68 billion in cash to be backed by $1.85 billion of
gold, documents obtained by Bloomberg News showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, which wasn&#8217;t completed, would have carried an
interest rate of 7.5 percent plus the three-month London
interbank offered rate. Venezuela would have kept its exposure
to gold, with the nation posting the precious metal or cash to a
margin account if the price fell and Goldman Sachs posting U.S.
dollars if it rose, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuador&#8217;s transaction with Goldman Sachs &#8220;has nothing to
do&#8221; with the proposed Venezuelan deal, the central bank said in
its e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financing Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuador will probably use the transaction proceeds to
finance public spending, said Martin Castellano, a senior
economist for Latin America at the Institute of International
Finance, a trade association of banks and money managers
including Goldman Sachs. Given the country&#8217;s use of the
greenback as its official currency, the government needs to
ensure it has enough liquidity to avoid balance-of-payment
problems, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The measure reflects the government&#8217;s willingness to
pursue whichever financing option is at hand in order to avoid a
fiscal adjustment,&#8221; Castellano said yesterday in a telephone
interview from Washington. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) Chief Financial Officer
Byron H. Pollitt Jr., who joined the biggest bank-card network
the year before its 2008 IPO, will retire within the next 12
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pollitt, 62, who has been CFO for seven years, will assist
in the search for a successor and in the transition, Foster
City, California-based Visa said today in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pollitt&#8217;s retirement will leave four executives remaining
on the company&#8217;s management team from before its initial public
offering: Antonio Lucio, chief brand officer; Jim McCarthy, head
of innovation and strategic partnership; Ellen Richey, chief
legal and risk officer; and head of corporate strategy Bill Sheedy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Buse, 53, who previously ran most of the firm&#8217;s
international business, retired in March after more than 16
years at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pollitt previously served as CFO at Gap Inc. and Walt
Disney Co. and is a graduate of the University of California
Riverside and Harvard Business School. He received total
compensation of about $7.6 million in 2013, which included stock
awarded in prior years, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly Mahon Tullier, a senior vice president at PepsiCo
Inc., will join as general counsel and a member of the firm&#8217;s
executive committee in October, Visa said in April. Former
General Counsel Josh Floum left last year to return to private
practice and was replaced on an interim basis by Richey, the
company said in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa fell 0.9 percent to $211.65 at 10:10 a.m. in New York
and has slid 4.8 percent this year. The shares have increased
almost fivefold since the company went public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Cohen, a spokesman for Visa, declined to elaborate on
Pollitt&#8217;s retirement or the firm&#8217;s succession plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecuador President Rafael Correa said
proceeds from a loan obtained from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
after he offered more than half the country&#8217;s gold reserves as
collateral will go toward investing in economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government, faced with a budget deficit forecast to hit
a record this year, said last week that it &#8220;invested&#8221; 466,000
ounces of gold with Goldman Sachs in return for &#8220;instruments of
high security and liquidity.&#8221; The transaction added to reserves
of &#8220;monetary gold&#8221; and would generate as much as $20 million
in profit, according to a central bank statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gold reserves &#8220;serve as collateral for a loan,&#8221;
Correa told reporters today at the presidential palace in Quito.
&#8220;With this loan, we can invest in the country.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, amounting to 1,165 gold bars worth about $580
million at current prices, comes on top of government attempts
to sell about $700 million of bonds this year in what would be
the nation&#8217;s first foreign debt sale since it defaulted on $3.2
billion of its notes in 2008 and 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuador&#8217;s government hasn&#8217;t sufficiently explained the
operation with Goldman Sachs and the difference between the
central bank&#8217;s original statement and Correa&#8217;s comments today,
said Luis Fernando Torres, a congressional representative for
Tungurahua province. The government has liquidity problems and
has begun delaying payments to some public officials, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An investment and a loan are two totally different
things,&#8221; Torres said today in an interview at the nation&#8217;s
Congress in Quito. &#8220;This operation is baffling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$10 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correa&#8217;s administration is also in talks with China to
finance a $10 billion refinery in the coastal province of Manta,
Strategic Sectors Minister Rafael Poveda said today at the event
in Quito. The government expects to sign a deal for $2 billion
in August, of which $500 million will be for the government&#8217;s
discretionary use, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry forecasts the government will need
about $4.94 billion to cover this year&#8217;s budget deficit. The
government has said that if it doesn&#8217;t find the funds to finance
the gap, it will cut spending on budgeted infrastructure
projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GoPro Inc., the maker of cameras used
by surfers, skiers and sky divers to record their adventures,
recruited former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) executive Tony Bates as
president and added him to the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bates, 47, will join as second-in-command at the San Mateo,
California-based video maker, reporting to GoPro founder and
Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Woodman, the company said in a
statement today. Bates left Microsoft in March after he was
passed over for the CEO job that went to colleague Satya Nadella. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GoPro, which filed preliminary documents for a U.S. initial
public offering in February and a public prospectus last month,
plans to position itself as a media company distributing video
content. Most of its $985.7 million revenue last year was
derived through cameras and accessories. Bates, a former Cisco
Systems Inc. executive, ran Microsoft&#8217;s Skype unit before
becoming an executive vice president in July, where he ran
business development and evangelism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video and equipment maker also said today that it added
Dolby Laboratories Inc. Chairman Peter Gotcher to its board,
bringing the total number of directors to seven. Gotcher co-founded Digidesign Inc., maker of digital-audio workstations
including ProTools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Barclays
Plc and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit were fined $1
million each for submitting inaccurate information about
securities trading to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks failed to provide &#8220;complete and accurate
information&#8221; about trading, known as blue sheet data, that
regulators use to investigate potential insider trading and
market manipulation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When firms fail to submit timely and accurate blue sheet
data, it compromises the ability of every regulator to identify
the perpetrators of illegal insider trading and other market
abuses,&#8221; said Cameron Funkhouser, the head of Finra&#8217;s fraud
detection office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finra said the violations included submissions that failed
to include some customer names, contained incorrect names, and
failed to include some transactions. Goldman Sachs, Barclays and
Merrill Lynch each has a history of inaccurate blue sheet data,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs and Bill Halldin, a spokesman for Bank of America, based
in Charlotte, North Carolina, declined comment. A spokesman for
London-based Barclays didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms didn&#8217;t admit or deny wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TransCanada Corp. (TRP) signed agreements
with Chevron Corp. and Apache Corp. (APA) for a C$1.9 billion ($1.7

export facility near Kitimat, British Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement calls for delivery of about 1.9 billion cubic
feet of gas a day on the Merrick Mainline project, Calgary-based
TransCanada said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The initial work for the project is proceeding well, and
we anticipate filing an application with the National Energy
Board in the fourth quarter of 2014 for approvals to build and
operate the project,&#8221; TransCanada Chief Executive Officer Russ

&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Switzerland&#8217;s
No. 2 bank, rose the most in two weeks after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) raised its recommendation to buy from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analysts also raised their recommendation for
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) to neutral from sell, citing the decline in its
stock and its plan to issue shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse rose as much as 2.1 percent in trading today
after Goldman Sachs analysts including Jernej Omahen said its
shares were among the most undervalued in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise was the most since Credit Suisse settled a U.S.
investigation of its role in helping Americans evade taxes. The
settlement, announced after the close of trading on May 19,
included a guilty plea and a fine of $2.6 billion. It resolved
the last major litigation issue for Credit Suisse, Chief
Executive Officer Brady Dougan said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss bank &#8220;offers one of the highest upsides amongst
our coverage,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;We therefore upgrade the
shares to buy and add it to our conviction list.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse shares were up 1.6 percent to 26.76 francs at
12:20 p.m. in Zurich. At that price, it would have to rise 36
percent to reach the analysts&#8217; 12-month price target of 36.50
francs. Goldman Sachs said its view was based on the bank&#8217;s
current strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weak share performance, low expectations for profitability
and low capital ratios are among factors that increase the
chances of Credit Suisse adjusting its strategy, Goldman Sachs
said. Its analysts see more potential for shares to rise if any
such changes reduce the impact of investment banking on return
on equity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investment Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lowered its estimate of Credit Suisse&#8217;s
earnings per share for this year to 2.58 Swiss francs ($2.87)
from 2.73 francs, citing a slowdown in debt trading. The mean
estimate of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is 2.11 francs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank is weighing on the company&#8217;s return on
equity, the analysts said, estimating the drag at about 5
percent. Credit Suisse&#8217;s return on equity, a measure of
profitability, was 8 percent in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse says its common equity ratio at the end of
the first quarter would have been 9.3 percent if the U.S.
settlement were factored in. The bank lags 3.9 percentage points
behind the biggest Swiss bank UBS AG (UBSN) in this measure, Goldman
Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In our view, an external capital hike remains an option
for CS,&#8221; the Goldman Sachs analysts said. &#8220;Additional source
of capital generation would be welcome.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt, a small
chain with exotic flavors like gingerbread and kiwi, is facing a
tough technology choice: sink thousands of dollars into new
credit card-reading machines by next year, or run the risk of
fraud by waiting and adopting cheaper mobile-payment services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By October 2015, Orange Leaf and most of the country&#8217;s 6
million small merchants that accept credit cards are supposed to 
be ready to take cards with an embedded chip for extra security 
-- or credit-card networks may consider them liable for some 
fraud in their stores. The new cards require a technology 
called EMV that helps prevent fraud by assigning a unique code 
for every transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is to delay EMV and press ahead with plans
to take payments via mobile devices, often a more convenient
approach that&#8217;s less expensive to implement and can even
generate revenue for merchants by using smartphone applications
to build relationships with customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Using a mobile wallet is a better choice right now,&#8221;
said Michael Christy, Orange Leaf&#8217;s director of information
technology. &#8220;We can control that, and the technical 
requirements are minimal. We want to make sure we save our 
franchisees money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christy&#8217;s choice underscores the dilemma facing millions of
businesses seeking to avoid the data losses that have plagued
Target Corp. and Neiman Marcus Group Ltd. -- while aiming to cut
costs and embrace the boom in demand for smartphones that also
offer useful payment methods. While big companies like Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. can afford the costs of EMV, which can run as much
as $1,000 per checkout lane, many smaller businesses are under
pressure to convert to the chip cards just as mobile payments
start to gain popularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Skipping Generation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate,&#8221; said Doug Brown, general manager of
mobile at payment-technology provider FIS. &#8220;Longer-term, it&#8217;d
be better if we could just skip a generation and just go to
mobile payments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In five to seven years, more than half of in-store
transactions will be made with mobile phones instead of plastic,
said Brown, whose Jacksonville, Florida-based company helps more
than 14,000 financial companies use payments including EMV and
mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, many businesses aren&#8217;t ready for EMV. According to
Javelin Strategy  Research, only about one in five businesses
with fewer than 10 employees will be outfitted for the new
technology by next year&#8217;s deadline, which the credit-card
companies refer to as the &#8220;liability shift&#8221; because retailers
will need to assume more responsibility when people make
fraudulent transactions in their stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Equipment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin accepting EMV, stores have to get new equipment to
read the cards&#8217; internal security chips, and a signature or PIN
are typically used to complete a sale. The technology is
considered more secure because EMV cards create a unique code
for each transaction, making them more difficult to hack or
counterfeit than striped cards. All EMV cards also have magnetic
stripes, so they can work on older store payment terminals. EMV
is an acronym for Europay, MasterCard and Visa, the companies
that are pushing its adoption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While mobile-payment systems vary, they often work by
storing credit-card data on a remote server and scanning a QR
code with a phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange Leaf, which has 315 stores in the U.S., is rolling
out a mobile-payment system for a quarter of the cost of EMV-capable technology, Christy said in an interview. The Oklahoma
City-based yogurt chain is simply upgrading its current
transaction software so customers can easily use a mobile-phone
app from FIS and mobile-payment startup Paydiant Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phasing In &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange Leaf&#8217;s current payment hardware can last another
four to seven years, Christy said. Like many smaller merchants,
it may make sense for him to wait to phase in EMV as his older
hardware wears out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many small businesses don&#8217;t see enough fraud to justify
upgrading their hardware and moving to the more secure cards,
Richard Crone, chief executive officer of payment consultancy
Crone Consulting LLC, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fraud is tiny, in terms of transactions,&#8221; Crone
said. &#8220;You are talking about a minuscule amount.&#8221; Small
businesses see fraud in 0.03 percent to 0.05 percent of all in-store transactions, he said; that means that a merchant with
$500,000 in annual sales may see less than $250 in fraudulent
sales a year. And the liability shift won&#8217;t even apply in some
situations, such as when a customer&#8217;s bank hasn&#8217;t yet issued an
EMV card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Boosting Revenue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies like FIS and Paydiant also help keep mobile
transactions secure by storing and encrypting credit-card
information on behalf of their clients. Some mobile-payment
systems store financial data on the device itself, which could
be more vulnerable to hackers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike EMV, mobile payments can help merchants boost
revenue. Mobile applications give businesses a way to track
loyalty-card holders, distribute coupons and publish ads. Mobile
apps can also let consumers scan items with their phones and
self-checkout from anywhere in the store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile payments can work in a variety of ways. Orange
Leaf&#8217;s app will let consumers scan a special QR code with their
phone at checkout. Consumers can use a credit card to upload
money to be used through the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many retailers are enthusiastic about mobile
payments, consumers have been slow to embrace them. Starbucks
Corp.&#8217;s mobile app now has 10 million users after being
introduced nationwide in 2011, and mobile payments now account
for more than 14 percent of tender in its company-operated
stores in the U.S. and Canada. It takes time to train customers
and employees to use a new payment system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slower Transactions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMV cards require their own learning curve and may also
lead to slower transactions since they have to be inserted into
in-store terminals throughout the entire checkout process.
Still, large stores will probably have to upgrade to EMV
technology because they tend to see more fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They, obviously, have far more to be concerned about, at
least in the initial liability-shift discussion,&#8221; said Greg
Boardman, a senior vice president at Ingenico, one of the
world&#8217;s biggest EMV-terminal makers. &#8220;Having said that, the
small merchant doesn&#8217;t have the financial resources to absorb a
lot of fraud loss.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Patricia Laya" date="Jun 04, 2014 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-04/televisa-america-movil-can-keep-exclusive-deals-regulator-says.html"><headline>Televisa, America Movil Can Keep Exclusive Deals, Regulator Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;America Movil SAB (AMXL) and Grupo Televisa
SAB (TLEVICPO) are being permitted by Mexican officials to keep their
current deals to broadcast exclusive sports programming, though
they can&#8217;t strike similar agreements in the future for certain
events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Telecommunications Institute, or IFT, said a
regulation passed last week that limits the companies&#8217; ability
to acquire exclusive programming rights doesn&#8217;t apply
retroactively, the agency said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa, which gets about 70 percent of Mexico&#8217;s broadcast
audience, has rights to broadcast World Cup soccer matches in
Mexico this year and in 2018 and 2022, though it hasn&#8217;t said how
many of those games are exclusive. America Movil, which has an
online video network, has an exclusive deal to broadcast the
2016 Olympic games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those agreements are unaffected by the IFT&#8217;s new rule,
which was meant to increase competition by letting smaller
rivals gain access to widely viewed events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In other words, nothing is going to happen with that
regulation,&#8221; said Jose Otero, an analyst at Signals Telecom
Consulting, in a Twitter message. &#8220;The more things change, the
more they stay the same.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under last week&#8217;s IFT ruling, Televisa and America Movil
are forbidden from buying exclusive rights to the Mexican soccer
league finals, the Mexican national men&#8217;s soccer team matches,
the Summer Olympics opening and closing ceremonies and a
selection of World Cup soccer matches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency singled out the two companies for the ban
because it has found them dominant in their industries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/), Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) are among two dozen U.S. refiners sued by Vermont Attorney
General William Sorrell and accused of polluting the state&#8217;s
groundwater with a gasoline additive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell filed the case today in state court in Montpelier,
the capital. The refiners promoted, marketed and distributed
gasoline containing the additive Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether, or
MTBE, knowing that it posed &#8220;unprecedented risks&#8221; to
groundwater, Sorrell&#8217;s office said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These companies knew years ago that MTBE was a uniquely
bad actor in groundwater, and they ignored the risks and sold it
anyway,&#8221; Sorrell said. &#8220;This lawsuit is about holding them
accountable and ensuring that they -- and not Vermonters -- pay
to clean up our groundwater.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is one of scores of claims filed by cities, states
and individuals around the U.S. against oil refiners, retailers
and distributors over MTBE. The U.S. Supreme Court in April
upheld a jury&#8217;s $104.7 million damage award against Exxon Mobil
for contaminating New York City wells with the additive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York sued oil companies in 2003, alleging they knew the
additive would pollute groundwater. Exxon Mobil argued that
state laws are pre-empted by the federal Clean Air Act, which
required oil companies to reformulate gasoline to reduce air
pollution from vehicle emissions. Oil companies added MTBE to
make it burn more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exxon Statement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Exxon Mobil spokesman, Todd Spitler, said the company is
reviewing the state&#8217;s claims. The foundation of MTBE litigation
is flawed because companies are being held liable for including
oxygenates in gasoline that were required by Congress and
approved by regulators, he said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies that complied with the law and regulations to
blend approved oxygenates in gasoline should not be held liable
simply for following a government mandate,&#8221; Spitler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There hasn&#8217;t been a single recorded case of anyone&#8217;s
becoming sick from MTBE water contamination, he said. The
company takes seriously its responsibility to operate in an
&#8220;environmentally sound manner&#8221; and works hard to protect the
health and safety of the communities where it operates, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman, Braden Reddall, said the company will
&#8220;review the complaint once we are served.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlton Carroll, an American Petroleum Institute spokesman,
declined to comment on the suit. Diana Cronan, a spokeswoman for
the American Fuel  Petrochemical Manufacturers, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;State Findings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While MTBE is banned as a gasoline additive in Vermont, the
state&#8217;s Agency of Natural Resources continues to oversee
remediation of past releases and keeps finding new contaminated
wells, according to Sorrell&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state claims violations of its Groundwater Protection
Act and alleges that the refiners used MTBE as an additive
despite knowing it was hazardous and would pollute groundwater,
and that they failed to inform state regulators, resellers or
consumers of the hazards and how to mitigate them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of Vermont v. Atlantic Richfield Co.,
Vermont Superior Court, Washington County (Montpelier). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central Florida county is building
a toll road through swampland near Walt Disney World to speed
the commutes of local workers, financing the project by selling
low-rated debt to yield-hungry investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $70 million tax-exempt deal from Osceola County drew
Vanguard Group Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest mutual fund company,
whose head of municipal securities, Chris Alwine, foresees
demand for more infrastructure funding. Citigroup Inc. (C) predicts
next year will bring the most muni toll-road issuance since 2010
as officials ramp up investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Poinciana Parkway being dug from the muck outside
Orlando shows how America&#8217;s aging road system stands to benefit
from the search for yield with interest rates close to
generational lows. Investing in the project is like wagering on
a start-up venture: The bonds bear the lowest investment grade
and are backed by tolls to be collected on an unproven route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s inherent demand given the level of congestion in
the area,&#8221; said Alwine of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based
Vanguard. The company oversees about $130 billion in munis,
including about $42 million of the Osceola toll bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look at the route relative to alternatives, the fares
that are proposed, and then the cushion, and we&#8217;re comfortable
with the deal,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MModal Inc., the medical-transcription company indirectly controlled by JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM), won court approval of the rough terms of a plan to
reorganize and will seek final approval July 15 to exit
bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Grossman yesterday approved
MModal&#8217;s disclosure statement, which explains how much creditors
will get. The reorganized company is projected to earn $57
million before taxes and other items this year and $71 million a
year by 2017, enough to support its new debt load of about $320
million in secured debt, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The disclosure statement complies with the requirements
of the bankruptcy code&#8221; and has enough information to allow
creditors to vote on the plan, Grossman wrote in an order in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MModal, acquired by New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s One Equity
Partners in a $1.14 billion leveraged buyout in August 2012,
filed for bankruptcy on March 20. The Franklin, Tennessee-based
company listed assets of $626.8 million and liabilities totaling
$876.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MModal struggled to make payments on the debt as software
and other products supplanted its transcription business, which
converts health-care providers&#8217; dictation to text and generated
more than 80 percent of revenue. Sales fell more than 9 percent
last year to $411 million as earnings dropped almost 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s $250 million in 10.75 percent senior
unsecured notes due in 2020 last traded at 26 cents on the
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They sold for
46.93 cents at the beginning of the year, on Jan. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Legend Parent Inc., 14-bk-10701, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
won a contract with China&#8217;s state-owned Shanghai Airport
Authority to use cloud computing to help move traffic more
efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IBM system, the first phase of which was completed in
March, helps the airport manage everything from airplane taxi
times to passengers waiting on a concourse, the Armonk, New
York-based company said in a statement today. The system
dramatically improved the punctuality of flight departures,
according to the statement, which didn&#8217;t provide specific
figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract gives IBM a boost as it seeks to reverse
declining sales in China, where revenue fell 20 percent last
quarter, dragged down by declining hardware spending. U.S.
companies have also been grappling with tensions over
cybersecurity in China after U.S. prosecutors last month charged
five Chinese military officers with allegedly hacking into
computers of American companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is reviewing whether domestic banks&#8217; reliance on
IBM&#8217;s high-end servers compromises the nation&#8217;s financial
security, Bloomberg News reported May 27 citing people familiar
with the matter. IBM said last month it wasn&#8217;t aware of any
government policy against use of its servers. The company&#8217;s
Shanghai-based spokesman Anthony Guerrieri said today&#8217;s
announcement is unrelated to any government reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shanghai Airport &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are proud to be selected by Shanghai Hongqiao
International Airport as its trusted partner,&#8221; Ernie Hu, IBM&#8217;s
vice president for its software group in China, said in the
statement. &#8220;IBM has a long history of innovation in
transportation, working with the world&#8217;s leading airlines and
airports.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM was little changed at $184.23 at 10:10 a.m. in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system supplied to the Shanghai Airport Authority,
which operates the city&#8217;s Pudong International Airport and
Hongqiao International Airport, features IBM&#8217;s DB2 data server,
and the Tivoli Directory Server and Security Identity Manager,
according to IBM&#8217;s statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter has said the
company&#8217;s challenges in China are related to the normal cycle of
upgrades for hardware such as servers. While IBM doesn&#8217;t break
out sales figures by country, 14 percent of its 2013 revenue
came from the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Penner, the grandson-in-law of
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) founder Sam Walton, became heir apparent to
the chairman role today after spending almost a decade investing
the family&#8217;s money as head of a venture firm in Silicon Valley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penner, a 44-year-old who participates in triathlons,
brings California sensibilities to the Arkansas-based retail
chain, which named him vice chairman at its annual meeting
today. Penner received his MBA from Stanford University in 1997
before taking a series of Wal-Mart management jobs. In 2005, he
started Madrone Capital Partners, a firm backed by money from
Wal-Mart Chairman Rob Walton and other family members. Penner
then joined Wal-Mart&#8217;s board in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By elevating him to the newly created vice chairman
position, the Waltons are betting that Penner&#8217;s technology
experience can help guide the company into a new era of e-commerce and smaller-format stores. The move also could raise
hackles among Wal-Mart&#8217;s critics, who say the Waltons already
have too much control over the company. Wal-Mart described the
change as an act of succession planning and said Penner will
begin standing in as chairman when Rob Walton isn&#8217;t present. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am committed to the long-term success of Wal-Mart,&#8221;
Penner said in a statement today. &#8220;I look forward to
contributing to a stronger Wal-Mart in any way possible,
including how we develop new digital capabilities to add to our
store offering.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
both say that Brazil will probably win its sixth World Cup title
next month. They have opposing calls on the market&#8217;s reaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman cites historical data for past winners to
predict a victory for the national team will spark a rally for
Brazilian stocks, UBS said in a report today that local politics
mean a defeat could spur gains by further eroding the popularity
of President Dilma Rousseff&#8217;s government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian stocks posted the biggest rally among the world&#8217;s
major stock indexes today after a poll showed declining support
for Rousseff ahead of October elections in which she&#8217;ll seek a
second four-year term. Investors are betting that a new
president will interfere less in state-controlled companies such
as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, bolstering their prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the national team &#8217;crashes and burns&#8217; in the Cup, or
if the tournament suffers a major organizational catastrophe,
widespread social discontent could ensue,&#8221; Jorge Mariscal, the
chief investment officer for emerging markets at UBS Wealth
Management, wrote. &#8220;However, short-term economic pain and anti-Dilma sentiment could be good for financial markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elections, expectations for a Brazil victory as well as
an &#8220;unstable&#8221; social situation evident in street protests over
$11 billion in spending tied to the games, make this year&#8217;s
tournament especially important for markets, UBS said. In
addition to how well the team fares, Rousseff&#8217;s popularity could
also be hurt by traffic jams and other problems that expose
Brazil&#8217;s lack of preparation, Mariscal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors should get ready to carefully follow
developments not only inside the soccer stadium, but also on the
streets of Brazil&#8217;s largest cities,&#8221; UBS said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Call &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs recommended buying Brazilian assets in a May
28 report, saying history shows a win will boost the country&#8217;s
stock markets in the weeks after the final. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victor country&#8217;s equity markets outperform global
stocks by 3.5 percentage points in dollar terms on average in
the first month after winning, &#8220;although the outperformance
fades significantly after three months,&#8221; according to Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, which looked at the winning nations&#8217; stock markets in
local currency terms since the 1974 World Cup, said the winner
underperformed global equities in the week after the final in
six of eight times, with a median underperformance of 0.7
percent. Considering one-month returns after the World Cup, the
median nation outperformed by 0.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the analysts are split on the effect of a win on the
country&#8217;s assets, they agree that Brazil is likely to get a
record sixth title at Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s Maracana stadium next
month. UBS called the team as the &#8220;clear favorite,&#8221; joining
Goldman, Danske Bank A/S and Unicredit SpA, who all predicted
the host team will beat Argentina in the final match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Support Slips &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rousseff&#8217;s support fell to 34 percent this month from 37
percent in May, according to a Datafolha poll published today on
Folha de Sao Paulo&#8217;s website. All of Rousseff&#8217;s challengers
together garnered 35 percent, a gap from the front-runner that
is within the two-percentage-point margin of error in the June
3-5 survey. To win in the first round a candidate needs to have
more than 50 percent support, or more votes than all other
candidates combined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ibovespa jumped 3 percent today in Sao Paulo as state-run companies surged after the poll results. Petrobras, as the
state-controlled oil producer is known, added 8.3 percent to
17.68 reais, the biggest one-day advance since March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Investment Management Corp. (WAC),
the third-largest non-bank mortgage servicer, has been 
expanding while its bigger rivals shrink amid probes from 
regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Investment, which was spun off from a coal-mining
and homebuilding conglomerate in 2009, increased its mortgage
servicing business by 20 percent in the first quarter, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg from regulatory filings. Tampa,
Florida-based Walter Investment rose to No. 3 in the period by
surpassing PHH Corp. (PHH) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business of collecting mortgage payments is undergoing
a transformation as large banks retreat from the $9.4 trillion
market and regulators investigate non-bank servicers. The two
largest non-bank operators, Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) and Nationstar
Mortgage Holdings Inc. (NSM), both lost market share in the first
quarter, while Walter Investment enlarged its loan holdings to
$234 billion, according to company filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The huge shift in servicing from banks to non-banks has
created a landscape that&#8217;s rapidly changing,&#8221; said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of research firm Federal Financial
Analytics Inc. in Washington. &#8220;No one can know who the winners
and the losers will be until the dust settles.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Investment had a 2.4 percent share of the servicing
market in the first quarter compared with Ocwen&#8217;s 4.5 percent
and Nationstar&#8217;s 3.9 percent, according to Bloomberg data. Wells
Fargo  Co. led with 18 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Investment&#8217;s stock price gained 13 percent to $28.99
from the beginning of May through June 4, exceeding the 11
percent advance by Lewisville, Texas-based Nationstar, which is
majority owned by Fortress Investment Group LLC. (FIG) Atlanta-based
Ocwen, which is controlled by billionaire founder&#160;William Erbey,
gained 3.1 percent in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lawsky Probes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Department of Financial Services is
investigating both Ocwen and Nationstar. The companies about
doubled their holdings of mortgage servicing rights, or MSRs, in
2013, according to company reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocwen said on Feb. 6 that the department had blocked its
deal to buy $39 billion of servicing rights from Wells Fargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is appropriate for regulators, where warranted, to
halt the explosive growth in the nonbank mortgage servicing
industry&#8221; to protect homeowners, Benjamin Lawsky, the
department&#8217;s head, said a week later in a speech in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsky also sent a letter in February to Ocwen citing his
concerns about potential conflicts of interest among four
companies headed by Erbey that provide mortgage-related services
to each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter to Nationstar in March, the regulator said it
was probing the impact of the firm&#8217;s rapid growth on homeowners
and asked for data about its servicing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ocwen Shrinks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies have disputed Lawsky&#8217;s comments, saying they
have better performance records than the nation&#8217;s biggest banks.
The companies are cooperating with the probes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Ocwen and Nationstar declined to comment for
this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocwen&#8217;s loan portfolio dropped 3.2 percent to $440.7
billion in the first quarter, and Nationstar&#8217;s portfolio fell
7.5 percent to $384 billion. PHH, which also manages car and
truck fleets, declined 1 percent to $225.7 billion, putting it
in fourth place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Walter is buying loans, and in the last few months we&#8217;ve
seen a slowdown in the acquisitions by Ocwen and Nationstar,&#8221;
said Douglas Harter, a director and servicing analyst at Credit
Suisse Group in New York. &#8220;Ocwen and Nationstar will have to
adjust to a different environment where deal sizes are smaller
and there is more focus on integration. That&#8217;s going to slow
them down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Walter Investment and other non-banks held
MSRs on less than 2 percent of U.S. home loans. Banks have been
selling these rights since the Federal Reserve began drafting
new rules in 2012 to implement an international banking
agreement known as Basel III aimed at preventing the type of
financial shock seen in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement increases the amount of capital banks are
required to have to hold MSRs on their books. Non-banks such as
Walter Investment are not bound by the new rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, non-banks control a total of about 14 percent of the
market, according to Bloomberg data. In the next two years,
banks probably will sell another $1 trillion in MSRs, according
to Harter. That would push the non-bank share to 24 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Investment is also under scrutiny. In February, the
company disclosed in a filing that the Federal Trade Commission
and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau informed it of a
possible enforcement action. The details have not been made
public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mortgage Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re currently in discussions,&#8221; said Denmar Dixon,
Walter Investment&#8217;s chief investment officer. &#8220;We&#8217;d like to
find a resolution to that in the near term. Right now, we can&#8217;t
predict when that will come.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Smith, who oversees a $25 billion mortgage
settlement between state and federal agencies and five banks,
said in May that Green Tree Servicing LLC, a unit of Walter
Investment, didn&#8217;t use proper procedures in servicing loans it
bought last year from Residential Capital LLC, a company covered
by the agreement. The former ResCap loans make up about 14
percent of Walter&#8217;s portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was our first time through the testing,&#8221; said
Dixon. &#8220;We are a pretty compliant shop, and highly rated. This
was layered on top of that. We will be tested again on the
metrics,&#8221; and expect to pass, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Green Tree &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compass Point Research  Trading LLC in March ranked Walter
Investment as the top performer among all loan servicers, based
on customer-complaint data from CFPB. Walter had a 0.8 percent
complaint ratio when measured against the amount of delinquent
loans in its portfolio, followed by Nationstar at 1.3 percent
and Ocwen at 2 percent. The average rate for servicers, most of
them banks, was 4.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark O&#8217;Brien, CEO of Walter Investment, has his roots in
the homebuilding industry. He was CEO of PulteGroup Inc. in
2001, when it was known as Pulte Homes, and oversaw the $1.8
billion purchase of Del Webb that created what was then the
nation&#8217;s largest residential builder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Brien left Pulte in 2003, saying he was retiring. In
2005, he joined Walter Industries Inc. as a director and in 2009
became head of Walter Investment when it was spun off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Investment has more than tripled its holdings of

&lt;p&gt;David Blitzer had his eye on Addy Loudiadis&#8217;s business at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the middle of 2013, the Blackstone Group LP (BX) dealmaker had his shot. Pressured by regulators to boost capital under new rules, the bank started looking for investors to take pieces of Rothesay Life Ltd., the insurer that Loudiadis heads in London. Blitzer, whose private-equity firm historically has to control companies it buys, was fine taking a minority stake in a Goldman cash cow. In October, he struck a $297 million deal to buy 28.5 percent of Rothesay, with Singapore&#8217;s sovereign fund taking an equal share. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blitzer has spent the past two years engineering unorthodox deals like Rothesay that no one else within Blackstone could do. The 44-year old New Jersey native runs Tactical Opportunities Group, a $5.6 billion unit with the mandate to make investments that fall between the cracks of the firm&#8217;s other businesses. The group has bought oil tankers, developed Brazilian shopping malls, and created a finance unit for U.S. landlords, capitalizing as banks are forced to shrink, and cutting deals that were the domain of Wall Street before its retreat from proprietary investing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;An awful lot of what Tac Ops does was either done by the big banks on their proprietary trading desks or by hedge funds in their illiquid side pockets,&#8221; Tony James, Blackstone&#8217;s president, said in an interview last month. &#8220;Both those sorts of capital have been eliminated and unless they come back, there will be tons of opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s biggest computer services provider, and Epic
Systems Corp. will team up to compete for an $11 billion project
to manage U.S. troops&#8217; electronic health records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM announced its plans to bid today, even before the
Defense Department formally starts the competition for the
information-technology system. Rival bids may come from
Accenture Plc (ACN) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winner gets one of the biggest opportunities in federal
information technology, where new projects are under scrutiny
after the flawed rollout of the Obamacare website. A better
Pentagon system is needed so troops&#8217; health records can be
shared quickly with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is
struggling to reduce backlogs in disability claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I hope people expect results, because this is where we
show up,&#8221; Andy Maner, managing partner for IBM&#8217;s U.S. federal
division, said in a phone interview. &#8220;We don&#8217;t bid on
everything, but when we do, we want to change the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon&#8217;s solicitation for the contract, possibly with
a 10-year duration, may be posted as early as next month, Maner
said. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, already has more than 100
employees working to develop a proposal, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This has been a thing we&#8217;ve had circled for more than
three years,&#8221; Maner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Website Fixes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract may attract bids from companies such as
Dublin-based Accenture and Falls Church, Virginia-based
Northrop, according to Brian Friel, a Bloomberg Industries
analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government this year turned to Accenture for help
fixing healthcare.gov, the enrollment website for the federal
health-care overhaul. The company succeeds Montreal-based CGI
Group Inc. (GIB/A), criticized for the website&#8217;s early troubles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other competitors for the Pentagon program might include
Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Reston,
Virginia-based Leidos Holdings Inc. (LDOS), Friel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northrop built the original system, which is now being
maintained by Leidos, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planned system, which will replace the older one, will
track U.S. forces&#8217; health records no matter where they receive
care, whether on base, on a ship, in a military hospital or
close to combat. It will handle the health records of 9.7
million beneficiaries, including active-duty military, retirees
and their dependents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Epic&#8217;s Software &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Service members, their families and health-care providers
who care for them deserve the best health care our country can
provide,&#8221; Carl Dvorak, president of Verona, Wisconsin-based
Epic, said in a statement. &#8220;They would benefit from an
integrated system that leverages best practices from other large
and successful health-care organizations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic&#8217;s enterprise software is widely used in the health-care industry, including by Johns Hopkins Medicine, Kaiser
Permanente and the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM and Epic have worked together on other health-care
projects, including for Kaiser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM was the 51st biggest federal contractor in the fiscal
year that ended Sept. 30, receiving $1.2 billion in prime, or
direct, awards, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company ranked 45th in 2012, when it had $1.5 billion in U.S.
contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IBM-Epic collaboration will be led by Keith Salzman, a
former Army hospital chief medical information officer who is
now IBM&#8217;s chief medical information officer, and use technology
from its Watson supercomputer, best known for beating human
contestants on the &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; TV game show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Claims Backlog &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs have
been pressured by lawmakers, White House officials and veterans
to help fix the VA&#8217;s backlog in processing disability claims.
The military has contributed to that bottleneck, some lawmakers
and the Veterans of Foreign Wars have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon announced in May 2013 that it would build its
own electronic health-records system. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel promised to work with the VA to develop a &#8220;seamless
system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military&#8217;s plan raised concerns among lawmakers and
veterans&#8217; organizations that had pushed the two agencies to
build a single system for current and former troops&#8217; health
records. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. didn&#8217;t buy the &#8220;new normal&#8221; and it&#8217;s not rushing to embrace the &#8220;new neutral&#8221; either. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius and Dominic Wilson are questioning the bet made last month by investor Bill Gross that Federal Reserve monetary tightening will be much less aggressive than in the past -- when it comes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not disagree that the Fed funds rate will on average be at least modestly lower over the next 20 years than it was over the 20 years preceding the crisis,&#8221; New York-based economist Kris Dawsey wrote in a June 6 report. &#8220;We lean towards the view that the difference will not be drastic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

Gross Says &#8217;New Neutral&#8217; Rate Lower for Years to Come
Goldman Shuns Bonds Pimco&#8217;s Gross Favors in &#8216;New Neutral&#8217;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is not alone in questioning the &#8220;new neutral,&#8221; the level at which the Fed benchmark neither stimulates nor slows the economy. The term was coined by Bloomberg News in a March 17 report and then promoted by Gross&#8217;s Pacific Investment Management Co. It describes the view that the Fed is unlikely to raise the rate much beyond 2 percent because potential growth is weaker and debt higher than before the recession. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using bond yields and surveys of forecasters, Dawsey reckons investors anticipate a neutral rate of 3.8 percent, in line with the 4 percent projected by Fed officials. While Goldman Sachs still doesn&#8217;t expect the Fed to begin raising before 2016, it predicts the key rate will reach 4 percent at the end of 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

In 2012, Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius sided with the view that monetary stimulus could help reduce unemployment, while Bill Gross argued joblessness was permanently elevated and would only by eased &#8220;at the margin&#8221; by easy monetary policy. Close

&lt;p&gt;Foreign banks are projected by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to lend less money against commodity
inventories in China amid a probe into metals stockpiles in the
biggest consumer of raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims that single batches of copper and aluminum at
Qingdao Port were pledged as collateral for multiple loans risks
undermining a broader practice in which traders use everything
from iron ore to rubber to get funding. The investigation is
already weighing down copper prices and may curb foreign
exchange inflows to China, according to a report by Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe may affect metals stockpiles at the northeastern
port held by Citic Resources Holdings Ltd., the trader
controlled by China&#8217;s largest state-owned company said today.
Standard Chartered Plc said last week it was reviewing financing
to some companies in China and Standard Bank Group started
looking at &#8220;potential irregularities&#8221; with metals at Qingdao.
Citigroup Inc. said it would work closely with authorities and
warehousing companies to resolve any problems for clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The developments in Qingdao are likely to continue the
significant scaling back of FX inflows from foreign banks into
China via commodity financing business,&#8221; analysts at New York-based Goldman said in the report dated yesterday. &#8220;As foreign
banks reduce their exposure to Chinese commodity financing
deals, the profitability of these could be reduced
meaningfully.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper in London may fall to $6,200 a metric ton before the
end of this year, analysts including Roger Yuan and Max Layton
said in a report. Benchmark three-month futures on the London
Metal Exchange slumped 9.7 percent this year and traded at
$6,645 at 5:45 p.m. Shanghai time, putting them on course for
the lowest closing price since May 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currency flows may be affected because Chinese borrowers
often use commodities as collateral to get low interest loans
from overseas lenders in dollars. They then bring the money
onshore to invest in the nation&#8217;s higher interest rate
environment before later repaying the sum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qingdao Port said in a June 6 statement that public
security authorities were probing alleged fraud involving
material held in its Dagang bonded storage area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public security authorities in Qingdao have not responded
to calls by Bloomberg News seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The authenticity of warehouse receipts is critical to the
practice of inventory financing in bonded warehouses,&#8221; Barclays
Plc analyst Sijin Cheng wrote in a report last week. &#8220;Feedback
from trading house contacts suggests that this investigation has
cast a pall on the financing trade as a whole.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Port Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares (6198) of Qingdao Port International Co., which listed on
the stock exchange in Hong Kong on June 5, have fallen 3.5
percent from their offer price to $HK3.63 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation is into the owner of some metals and a
third party storing them in the Dagang area and not Qingdao Port
itself, according to the June 6 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company continues to provide regular port services to
other clients and for all metal ore products, including aluminum
and copper products,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, some Chinese banks have raised margins for
letters of credit for iron ore financing to as much as 50
percent from as much as 30 percent previously, said two people
with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others reduced overall credit available for iron ore
financing and set a cap on credit used in some locations
including Rizhao, a port located about 100 kilometers (65 miles)
southeast of Qingdao, according to the people, who asked not to
be identified because they aren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Locked Gates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dagang area has been sealed and gates to the area are
chained and padlocked, Reuters reported. The amount of metal
involved in the probe was about 20,000 tons of copper, almost
100,000 tons of aluminum ingots and about 200,000 tons of
alumina, Reuters said, citing a source it didn&#8217;t name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiangxi Copper Co., China&#8217;s biggest smelter of the metal,
said the problems at Qingdao don&#8217;t represent a systemic risk and
won&#8217;t hurt demand or production of industrial metals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as industrial metals, Qingdao port also handles
iron ore and agricultural commodities including cotton and
rubber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai is China&#8217;s biggest port and storage center for
industrial metals. Copper inventories in bonded zones in
Shanghai were estimated to be about 815,000 tons in April by
CRU, a London-based consultant. Citrine Capital Management LLC
said in June that stockpiles in bonded warehouses across China
may be about 900,000 tons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe will make China&#8217;s banks &#8220;extremely cautious&#8221;
about financing deals, though lenders will continue to help fund
shipments to end-users, Colin Hamilton, Macquarie Group Ltd.&#8217;s
head of commodities research, said June 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some copper may be moved from China to LME warehouses in
South Korea, and possibly Singapore and Malaysia, Jeremy Goldwyn, head of business development in Asia for Sucden
Financial Ltd., said June 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Financial Officer
Frank D&#8217;Amelio said the company&#8217;s $117 billion bid for
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) broke down over price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, set a ceiling for how
much it would pay for London-based AstraZeneca and wasn&#8217;t
willing to go over that limit, D&#8217;Amelio said today at an
investment conference organized by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
While New York-based Pfizer can approach AstraZeneca again after
a U.K. regulatory period ends in six months, D&#8217;Amelio said he
couldn&#8217;t comment about whether it will do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D&#8217;Amelio also said Pfizer&#8217;s attempt at a mega-merger
doesn&#8217;t rule out the possibility the company will instead break
up into smaller parts. AstraZeneca last month rejected a
takeover offer valued at 55 pounds a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a word it was price,&#8221; that kept the two companies
from sealing a deal, D&#8217;Amelio said. &#8220;Any other issues that were
raised during negotiations and conversations I think we were
able to adequately, effectively address those.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer was seeking to lower its tax rate
through the deal by moving its official headquarters to London.
The company also sought to gain from AstraZeneca&#8217;s experimental
immune therapy cancer drugs, a new class of treatments that
would have filled a hole in Pfizer&#8217;s product portfolio.
AstraZeneca has predicted those products may help raise its
annual sales by 75 percent to $45 billion by 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp.

&lt;p&gt;Coca production in Peru fell at the
fastest pace in 14 years in 2013 and cocaine prices soared as
the government stepped up eradication efforts, United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area under cultivation dropped 18 percent to 49,800
hectares (123,058 acres), Flavio Mirella, head of the agency&#8217;s
Peruvian office, said at the presentation of its annual coca
report. The price of pure cocaine made from coca leaves surged
to $1,310 a kilogram, a 15-year high, from $993 in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Ollanta Humala increased spending on eradication
and crop substitution after Peru overtook Colombia in 2012 to
become the world&#8217;s largest grower of coca leaf. It is not clear
whether the country retains that title as the agency hasn&#8217;t yet
published surveys of coca cultivation in Colombia and Bolivia
for 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca eradication has been expanded to parts of the country
&#8220;previously considered untouchable&#8221; such as the Monzon Valley,
&#8220;an area dominated for more than 40 years by drug traffickers
and coca growers, and where the local population traditionally
violently rejected any intervention by the state,&#8221; the report
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru, Colombia and Bolivia are the world&#8217;s biggest
producers of coca leaf, Mirella said. Cultivation in Peru fell
3.4 percent in 2012 after expanding for seven straight years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of cocaine from Peru doubles as it gets to the
border with Bolivia, one of the transport routes for the drug,
Mirella said. On the streets of New York the drug sells at

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the world&#8217;s
biggest investment bank, may have to cut jobs and reduce
compensation if trading revenue fails to rebound as expected,
Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With results holding at current levels, &#8220;compensation will
come down,&#8221; Lake said today at an investor conference in New
York. &#8220;Then in the longer term, the question is whether we will
have too much capacity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan warned investors last month that second-quarter
fixed-income and equities trading would probably drop about 20
percent from a year earlier amid low volatility across asset
classes. Lake, 45, affirmed the New York-based bank&#8217;s forecast
today and said the slowdown appeared to be cyclical, rather than
a permanent shift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over time, we should expect to see these cyclical
headwinds abate and get replaced with tailwinds,&#8221; including
stronger global economic growth and higher interest rates, Lake
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s size allows it to withstand market lulls without
overreacting, she said, while acknowledging the possibility that
job cuts could be needed over the longer term. Rivals including
Morgan Stanley have reduced staff and Zurich-based Credit Suisse
Group AG is weighing the sale of additional stakes in an
electronic interest-rates trading unit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A four-decade-old U.S. ban on crude
exports should remain until a &#8220;saturation&#8221; point when domestic
refining capacity can&#8217;t absorb increased oil production,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining the statutory curb on shipments overseas will
deliver the &#8220;highest value&#8221; to the U.S. economy, the bank said
in an e-mailed report today. At current extraction costs, the
export ban may start to weigh on U.S. output growth in coming
years, it predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Goldman view is very credible,&#8221; said Sarah Emerson,
managing principal of ESAI Energy Inc. in Wakefield,
Massachusetts. &#8220;Refiners are processing increasing output here
and that&#8217;s a greater benefit to the economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising production from shale formations has allowed the
U.S., the world&#8217;s biggest oil consumer, to import less crude,
fueling speculation that the curb on exports could be lifted. A
1975 federal law bans most shipments overseas, with only
deliveries of refined products including gasoline and diesel
allowed. Supporters of the ban say keeping U.S.-produced oil at
home helps reduce fuel prices for industry and consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Optimal Decision&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Keeping the ban in place would be the optimal decision
until saturation is reached to maximize the contribution of the
refining sector,&#8221; said Damien Courvalin, a Goldman analyst in
New York. &#8220;Once saturation is reached, it would then be optimal
to lift the ban as value added from higher production
outperforms value added from the refining sectors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty over the future of the ban is probably delaying
investment in U.S. refining capacity, according to Goldman. Oil
companies are seeking ways around it by using simple, one-step
plants capable of turning crude into products for exports. BP
Plc signed on to take at least 80 percent of the capacity of a
new $360 million mini-refinery in Houston that will process just
enough to escape the restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IHS Inc. last month said the ban should be lifted because
the U.S. will benefit from higher oil production and reduced
gasoline prices. The nation may save an average of $67 billion a
year from its import bill in 2016 and add 964,000 jobs by 2018,
according to the Colorado-based consultant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Premature&#8217; Urgency &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The urgency of the debate has been premature,&#8221; Emerson
said. &#8220;We aren&#8217;t at the saturation point and won&#8217;t be for a
long time because there are a bunch of ways refiners are able to
transform these molecules and make products for export.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude production rose 77,000 barrels a day to 8.46
million last week, the Energy Information Administration said
today. Output reached 8.47 million barrels a day in the week
ended May 23, the most since October 1986, according to the EIA,
the Energy Department&#8217;s statistical arm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asya Katilim Bankasi AS (ASYAB), the Turkish

hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as a financial adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was hired after a board meeting to be the
Istanbul-based lender&#8217;s financial adviser in relation to its
&#8220;strategic partnership,&#8221; Bank Asya said today in a statement,
without providing further details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Asya said in March that it was in exclusive talks with
QIB for a strategic partnership, while the Qatari bank said it
was interested in taking a stake in the lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Asya was founded by followers of Fethullah Gulen, the
U.S.-based Islamic cleric blamed by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the corruption probe that implicated members of his
cabinet. The bank&#8217;s shares have climbed 62 percent since talks
with QIB were announced on March 25, after slumping following
the investigation that became public on Dec. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merger and acquisition activity in Turkey&#8217;s banking
industry is increasing as international rivals seek to tap the
country&#8217;s economic growth. Industrial  Commercial (1398) Bank of China
Ltd. agreed to buy 76 percent of Turkey&#8217;s Tekstil Bankasi AS (TEKST) for
$316 million in April, while Commercial Bank of Qatar bought
Alternatifbank AS (ALNTF) last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Asya fell 1.8 percent to 1.68 liras by 12:30 p.m. in
Istanbul, cutting its market value to 1.5 billion liras ($723
million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Asya last week issued a statement denying unspecified
&#8220;media reports,&#8221; after Hurriyet newspaper reported that state-run lender TC Ziraat Bankasi AS was interested in buying the
lender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shefter joined the company in 1996 after working as a tax

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) must defend against
accusations that it deceived consumers about the amount of
pomegranate juice in one of its beverages, as the U.S. Supreme
Court revived a lawsuit by rival drink-maker POM Wonderful LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unanimous ruling gives companies a greater role in
policing competing product labels for misleading advertisements.
The justices said private parties can press false-advertising
suits under a federal law known as the Lanham Act even when the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates a product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA &#8220;does not have the same perspective or expertise
in assessing market dynamics that day-to-day competitors
possess,&#8221; Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court. &#8220;Lanham
Act suits draw upon this market expertise by empowering private
parties to sue competitors to protect their interests on a case-by-case basis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The label on Coca-Cola&#8217;s drink says &#8220;Pomegranate Blueberry
Flavored Blend of 5 Juices,&#8221; with the first two words appearing
in larger letters. A lower court had said FDA juice-labeling
regulations authorized the Coca-Cola product&#8217;s name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POM Wonderful says the label is misleading because the
drink contains only 0.3 percent pomegranate juice and 0.2
percent blueberry juice. Apple and grape juice constitute 99
percent of the juice, POM Wonderful says. &lt;/p&gt;

POM Wonderful says the label on Coca-Cola&#8217;s &#8220;Pomegranate Blueberry Flavored Blend of 5 Juices,&#8221; is misleading because the drink contains only 0.3 percent pomegranate juice and 0.2 percent blueberry juice. POM Wonderful is separately fighting accusations over its own advertising. In a case now pending at a federal appeals court, the Federal Trade Commission says POM is deceiving consumers with claims about the health benefits of its pomegranate drinks. Close

&lt;p&gt;The calm that has descended on
financial markets has longer to run if history is any guide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having coined the phrase Great Moderation 2.0 to describe
the lull back in April, JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s John Normand is
comparing this moment to periods of tranquility over the past
three decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His findings suggest the quiescence is here to stay for a
while, meaning investors may be lulled into taking ever-greater
risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s head of foreign-exchange and international-rates
strategy in London characterizes low volatility in the currency
market as when swings in the Group of 10 major currencies slip
and stay below 7 percent on a trailing three-month basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that happened for 45 business days as of the end of
last week, the average timeframe of similar episodes since the
1980s is 150 days. They ranged in length from three months when
the Federal Reserve paused its easing of monetary policy in 2002
to almost two years during the so-called Goldilocks era of the
late 1990s when the U.S. economy was neither too hot nor too
cold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The current undershoot is quiet immature by the
historical norm,&#8221; Normand wrote in a June 6 research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More often than not, the Fed is the key. The last market
lull ran for 156 business days and ended in May 2013 with the
&#8220;taper tantrum&#8221; when Fed officials began suggesting they would
soon start slowing monthly asset purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As most would acknowledge, central bank predictability is
bearish for volatility,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The current backdrop is
textbook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the calm may continue unless U.S. inflation data
or wage pressures force the Fed into tightening policy sooner
than markets anticipate or if a geopolitical crisis blows up,
said Normand. A Bloomberg News survey of economists in May
suggested the consensus doesn&#8217;t expect the Fed to raise its
benchmark before the third quarter of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until these risks emerge &#8220;this vol undershoot has further
to run,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore and Chris Dolmetsch" date="Jun 13, 2014  7:04 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-13/former-goldman-trader-sues-to-get-20-million-in-bonuses.html"><headline>Former Goldman Trader Sues to Get $20 Million in Bonuses</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
trader who helped lead the firm&#8217;s bets against subprime
mortgages before the financial crisis asked a court to throw out
an arbitration ruling denying him more than $20 million in
unpaid compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeb Salem encountered a &#8220;kangaroo court&#8221; and a
&#8220;shocking and blatant miscarriage of justice&#8221; as Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority arbitrators didn&#8217;t allow him to
call some of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s top trading executives as
witnesses, he said in a complaint today in New York State
Supreme Court. Salem, 35, said in the complaint that members of
the industry-funded regulator&#8217;s arbitration panel called his
case &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; and &#8220;bulls---&#8221; during a hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salem left the firm in May 2012, a year after a U.S. Senate
subcommittee said he and other Goldman Sachs traders tried to
manipulate prices of derivatives linked to subprime home loans
in 2007 for their own benefit. The subcommittee&#8217;s assertions
were based in part on Salem&#8217;s discussion of an attempted short
squeeze in his self-evaluation, a finding which Salem said &#8220;put
too much emphasis on &#8216;words,&#8217;&#8221; according to the Senate report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-person Finra arbitration panel said in a March 17
decision to dismiss his case that even if the witnesses said
what Salem maintained they would, he hadn&#8217;t established a
legally enforceable claim for the bonus money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Employees trade their rights to go litigate in court and
get smart judges to review their circumstance in exchange for an
expedited hearing on the merits,&#8221; Jonathan Sack, Salem&#8217;s
lawyer, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Deeb Salem got
neither.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;A Scapegoat&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sack said his client was &#8220;used as a scapegoat&#8221; by Goldman
Sachs after criticism of the firm. Salem left the bank on his
own accord and started at New York-based hedge-fund firm
GoldenTree Asset Management LP a few months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His arbitration claim seeks $6.15 million in deferred
compensation, $10 million in &#8220;bonus true-up&#8221; for 2010 and
2011, and $5 million as a pro-rata bonus for his 2012 work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Zern, chairman of the arbitration panel, didn&#8217;t
return a phone message left at a listed number. Tiffany Galvin,
a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, said the firm
wouldn&#8217;t comment on litigation and Finra&#8217;s Michelle Ong declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company documents show Goldman Sachs traders in 2007 sought
to encourage a &#8220;short squeeze&#8221; by putting artificially low
prices on derivatives that would gain in value as mortgage
securities fell, according to a 2011 report by the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. The idea, abandoned after market
conditions worsened, was to drive holders of such credit-default
swaps to sell and help Goldman Sachs traders buy at reduced
prices, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short Squeeze &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We began to encourage this squeeze, with plans of getting
very short again,&#8221; Salem said in a 2007 self-evaluation
excerpted in the report. In interviews with the committee, Salem
denied attempting a short squeeze and &#8220;claimed that he had
wrongly worded his self-evaluation,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Salem v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 651811/2014, New
York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won
dismissal of a suit over $450 million in residential mortgage-backed securities, with a New York judge saying that the firms
that bought the bonds should have done more research beforehand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos dismissed the
claims against Goldman Sachs today, saying the investors only
reviewed data presented in offering documents for the securities
and never asked to review files for the underlying loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The true nature of the risk being assumed could,
admittedly, have been ascertained from reviewing these loan
files and plaintiffs never asked for them,&#8221; Ramos wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was among financial firms including Bank of
America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. sued over more than $1.8
billion in mortgage-backed securities in 2012 by Phoenix Light
SF Ltd., a company based in Dublin that inherited claims from
six legal entities &#8220;that collapsed or nearly collapsed,&#8221;
according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entities include WestLB, the 180-year-old German state-owned lender, based in Dusseldorf, that ceased operations in
2012 as part of European Union conditions tied to a 17 billion-euro ($23 billion) bailout after the 2008 financial crisis,
according to a complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
worst recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Request &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs said Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t share the files
for the loans underlying the securities. Ramos said there were
no allegations that that they asked for them and Goldman Sachs
denied access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It does not matter if the failure to seek this
information was because of blind faith in the process of
origination and/or securitization, or if it was attributable to
the desire to quickly get on board of what the investors thought
was a profitable bandwagon,&#8221; the judge wrote. &#8220;The obligation
of a sophisticated investor to inquire cannot be merely
excused.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan Lindell, an attorney with Robbins Geller Rudman 
Dowd LLP representing the plaintiffs in the case, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on the
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Phoenix Light SF Ltd. v. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., 652356/2013, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), Mexico&#8217;s largest
TV provider, posted the best return on the country&#8217;s benchmark
index on speculation its stake in Univision Communications Inc.
is worth more than previously estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares advanced 1.9 percent to 89.46 pesos today in
Mexico City after earlier jumping as much as 4.6 percent to the
highest intraday price since at least 1994. Mexico&#8217;s IPC stock
gauge retreated 0.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Univision, the largest Spanish-language broadcaster in the
U.S., has been contacting companies to seek a buyer for the
business and may also consider an initial public offering,
according to people familiar with the matter. Televisa has an 8
percent equity stake in Univision and debt that could be
converted into an additional 30 percent holding. Univision&#8217;s
owners, which took the company private in 2007 in a $12.3
billion leveraged buyout, are now seeking a valuation of more
than $20 billion, two people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors &#8220;can infer that Televisa&#8217;s stake in Univision is
more valuable,&#8221; Valeria Romo Martinez, an analyst at Monex Casa
de Bolsa, said today in an interview from Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Televisa didn&#8217;t return an e-mail and a

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the world&#8217;s third-largest energy producer by market value, sold its stakes in an
African oilfield and pipeline for $1.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron sold a 25 percent stake in an oil concession in
southern Chad that produced about 18,000 barrels of crude daily,
the San Ramon, California-based company said in a statement
today. That equated to less than 1 percent of Chevron&#8217;s
worldwide output last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction also involved divestiture of Chevron&#8217;s
interest in a pipeline that connects the Chadian oilfield to a
port on Cameroon&#8217;s coast. &lt;/p&gt;

half of GS Caltex Corp.&#8217;s dollar bonds this week as Goldman

yield premiums on top Korean names too tight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seoul-based oil refiner is paying a 3 percent coupon on
its $400 million of notes, the lowest yet for its sales in the
U.S. currency, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Spreads
on South Korean dollar bonds average 139 basis points more than
Treasuries this year, JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes show, the
least since 2007, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and the global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed-market money managers&#8217; search for yield, as well
as onshore investor demand, is making Korea&#8217;s dollar bonds a
less attractive bet, according to a June 12 Goldman Sachs
report. Spreads for top-rated non-financial companies are an
average 50 basis points more than their U.S. peers, compared
with 120 basis points about a year ago, the New York-based
investment bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see limited upside given the tight spreads,&#8221; analysts
led by Hong Kong-based Kenneth Ho wrote. &#8220;We see better value
elsewhere in Asia investment grade, even though we believe
search-for-yield motives will likely keep Korean spreads
tight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far East Horizon Ltd., part owned by China&#8217;s biggest
supplier of chemical products, Sinochem Group, is meeting
investors from today for a proposed dollar bond sale, people
familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified
because the details are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sales Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. sold $1 billion of Tier 2
subordinated bonds at 175 basis points more than Treasuries
yesterday, while Goodman Hong Kong Logistics Fund borrowed $400
million at a 180 basis-point spread. The issues contributed to
the $3.3 billion of sales this week, down 36 percent from the
previous five business days, Bloomberg-compiled data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring corporate and sovereign bonds against
non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region climbed to the highest in
a week today, credit-default swap prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 2 basis points to 105 basis points
as of 8:34 a.m. in Singapore, Standard Chartered Plc prices
show. The gauge is set for its highest close since June 5,
according to data provider CMA. On the week, it&#8217;s poised for a
3.8 basis-point climb after falling for the past six periods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 1 basis point to 70
as of 9:42 a.m. in Tokyo, Mizuho Securities Co. prices show. The
measure is at its highest level since June 6 and set to rise for
a fourth-straight day, the longest series of increases since
March 14, CMA data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 2 basis points to
83.75 basis points as of 10:30 a.m. in Sydney, National
Australia Bank Ltd. prices show. The benchmark, on track for its
biggest one-day gain in a week, last closed higher on June 5,
CMA data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indexes are benchmarks for insuring bonds against
default and traders use them to speculate on credit quality. A
drop signals improving perceptions of creditworthiness, while an
increase suggests the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
trader who helped lead the firm&#8217;s bets against subprime
mortgages before the financial crisis asked a court to throw out
an arbitration ruling denying him more than $20 million in
unpaid compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeb Salem encountered a &#8220;kangaroo court&#8221; and a
&#8220;shocking and blatant miscarriage of justice&#8221; as Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority arbitrators didn&#8217;t allow him to
call some of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s top trading executives as
witnesses, he said in a complaint yesterday in New York State
Supreme Court. Salem, 35, said in the complaint that members of
the industry-funded regulator&#8217;s arbitration panel called his
case &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; and &#8220;bulls---&#8221; during a hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salem left the firm in May 2012, a year after a U.S. Senate
subcommittee said he and other Goldman Sachs traders tried to
manipulate prices of derivatives linked to subprime home loans
in 2007 for their own benefit. The subcommittee&#8217;s assertions
were based in part on Salem&#8217;s discussion of an attempted short
squeeze in his self-evaluation, a finding which Salem said &#8220;put
too much emphasis on &#8216;words,&#8217;&#8221; according to the Senate report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-person Finra arbitration panel said in a March 17
decision to dismiss his case that even if the witnesses said
what Salem maintained they would, he hadn&#8217;t established a
legally enforceable claim for the bonus money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Employees trade their rights to go litigate in court and
get smart judges to review their circumstance in exchange for an
expedited hearing on the merits,&#8221; Jonathan Sack, Salem&#8217;s
lawyer, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Deeb Salem got
neither.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;A Scapegoat&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sack said his client was &#8220;used as a scapegoat&#8221; by Goldman
Sachs after criticism of the firm. Salem left the bank on his
own accord and started at New York-based hedge-fund firm
GoldenTree Asset Management LP a few months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His arbitration claim seeks $6.15 million in deferred
compensation, $10 million in &#8220;bonus true-up&#8221; for 2010 and
2011, and $5 million as a pro-rata bonus for his 2012 work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Zern, chairman of the arbitration panel, didn&#8217;t
return a phone message left at a listed number. Tiffany Galvin,
a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, said the firm
wouldn&#8217;t comment on litigation and Finra&#8217;s Michelle Ong declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company documents show Goldman Sachs traders in 2007 sought
to encourage a &#8220;short squeeze&#8221; by putting artificially low
prices on derivatives that would gain in value as mortgage
securities fell, according to a 2011 report by the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. The idea, abandoned after market
conditions worsened, was to drive holders of such credit-default
swaps to sell and help Goldman Sachs traders buy at reduced
prices, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short Squeeze &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We began to encourage this squeeze, with plans of getting
very short again,&#8221; Salem said in a 2007 self-evaluation
excerpted in the report. In interviews with the committee, Salem
denied attempting a short squeeze and &#8220;claimed that he had
wrongly worded his self-evaluation,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Salem v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 651811/2014, New
York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s PlayStation 4 beat Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Xbox One in sales of consoles in U.S. stores in May, extending its lead for a fifth month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall consumer spending on video-game hardware and software jumped 52 percent to $586 million last month, compared with a year earlier, with the PS4 retaining its sales lead as the No. 1 platform, NPD Group Inc. said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft last week began selling a lower-priced version of its Xbox One to match the $399 price of Sony&#8217;s PS4. The company had struggled to convince gamers that the $499 price tag of the console is justified. Both companies showcased new titles for the machines at the industry&#8217;s annual E3 conference earlier this month, as they gear up for the year-end holiday season. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony has led Microsoft in U.S. console sales every month since the new devices were released in November. At the E3 conference in Los Angeles, Microsoft used its entire presentation to focus on hard-core players, who were alienated by an Xbox One debut last year focused on non-game entertainment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. hardware sales in May almost doubled to $187 million, while revenue from software excluding titles for PCs gained 57 percent to $274 million. The increase in game sales was the first after six months of declines and helped overall sales jump the most since June 2008, according to NPD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate-bond buyers are
increasingly becoming stock pickers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-yield debt funds boosted their allocations to equities
to 3.2 percent in March from 3.1 percent in December and 2.1
percent at the end of 2012, Morgan Stanley (MS) data show. JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) strategists suggested others do the same, last week
advising investors to cut their credit holdings as yields
dwindle and switch to equities instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the outlook for American businesses still looks
pretty good to investors, they&#8217;re growing uneasy about owning
bonds that offer some of the lowest yields in history. That
angst is only made worse by the reduced liquidity that&#8217;s
resulted from banks pulling back in debt trading, raising
concern that the market will spiral downward when everyone tries
to sell at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see credit as relatively over-owned and valued versus
other risk assets,&#8221; JPMorgan strategists led by Jan Loeys wrote
in a June 13 report. &#8220;Investors are beginning to worry about
how the eventual exit will fare in a world of reduced market
making by banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities look more attractive because they haven&#8217;t
benefited as much as company debt from the easy-money policies
of central banks across the globe, according to the analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading Drops &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds may also be hurt more in a sell-off because
the biggest dealers are reducing their fixed-income inventories
in response to risk-curbing regulations, causing trading volumes
to drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the size of the investment-grade company-bond market
ballooned 82 percent since the end of 2008, trading volumes only
increased 72 percent in the period, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority data.
Since the end of April, an average $13 billion of the debt has
been exchanged each day, compared with $13.8 billion in the
period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That hasn&#8217;t mattered much -- at least not yet -- because
central banks have been pumping more and more stimulus into the
global economy, pushing investors into riskier assets. That&#8217;s
made for a one-way market in bonds, with few wanting to sell
investment-grade notes that have rallied 61 percent since 2008,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what happens when sentiment reverses? JPMorgan analysts
suggest investors may want to cut their credit positions before
finding out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buying Stocks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk-bond buyers earned 3.46 percentage points more than
benchmark rates to own U.S. speculative-grade securities as of
June 10, the lowest since 2007 and 2.41 percentage points lower
than the two-decade average. That means fewer potential gains
and a smaller cushion against a bear market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are indeed at that point of the cycle where one should
not expect that much more spread tightening,&#8221; the JPMorgan
strategists wrote. &#8220;We prefer to take more risk in equities and
we now cut the size of our U.S. high-yield spread trade by one-third.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers of junk-bond mutual funds seem to agree. They
increased the proportion of assets that fall outside of
benchmark indexes to 15 percent of holdings as of March from
14.6 percent in December, according to a June 6 report by Morgan
Stanley. They boosted allocations to stocks, securitized debt
and loans, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While almost all U.S. markets may look expensive right now,
equities may be a better bet than bonds when central banks
start yanking their stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is introducing a new
Internet-based service that helps companies use data analysis to
predict behavior, in a bid to gain more customers in the fast-growing field of machine learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service lets users more easily build algorithms to
predict purchasing patterns, electricity usage and more. The
work and results can be hosted on the Web through Microsoft&#8217;s
Azure cloud offering. The new product, dubbed Azure Machine
Learning, has been in a trial period for about a year and now
has about 100 customers testing it, said General Manager Eron
Kelly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, under new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella,
is trying to boost its focus on cloud software as more companies
gravitate to hosting data and other operations on the Web.
Nadella ran the cloud business before becoming CEO in February.
The Redmond, Washington-based software maker wants to bolster
usage of Azure as it tries to narrow the gap with market leader
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)&#8217;s Web Services business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning, which is an artificial intelligence field
that involves constructing systems that automatically analyze
and learn from data, has been on the rise. Even as companies
collect more information, the challenge has been how to extract
value from it. As a result, the market for analysis software is
growing about 18 percent a year and will reach $6.5 billion by
2019, according to Transparency Market Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data Scientists &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the challenges is as you create more data -- data
in and itself isn&#8217;t all that valuable,&#8221; Kelly said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
insights you can create from it, and as the datasets get larger,
it becomes harder to analyze.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said its new product can be used by full-fledged
data scientists to speed up their work, as well as by analysts
who aren&#8217;t trained in the mathematical underpinnings of the
field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s own retail stores are using the software to
predict fraud, while another unnamed retailer is analyzing past
customer purchases to decide future inventory, said Kelly.
Carnegie Mellon University is tracking weather patterns and
electricity usage in its buildings and has told Microsoft the
system will enable them to save 30 percent on energy, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will offer a public preview of the service, which
was code-named Project Passau, in July. It&#8217;s the product of work
from the company&#8217;s research unit and its data platform team,
helmed by Joseph Sirosh, a machine-leaning executive who
Microsoft hired from Amazon in July 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Soon machine learning will help to drastically reduce
wait times in emergency rooms, predict disease outbreaks and
predict and prevent crime,&#8221; Sirosh wrote in a blog post. &#8220;To
realize that future we need to make machine learning more
accessible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither South Africa&#8217;s dominant
platinum union nor the top three producers it has targeted in an
almost five-month pay strike will emerge as winner from the
standoff, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies will be left with damage to some mines and
delays while they get their workforce back up to speed, while
the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union will fall
short of delivering for members on their demands, Goldman Sachs
said in a June 13 note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union members late last week accepted a pay proposal &#8220;in
principle&#8221; from Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS), Impala Platinum
Holdings Ltd. (IMP) and Lonmin Plc. (LMI) The AMCU has said it has
conditions to put to the companies before agreeing to a deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not expecting any developments until the long
weekend is over,&#8221; Alan Fine, a Johannesburg-based spokesman
representing the producers, said in an e-mail today. June 16 is
a public holiday in South Africa. AMCU Treasurer Jimmy Gama
didn&#8217;t answer a call or respond to a text message seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The union&#8217;s members have been on strike since Jan. 23 in
support of their demand to more than double basic monthly pay to
12,500 rand ($1,165). The producers&#8217; latest offer includes wage
increases of as much as 1,000 rand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMCU members have raised conditions on issues including the
length of the agreement, back pay, increases in living-out
allowances and the reinstatement of jobs, union President Joseph Mathunjwa said at rallies last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Slightly Improved&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the deal is only slightly improved for workers
compared to the offer which was proposed within a month of the
strike,&#8221; and was accepted by the union because of pressure from
members, Eugene King, a Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote in in the
note. &#8220;Mines will be damaged as panels will have collapsed,
while organizing and retraining workers will take time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three companies said they have lost 22.8 billion rand
($2.1 billion) in revenue in the longest and costliest strike in
South Africa, source of about 70 percent of the global platinum
mined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lonmin will likely rebound strongly post-strike as
inventory can be converted to cash quickly and the mining
restart will see concentrate coming through&#8221; in the next two
months, King wrote. Impala will be confronted by delays to new
shafts following the strike, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) Chief Executive
Officer Rex Tillerson talked up his company&#8217;s prospects in
Russia, appearing in Moscow alongside OAO Rosneft (ROSN) CEO Igor Sechin, who&#8217;s been sanctioned by the U.S. government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work between Texas-based Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest oil
company by market value, and state-run Rosneft on Sakhalin
Island in Russia&#8217;s Far East provides a template for further
exploration, especially in the Arctic&#8217;s Kara Sea, Tillerson said
at the World Petroleum Congress in Moscow today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look forward to taking advances achieved in the
cutting-edge success in the Far East of Russia and building on
them to unlock new supplies of oil and gas,&#8221; Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is pursuing a global alliance with Rosneft even
after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Sechin, a close ally of
President Vladimir Putin, as part of a package to punish Russia
for annexing Crimea from Ukraine. The two companies plan to
drill a well in the Kara Sea later this year, targeting a
formation that could hold more than 8 billion barrels of oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All major projects this year are related to our joint
work with Exxon,&#8221; Sechin, who&#8217;s banned from traveling to the
U.S., said at the same event. It&#8217;s &#8220;business as usual.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson declined to comment on U.S. sanctions on Sechin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as the Sakhalin project and Kara Sea exploration,
Exxon&#8217;s alliance with Rosneft includes shale exploration in
Siberia and joint venture fields in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remoteness of the Arctic well -- four days voyage from
the nearest port in iceberg-prone seas -- means it will be among
the most expensive Exxon has ever drilled, costing at least $600
million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the raft of multi-billion-dollar mergers and acquisitions this year, a new player has entered negotiations: politicians. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two Congressional committees are studying ATT Inc. (T)&#8217;s $48.5 billion takeover of DirecTV (DTV), while Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s $45.2 billion offer for Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) faced tough questioning last month at a House hearing. Politicians are also trying to crack down on overseas mergers intended to escape U.S. corporate taxes. Across the Atlantic, U.K. lawmakers fought Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s shelved $118 billion offer for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), and their French counterparts have challenged General Electric Co. (GE)&#8217;s $17 billion bid for Alstom SA (ALO)&#8217;s power assets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the U.S. and Europe struggle with weak job creation and stalled wages, lawmakers are increasingly injecting themselves into announced mergers by raising concerns over layoffs or industries dominated by a few huge companies. Such attempts are putting some of the biggest transactions under the magnifying glass, and are likely to become more common, especially in high-profile industries like telecommunications and healthcare. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once in a blue moon, takeovers do spill into the public consciousness, and in terms of doing deals it completely changes the dynamics,&#8221; said Stephen Blackshaw, a partner in London at law firm Sidley Austin LLP. &#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt that we are in a wave of popular debate or outrage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
Director Rajat Gupta, convicted of insider trading in a scheme
masterminded by hedge fund billionaire Raj Rajaratnam, joined
his co-conspirator in a Massachusetts federal prison to begin
serving a two-year sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 65, reported today to the Federal Medical Center
Devens, where he&#8217;s assigned to a minimum-security satellite
camp, said Ed Ross, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Prisons. Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year sentence in the
complex&#8217;s medical prison. While the facilities are separate, it
is possible the two could cross paths, Ross said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta last week failed in a last-ditch effort to remain
free while he appeals his conviction. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg refused to order his continued release on bail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta today lost his appeal of a $13.9 million civil fine
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The federal
appeals court in New York upheld the fine and an order
permanently barring him from acting as an officer or director of
a public company and from associating with any broker or
investment adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highest Profile &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former McKinsey  Co. managing partner, Gupta is the
highest-profile executive convicted in a U.S. crackdown on
insider trading at hedge funds. Since August 2009, prosecutors
in the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara have
charged 86 people with insider trading, with 81 cases resulting
in convictions, mostly through guilty pleas. &lt;/p&gt;

its Xbox One to match the $399 price of Sony&#8217;s PS4. The company
had struggled to convince gamers that the $499 price tag of the
console is justified. Both companies showcased new titles for
the machines at the industry&#8217;s annual E3 conference earlier this
month, as they gear up for the year-end holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of GameStop Corp. (GME), the largest seller of consoles
and video-game titles in the U.S., rose 6.8 percent to $40.29 at
the close in New York. The Grapevine, Texas-based company is
depending on the new generation of consoles to boost sales in an
industry that&#8217;s been hurt as consumers have shifted to playing
games on social networks and mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Well Positioned&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;GameStop is well positioned to benefit from a renewed
growth period within the console video game industry driven by
adoption of the PS4 and Xbox One,&#8221; Michael Olson, an analyst at
Piper Jaffray Cos., said in a note yesterday. Past declines in
industry software sales &#8220;are largely cyclically driven and the
industry is poised to grow sustainably in late &#8217;14,&#8221; said
Olson, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the retailer&#8217;s
shares. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edita Food Industries, the Egyptian
snacks maker part-owned by buyout firm Actis LLP, is close to
hiring Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to help manage its initial
public offering, three people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, whose products include the Twinkies cake in
Egypt, may appoint a second bank to assist on the expected share
sale in Cairo, the people said, asking not to be identified as
the information is private. The IPO may be valued at about $300
million, according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egyptian companies are reviving share sales as they seek to
benefit from a more than 20 percent gain in Egypt&#8217;s benchmark
EGX 30 index this year. A $110 million IPO of Arabian Cement
last month, the country&#8217;s first since the 2011 uprisings,
received $1.5 billion in bids from institutional and individual
investors, according to EFG-Hermes Holding SAE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edita is the largest independent snack food business in
North Africa, Actis said in June 2013 when it bought a $102
million stake in the company. Representatives at London-based
Actis and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Edita officials did
not immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big trend among the young and
restless in New York this summer is to bash Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. interns on Yik Yak, an anonymous social-media app. The big
trend for analysts covering Goldman is to bash the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average rating on Goldman Sachs shares has fallen to
3.21, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that assigns a
score of 5 to ratings of buy or the equivalent, 3 to holds and 1
to sells. Apart from some similar scores earlier this year,
Goldman&#8217;s rating has never been lower in data starting in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#8217;s a sample of the ribbing the summer associates are
taking on Yik Yak: &#8220;GS interns clap when the plane lands.&#8221;
Here&#8217;s a sample of what analysts are saying about Goldman Sachs:
Trading revenue from fixed income, commodities and currencies
will drop 16 percent this quarter, according to Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co.&#8217;s Brad Hintz, who on June 5 cut his second-quarter earnings estimates by 8 percent to $3.35 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slump in Goldman&#8217;s ratings, not to mention the 6
percent drop in its stock this year, is a casualty of the
pervasive calm that has overtaken financial markets and sent
measures of volatility in various asset classes to multi-year,
if not record, lows. Citigroup Inc. has warned of a drop of as
much as 25 percent in second-quarter trading revenue and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) estimated a 20 percent decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Never Move&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn said at an investor
conference last month: &#8220;What drives activity in our business is
volatility. If markets never move or don&#8217;t move, our clients
really don&#8217;t need to transact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average predict Goldman&#8217;s earnings per share
before unusual items will slide 16 percent this quarter, 2
percent next quarter and 9 percent in the final three months of
the year before rebounding 8 percent in all of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s 3.21 analyst rating ranks the stock 68th among 83
financial stocks in the SP 500 and 14 percent below the average
3.72. Banks less reliant on trading revenue are faring better.
JPMorgan Chase ranks 11th among financials with a 4.3 rating;
Citigroup&#8217;s is 4.1; Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo  Co. are
each at about 3.9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the entire SP 500, Goldman&#8217;s consensus rating ranks it
440th and 16 percent below the average of 3.84. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman&#8217;s shares outperformed the benchmark stock
index by more than 9 percentage points in 2013 and 28 percentage
points in 2012, its 139 percent return including dividends is
far behind the SP 500&#8217;s 220 percent return and an almost 300
percent jump for financial shares since the start of the bull
market in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&#8217;t blame the summer interns for that. Even if,
according to Yik Yak, they all wait for the light to change
before crossing the street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Billy Chan and Vinicy Chan" date="Jun 17, 2014  4:09 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-17/macau-cuts-chinese-visitor-transit-stays-in-visa-abuse-crackdown.html"><headline>Macau Tightens Chinese Visitor Stays in Visa-Abuse Crackdown</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Macau will reduce the maximum number
of days that Chinese passport holders with transit visas can
stay in the city to five from seven, in an attempt to prevent
them from abusing the law. Casino shares dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transit visitors from China who don&#8217;t depart for another
destination within the five days will be in violation of the new
rules, effective July 1, and will be penalized upon their next
visit, the city&#8217;s Public Security Police Force said in a
statement yesterday. Repeat violations will result in denial of
entry, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese tourists have been driving the revenue of casino
companies in the world&#8217;s largest gambling hub, including Sands
China Ltd. (1928) and Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) They are
competing for gamblers by adding malls, theaters and restaurants
at their resorts. An improved rail connection and an increase in
hotel rooms are helping draw more vacationing Chinese to Macau
and the country&#8217;s only legal casinos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not think this new policy will have a measurable
impact on gaming revenue,&#8221; Grant Govertsen at investment bank
Union Gaming Group said today. &#8220;It is important to keep in mind
that most high-value casino customers typically come to Macau
about four times per year.&#8221; Most visitors to Macau only stay a
day or two, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainland Chinese tourists accounted for two-thirds of the
total visitors to Macau in the first quarter, according to
government data. Travelers to the Chinese city stayed for less
than two days on average in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High-Stakes Segment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282) fell 1.4 percent to close at HK$24
in Hong Kong trading, while Wynn Macau Ltd. dropped 2.4 percent
and Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. declined 2.7 percent. Sands
China and SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) dropped 1.4 percent and 1 percent,
while Galaxy lost 1 percent. Hong Kong&#8217;s benchmark Hang Seng
Index fell 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulatory change &#8220;aims to prevent Chinese passport
holders from using transit as an excuse to stay in Macau, when
they actually have not gone to their destination,&#8221; the
government department said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, 2.08 million mainland Chinese arriving in Macau
using a transit visa didn&#8217;t go on to a third-party country,
representing 11.2 percent of total mainland Chinese visitors for
the year, Union Gaming&#8217;s Govertsen wrote in a note last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casino operators in Macau are expanding their footprint in
the city. Galaxy is spending HK$20 billion ($2.6 billion) on the
resort&#8217;s second phase in the increasingly popular Cotai area.
The project is slated to add as many as 500 gaming tables and
1,300 rooms at JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macau casino revenue rose 9.3 percent to 32.4 billion
patacas ($4.1 billion) last month, according to data on the
website of the city&#8217;s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point72 Asset Management LP, Steven
A. Cohen&#8217;s family office, hired Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. prime
broker Seiji Onoe to head its Japan operations, said a person
with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onoe will start his new job at the successor company to
Cohen&#8217;s hedge-fund firm SAC Capital Advisors LP in July, said
the person, who asked not to be identified as the information is
private. Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Point72 at Sard
Verbinnen  Co. in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees are leaving global banks, which are facing
tighter regulatory and public scrutiny on capital, trading
activities and compensation after the 2008 global financial
crisis. Against this backdrop, such moves can be considered
rational career management decisions, whereas seven or eight
years ago they could have been more negatively perceived, said
Paul Smith, the CFA Institute&#8217;s Asia-Pacific managing director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Opportunities in the banking sector are becoming harder
to come by as traditional forms of financing continue to be
squeezed by a combination of increasing regulation, the need to
deleverage balance sheets and investors&#8217; lack of trust and
confidence in the sector,&#8221; Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onoe will oversee the Stamford, Connecticut-based company&#8217;s
Japan staff, including fund managers and analysts, in the newly
created position, the person said. He will be responsible for
business development, regulatory compliance, professional
development and performance management of the Japan team, said
the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Millennium Hire &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among others, Millennium Management LLC hired Kazutoshi Ohkubo, former Barclays Plc head of Japan equities, as chief
executive officer for its business in the country, two people
with knowledge of the matter said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAC agreed in November to pay a record $1.8 billion and
plead guilty to securities fraud to settle allegations of
insider trading. As part of the settlement, Cohen agreed to
close SAC and return client money. Point72 oversees about $10
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onoe spent more than 10 years at Goldman Sachs, most
recently as an executive director for prime brokerage sales in
Tokyo. He also worked on the equity sales team, said the person.
Banks&#8217; prime brokerage units provide services to hedge funds
such as clearing trades, lending stocks and cash, and linking
them to potential investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moore Capital &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miyako Takebe, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment, citing a company policy of not confirming
departures. Onoe could not immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Glynn, a former Morgan Stanley managing director,
joined Moore Capital Management LLC as a Hong Kong-based fund
manager, Sharron Silvers, a spokeswoman at Burson-Marsteller in
New York for the hedge-fund firm with $14.9 billion of assets
and run by Louis Moore Bacon confirmed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glynn, Asia-Pacific head of fixed income at his resignation
in March, spent 14 years at the Wall Street bank, Nick Footitt,
a Hong Kong-based spokesman said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toontown Online, loosely based on the 1988 Walt Disney Co. (DIS) film &#8220;Who Framed Roger Rabbit,&#8221; was a multiplayer Internet game for kids and families that drew more than 1 million users after it was introduced in 2003. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney shut it down last year amid a shift away from subscription-based games. Now, it&#8217;s getting a second life thanks to fans who have created a knockoff version without the company&#8217;s permission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the original game, animal characters called Toons tried to prevent the takeover of their town by corporate robots called Cogs. After Disney closed Toontown Online in September to focus on other projects, about two dozen developers, many in high school or college, created Toontown Rewritten. The site is flourishing: traffic has grown so fast that users have to wait in line to play, according to the 16-year-old project leader. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re all just a bunch of nostalgic players who think that the game deserves to live a little longer,&#8221; said the teenager, Joey Ziolkowski, in a telephone interview from his parents&#8217; home in Princess Anne, Maryland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether to allow Toontown Rewritten to continue is a tricky decision for Disney. If the company lets Ziolkowski and his collaborators keep going, it builds goodwill with fans. On the other hand, Disney may want to sell the content in the future, and the company could suffer reputational damage if something bad happens to players online, according to Scott Landsbaum, a copyright attorney in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deeb Salem, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader who said he helped the bank earn more than $7 billion, wants to be paid the almost $5 million difference between his 2010 bonus and what he told his mother to expect. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salem said in an arbitration hearing that he was led to believe that his 2010 bonus would be $13 million, down from a $15 million award for 2009 when he was paid more than Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein. Instead, Salem said his bonus was unfairly docked because of a written warning he received about his 2007 self-evaluation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salem, 35, said the $8.25 million bonus for 2010 didn&#8217;t reflect his contributions, while Goldman Sachs argued he was aware that the firm could pay him whatever it wished and that the company considered his conduct in determining compensation. Salem said promises from executives kept him around for another year before a $3 million bonus led him to jump to a hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Let&#8217;s be very clear: I was one of the most sought-after investment professionals in the mortgage industry,&#8221; Salem said during the Feb. 25 hearing. &#8220;I had the opportunity throughout the course of my career and throughout -- from that day, from almost every month that I was at Goldman, to leave for other opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cellectis (ALCLS) shares rose 76 percent,
the most ever, after Pfizer Inc. (PFE) bought rights to the French
company&#8217;s experimental CAR-T projects, following Novartis AG (NOVN)
into a new area of cancer immune therapy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will give Cellectis $80 million upfront, plus
milestone payments of as much as $185 million for each product
that hits certain development and commercial targets, the
drugmakers said in a statement today. New York-based Pfizer also
agreed to buy about 10 percent of the French biotechnology
company&#8217;s capital through newly issued shares at 9.25 euros
apiece, 49 percent above yesterday&#8217;s close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellectis gained the most since the stock began trading in
2007, rising to 10.94 euros in Paris, giving the company a
market value of 274 million euros ($372 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal sets up a challenge between Pfizer and Novartis,
the world&#8217;s two biggest drugmakers. The Swiss company is already
testing a CAR-T therapy, which involves taking T cells from
blood, engineering them to identify proteins on cancer cells,
then putting them into the body to seek and destroy a tumor.
Technology from Cellectis will simplify the delicate process of
engineering those cells, Pfizer said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is &#8220;an important step toward realizing the
full potential of this technology in harnessing the body&#8217;s own
immune system to fight cancer,&#8221; Andre Choulika, chairman and
chief executive officer of Cellectis, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bezos Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juno Therapeutics Inc., founded last year, is also testing
drug candidates with a similar approach. The U.S. biotechnology
company counts Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos among its
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Immune oncology is a very hot segment,&#8221; Arnaud Guerin, a
Nantes, France-based analyst at Portzamparc Societe de Bourse,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Everybody wants to be here. But
it&#8217;s a very risky area.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAR-T technology developed by Cellectis hasn&#8217;t been
tested in people yet, Guerin said, so it&#8217;s difficult to assess
whether the project will be a success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will pay research and development costs for targets
in the collaboration, and Cellectis is also eligible for tiered
royalties. The Paris-based company will open a site in the U.S.
to work more closely with Pfizer scientists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAR-T refers to Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell
immunotherapies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan Hatzius, chief economist at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said Federal Reserve meeting
participants could increase their forecasts for interest rates
for 2015 and 2016 from their view in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is an economic argument for the dots to move up
slightly,&#8221; Hatzius said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
&#8220;The inflation numbers have been a little firmer, and the labor
market numbers have generally been good. So you could see a
slight move upward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Open Market Committee, which releases its
policy statement as well as forecasts at 2 p.m. today, has
scaled back its monthly asset purchases in $10 billion
increments at four consecutive meetings since December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chair Janet Yellen, who holds a press conference today, has
said the FOMC will look at a wide range of data in determining
when to raise its benchmark interest rate from zero. At a press
conference in March, she warned against paying too much
attention to the forecasts, which are depicted as dots on a
chart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A change in the composition of the FOMC &#8220;might argue for
more stability and the discussion around the long-term neutral
rate is probably also a reason to expect if at all only a very
small upward move in the 2015 and 2016 dots,&#8221; Hatzius said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Investment Management Co. has argued central banks
will keep interest rates at a &#8220;new neutral&#8221; rate because of
slower global growth, with more stable top speeds. Fed officials
have lowered their long-run estimate for U.S. growth to 2.2
percent to 2.3 percent in March from 2.5 percent to 2.8 percent
in January 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG), Europe&#8217;s
second-biggest carmaker, rose the most in four months after an
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the manufacturer has
been able to charge more for vehicles because of new models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives from Peugeot &#8220;highlighted significant
progress&#8221; in its earnings-revival strategy during recent
meetings, Justine Dingley, a London-based analyst at Goldman,
said in a research report dated yesterday. An industrywide focus
on profitability, &#8220;along with PSA&#8217;s attractive model portfolio,
has helped it to improve price realization in Europe,&#8221; and to
narrow the first-half loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peugeot jumped as much as 6.7 percent, the steepest
intraday gain since Feb. 21, and was trading up 4.2 percent at
10.44 euros at 5:17 p.m. in Paris. The stock has gained 34
percent this year, valuing the carmaker at 8.16 billion euros
($11.1 billion). Jonathan Goodman, a spokesman at the company,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carmaker sold 3 billion euros in stock earlier this
year, and brought in Chinese partner Dongfeng Motor Corp. and
the French state as investors, to finance a turnaround. Chief
Executive Officer Carlos Tavares&#8217;s strategy includes investing
in hybrid drives, reorganizing operations in South America and
Russian and scaling back the model lineup while turning the DS
badge, currently a unit of the Citroen nameplate, into a full-fledged premium auto brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in Paris, has been unprofitable since
mid-2011, hurt by a contraction in Europe&#8217;s car market that led
to a two-decade low in industrywide demand last year. The
company&#8217;s sales in the region rose 4.2 percent in May, helped by
demand for the 2008 compact sport-utility vehicle and 308
hatchback. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd. and
PineBridge Investments said South Korean global corporate debt
is still attractive, even as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
recommended shunning yield premiums near a seven-year low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowers have sold $20.5 billion of international bonds
this year, shy of the record $21 billion in the first half of
2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Korea Gas Corp.,
Kookmin Bank and Korea National Oil Corp. are holding investor
meetings this week for possible dollar- or euro-denominated note
offerings, people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&#8217;s sovereign default risk fell to a lowest since
2008 this month and the won reached the strongest in almost six
years as investors show confidence in Asia&#8217;s fourth-largest
economy, which the central bank forecasts will grow at its
fastest pace in five years in 2015. A global hunt for yield has
driven &#8220;profound&#8221; outperformance of Korea credit, making other
Asian bonds seem better value, Goldman Sachs wrote in a report
this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are active participants in Korean paper,&#8221; Stephen Chang, head of Asian fixed income in Hong Kong at JPMorgan Asset
said on June 12. &#8220;Korean credit spread levels are still
attractive versus U.S. investment grade,&#8221; he said, adding that
decisions on whether to buy new issues depend on valuations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Warning &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korean investment-grade notes yield 2.13 percent on
average, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.
That compares with 1.49 percent for corporate bonds from
developed markets, a Merrill Lynch and Pacific Investment
Management Co. measure shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average premium for dollar bonds sold by Korean issuers
over U.S. Treasuries has contracted 37 basis points this year to
124 on June 17. It touched 121 on April 25, the least since July
2007, JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The outperformance of Korea has been profound,&#8221; Goldman
Sachs analysts led by Kenneth Ho wrote in a June 12 report. &#8220;We
retain our negative view, because we see better value elsewhere
in Asia investment grade, even though we believe that search for
yield motives will likely keep Korea spreads tight,&#8221; Ho said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have been seeking extra yield after rates sunk
globally as the world&#8217;s major central banks held key lending
rates near zero and enacted unprecedented monetary easing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High Quality &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While credit spreads of Korean bonds may look tight, the
volatility of them is also very low,&#8221; Arthur Lau, head of Asia
ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge in Kong Kong, which oversees
about $71 billion, said in June 13 interview. &#8220;The high credit
quality nature of Korean bonds also appeals to many long-term
investors who are looking for stable and predictable returns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 90-day historical volatility of Korean sovereign dollar
debt maturing in April 2019 has fallen to 2.82 percent from as
high as 14.46 percent in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global investors are seeking higher yields in longer-maturity bonds. The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year
U.S. Treasuries over five-year securities contracted 38 basis
points to 91 this year, Bloomberg-compiled data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now seems like a good time to sell long-dated dollar
bonds,&#8221; Lee Sang Wook, a spokesperson for Korea Gas based in
Seongnam near Seoul, said by phone on June 17. &#8220;We are
considering sales for refinancing maturing debt and possible
overseas use.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Korea Oil, Kookmin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea National Oil is mulling offshore issuance to
refinance debt, Choi Hong Seok, a spokesperson for the Anyang,
South Korea-based company, said by phone on yesterday. Kookmin
Bank declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The won touched 1,015.25 per dollar, the strongest level
since August 2008, on June 10. Its 2.67 percent advance this
year is the second biggest among emerging-market currencies.
Ten-year won-denominated government bond yields have fallen 21
basis points since March 31 to 3.305 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps insuring South Korea&#8217;s sovereign debt
against non-payment for five years fell to 49.5 basis points on
June 6, the lowest close since January 2008, according to data
provider CMA. That compared with 68.5 basis points for China,
whose sovereign debt is rated Aa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service,
the same as South Korea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign-currency corporate bond sales rose 52 percent this
year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Demand has been driven by
onshore and offshore investors and a drop in net issuance,
Goldman Sachs said. Borrowers face more than $47 billion of
maturing offshore bonds this year, almost double the $26.7
billion in 2013, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in the north-east Asian country increased
holdings of Korean paper to $20.5 billion as of end-March,
compared with $11.95 billion at the end of 2010, according to a
May statement from the Bank of Korea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Supply of Korean bonds is expected to be limited this
year,&#8221; PineBridge&#8217;s Lau said. &#8220;There may be room for spreads
to tighten further.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Ksenia Galouchko and Vladimir Kuznetsov" date="Jun 18, 2014 10:42 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-18/traders-pare-bets-for-cuts-as-goldman-notes-risks-russia-credit.html"><headline>Traders Pare Bets for Russia Cuts as Goldman Notes Risk</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Traders are scaling back bets for
lower interest rates in Russia over the next three months after
the central bank warned that inflation threatens to drive
borrowing costs higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping the benchmark at 7.5 percent two days ago,
policy makers led by Chairman Elvira Nabiullina said they could
raise rates if &#8220;inflation risks materialize.&#8221; The market is
&#8220;prematurely&#8221; pricing in cuts from the third quarter as food
drives consumer-price growth to the highest level since 2011,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a June 16 report. The discount
on three-month forward-rate agreements fell to 24 basis points
below the MosPrime rate from 63 at the end of last week as bets
on lower borrowing costs eased, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the central bank expects the economy to expand the
least since 2009 this year amid international sanctions slapped
on Russia because of its incursion into Ukraine, inflation
accelerated last month led by food prices after a ban on imports
of pork from the European Union. A rate increase remains a risk
before the central bank &#8220;begins a cautious rate-cutting cycle&#8221;
in the fourth quarter, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The central bank clearly showed that it&#8217;s absolutely
indifferent to economic growth, that inflation is its top
priority,&#8221;Oleg Kouzmin, an economist for Russia and the
Commonwealth of Independent States at Renaissance Capital in
Moscow, said by phone yesterday. &#8220;There was no rate hike but
the statement was extremely hawkish.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Toughest&#8217; Statement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kouzmin, who worked as a consultant to the central bank&#8217;s
monetary policy department until last year, said it was the
&#8220;toughest&#8221; statement he&#8217;d seen from the regulator. Renaissance
extended its outlook for a rate cut to the fourth quarter of
2014 from the third after the comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the outlook for lower borrowing costs helped reduce
the extra yield on two-year government ruble bonds over Bank
Rossii&#8217;s main rate to 67 basis points last week, matching the
lowest gap of the past nine months, the spread was at 70 basis
points as of 6:14 p.m. in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank has raised its benchmark by 200 basis
points since February as the standoff with the U.S. and its
allies over Ukraine intensified. Nabiullina told reporters in
Moscow on June 16 she&#8217;s &#8220;very concerned&#8221; about economic growth
declining &#8220;steadily&#8221; and an increase in the inflation, now 7.6
percent. Russia&#8217;s economy will expand as much as 0.4 percent
this year before recovering &#8220;slowly&#8221; to 0.9 percent next year
and 1.9 percent in 2016, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bank Reliance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Risks to the policy rate in the short term are to the
upside,&#8221; Goldman economists Clemens Grafe and Andrew Matheny
wrote in the note. &#8220;The government bond curve has been pricing
too many rate cuts over too short of a period of time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even amid caution about inflation, the central bank would
be too worried about exacerbating the worsening cash shortage
among lenders to raise interest rates, according to Konstantin Nemnov, who helps manage $3 billion as the head of fixed income
at TKB BNP Paribas Investment Partners in St. Petersburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian lenders have become more reliant on the central
bank for funding as foreign investors are deterred by the
escalating crisis in Ukraine. Central bank loans comprised 8.2
percent of the banking industry&#8217;s funding as of June 1, an
increase from 5.4 percent at the start of 2013, its data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble is the third-worst performing developing-nation
currency this year, down 4.8 percent versus the dollar. It has
risen 1 percent this month, the second best in emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VTB Capital&#8217;s chief economist for Russia, Vladimir Kolychev, expects a 50 basis-point rate cut in the fourth
quarter as inflation will dip below 6 percent this year. A
further 50 basis points will follow in the first and second
quarters of 2015, he said by phone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is expecting rate cuts this year, but less
than a week ago,&#8221; Vladimir Miklashevsky, a strategist at Danske
Bank A/S in Helsinki, said by e-mail yesterday. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s clear
that the central bank is undoubtedly taking a hawkish stance, at
least through the summer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s asset-management unit bought a San Francisco property from Jamestown
LP in a $415 million deal that includes offices, a hotel and a
development site, said two people with knowledge of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase of 22 Fourth St. near Union Square closed
today, said the people, who asked not to be named because the
transaction is private. JPMorgan will acquire 430,000 square
feet (40,000 square meters) in two buildings known as Pacific
Place, as well as a land parcel, the people said. Tenants
include the 198-room Hotel Palomar, software maker Intuit Inc.
and retailers Old Navy, Levi&#8217;s and the Container Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa Shuffield, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment. Jamestown, a closely held real
estate investment firm based in Atlanta, confirmed the sale
without naming the buyer or price in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco&#8217;s office market is luring property investors
after a surge in leasing demand led by technology companies
pushed rents up 70 percent since 2010, according to Jones Lang
LaSalle Inc. The metropolitan area has California&#8217;s lowest
unemployment rate at 4.3 percent and an economy that has added
jobs each month for almost five years, state labor data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very strong market, with tons of tenant activity
driving investment activity,&#8221; Grant Lammersen, a sales broker
at Cushman  Wakefield Inc. with a waterfront office listing at
188 Embarcadero, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Salesforce Tower &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com Inc. in April agreed to lease 714,000 square
feet in a skyscraper being built by Boston Properties Inc. that
will be the city&#8217;s tallest and named for San Francisco-based
Salesforce, the biggest maker of customer-management software. A
unit of Shenzhen, China-based developer Genzon Property Group
Co. last month bought a majority stake in 225 Bush St. offices
in the financial district, in a deal valued at $350 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Place, two blocks from Union Square&#8217;s cluster of
upscale shops and theaters, has 202,000 square feet of offices
fully leased to Mountain View, California-based Intuit&#8217;s
Demandforce unit and 200 feet (61 meters) of retail frontage on
Market Street, Jamestown said. The area is the main transit
corridor for city buses and Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, the
regional subway and rail system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The addition of a signature tenant like Intuit and its
long-term lease created an attractive investment for a buyer,&#8221;
Jamestown Chief Operating Officer Michael Phillips said in the
statement. &#8220;We remain committed to the San Francisco Bay Area
as we are very engaged in the community through our other local
properties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan buys properties on behalf of institutional
investors through its Global Real Assets business. The unit, run
by Joe Azelby, invests and manages in real estate,
infrastructure and maritime assets around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastdil Secured LLC was the listing broker for Jamestown. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deeb Salem, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader who said he helped the bank earn more than $7 billion, wants to be paid the almost $5 million difference between his 2010 bonus and what he told his mother to expect. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salem said in an arbitration hearing that he was led to believe that his 2010 bonus would be $13 million, down from a $15 million award for 2009 when he was paid more than Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein. Instead, Salem said his bonus was unfairly docked because of a written warning he received about his 2007 self-evaluation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salem, 35, said the $8.25 million bonus for 2010 didn&#8217;t reflect his contributions, while Goldman Sachs argued he was aware that the firm could pay him whatever it wished and that the company considered his conduct in determining compensation. Salem said promises from executives kept him around for another year before a $3 million bonus led him to jump to a hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Let&#8217;s be very clear: I was one of the most sought-after investment professionals in the mortgage industry,&#8221; Salem said during the Feb. 25 hearing. &#8220;I had the opportunity throughout the course of my career and throughout -- from that day, from almost every month that I was at Goldman, to leave for other opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After helping Mexico sell 100-year
bonds overseas for the first time in 2010, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. is seeking to do the same for Colombia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Andean nation may issue the notes later this year after
the New York-based bank offered to arrange the sale, Finance
Minister Mauricio Cardenas said June 11. Goldman Sachs helped
underwrite Mexico&#8217;s offering of dollar bonds due 2110 as well as
its pound-denominated century bonds in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia is seeking to exploit soaring demand for its
longer-maturity debt as its economy grows twice as fast as the
regional average and the Federal Reserve reiterates that
interest rates will stay low for a &#8220;considerable time&#8221; after
it stops buying bonds. Yields on Colombia&#8217;s $2 billion of bonds
due in 2044, its longest-term notes, have plunged 0.67
percentage point to 4.98 percent since they were issued Jan. 21.
That&#8217;s more than the average 0.48 percentage point decline in
long-dated bonds with the same rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Colombia shines in the midst of underperforming economies
in emerging markets, and investors are noticing,&#8221; Mario Castro,
a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc, said by phone from New
York. &#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt there&#8217;s appetite for Colombia risk, and
Colombia would be getting long-term financing at still very low
yields.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t answer calls and messages seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;General Receptiveness&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia would use funds from a sale to cover its 2015
financing needs, Cardenas told investors at the June 11
presentation. Goldman Sachs proposed a reference yield of around
5.7 percent for a Colombian 100-year debt offering, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Mexico&#8217;s $2.68 billion of bonds due 2110 have
fallen 0.67 percentage point this year to 5.55 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico, whose BBB+ rating from Standard  Poor&#8217;s is one
level higher than Colombia&#8217;s, is the only nation to have issued
100-year notes in both dollars and pounds. China and the central
bank of the Philippines sold $100 million of century bonds in
1996 and 1997, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has been a general receptiveness to longer
maturities recently,&#8221; Michael Roche, an emerging-market
strategist at Seaport Group LLC, said by telephone from New
York. &#8220;Institutional investors, particularly pension funds and
insurance companies, generally have a need for longer
duration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growth Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s economy will grow 4.5 percent this year,
compared with an average expansion of 2.7 percent in Latin
America, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.
The economy expanded 6.4 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, the national statistics agency said today, higher
than the 5.2 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso advanced 0.4 percent to 1,882.50 per dollar at the
close today in Bogota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s sale of 30-year bonds in January attracted
$4.2 billion in bids, according to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government plans $3 billion in overseas debt offerings
next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Appetite for Colombia&#8217;s last bond sale was huge, and that
shows there definitely is willingness to invest in the
country,&#8221; said Nomura&#8217;s Castro. Selling a century bond would be
&#8220;another step in positioning Colombia in the international
capital market. It&#8217;s an exclusive club.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian stocks have been so volatile
amid the turmoil in Ukraine that it took a bull market to
convince JPMorgan Chase  Co. that it&#8217;s time to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s upgrade from sell yesterday follows a 21 percent
advance in the benchmark Micex Index (INDEXCF) from its bear-market low in
March. Stocks are rallying as President Vladimir Putin signals
that he&#8217;s willing to work with Ukraine&#8217;s new leader, reducing
concern that Russia will face more sanctions. Bank of America
Corp., which has had a buy rating on Russian stocks since
September, reiterated its bullish view on June 17. Deutsche Bank
AG strategist John-Paul Smith predicted a rebound six weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The two key catalysts are the fading of the Ukraine
crisis and the shift in positioning,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts
including David Aserkoff and Christian Kern wrote in a report on
June 18. &#8220;Global emerging-market funds are underweight for the
first time since 2009. The emerging-market value trade seems to
be working, which should benefit Russia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts raised their rating on Russian shares to
overweight after cutting it to underweight on March 6 as Putin
began the annexation of Crimea. The Micex entered a bull market
on June 6. The gauge&#8217;s 30-day historical volatility, a measure
of price swings, reached a five-year high of 46.2 percent on
April 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ukraine Conflict &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko yesterday reiterated a
plan to end fighting in the country&#8217;s southeast region after
talks with Putin. The Micex gained for the second day, rising
0.7 percent to 1,504.23 by 8:20 a.m. in New York. The Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian companies in
the U.S. jumped 1.9 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Russia still provides better value than other emerging
markets,&#8221; David Hauner, a strategist at Bank of America, said
in a telephone interview from London yesterday. &#8220;The risk
reward is not as high as it was a couple of months ago, but our
view on global equities is positive and Russia will outperform
the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, the Deutsche Bank strategist who predicted Russia&#8217;s
1998 stock-market crash and had been bearish on the country for
more than three years, said in May that investors were
overreacting to the conflict in Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s second-biggest oil producer OAO Lukoil (LUKOY), eastern
Europe&#8217;s biggest lender OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) and Russia&#8217;s second-biggest
mobile phone company OAO Megafon (MFON) are among JPMorgan&#8217;s top
emerging-market stock picks, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aserkoff in London and Kantarovich in Moscow weren&#8217;t
available for comment on the timing of their overweight
recommendation when contacted by phone and e-mail outside
regular business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Pretty Negative&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley raised Russian stocks to overweight on May 8
before Ukraine elected Poroshenko. Citigroup Inc. has an
overweight recommendation on Russia in its global emerging
markets portfolio, according to a report this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital Economics Ltd., in an e-mailed research note
yesterday, said it is &#8220;relatively downbeat on the outlook for
Russian equities&#8221; and expects stocks and the ruble to fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our view on the Russian market is pretty negative,&#8221; Liza Ermolenko, a London-based emerging-market economist at Capital
Economics, said by phone yesterday. &#8220;While the economy is
slowing, no one really knows what is next in the Ukraine crisis
and whether further sanctions against Russia will be approved.
The Russian market is very sensitive to the Ukraine crises, and
there is no quick solution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;International Sanctions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine will call a unilateral cease-fire to help end three
months of fighting with pro-Russian separatists, Poroshenko said
in Kiev yesterday. Insurgents will be given a limited window to
lay down their arms, with those who haven&#8217;t committed any
serious crimes to be offered an amnesty and safe passage out of
the country, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and European Union have imposed sanctions
including travel bans and asset freezes on Putin allies in
Russia and Ukraine to punish the country for its standoff with
Ukraine. Russia&#8217;s gross domestic product grew 0.9 percent in the
first quarter from the same period in 2013, the slowest pace in
a year, the Federal State Statistics Service said on May 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the $2 trillion economy was stalling before the
sanctions, the U.S. and EU have warned the nation faces further
penalties if fails to de-escalate the conflict. Ukraine and
Russia are also in conflict over gas, with Russia cutting off
supplies on June 16 because of unpaid bills. The International
Monetary Fund said April 30 that Russia is already in recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micex trades at 5.4 times estimated 12-month earnings,
compared with a ratio of 15.5 for India&#8217;s SP BSE Sensex Index,
10.7 for Brazil&#8217;s Ibovespa and 7.6 for the Shanghai Composite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
the index futures, was little changed today, while RTS stock-index futures increased 1.6 percent to 132,920 yesterday. The
Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the biggest U.S.-traded exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, rose 2.6 percent to
$26.88. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects headline, lead to show target will be difficult to achieve; Adds comments from Sago in fourth paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs Japan Co. said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&#8217;s goal to have women in 30 percent of management jobs by 2020 will be difficult to achieve, citing a lack of candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We now recruit exactly the same numbers of men and women,&#8221; Shigeharu Suzuki, chairman of Daiwa Securities Group, said yesterday in a diversity forum held at Bloomberg&#8217;s Tokyo offices. &#8220;That was not the case in the past and unfortunately we are not going to reach the target because we don&#8217;t have enough people in the pipeline. Even if we promoted at an even rate, we would be around 15 percent or maybe a touch above by 2020.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Katsunori Sago, deputy president of Goldman Sachs Japan who is also co-chairman of the bank&#8217;s diversity committee in Asia, said his firm faced similar difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I agree completely with Mr. Suzuki. It&#8217;s a difficult proposition,&#8221; Sago said at the same event. &#8220;In an industry where women have been active for a while, 30 percent is a target that is possible to reach. On the other hand, in the financial industry and in manufacturing, the proportion of women is low. It is difficult.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Labor Challenges &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The comments reflect the challenges for Abe in drawing more women into jobs to maintain a labor force that is forecast to shrink as much as 42 percent by 2060 as the population ages. Japan&#8217;s workforce would swell by more than seven million people and output would jump if participation by women equaled that of men, Goldman Sachs said in its latest &#8220;Womenomics&#8221; report on May 6. Gender Equality Minister Masako Mori has said the bureaucracy will only reach Abe&#8217;s target by recruiting people from outside. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If people say they can&#8217;t do it, then we will never reach it,&#8221; Mori said at the same event in response to the comments by Suzuki and Sago. &#8220;There are all sorts of excuses about why it can&#8217;t be done, but I want you to keep on trying.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daiwa has introduced support measures for working mothers over the past decade, include extending childcare leave and shorter worker hours for those with children until the third year of elementary school. That has boosted its proportion of female managers to 7.2 percent this year from 2.3 percent a decade ago, Suzuki said, citing documents prepared by Daiwa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Science Graduates &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The target could be harder to reach for companies in other fields, he said. &#8220;If you look at manufacturers, they need science graduates. There are very few women science graduates, so the pool of candidates is not there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mori detailed the government&#8217;s efforts to promote women in her presentation, including a push to offer 400,000 more childcare spots by 2018. In a draft growth strategy released on June 16, the government said it would consider a new law detailing strategies for reaching the 30 percent target in national and local government and private business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Sago said setting ambitious targets for female participation in the workforce was effective in itself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we should quibble about the actual figure,&#8221; said Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Sago, who is leaving his post this month and will serve as an advisory director. &#8220;If you deliberately promote people early or promote unsuitable people in an attempt to look good, it can have a negative effect on diversity in the long term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Edvard Pettersson and Sophia Pearson" date="Jun 20, 2014  5:39 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-20/exxon-chevron-sued-by-pennsylvania-over-gas-additive.html"><headline>Exxon, Chevron Sued by Pennsylvania Over Gas Additive</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX)
were among oil companies accused by Pennsylvania of polluting
groundwater with a gasoline additive in lawsuits similar to ones
brought by New York City, New Hampshire and Vermont. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/) and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Venezuela&#8217;s
state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA, also were named in two
complaints made public today in state court that seek damages
for costs to clean up groundwater tainted by Methyl Tertiary
Butyl Ether, or MTBE. Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane and Governor Tom Corbett&#8217;s office of general counsel filed
the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MTBE-related spills over the past 20 years have cost
Pennsylvania hundreds of millions of dollars,&#8221; James Schultz,
the governor&#8217;s general counsel, said yesterday in a statement.
&#8220;We cannot take the health of Pennsylvania&#8217;s waters for granted
and their protection must remain our utmost priority.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania lawsuits follow scores of claims filed by
cities, states and individuals around the U.S. against oil
refiners, retailers and distributors over MTBE. Exxon Mobil,
Chevron and BP were among two dozen U.S. refiners sued this
month by Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court in April upheld a jury&#8217;s $104.7
million damage award against Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil for
contaminating New York City wells with the additive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clean Air &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city sued oil companies in 2003, alleging they knew the
additive would pollute groundwater. Exxon Mobil argued that
state laws were pre-empted by the federal Clean Air Act, which
required oil companies to reformulate gasoline to reduce air
pollution from vehicle emissions. Oil companies added MTBE to
make the fuel burn more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasonable alternatives to MTBE were available at the time
oil companies jointly promoted gasoline with the additive,
Pennsylvania claims in its lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braden Reddall, a spokesman for San Ramon, California-based
Chevron, said the company hadn&#8217;t yet seen the suit and couldn&#8217;t
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BP acted at all times in good faith,&#8221; said Scott Dean, a
spokesman in Houston for the London-based company. &#8220;BP plans to
defend itself against the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd Spitler, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, said the company is
reviewing the claims, although &#8216;&#8216;such litigation is flawed in
that energy companies are being held liable not for spilling
gasoline, but for simply including oxygenates in gasoline as
required.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second-Guessing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;If a company spills gasoline in Pennsylvania, it is
required to clean it up, as should be the case,&#8217;&#8217; Spitler said.
&#8216;&#8216;These cases are about second-guessing decisions made by state
and federal regulators to rely on MTBE-blended gasoline to
reduce air pollution. We take very seriously our responsibility
to operate in an environmentally sound manner.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando Garay, a Citgo spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania wants the companies held liable for
manufacturing a defective product, creating public nuisances and
negligence. The complaint also seeks punitive damages for
&#8216;&#8216;wanton, malicious, oppressive and fraudulent conduct,&#8217;&#8217;
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Exxon Mobil
Corp., 140602881, Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County
(Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jody Shenn" date="Jun 20, 2014  1:25 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-20/jpmorgan-said-to-plan-sale-of-304-million-mortgage-bonds.html"><headline>JPMorgan Said to Plan Sale of $304 Million Mortgage Bonds</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is planning a
sale of U.S. home-loan bonds without government backing, adding
to evidence that the market for the securities is beginning to
pick up steam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal will be tied to $303.7 million of prime 15-year
mortgages, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction who asked not to be identified without authorization
to speak publicly. While most of the loans had original balances
larger than the current threshold for jumbo mortgages, the
market&#8217;s focus since its revival, 14.5 percent of the debt is
smaller than $400,000, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premium Point Investments LP&#8217;s WinWater Home Mortgage LLC
yesterday completed its first non-agency bond transaction, a
deal tied to about $250 million of jumbo loans, and Citigroup
Inc. (C) is planning a similar $219 million offering. After reviving
from the paralysis caused by the 2008 financial crisis the debt
helped spark, issuance of non-agency securities had slowed after
the middle of last year as banks seek jumbo loans to hold as
investments and bond buyers pay less for the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing repeat and new issuers attempt to bring the
market back,&#8221;Michele Patterson, a senior director at Kroll
Bond Rating Agency, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We are not
at last year&#8217;s levels, and we don&#8217;t anticipate getting to last
year&#8217;s levels. I think the second half will probably be about
the same as the first half&#8221; of the year in terms of sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;September Collapse &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While total issuance of non-agency securities tied to new
loans jumped to $13.4 billion last year from $3.5 billion in
2012, sales collapsed after September, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance totals about $1.8 billion this
year. Sales peaked at $1.2 trillion in both 2005 and 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumbo mortgages are those larger than allowed in
government-supported programs. Limits now range from $417,000 to
$625,500 for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans with the lowest
costs for borrowers using 20 percent down payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average age of the loans in the JPMorgan transaction is
about one year, with 5.2 percent of the mortgages older than 30
months, the person said. First Republic Bank originated 55
percent of the mortgages, while JPMorgan&#8217;s bank made 38 percent,
the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loss Protection &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of loss protection for investors known as credit
enhancement, totaling 5.5 percent for part of the AAA portion of
the transaction, is the lowest yet seen by Kroll, which was
founded after the crisis and has been hired to grade the deal,
Patterson said. The inclusion of only mortgages with terms of 15
years or less, a first since the credit seizure, improves the
quality of the transaction because the loans typically perform
better than 30-year debt, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other AAA portions of the deal have 10 percent
enhancement, the person said. Most of WinWater&#8217;s top-rated bonds
carried 15 percent of credit enhancement, with a smaller amount
offering a buffer of 8.25 percent. The safety margin is provided
by features such as some bonds losing principal amid losses on
the underlying loans before others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Danube, the European Union&#8217;s
longest river, will receive aid from the WWF and Coca-Cola Co. (KO)
for projects to help restore wetlands, floodplains and water
quality for six countries along the famed waterway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature conservancy and beverage maker today announced
the partnership would work to improve the equivalent of at least
7,400 football fields of wetland habitat and 12 million cubic
meters of water from Romania to Austria by 2020. Fish and
wildlife would benefit from the works as would reconstructed
wetlands that help conserve freshwater resources, the
organizations said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership includes building a fish pass funded by a
Coca-Cola grant, removing dykes to reconnect floodplains and
boost flooding capacity and are part of efforts supported by
local and EU authorities, the groups said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Takako Taniguchi and Finbarr Flynn" date="Jun 20, 2014  4:08 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-20/goldman-swaps-aiful-loan-for-8-bond-luring-funds-japan-credit.html"><headline>Goldman Swaps Aiful Loan for 8% Bond Luring Funds: Japan Credit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is set to
get bonds with more than double the interest rate local Japanese
banks will receive on loans when Aiful Corp. (8515) refinances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer lender, which postponed repayments to avoid
bankruptcy in 2009, said June 13 it will exchange part of 161.7
billion yen ($1.6 billion) of debt for notes bearing an 8
percent coupon. While that&#8217;s in line with U.S. notes with
similar credit scores, it&#8217;s among the highest for Japanese bonds
in the past 15 years, data compiled by Bloomberg and Bank of
America Merrill Lynch show. Domestic banks will extend new loans
at about 3 percent, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local banks are accepting lower interest because they have
collateral on loans to Aiful, while the debentures won&#8217;t be
secured. The consumer lender is seeking to refinance for a
second time in five years as Bank of Japan stimulus lowers
funding costs and the burden of refunding customers for excess
interest-rate charges declines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A coupon of 8 percent looks very attractive,&#8221; said
Taketoshi Tsuchiya, a senior executive at Mizuho Securities Co.
who heads a team dealing with distressed fixed income. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
had a number of requests from overseas hedge funds saying they&#8217;d
like to buy the bonds if they come on the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Informal Agreement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Aiful have reached an informal agreement
that the U.S. bank will apply to swap loans for notes, according
to two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be
identified because the details are private. Aiful triggered
Japan&#8217;s first auction to determine the payout of credit-default
swaps when it obtained lender approval to postpone repayment on
280 billion yen in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese banks may be avoiding the risk of default by
extending loans with collateral, according to Junichi Shimizu, a
Tokyo-based credit analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the principal on loans gradually decreases as
payments are made, corporate bonds are repaid at one go, so
there&#8217;s the risk of a default depending on the business
environment,&#8221; Shimizu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one yen bond offered by bankrupt Takefuji Corp. had a
higher coupon in the past 15 years than the Aiful notes to be
issued to Goldman, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Takefuji&#8217;s securities issued overseas in 2009 paid 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debt Repayment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiful will obtain a loan from Japanese banks of a little
under 80 billion yen with which it will repay part of its
outstanding debts, according to a person familiar with the
matter. Foreign creditors including Goldman Sachs will exchange
more than 30 billion yen in liabilities for the new bonds due at
the end of April 2020, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiful will also postpone repayment of 52.7 billion yen of
existing loans, it said in a statement on June 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In difficult negotiations, we were compelled to accept
tough terms on the bonds,&#8221; said Kenichi Hashimoto, an Aiful
spokesman. &#8220;Realistically, there&#8217;s not such a big difference
between the rate and that being charged in secondary markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield on Aiful&#8217;s 1.99 percent bonds due in
October 2015 was 7.4 percentage points over sovereign notes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Tokyo-based lender
is graded CCC+ by Japan&#8217;s Rating  Investment Information Inc.,
or the equivalent of seven steps below investment level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. corporate bonds with CCC or lower ratings had an
average yield of 8.8 percent, while it was 9.2 percent for
global notes with such scores, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BOJ Stimulus &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowing costs have fallen in Japan as the BOJ buys about
7 trillion yen of sovereign bonds a month to spur inflation. The
benchmark 10-year debt yield has dropped 15 1/2 basis points, or
0.155 percentage point, to 0.58 percent this year. The yen has
gained 3.3 percent in 2014 to 101.93 per dollar as of 5:06 p.m.
in Tokyo, after tumbling 18 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investment unit of Goldman Sachs held 14.5 billion yen
of Aiful&#8217;s debt, while a unit of Barclays Plc (BARC) had 9.4 billion
yen at the end of March, according to material provided by Aiful
to shareholders. The company&#8217;s single largest creditor was the
banking unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc., the
documentation showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiroko Matsumoto, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Tokyo,
declined to comment on the plan, as did Kyota Narimatsu, a
spokesman at Barclays in Japan, and Hiroshi Kashimoto at
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credit Event &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiful&#8217;s December 2009 agreement with creditors to delay
debt repayment resulted in a dispute over whether the action had
caused a so-called restructuring credit event. Buyers of Aiful
credit-default swaps, which insure bondholders against
nonpayment, had to wait three months for the International Swaps
 Derivatives Association to rule that the plan had triggered
payouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sellers of credit-default protection agreed in 2010 to pay
holders 66.125 yen for each 100 yen of insured debt, in Japan&#8217;s
first credit default auction, according to bid administrators at
the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiful racked up 636.1 billion yen in net losses in the
eight years ended March 31 as a crackdown on coercive lending
practices and court rulings forced Japan&#8217;s consumer lenders to
repay billions of dollars in overcharged interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That regulatory action led to the bankruptcy of Takefuji
with 433.6 billion yen of liabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiful recorded a profit of 30.5 billion yen in the 12
months ended March 31, its biggest in eight years and the third
in succession. Interest repayments fell for a fourth year last
fiscal year, dropping 57 percent to 33.1 billion yen from three
years earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the business environment is improving, banks can
increase their recovery rate by continuing to support Aiful and
its turnaround,&#8221; said Shintaro Niimura, a credit analyst at
Nomura Securities Co., Japan&#8217;s largest brokerage. &#8220;For
investors rationally seeking a profit, they&#8217;re emphasizing
better repayment terms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Fion Li" date="Jun 22, 2014 12:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-22/jpmorgan-buys-larger-developers-as-bubble-deflates-china-credit.html"><headline>JPMorgan Buys Larger Developers as Bubble Deflates: China Credit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management and
Invesco Asset Management say China&#8217;s cooling property market is
an opportunity to boost dollar bond holdings as the government&#8217;s
targeted stimulus benefits the largest developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese real-estate companies accounted for six of the 10
best-performing Asian notes in the past three months, according
to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The yield on 2018 debt
of China Overseas Land  Investments Ltd., the nation&#8217;s largest
developer by market value, dropped to 3.35 percent last week,
from a record 4.31 percent on Feb. 5, while that on similar-maturity bonds of China Vanke Co. fell to 3.95 percent, from an
all-time high of 5.07 percent on March 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will pick the winners from these trends,&#8221; said
Stephen Chang, head of Asian fixed income at JPMorgan Asset,
which oversees $39 billion in emerging-market debt. &#8220;Although
sales and prices are falling along with margins, we have
identified the larger developers are gaining market share and
executing well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premier Li Keqiang has pledged to safeguard this year&#8217;s
growth target of 7.5 percent, fueling bets the government will
encourage increased lending to selected projects and relax
restrictions in the real-estate market. Larger developers may
benefit from industry consolidation as smaller builders face a
funding squeeze with a record amount of property trusts maturing
next year and prices falling in the most cities in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Softening Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home prices declined in 35 of China&#8217;s 70 cities last month
from April, the most since May 2012, official data showed June
18. In the financial center of Shanghai, prices decreased 0.3
percent, the first drop in two years, while they fell 0.2
percent in the southern business hub of Shenzhen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Softening prices are good because they imply there isn&#8217;t
a bubble anymore,&#8221; said Ken Hu, Hong Kong-based chief
investment officer of fixed income for Asia Pacific at Invesco,
which manages $787 billion globally. &#8220;We pick developers with
high turnover and those who tend to build smaller-sized flats.
Profit margin isn&#8217;t that key to bondholders like us. Our
approach is to buy on dips.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers including Vanke that cut prices by 10 percent to
15 percent achieved good sales volume, Deutsche Bank AG analysts
led by Hong Kong-based Tony Tsang wrote in a June 13 report.
Vanke, headquartered in Shenzhen, recorded a 16.2 percent
increase in sales value in the first five months of 2014 from a
year earlier, it said in a June 3 statement to the Shenzhen
stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking Advantage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larger industry players are able to tap overseas capital
markets for funds. Sales of dollar bonds by Chinese companies
totaled $91 billion in 2014, compared with $89 billion in the
previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller builders, which rely on property trusts for
financing, have to repay 203.5 billion yuan ($32.7 billion) in
2015, according to research firm Use Trust. That&#8217;s almost double
the 109 billion yuan due this year. China&#8217;s banking regulator
said on June 6 it will monitor developer finances, a sign of
concern defaults may spread after the March collapse of Zhejiang
Xingrun Real Estate Co., a builder south of Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It won&#8217;t be surprising to have a few defaults in the
sector in an economic slowdown, given you have thousands of
developers and many of them are small ones,&#8221; BOCI&#8217;s Wang said.
&#8220;The bigger ones, especially those listed, can take advantage
to lower their funding costs as the industry consolidates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China South City Holdings Ltd. (1668), which runs logistics parks
for industrial materials, sold 1 billion yuan of five-year bonds
at a coupon of 7.5 percent in the interbank market on May 9. It
plans to use the proceeds to repay short-term bank loans.
Greenland Holding Group has hired banks to arrange investor
meetings from today for a potential dollar bond offering,
according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Borrowing Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanke&#8217;s bond borrowing costs dropped to 3.45 percent on a
weighted average last week, compared with 5.5 percent in the
first quarter of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It also managed to extend the average maturity of its notes to
3.95 years, from 2.43 years in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowing growth is causing declines in the yuan and onshore
interest rates. The Chinese currency has fallen 2.8 percent
against the dollar this year, the worst performance in Asia. The
yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond has dropped 52
basis points to 4.04 percent in the same period as investors
sought safe havens. Gross domestic product will probably expand
7.3 percent this year, the slowest pace since 1990, according to
a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prolonged Downturn &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downturn in the property market will be more prolonged
this time than in previous corrections, Tom Byrne, senior vice
president at Moody&#8217;s, said at a June 19 conference in Shanghai.
Broad price cuts are likely to come in late August or in
September when more new projects are set to be introduced, UBS
AG Hong Kong-based analyst Eva Lee wrote in a report last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s revised its credit outlook for Chinese developers
to negative from stable on May 21. The Shanghai Stock Exchange
Property Index, which tracks 24 real-estate companies listed in
the city, has slumped 6.3 percent this year, exceeding the 4.2
percent decline for the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Overall, the housing market is cooling in some parts,
like in third- or fourth-tier cities,&#8221; said Chang at JPMorgan
Asset. &#8220;But we do see a silver lining. There&#8217;s actually a
healthy pickup in transactions at specific locations after some
discounting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8217;Minor Stimulus&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation has introduced measures to help the real-estate
industry, which JPMorgan Chase  Co. says poses the biggest
near-term risk to growth in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy.
The People&#8217;s Bank of China told 15 banks in May to improve
efficiency of service, give timely approval and distribution of
mortgages to qualified buyers. The southeastern city of Fuzhou
has removed home-purchase limits for buyers who make one-time
payments, the Securities Times reported on June 18, citing sales
people from two developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government may announce additional &#8220;minor stimulus
measures&#8221; after Premier Li said in London last week that the
nation will maintain a minimum growth rate of 7.5 percent,
according to a China Securities Journal commentary on June 20.
The PBOC may release more targeted steps to prevent expansion
from falling short of the goal, it added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Policy makers are actually putting out more measures to
support this sector,&#8221; said Arthur Lau, Hong Kong-based head of
Asia ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge Investments, which
oversees about $71 billion. &#8220;I think, volume-wise, it could
catch up a little bit in the second half, especially those who
are not aggressively buying land. There is still a wide
selection, even within this sector.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Fed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 19 (Bloomberg) -- Gold rose the most since September

economy grows. Emerging-market currencies climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Nobody Knows How Hard It Is as Master of Universe: Michael
Lewis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 15 (Bloomberg View) --&#160;I&#8217;d like to start by making a
confession: It&#8217;s never been easy being me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. A $549,000 Watch Is Market Signal Worth Tracking: Barry
Ritholtz &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 16 (Bloomberg View) --&#160;I have been hearing a lot about
the spending habits of the 0.01 percent lately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. There&#8217;s Apparently Quite a Bit of Insider Trading: Matt
Levine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 17 (Bloomberg View) --&#160;As I may have mentioned&#160;over
and&#160;over&#160;and&#160;over&#160;and&#160;over&#160;and&#160;over&#160;again, the first rule of
insider trading is just don&#8217;t insider trade, but the second rule
is: If you have inside information about an upcoming merger,
don&#8217;t buy short-dated out-of-the-money call options on the
target. The SEC will get you! What I haven&#8217;t emphasized,
however, is that derivatives can be replicated in various ways,
so you can use other options to get similar results without
trading in the Forbidden Option.&#160;This would not technically
violate the second rule of insider trading, though I cannot
wholeheartedly recommend it since it would violate the first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Morgan Stanley Thought Valeant Was a House of Cards: Matt
Levine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 16 (Bloomberg View) --&#160;Has anything good ever happened
to an investment bank because of e-mail? I mean, I guess,
probably. Certainly e-mail is the best way to tell an analyst to
work all weekend without having to watch in person as the light
goes out of his young eyes.&#160;And it probably helps to, I don&#8217;t
know, coordinate complicated global businesses and so forth. But
that&#8217;s boring background stuff and hardly worth mentioning.
Every time you&#160;hear about&#160;an investment bank&#8217;s e-mails, it&#8217;s
safe to say, the story is going to be terrible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Senators Got Together to Discuss Their Stock Trades: Matt
Levine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 17 (Bloomberg View) --&#160;A good chunk of today&#8217;s very
silly Senate subcommittee hearing&#160;on &#8220;Conflicts of Interest,
Investor Loss of Confidence, and High Speed Trading in U.S.
Stock Markets&#8221; was taken up by: Senator Ron Johnson pointing
out that, when he trades stock in his personal account,&#160;he gets
instantaneous execution of his trades, at the price he wants,
for $10 a trade, and Professor Robert H. Battalio telling him,
no, the problem is, you&#160;don&#8217;t&#160;get your stock, the price moves
away from you and your order is never filled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Mikael Holter" date="Jun 23, 2014  6:34 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-23/exxon-s-norway-output-threatened-as-union-readies-pension-strike.html"><headline>Exxon&#8217;s Norway Output Threatened as Union Readies Pension Strike</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A Norwegian oil-workers union said
it&#8217;s ready to go on strike over pensions in a move that
threatens to cut oil production from Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s
platforms in the North Sea by more than 60,000 barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A court in Oslo today ruled that a strike notice by the
Safe union that would affect three Exxon platforms is legal,
clearing the way for a walkout, according to the group&#8217;s leader,
Hilde-Marit Rysst. While the union is yet to decide on a public
mediator&#8217;s proposal that seeks to bridge differences with
employers, it will do so by the June 27 midday deadline, she
said by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everything is set&#8221; for a strike, Rysst said. The
mediator&#8217;s proposal, endorsed by the Norwegian Oil and Gas
Association, which represents employers in wage negotiations,
&#8220;is not good enough,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strike would set Safe apart from two other unions that
reached wage agreements in talks that covered 7,615 offshore
oil-platform workers. In 2012, workers from all three unions
walked out in their longest action, disrupting oil and gas
production until the government intervened to stop companies
imposing a full lockout that would have halted output from
western Europe&#8217;s largest producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conflict centers on pension terms for 31 Safe-affiliated workers at Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest oil company by
market value. While the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association argued
that the issue isn&#8217;t relevant for industry-wide wage talks, the
Oslo court ruled Safe&#8217;s strike notice is legal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Union Threat &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Norwegian Oil and Gas Association could meet with Safe
again this week after last week&#8217;s state-backed mediation, though
there are no talks planned yet, the oil-industry lobby group&#8217;s
spokeswoman Eli Ane Nedreskaar said by phone. Exxon declined to
comment on talks with the union as it&#8217;s represented by the
Norwegian Oil and Gas Association, spokesman Knut Riple said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe has threatened to take out 154 of its members from
Exxon&#8217;s Balder, Ringhorne and Jotun platforms, shutting down
production that reached 61,000 barrels of oil in April,
according to figures from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. A
strike would also halt production at Det Norske Oljeselskap
ASA&#8217;s Jette field, which goes through Jotun and amounted to
2,000 barrels of crude a day in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Kelly Bit" date="Jun 24, 2014 10:38 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-24/ex-goldman-currency-trader-cho-is-said-to-start-macro-fund-2-.html"><headline>Ex-Goldman Currency Trader Cho Is Said to Start Macro Fund</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Steven Cho, a former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. currency trader, plans to start a macro hedge fund, a
strategy attracting investors seeking to profit from diverging
global economic trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cho&#8217;s New York-based Kings Peak Asset Management LP is
scheduled to start in the fourth quarter, according to four
people with knowledge of his plans, who asked not to be named
because the fund is private. Cho, who was global head of spot
and forward trading of G-10 currencies at Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment. He left in April after 18 years at the
bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macro funds, which make bets on stocks, bonds, currencies
and commodities, have underperformed the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index every year since 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, in part because central banks have depressed interest
rates, making it harder to profit from discrepancies between
countries. Firms including Tudor Investment Corp. and Mariner
Investment Group LLC, which deploy the strategy, have forecast
divergence in monetary policies as some economies grow faster
than others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Central banks can&#8217;t all keep doing the same thing in
tandem,&#8221; said Maggie Ralbovsky, a managing director at Wilshire
Associates, which advises hedge funds and their investors. &#8220;The
macro market, because of the divergence in conditions in
different countries, is very prime for this kind of strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volatility Index &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some funds expect increased divergence, they may have
to be patient. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said today
policy makers can wait for the economy to absorb more slack
before increasing interest rates and U.S. Federal Reserve Chair
Janet Yellen said last week the Fed expects interest rates to
stay low for a &#8220;considerable time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s caused volatility to plunge across stocks, bonds and
currencies. The JPMorgan Global FX Volatility Index fell to a
record low 5.5 percent on June 19 from 11.8 percent a year ago.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures price swings in stocks, tumbled 12 percent on June 18
to close at 10.6, the lowest level since February 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, investors are seeking returns derived from
macroeconomic themes and less correlated to the stock market,
according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc. That&#8217;s
contributing to an increase in hedge-fund startups overall, with
289 in the first quarter, compared with 244 in the prior three
months. Industry assets have increased to a record $2.7
trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bankers Leave &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top bankers and traders have exited the biggest Wall Street
firms for more lucrative jobs at hedge funds, as regulation has
intensified following the 2008 financial crisis and lower
returns have pushed banks to cut the amount of revenue they set
aside for compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
investment banks declined 9 percent in 2013, according to
industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in October that the
bank&#8217;s currency business had &#8220;difficulty managing inventory&#8221;
in the third quarter as the firm posted its worst fixed-income
trading revenue since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are also facing at least a dozen regulators
investigating allegations that traders colluded to rig
benchmarks in the $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market. Cho&#8217;s
resignation was unrelated to the currency probe and he left on
good terms, according to two people with knowledge of the
matter, who asked not to be named because the information is
private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Maria Kolesnikova" date="Jun 24, 2014  9:06 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-24/goldman-sees-commodities-dropping-5-5-after-iraq-driven-rally.html"><headline>Goldman Sees Commodities Dropping 5.5% After Iraq-Driven Rally</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Commodities are poised to decline
5.5 percent over the next 12 months after climbing amid tensions
in Iraq, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy prices will be 5 percent lower a year from now,
precious metals will drop 15 percent and agricultural products
will retreat 10 percent, the bank said in an asset-allocation
report dated yesterday. Commodities will decline 4 percent in
the next three months, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite the negative return we forecast after the recent
rally driven by events in Iraq, we stay neutral commodities due
to the hedging benefits they offer against these risks,&#8221;
Goldman analyst Jeffrey Currie in New York said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude reached a nine-month high in London on June 19
after Iraqi insurgents captured the northern city of Mosul and
advanced to towns just north of Baghdad, sparking concern oil
output might be interrupted in OPEC&#8217;s second-largest producer.
Gold futures touched the highest price since April 15 today in
New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Brent fell as much as 0.5 percent after Iraqi forces
regained control of the Baiji refinery in the north from
Islamist militants, and fighting has yet to spread to the south,
home to more than three-quarters of the country&#8217;s crude output.
Saudi Arabia was the only producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries that pumped more oil than Iraq
last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Larger Stockpiles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, risks in energy are &#8220;skewed to the upside in an
environment of heightened geopolitical risks and very limited
OPEC spare capacity,&#8221; the Goldman analyst wrote. Precious
metals will drop amid rising real interest rates, while
agriculture prices are set to decline as inventories increase,
according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity prices as measured by the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI
Enhanced Commodity Index rose 3.4 percent so far this month and
are up 7.1 percent in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman forecast May 14 the enhanced index might have zero
total return in three months and decline 2.2 percent over 12
months. The bank projected a 4 percent drop over 12 months in an
April 13 note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) is a better bet than its
Zurich neighbor Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) even though it&#8217;s more
exposed to legal risks, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS could nearly quadruple its litigation reserve to 7
billion Swiss francs ($7.8 billion) by 2016 and still have a
common equity ratio of 13 percent, Kian Abouhossein and Amit Ranjan, banking analysts at JPMorgan in London, said in a note
today. They included a dividend yield of 10.3 percent in this
estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS had 1.8 billion francs in reserve for legal matters at
the end of the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Credit Suisse reported a common equity ratio
of 10 percent at the end of March. Factoring in a $2.6 billion
fine to settle a U.S. tax-evasion case in May, that figure drops
to 9.3 percent, the lowest of the 17 global investment banks
tracked by Bloomberg Industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On litigation, in our view CSG appears better placed than
UBS,&#8221; Abouhossein and Ranjan said in their note. &#8220;However, UBS
has sufficient cushion in our estimates to take litigation
charges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse will generate 48 percent of investment
banking-related revenues from equities in 2015, according to
Abouhossein and Ranjan, compared with 68 percent at UBS. As a
result, the analysts said they &#8220;see UBS business mix as much
more attractive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes Switzerland&#8217;s second-largest bank more dependent
on fixed income, an area of investment banking that the analysts
said is shrinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, also has more estimated
future revenue from &#8220;asset-gathering-geared activities&#8221;
relative to total income. Credit Suisse will have 55 percent of
revenue from these businesses in 2015, the analysts estimate,
compared with 68 percent for UBS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;UBS again is more attractive than CSG,&#8221; Abouhossein and
Ranjan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS also has an advantage in wealth management because of
its stronger position in Asia, which they view as the fastest-growing region, and in the U.S., the men said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The era of slowing global inflation looks to be over. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three years of worldwide disinflation is ending, in the eyes of economists at JPMorgan Chase  Co. Their estimates show global consumer prices accelerated 2.65 percent in May. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s the fastest pace since April 2012 and the level they&#8217;d targeted for the end of 2014. It marks a 0.6 percentage point jump since February, when the 2 percent rate was the lowest since November 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not just food and energy costs. Inflation excluding those more volatile measures was still 2.1 percent in May. The hunch at the biggest U.S. bank is that companies are regaining pricing power as manufacturing strengthens, said David Hensley, an international economist at JPMorgan in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The analysis may surprise those investors who spent the year pushing up bond prices. It may also grate on economists such as Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, who yesterday bemoaned &#8220;inflation hysteria&#8221; on Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We definitely have seen the turn,&#8221; said Hensley in an interview. &#8220;It would be an abrupt swing to go to worrying about the inflationary upside, but we may be seeing that shift taking place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like JPMorgan, Societe Generale SA economist Aneta Merkowska told clients last week to &#8220;prepare for the return of U.S. inflation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Yellen Challenge &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;She predicts Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will face consumer-price gains outside of food and energy of 2.3 percent by the end of the year. Import prices are bottoming, slack is eroding and housing and health-care costs are bouncing, she wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That could put the Fed behind the inflation curve, she said. Waiting to the middle of next year to raise their benchmark rate -- as markets and officials have indicated is likely -- would spell an unusually late start to tightening given the core rate may exceed 2.5 percent by then. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fed raised rates in 2004 and 1999 when inflation was closer to 2 percent, said Merkowska, who predicts the Fed funds rate will be at 2.5 percent by the end of 2016, higher than the market bets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Krugman&#8217;s hysteria accusation is hyperbolic itself given investor measures of inflation expectations do not suggest panic about prices, according to Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research LLC in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While faster wage growth has yet to materialize in the U.S., unemployment has fallen quicker than expected, banks are boosting lending and rents and medical care are becoming costlier, he told clients in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the investment business it is much better to be prepared than surprised,&#8221; said Dutta. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Takahiko Hyuga, Hiroko Komiya and Kevin Buckland" date="Jun 24, 2014 12:34 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-24/goldman-sachs-tokyo-fx-salesman-wako-ogawa-said-to-resign.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Tokyo FX Salesman Wako Ogawa Said to Resign</headline><body>

according to two people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ogawa, 44, a vice president at Goldman Sachs Japan Co.,
will leave the firm later this year to join a financial
institution, the people said, declining to be identified because
the matter is confidential. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Tokyo-based
spokeswoman Hiroko Matsumoto declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ogawa, who joined Goldman Sachs in 2007, regularly appears
as a commentator on TV Tokyo (9413)&#8217;s early morning financial news
program, &#8220;Morning Satellite.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks globally are seeing income from foreign exchange
squeezed by a decline in market volatility as global central
banks provide unprecedented liquidity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s Currency Volatility Index, which
measures the market&#8217;s expectation of future price swings for
nine currency pairs, slumped to a record 5.3 percent on June 19.
The index was as high as 15.8 percent in September 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs ranked 10th in global currency trading, up
from 11th a year earlier, Euromoney reported in its survey of
the market published this year, with a 2.5 percent share. The
bank has seen its proportion of transactions shrink each year
since 2010, the data show. Citigroup Inc. was the leader in the
latest survey with a 16 percent share. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abigail Jones Feder, a JPMorgan (JPM)
Chase  Co. managing director who oversaw cash and bond
investments for the bank&#8217;s private clients, has died. She was
51. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She died on June 22 at New York University Langone Medical
Center in Manhattan, following a long illness, according to her
husband, Andrew Feder. Residents of Cold Spring Harbor on New
York&#8217;s Long Island, the couple shared their passion for sailing
with their two children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At JPMorgan Asset Management, Feder ran an investment team
serving wealthy private-banking clients. She joined New York-based JPMorgan in 2000 as a vice president in the U.S. Fixed
Income Group, overseeing short-term and intermediate domestic
bonds. She spent the first 15 years of her career with Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter Investment Management, in Manhattan, where
she rose to head of enhanced cash management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She shared her finance expertise with the organizations
that helped educate her, serving on the investment committees of
the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island and the East Woods School
and Christ Church in Oyster Bay, New York. She was on the Board
of Managers of the Havens Relief Fund Society, which distributes
funds to struggling New York City residents through a network of
120 volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Spurring People&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She was very involved and truly altruistic,&#8221; Andrew
Feder, a JPMorgan executive director who manages real estate
investments on behalf of private banking clients, said yesterday
in an interview. &#8220;She was selfless in her view of the world.
She gave of herself to many people, and she led by spurring
people to do great things.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abigail Lispenard Jones was born on July 16, 1962, in
Huntington, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father, Edward Sprague Jones, was an art dealer,
genealogist and illustrator whose work appeared in publications
including the Nation and the New Republic, according to his 1997
obituary in Princeton University&#8217;s alumni magazine. Her mother,
the former Patricia Bleecker, was executive director of the
Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York from 1987 to 1997
and a former president of the National Society of the Colonial
Dames of America, which preserves historic properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feder was a 1980 graduate of Phillips Academy in Andover,
Massachusetts. She graduated in 1985 from Vassar College in
Poughkeepsie, New York, where she was an art-history major and
captain of the squash team, her husband said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of college she joined Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s corporate-finance department and, in 1987, moved to Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
asset-management business as a marketing analyst, according to a
filing by the Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust. She
became a portfolio manager in the fixed-income group in 1989, a
vice president in 1992, and head of a cash-reserves portfolio in
1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to her husband, survivors include their son,
Andries, 20, and daughter, Catalina, 17; her sister, Susanna A.
Jones, head of the Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland; and
her brother, Thomas Jones, a partner in the Washington office of
law firm Willkie Farr  Gallagher LLP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two stockbrokers were charged with
insider trading tied to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s
$1.2 billion acquisition of software company SPSS Inc., in a
probe that has already yielded three guilty pleas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daryl Payton, 38, and Benjamin Durant III, 37, pleaded not
guilty to one count of conspiracy and five counts of securities
fraud in an indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court. The
two men, arrested this morning in New York by the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, were each released on $250,000 bond set by
U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Dolinger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payton and Durant were part of a group of friends who
traded on the IBM tip, the U.S. said. When the SPSS deal was
announced on July 28, 2009, the pair met with three other co-conspirators at a New York hotel to discuss a cover story,
according to Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Benjamin Durant and Daryl Payton not only acquired inside
information about a corporate acquisition and made illegal
profits from it, but they colluded with others to conceal their
crime,&#8221; Bharara said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peggy Cross-Goldenberg, a lawyer for Durant, and Jim Roth,
an attorney for Payton, declined to comment about their clients
after court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrests are the latest in a federal crackdown by
Bharara&#8217;s office and the FBI on insider trading at hedge funds,
technology companies and so-called expert networking firms.
Payton and Durant are among at least 88 people who have been
charged since 2009, with 81 having been convicted, most after
guilty pleas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payton, Durant, David Weishaus and Thomas Conradt were
employed as brokers at Euro Pacific Capital Inc., according to
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Same Brokerage&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They all worked together at the same brokerage firm here
in New York City and they all made a substantial amount of money
on inside information, hundreds of thousands of dollars,&#8221;
Assistant U.S. Attorney John Zach said today at the arraignment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payton and Durant were also sued by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, which alleged the two made more than
$290,000 in illegal profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the tip from an associate at the New York law
firm representing IBM, Trent Martin passed the information to
his roommate, Conradt, the SEC said. Conradt immediately shared
the information with Weishaus, a friend, who tipped off his co-workers Payton and Durant, according to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin, Conradt and Weishaus all pleaded guilty last year
and await sentencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;41% Jump &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payton and Durant bought securities in SPSS in the days
leading up to the announcement of the acquisition. When the deal
was made public, the software company&#8217;s stock rose by 41 percent
in a day, earning Durant $53,000 in illegal profit and Payton
$243,000, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Euro Pacific was subpoenaed in November 2009 by the
SEC as part of its investigation, Payton, Durant, Conradt and
Weishaus were questioned by the broker and later fired, said
Andrew Schiff, director of marketing for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The firm has been cleared by the SEC and Finra and had
control systems in place to detect this kind of conduct,&#8221;
Schiff said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Martin, 12-cr-00887, the civil
case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Payton, 14-cv-04644, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold bonds tied
to about $304 million of U.S. home loans without government
backing, adding to signs of life in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction included $171 million of top-rated
securities paying a 3 percent coupon, which were sold at 102.2
cents on the dollar, according to a person with knowledge of the
offering who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly. That&#8217;s about 1.5 cents on the
dollar less than comparable benchmark Fannie Mae-guaranteed
bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes are unlike other recent deals because they&#8217;re
backed almost entirely by 15-year mortgages, which are often
taken by &#8220;more financially secure&#8221; borrowers relative to more
common 30-year loans, according to a presale report by Standard
 Poor&#8217;s. The average size of the mortgages, at about $558,000,
was also smaller than the $850,000 in previous JPMorgan deals
since the 2008 financial crisis, SP said. They were mainly
&#8220;jumbo&#8221; loans, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction&#8217;s contracts included an &#8220;untested and
rigid&#8221; process for forcing JPMorgan or other originators of the
underlying loans to buy back misrepresented debt, SP said.
Seeing that &#8220;the framework is more restrictive than those in
other recent prime transactions, we imposed additional loss
coverage requirements in our review.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While issuance of non-agency securities tied to new loans
jumped to $13.4 billion last year from $3.5 billion in 2012,
sales collapsed after September, Bloomberg data show. Issuance
totals about $2.1 billion this year, and Citigroup Inc. (C) has been
also planning a sale this month. Offerings peaked at $1.2
trillion in both 2005 and 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumbo mortgages are those larger than allowed in
government-supported programs. Limits now range from $417,000 to
$625,500 for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans with the lowest
costs for borrowers using 20 percent down payments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the top
merger adviser this year, is combining its health-care and
retail investment-banking groups amid a boom in deals involving
pharmaceutical companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathy Elsesser and Francois-Xavier de Mallmann, co-heads of
the retail team, will lead the new group with Marshall Smith,
who runs the health-care unit, according to an internal memo
obtained today by Bloomberg News. David Wells, a spokesman for
New York-based Goldman Sachs, confirmed the memo&#8217;s contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms have been seeking to boost efficiency as
lower trading revenue and new capital rules damp returns. The
combined group would be among the bank&#8217;s largest by total
investment-banking fees, trailing financial institutions and
financial sponsors, according to data from New York research
firm Freeman  Co. covering the past three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change will allow bankers to &#8220;be deployed more widely
across a broader client base,&#8221; Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-heads of
investment banking, Richard J. Gnodde, David Solomon and John S. Weinberg, wrote in the memo. &#8220;We see growing convergence
between sub sectors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the top-ranked adviser this year on deals
involving health-care companies, which this quarter announced
about $200 billion of deals, the most ever, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The firm ranked second for retail deals,
behind Morgan Stanley, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsesser started working for Goldman Sachs in 1989, while
de Mallmann and Smith joined in 1993 and 2005, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is an adviser to Allergan Inc. on Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International Inc.&#8217;s $54 billion hostile
takeover bid, as well as to medical-device maker Covidien Plc on
its $46 billion acquisition by Medtronic Inc. On retail deals,
the firm is advising Safeway Inc. on its $9.1 billion sale to
Albertsons LLC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is
marketing a new type of bond designed to give investors access
to top-rated assets as the supply of covered bonds and other
high-grade securities continues to shrink. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of notes are
provisionally rated AAA by Standard  Poor&#8217;s and will be sold
through FIGSCO Issuer Ltd., SP said in a statement. The bonds
are secured by fixed-income assets and offer investors three
levels of protection in the event of default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman is seeking to meet investor demand for the safest
assets as AAA rated bonds become harder to find in Europe.
Redemptions of covered bonds and U.K. RMBS are outpacing new
issues in Europe as cheap central bank funding and regulatory
pressure prompt lenders to trim balance sheets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The current context of the supply/demand imbalance in the
markets is well known,&#8221; Societe Generale SA analysts led by
Jean-David Cirotteau said in a report. &#8220;A new senior secured
bond backed by a portfolio of financial assets by a large U.S.
investment firm is probably a good thing for hungry investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophie Ramsay, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
declined to comment on the notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collateral backing the AAA bonds will be transferred to
FIGSCO through a total return swap with Goldman Sachs Mitsui
Marine Derivative Products LP, a joint venture between the U.S.
bank and Japan&#8217;s Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co., according to
SP. The securities offer investors a claim on the assets
backing the deal, as well as on Goldman and Mitsui if the joint
venture defaults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank has set up a 10 billion-euro program to sell
the debt. Goldman Sachs, Barclays Plc, Credit Agricole SA,
Natixis, and UBS AG are holding investor meetings for the bonds
this week, a person familiar with the matter said June 23. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), in its pursuit of
drugmaker Shire Plc (SHP), has hired some of the same advisers that
Pfizer Inc. worked with in its failed push for AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN)
They&#8217;re trying to learn from the experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie&#8217;s chief executive officer,
yesterday made clear that a hostile bid is an option for his
company, a move Pfizer ruled out. AbbVie&#8217;s effort also differs
in that it&#8217;s appealing directly to Shire shareholders early,
offering what it calls a significant premium to win their
support to pressure its board or prepare the ground for a
hostile offer, according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&#8217;s boom in health-care takeovers is giving
companies and their banks, lawyers, and public-relations firms
plenty of real-life experience to draw upon. AbbVie is being
advised on its $46.5 billion bid by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) as well
as PR firm Brunswick Group, both of which also worked with
Pfizer on AstraZeneca. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They don&#8217;t want to back themselves into a corner,&#8221; Navid Malik, an analyst at Cenkos Securities Plc in London, said of
AbbVie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gonzalez&#8217;s team is trying to keep debate focused on the
strategic logic of a deal, rather than on using Shire&#8217;s Irish
legal domicile to escape U.S. taxes -- a topic that came to
dominate the Pfizer-AstraZeneca transaction, said one of the
people, who asked not to be identified because talks are
private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they&#8217;re also stressing that tax benefits could
enable bigger payouts to investors in the future. The pitch:
that a combination would enrich Shire shareholders beyond what
the company could achieve alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shire, for its part, has said the bid undervalues the
company, and that it has strong prospects on its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for AbbVie and a spokesman for Brunswick
didn&#8217;t immediately return calls seeking comment. A JPMorgan
spokeswoman declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Chicago, Illinois-based AbbVie heads into possible
negotiations with advantages Pfizer lacked. Unlike AstraZeneca,
Shire doesn&#8217;t have a large workforce or substantial research
base in the U.K. that politicians will fight to keep under local
control, as they did in AstraZeneca&#8217;s case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No History &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And AbbVie, spun off from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) last year,
has no history of past acquisitions to defend. Pfizer&#8217;s record
of presiding over large-scale layoffs after buying companies
including Wyeth and Pharmacia Corp. helped rally British
politicians and unions to AstraZeneca&#8217;s side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shire, domiciled in Dublin for tax purposes and with
management offices in Basingstoke, England, has rejected three
takeover offers from AbbVie. The companies are at odds over how
to benchmark Shire&#8217;s shares, with AbbVie arguing Shire&#8217;s share
price has been inflated since the AstraZeneca deal highlighted
the attractiveness of U.K. and Irish-domiciled health-care
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), Deutsche Bank AG, Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR),
Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are advising Shire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Offer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AbbVie CEO Gonzalez&#8217;s statement yesterday that he would
keep a hostile bid on the table contrasted with Pfizer&#8217;s
approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer on May 18 said its latest $117 billion proposal for
AstraZeneca was final and that it wouldn&#8217;t try to woo
shareholders directly. Under U.K. takeover rules, deeming an
offer final makes it nearly impossible for it to be further
increased. That&#8217;s another pitfall AbbVie is keen to avoid, two
of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those pledges marked the end -- at least for now -- of what
would have been the industry&#8217;s biggest-ever acquisition, raising
questions about Pfizer&#8217;s tactics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parliament&#8217;s Reaction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, AbbVie is trying to head off concerns that set
off a heated public debate over AstraZeneca, one of the people
familiar with the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of Parliament in the U.K. expressed reservations
over Pfizer&#8217;s history of large transactions followed by firings
and the shutdown of research facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Pfizer promised to locate 20 percent of its
global research workforce in Britain. That in turn fuelled
concern from public officials in the U.S. and Sweden, where
AstraZeneca also has significant operations, and exacerbated
animosity between the two companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shire employs fewer than 500 people in the U.K. and only
about 100 in Ireland. CEO Flemming Ornskov and Phil Vickers,
Shire&#8217;s research head, work in the U.S., and other top managers
are joining them there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a message to its employees yesterday, AbbVie said no
jobs would be lost in the Chicago area in a Shire deal, and the
combined company would be managed from there. AbbVie is also
arguing that a deal would strengthen Shire&#8217;s research and
development capacity and give it global scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Political Scrutiny &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying Shire would give AbbVie a growing stable of
treatments for rare diseases. The U.S. company is dependent on
the rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira for about 60 percent of
sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gonzalez yesterday stressed the strategic advantages he
believes a transaction would bring to both companies in areas
such as rare diseases, neurosciences and ophthalmology. He also
pointed to the common ground between AbbVie and Shire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both strategically and culturally, there is great
alignment between our companies,&#8221; he said. They &#8220;are both
specialty-focused biopharmaceutical companies, pursuing similar
strategies, targeting diseases of high unmet medical need.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While AbbVie has said the proposed deal would cut its tax
rate by almost 10 percentage points, in its 39-page slide deck
presentation to Shire investors the word &#8220;tax&#8221; surfaces only
on page 20. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa&#8217;s tightening of visa
rules to combat child trafficking may also deter foreign
visitors, industry groups have told Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restrictions, proposed by the Home Affairs Ministry and
due to come into effect at the end of September, will require
parents and guardians traveling with minor children to be in
possession of their unabridged birth certificates. Visitors will
also have to report in person to visa offices to provide
biometric data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Industry stakeholders argue that these measures may
impact on the competitiveness of our destination in an era where
countries are attempting to ease visa requirements,&#8221; Hanekom
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Any matter that could have a
detrimental impact on international tourist arrivals to South
Africa is a concern.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 9 million tourists visit South Africa each year.
The government is targeting annual income of 500 billion rand
($47 billion) from tourism by 2020 and 225,000 new jobs as it
seeks to cut a 25 percent unemployment rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourism department officials are working with their
counterparts at home affairs to clarify any misunderstanding
about the new rules and resolve any problems that may arise,
Hanekom said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is advising Manitowoc, the
Wisconsin-based company said today in a statement. Relational
has amassed an 8.5 percent stake in Manitowoc, according to a
filing yesterday. The shares rose as much as 12 percent, the
most since January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relational, co-founded by Ralph Whitworth and David Batchelder, wants the company to spin off its food-service
business, responsible for ice makers and freezers, from its
industrial business, which makes and services cranes and boom
trucks. The fund sees the separation enhancing capital
allocation and strategic flexibility, and attracting more
focused shareholders. Relational may seek board representation
next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stand-alone crane business would be significantly
more cyclical and not have the smoother cash flows of the
foodservice business,&#8221; Charles Brady, a Boston-based analyst at
BMO Capital Markets, said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food-service unit, which accounted for 38 percent of
revenue, has an implied enterprise value of $3.9 billion based
on the valuation of industry peers, Karen Ubelhart, an analyst
at Bloomberg Industries, said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Higher Margins &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manitowoc climbed 11 percent to $32.93 at the close in New
York, the biggest one-day gain since Jan. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1902, Manitowoc sold $4 billion in crane
equipment and commercial food coolers and heaters in 24
countries last year. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Glen E. Tellock already has announced efforts to cut $80 million in
costs to improve margins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Manitowoc will likely focus on improving its operational
efficiencies in cranes and food service while it assesses the
longer-term merits of any potential spin,&#8221; Larry De Maria, a
New York-based analyst for William Blair  Co., said by e-mail
today. &#8220;It appears that the activist investors are dug in, and
this process could take some time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relational, based in San Diego, first disclosed a small
holding of Manitowoc in February 2013. While the fund held talks
with management in January, the Manitowoc board hasn&#8217;t yet
agreed to meet, yesterday&#8217;s filing shows. The fund also is
seeking measures to boost profit margins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relational manages about $6 billion and regularly presses
for changes in public companies such as separating diverse
businesses and finding ways to operate more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relational also has recently targeted other industrial
companies including tool and equipment manufacturer SPX Corp. (SPW),
machinery builder Illinois Tool Works Inc. and hazardous waste
disposer Clean Harbors Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hess, Bunge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activist investors tend to buy at least 5 percent of a
company&#8217;s stock and flag their intention to actively engage
executives and directors by disclosing their holding in a 13D
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relational also holds stakes in energy group Hess Corp. (HES),
agricultural commodity processor Bunge Ltd., snacks supplier
Mondelez International Inc. and x-ray maker Hologic Inc. among
others, according to its most recent holdings disclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitworth has served as chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co.
since April 2013, after urging changes to turn around the
largest personal-computer maker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asia Resource Minerals Plc (ARMS), which
split from Indonesia&#8217;s Bakrie family in a $501 million deal
three months ago, appointed Bob Kamandanu as chairman after
shareholders voted against re-electing incumbent Chris Walton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton, who joined the company Jan. 1, was opposed by 59
percent of shareholders at today&#8217;s annual general meeting in
London, the coal producer formerly known as Bumi Plc said in a
statement. Its shares fell 12 percent before the announcement,
the biggest drop in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARMS Chief Executive Officer Nick von Schirnding has
stepped down and will be replaced by Amir Sambodo, who takes on
the role from tomorrow in a change the company announced June
12. Following the separation from the Bakries and with a focus
on its sole Indonesian asset PT Berau Coal Energy (BRAU), the board
wants the CEO based in the Asian country, ARMS has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financier Nathaniel Rothschild and the Bakries founded Bumi
Plc in a $3 billion deal in 2010 before becoming engaged in a
protracted and bitter dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders also voted 59 percent against the re-election
of Nick Salmon as a director at today&#8217;s meeting. ARMS closed at
164.75 pence in London, the lowest since October 2012, and
valuing the company at 397 million pounds ($676 million.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
bought a stake in Dong Energy A/S last year, the utility&#8217;s
hybrid debt has soared to a record, boosting investor returns as
the Danish firm uses the cash to rebuild its business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors holding Dong&#8217;s 4.875 percent bond due 3013 have
enjoyed a 14 percent return since the debt was issued in July
last year and a 5.5 percent note maturing in 3005 gained 4.6
percent. Creditors holding Vattenfall AB&#8217;s 5.25 percent
perpetual note received 4.3 percent in Sweden&#8217;s biggest utility
over the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bringing in Goldman was a good idea,&#8221; Finance Minister
Bjarne Corydon said in an interview at Denmark&#8217;s parliament in
Copenhagen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half a year after Goldman&#8217;s purchase of a stake in state-held Dong split the minority coalition of Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, investors are benefiting from the transaction.
The Wall Street bank&#8217;s $1.5 billion purchase of an 18 percent
stake was part of a deal, made together with pension funds ATP
and PFA, that helped cauterize losses after Dong failed to turn
a profit on natural gas projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Put Option &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which bought the stake through its European
merchant banking unit in a company named New Energy Investment
S.a.r.l., has already seen the value of its stake grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horsens, Denmark-based utility Insero this month exercised
a put option to sell a 1.8 percent stake in Dong to Denmark for
942 million kroner. That price values all of Dong at more than
50 billion kroner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dong was valued at 31.5 billion kroner ahead of Denmark
selling shares worth 13.1 billion kroner to Goldman, pension
funds ATP and PFA and a group of shareholders in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insero&#8217;s price was based on a 2005-2006 valuation with
added interests minus dividends, Peter Brixen, the head of the
unit that manages the ministry&#8217;s stake, said in an e-mailed
reply to questions. Other minority holders, such as SEAS-NVE and
Syd Energi A/S, which control more than 10 percent, were also
able to sell shares at the same terms at Insero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on Dong&#8217;s 3013 hybrid bond eased to about 2.8
percent this week, compared with 5.238 when it was issued in
July last year. Its spread to the government yield curve has
narrowed to about 264 basis points from a high of 355 basis
points in January, a month after the government split. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Popular Protest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman became the target of a popular protest in Denmark
after it emerged in December that the investment bank will
receive some veto rights over how Dong is managed in exchange
for its capital injection. Goldman has said it plans to follow
the current management&#8217;s strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dong explores for oil and natural gas in the North Sea and
is the world&#8217;s biggest builder of offshore wind turbine parks.
The company said yesterday net losses are narrowing and debt
shrinking after it completed a program of cuts and asset sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Jakob Magnussen, an analyst at Danske Bank
A/S, Dong&#8217;s hybrid bonds have also benefited from a general
appetite from investors for yields and &#8220;risk-taking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recommends investors to buy into Dong&#8217;s two most recent
hybrid bonds with call options in 2018 and 2022, respectively,
as the bonds carry a limited risk to get extended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dong has very solid financial metrics,&#8221; Magnussen said.
&#8220;They&#8217;re actually much better than the company&#8217;s long-term
targets, so we&#8217;re expecting them to increase their leverage in
the coming quarters. They want to lower their funds from
operations to net debt margin to 30 percent from 55 percent
currently after they received new equity from Goldman and the
other shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was accused of widespread gender discrimination and a &#8220;boy&#8217;s club&#8221; atmosphere that included bouts of binge drinking and trips to strip clubs, as two former female employees seek to expand their lawsuit against the firm with new evidence. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The women asked a federal judge in Manhattan today to let them sue on behalf of current and former female associates and vice presidents. Support for their claims includes statements of former Goldman Sachs employees, expert statistical analyses and evidence on earnings and promotions from the firm&#8217;s own records, they said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Women report a &#8216;boy&#8217;s club&#8217; atmosphere, where binge drinking is common and women are either sexualized or ignored,&#8221; according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two women, H. Cristina Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich, sued in 2010 and are seeking to broaden the case to include more than a decade of claimed discrimination at Goldman Sachs. A decision by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres to allow the women to sue as a class would increase the risk to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, filed in 2010, the women seek unspecified damages and an order requiring Goldman Sachs to fix the alleged gender bias at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, whose eight years atop JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) have made him one of Wall Street&#8217;s most powerful leaders, said he&#8217;ll start treatment for throat cancer, raising new questions about succession plans at the biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, the company&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, told employees and shareholders in a memo his condition is curable and that he&#8217;ll continue running the firm &#8220;as normal&#8221; during eight weeks of radiation and chemotherapy. The treatment will start soon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, limiting his travel, the CEO said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 58, has led New York-based JPMorgan since the end of 2005, navigating the 2008 financial crisis without a loss and doubling annual profit as the lender&#8217;s shares climbed 45 percent. Six months ago, the board credited his ability to resolve government probes of the bank. The illness will revive questions about how the panel would theoretically handle his succession, said Ralph Cole, a portfolio manager at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management Inc. in Portland, Oregon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Transition has always been a question and now that will be at the top of investors&#8217; minds,&#8221; Cole said. &#8220;They have to be very vocal about who&#8217;s going to be stepping up during the eight-week period. They&#8217;ve got to be clear with everybody about who that is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate bond sales worldwide capped
the busiest first half of a year on record as borrowers take
advantage of investor demand stoked by central banks&#8217;
unprecedented stimulus measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which sold a
combined $14 billion yesterday, pushed offerings during the
first six months of 2014 to $2.29 trillion, beating the previous
peak of $2.28 trillion issued during the same period in 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yesterday was the
busiest day since June 10 in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central banks&#8217; actions to depress short-term lending rates
have impelled institutional investors to seek higher-yielding
company debt. While the European Central Bank cut its main
refinancing rate to a record-low 15 basis points on June 5, the
U.S. Federal Reserve is holding its benchmark rate near zero
into a sixth year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The demand for these corporate bonds is so strong it&#8217;s
outstripping the record supply,&#8221; said Brian Reynolds, chief
market strategist for brokerage firm Rosenblatt Securities Inc.
in New York. &#8220;Institutional investors like insurance companies
and foundations are buying more aggressively now than ever in
order to reach their yield targets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Issuance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle, the largest maker of database software, issued $10
billion of bonds yesterday in the second-biggest dollar-denominated corporate bond offering this year, while Goldman
Sachs sold $4 billion of notes, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Yesterday&#8217;s offerings in the U.S. totaled $15.9
billion, Bloomberg data show. The year&#8217;s biggest corporate issue
in the U.S. was a $12 billion sale from Apple Inc. in April, the
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance is accelerating as borrowers take advantage of
yields approaching historic lows and the extra yield investors
demand for the risk of holding corporate bonds instead of
government securities is at about the least since 2007, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. corporate bond market is off to its fastest pace
for the first half of the year with more than $880 billion sold,
up from $789 billion in the same period last year, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-grade offerings reached $683.2 billion for the
first half, beating the previous record of $655.4 billion set in
the same period in 2009, Bloomberg data show. Yesterday&#8217;s high-grade sales of $14.75 billion were the most since $16.1 billion
on May 12, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High Yield &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade sales also reached a record for the first
half, with $196.8 billion that topped the previous high of $184
billion in 2013, the data show. High-yield, high-risk bonds are
rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and less than BBB-at Standard  Poor&#8217;s. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. corporate bonds have generated returns of 5.9 percent,
or 12.2 percent annualized, which would be the last decade&#8217;s
second best year after 2009. In the first half of that year,
issuance surged as banks sold securities backed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.&#8217;s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
and credit markets began to unfreeze after the financial crisis,
reviving investor confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, companies are debuting a record amount of bonds
as investors demanding higher yields show greater tolerance for
untested borrowers who are seeking to diversify funding as banks
curtail lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It reflects the reduced ability of European banks to make
business loans,&#8221; said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody&#8217;s
Capital Markets Research Group. &#8220;Non-financial companies are
being forced to enter the bond market to secure capital&#8221;
because they can&#8217;t rely on banks for loans, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of junk bonds in Europe exceeded $100 billion this
year for the first time, up from $56 billion in the first half
of 2013, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The record global bond issuance has a European accent,&#8221;
said Lonski. &lt;/p&gt;

Equiniti Group Ltd., a closely held U.K. financial-services
provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equiniti, based in Lancing, England, didn&#8217;t disclose what
it will pay for JPMorgan&#8217;s Corporate Dealing Services unit. The
transaction is scheduled to be completed by Aug. 31, Equiniti

&lt;p&gt;The acquisition &#8220;further strengthens our position,&#8221; Paul

according to the statement. JPMorgan is the largest corporate
broker to companies in the FTSE 100, offering advice to 34

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was fined
$800,000 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for
failing to have procedures in place to ensure clients in its
dark pool got the best price while trading stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 395,000 transactions were executed in the New

national best bid and offer from July 29 to Aug. 9, 2011, Finra
said today in a statement. Stock venues in the U.S. are obliged
to price trades at the NBBO or better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs discovered the pricing errors and sent checks
to customers to compensate for the mistakes, people with direct
knowledge of the matter said in March. Finra said today that the
firm returned $1.67 million to affected customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was unaware of the errors at the time,
according to the Finra statement. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index tumbled 13 percent through the first eight days of August
2011, while the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index
hit a multiyear high of 48 on Aug. 8. &lt;/p&gt;

JPMorgan last month appointed John Bilton from Bank of America Corp. to head the global strategy team, a role Nuttall also previously covered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are delighted to have further strengthened our investment team with the recent appointment of Neill,&#8221; Andrew Wilson, Goldman Sachs Asset Management&#8217;s CEO for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said by e-mail. &#8220;With over 30 years of investment experience, Neill will serve as the head of all of our investment activities, overseeing strategic and tactical allocation&#8221; for the GPS Group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Firms including Invesco Perpetual and Aviva Investors have sought to capitalize on the growing demand for multi asset investing, where money is deployed across asset classes from equities to infrastructure.

a broken economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s dollar-denominated notes have gained 5.9
percent since rebels took over swaths of northern Iraq on June
11, stoking concern that crude production will be hurt and
pushing Brent oil prices over $115 for the first time since
September. While the return was more than 14 times the average
for emerging-market debt, the extra yield of 8.63 percentage
points that investors demand to own Venezuela&#8217;s bonds instead of
U.S. Treasuries is still the highest in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any extra cash generated by the OPEC member&#8217;s oil exports
is likely to be siphoned off to pay for imports of consumer
goods amid shortages of drinking water, toilet paper and
medicine that have sparked anti-government protests, according
to Daniel Volberg, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.
After currency devaluations and energy output declines,
President Nicolas Maduro is struggling to prop up an economy
posting the world&#8217;s fastest inflation and facing the worst
growth prospects outside Equatorial Guinea, according to the
International Monetary Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The level of macroeconomic dysfunction is so deep that
the story really isn&#8217;t about oil prices anymore,&#8221; said Alberto Ramos, the chief Latin American economist at Goldman Sachs in
New York. &#8220;Unless policies change dramatically, I&#8217;d be
concerned even with the oil price at $150.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Currency Controls &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Maduro succeeded his mentor, the late Hugo Chavez, in
March 2013, the economy&#8217;s stagnation has deepened as currency
controls impeded imports and factories shut down. The number of
cars built in Venezuela fell 77 percent in the first five months
of this year as automakers including Ford Motor Co. and Toyota
Motor Corp. froze production while American Airlines Inc. (AAL) and
Air Canada have cut back flights to the country because of
difficulty getting money out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the nation has kept paying its debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan dollar bonds have returned 19 percent this year,
the best performance among developing countries, as suppressed
interest rates in the U.S. and Europe boosted demand for higher-yielding assets. The average yield on Venezuela&#8217;s dollar debt is
the highest in the world at 11.16 percent, 0.8 percentage point
more than lower-rated Argentina, which faces default as soon as
July 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bank Meetings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela will continue to meet its obligations, Rafael
Ramirez, the economy vice president, said June 27. Officials are
meeting representatives of Bank of America Corp. Citigroup Inc.,
Credit Suisse AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs in Caracas
to discuss debt, Ramirez said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela&#8217;s Finance Ministry didn&#8217;t respond to e-mail
messages sent yesterday seeking comment on the government&#8217;s
debt-payment policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew Benson, a spokesman for Credit Suisse in New York
declined to comment, as did Kerrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for
Deutsche Bank in New York. Press officers at Bank of America,
Citigroup and Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t respond to requests for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic Fundamentals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&#8217;s rally in the bonds doesn&#8217;t &#8220;make sense given
the direction fundamentals are going in Venezuela,&#8221; Volberg
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s international reserves fell 18 percent in the
last 12 months to $21 billion on June 27. Arrears to importers
and their banks may be worth as much as half the central bank&#8217;s
reported reserves, Volberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual inflation reached 61 percent in May after the
government carried out its biggest devaluation since the
introduction of currency controls in 2003. The economy will
probably contract this year and next by as much as 1 percent,
according to the IMF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While higher oil provides some benefits, signs that Maduro
is turning toward more pragmatic policies after four months of
unrest across the country may be more encouraging to investors,
according to Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month Maduro fired Planning Minister Jorge Giordani, a
long-term advocate of currency controls who taught Chavez
economics in jail in the early 1990s. The country plans to merge
its three official foreign exchange rates, Ramirez told
investors in London in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exchange Rate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rates range from 6.3 bolivars per dollar to 50 bolivars
per dollar. On the black market, the bolivar trades at 72.18 per
dollar. The government is likely to unify exchange rates at
about 25 per dollar, according to Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to the government of exchanging its oil dollars
for bolivars at the official rate is the equivalent of 10
percent of gross domestic product, and authorities make that up
by printing money, according to Francisco Rodriguez, an
economist at Bank of America in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Venezuela has a source of revenue it can use and with
unification it would pretty much solve its fiscal problem,&#8221;
Rodriguez said by phone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s oil exports are falling as production wanes
at state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Oil sales declined 8.4
percent last year to $114 billion, the company said June 27.
Output sank about 11,000 barrels a day in 2013 to a total of 2.9
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical indicators based on historical prices also
indicate the Venezuelan bonds may have risen too far, too fast.
The 14-day relative strength index on dollar bonds has been
above 70 since June 19, indicating they&#8217;re the most overbought
in two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question is how long the markets are willing to give
Venezuela a free pass and how long this process can go on before
you have a more disorderly adjustment,&#8221; Volberg said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker
Matthew Korenberg, the subject of a years-long insider-trading
probe tied to Galleon Group LLC, was told he won&#8217;t be sued by
regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Hueston, a lawyer for Korenberg, said in a telephone
interview that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
which was ready to file a civil complaint 18 months ago,
officially &#8220;de-authorized&#8221; his client as a lawsuit target.
Hueston said it&#8217;s &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; for the SEC to be persuaded
to drop a case it was ready to proceed with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Too often cases are filed and reputations are ruined
before mistakes of fact and judgment are realized,&#8221; Hueston
said. &#8220;There has been real cost here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has had mixed success in trials over insider-trading allegations. It lost a jury verdict last month against
STEC Inc.&#8217;s former chief executive officer, Manouchehr
Moshayedi, whom it accused of making $134 million from insider
information. That was its third loss since October out of four
such cases to go trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20 people have been convicted of insider trading
tied to the investigation of Galleon Group and the fund&#8217;s co-founder, Raj Rajaratnam. He was convicted in 2011 and is serving
an 11-year prison sentence for masterminding one of the most
sprawling insider-trading schemes in a generation. His brother
Rengan is on trial for insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abbott Acquisition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC and U.S. prosecutors were investigating Korenberg
for insider trading involving Abbott Laboratories Inc.&#8217;s
acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics Inc. in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a separate investigation, ex-Baltimore Orioles third
baseman Doug DeCinces was charged with making $1.3 million in
profit from insider information about that transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DeCinces case isn&#8217;t connected to Korenberg&#8217;s, Hueston
said. A parallel criminal investigation of Korenberg was
previously closed, according to the lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korenberg left Goldman Sachs at the end of 2012 and has
been focused on defending against the allegations, Hueston said.
He was a banker at Goldman in San Francisco and now lives in the
Philadelphia area, Hueston said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Nester, a spokesman for the SEC, declined to comment
on Korenberg&#8217;s case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was accused by two former employees seeking to expand their lawsuit of discriminating against women while male colleagues engaged in binge drinking and took clients to strip clubs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The women asked a federal judge in Manhattan yesterday to let them sue on behalf of current and former female associates and vice presidents. Support for their claims includes statements of former Goldman Sachs employees, expert statistical analyses and evidence on earnings and promotions from the firm&#8217;s own records, they said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Women report a &#8216;boy&#8217;s club&#8217; atmosphere, where binge drinking is common and women are either sexualized or ignored,&#8221; according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two women, H. Cristina Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich, sued in 2010 and are seeking to broaden the case to include more than a decade of claimed discrimination at Goldman Sachs. A decision by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres to allow the women to sue as a class would increase the risk to the New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, filed in 2010, the women seek unspecified damages and an order requiring Goldman Sachs to fix the alleged gender bias at the firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Salaries, Promotions &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Female vice presidents earned 21 percent less than men and female associates made 8 percent less, the former employees claimed. About 23 percent fewer female vice presidents were promoted to managing director of the bank relative to their male counterparts, they said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those statistics are attributed to an analysis of Goldman Sachs pay data by Henry S. Farber, a Princeton University economist. His samples included all associates and vice presidents in the firm&#8217;s New York class from 2003 to 2011 and throughout the U.S. from 2005 to 2011, according to a court filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has denied the women&#8217;s claims and is fighting the case. The bank believes the statistical arguments are misleading and don&#8217;t compare similar employees to one another, said a person briefed on its legal strategy who requested anonymity because the firm hasn&#8217;t responded to the data in court. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a normal and anticipated procedural step for any proposed class action lawsuit and does not change the case&#8217;s lack of merit,&#8221; David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Strip Clubs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chen-Oster and Orlich are seeking to persuade Torres that their claims are sufficiently similar to those of other women at Goldman Sachs so they can represent them in a single case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They&#8217;re asking Torres to certify a class of female associates and vice presidents who worked for the company in the U.S. in its investment banking, investment management and securities divisions beginning Sept. 10, 2004. The start date for employees who worked in New York City would be July 7, 2002. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Denise Shelley, a vice president who left the firm in 2009, said in a court filing that men at Goldman Sachs repeatedly called women &#8220;bimbos,&#8221; mocked a new hire who had won a beauty pageant and took clients to strip clubs. Shelley said in the filing that she sat on the steering committee of the firm&#8217;s network for women and, after joining colleagues at a bar, was called a &#8220;party girl&#8221; by a managing director. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is Chen-Oster v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 10-cv-06950, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J.

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, whose eight years atop JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) have made him one of Wall Street&#8217;s most powerful leaders, said he&#8217;ll start treatment for throat cancer, raising new questions about succession plans at the biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, the company&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, told employees and shareholders in a memo his condition is curable and that he&#8217;ll continue running the firm &#8220;as normal&#8221; during eight weeks of radiation and chemotherapy. The treatment will start soon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, limiting his travel, the CEO said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 58, has led New York-based JPMorgan since the end of 2005, navigating the 2008 financial crisis without a loss and doubling annual profit as the lender&#8217;s shares climbed about 45 percent. Six months ago, the board credited his ability to resolve government probes of the bank. The illness will revive questions about how the panel would theoretically handle his succession, said Ralph Cole, a portfolio manager at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management Inc. in Portland, Oregon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Transition has always been a question and now that will be at the top of investors&#8217; minds,&#8221; Cole said. &#8220;They have to be very vocal about who&#8217;s going to be stepping up during the eight-week period. They&#8217;ve got to be clear with everybody about who that is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVC Capital Partners Ltd. picked
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse
Group AG to manage a sale of its shares in Indonesian Internet
service provider PT Link Net Tbk (LINK), people with knowledge of the
matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-based buyout firm may raise about $500 million
from the offering, two of the people said, asking not to be
identified as the process is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC is seeking to divest its stake after Link Net stock
more than tripled since listing on the Indonesia Stock Exchange
last month. At $500 million, the share sale would be the biggest
in Indonesia this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, CVC and Indonesia&#8217;s Lippo Group raised $1.5
billion divesting their stakes in PT Matahari Department Store (LPPF)
in Indonesia&#8217;s biggest share sale, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. PT First Media Tbk, a company backed by Lippo Group, is
the other main investor in Link Net. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC owns a 49 percent stake in Link Net, valued at about
$742 million at the current share price, according to exchange
filings. Link Net&#8217;s initial public offering raised $42 million,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported the bank mandates
yesterday, citing unidentified people. CVC declined to comment

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has
appointed Nell Hutton to head its fixed-income, currency and
commodities sales for Australia and New Zealand, an internal
memo showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hutton will report both to Simon Rothery, chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs&#8217; Australian operations, and to James Houghton, head of fixed-income, currency and commodities
distribution for Asia Pacific ex-Japan, according to the memo
seen by Bloomberg News. Hutton, who previously oversaw corporate
advisory solutions in the region, joined Goldman in 1999 in
London, relocated to Australia in 2006, and was named a managing
director in 2007, the memo showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothery said in a Feb. 27 interview that Australian fixed-income trading was his biggest growth area in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s stable AAA credit rating made the nation a
haven and has encouraged inflows from sovereign-wealth funds, he
said. Goldman Sachs also saw opportunities to arrange debt
offerings and capture more of the market for Kangaroo bonds, or
Australian dollar-denominated securities sold by overseas
borrowers, Rothery said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
biggest energy company by market value, will invest $1 billion
to increase diesel production at its Antwerp refinery . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will add a delayed coker unit at the 320,000
barrel-a-day refinery in Belgium that will convert high-sulfur
oil to diesel for use in trucks and ships, the Irving, Texas-based company said in a statement today. Exxon has spent $2
billion in the past decade on expansions in the refinery
including a 130 megawatt power plant and hydrotreater unit that
reduces sulfur from fuels, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The investment addresses an industry shortfall in
capability to convert fuel oil to products such as diesel,&#8221;
Exxon said in the statement. The expansion &#8220;is the first of
several being evaluated to further strengthen strategic
refineries in Europe to more successfully face the challenging
industry environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s announcement comes after Total SA (FP), the biggest
refiner in western Europe, reported a 10 percent decline in
profit in the quarter ended March 31 on smaller crude-processing
margins caused by overcapacity. European refinery margins shrank
to $6.60 per metric ton of crude processed in the three months
from $26.90 a year earlier, Total said in April, citing its
European Refining Margin Indicator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s shares have increased 0.2 percent this year,
compared with the 6.8 percent gain in the SP 500 Index (SPX) and a
2.3 percent advance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The
stock gained 0.7 percent to $101.36 in New York yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For African building laborer Mamadou Diallo, Portugal (PTGDPQOQ)&#8217;s success in attracting investors to its real-estate market is laced with bitter irony. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 38-year-old Guinean said he has lived in the country for the past seven years, working in different construction projects and paying his taxes. That hasn&#8217;t been enough to gain residency in Portugal. Yet for a buyer of a property worth more than 500,000 euros ($682,000), the kind Diallo helps build, a visa can come with the purchase deeds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If I had half a million euros to buy a house all my problems would be over,&#8221; Diallo said in fluent Portuguese during an interview in downtown Lisbon. &#8220;This is so unfair.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fair or not, the practice has been heralded by governments in southern Europe as a much-needed boost to economies trying to put the continent&#8217;s financial woes behind them. While Malta drew the attention of the European Union this year after introducing a program effectively selling citizenship, it&#8217;s Portugal that has been attracting the most new residents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The country issued 1,161 visas since its program began in 2012, representing 699 million euros of investment mainly from China, Portugal&#8217;s Foreign Ministry said this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, is among companies embroiled in a European Union
inquiry into Luxembourg&#8217;s tax treatment of multinational firms,
according to three people familiar with the EU&#8217;s review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has quizzed Luxembourg about how it
taxes Microsoft&#8217;s intellectual property, said one of the people,
who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.
Competition regulators also asked questions about McDonald&#8217;s
Corp. (MCD)&#8217;s taxes in Luxembourg, two of the people said. Amazon.com
Inc.&#8217;s tax affairs there are also being looked at, the Financial
Times reported yesterday, citing an EU official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid a global crackdown on tax avoidance, EU competition
regulators last month opened a probe into suspected tax breaks
for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in Ireland, Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) in the Netherlands
and Fiat Finance  Trade SA in Luxembourg, the bloc&#8217;s richest
country in per capita terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in constant contact with the European Commission
on all these tax issues and Luxembourg is pretty confident in
the way it handles its taxation issues and so we&#8217;re going to
monitor the information with the commission and hand over the
information that is requested,&#8221; Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg
Finance Minister, said today on CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scrutiny of Luxembourg is also a potential
embarrassment for Jean-Claude Juncker, who is primed to become
the next president of the commission -- the EU&#8217;s executive arm
in charge of the investigation. Juncker, who led Luxembourg
until last year, helped the country win a reputation as an
attractive location for international companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Member States &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commission continues to gather information about
certain tax practices in several member states,&#8221; Antoine Colombani, spokesman for Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, said. &#8220;However we will not make any comment on whether
specific companies may or may not be covered by this information
gathering exercise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabina Gockel, a spokeswoman for Microsoft in Brussels,
declined to comment. Joanna Kwiatkowska, a spokeswoman for
McDonald&#8217;s in the U.K., didn&#8217;t immediately respond to calls and
an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natasha Bertaud, a spokeswoman for Juncker at the
commission, said the former Luxembourg premier also has no
comment. Lawmakers at the European Parliament are scheduled to
vote on his appointment later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucien Michels, a spokesman for Luxembourg&#8217;s finance
ministry, declined to comment on Amazon&#8217;s possible involvement
in the tax inquiry. He didn&#8217;t immediately respond to e-mailed
questions concerning other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;French Unit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald&#8217;s denied earlier this year a magazine report that
it avoided paying taxes related to more than $3 billion of
