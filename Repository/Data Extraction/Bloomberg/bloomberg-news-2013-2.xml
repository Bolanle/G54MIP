&lt;p&gt;The federal judge overseeing a
settlement between International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and
U.S. regulators over alleged foreign bribes said he won&#8217;t drop
demands for reports of possible wrongdoing by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, who refused to accept the
deal the company struck with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, denied IBM&#8217;s request to alter a requirement that he
be told about any future law enforcement or administrative or
probes. He agreed to narrow his insistence that IBM tell him of
accounting violations to include only those involving payments
covered by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bear in mind, this is a company that has a history of
violating the books and records provision of the FCPA,&#8221; Leon
said today during a 20-minute hearing in Washington. &#8220;This is a
company that has made major payments to foreign governments in
the past.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leon said in December there&#8217;s a growing awareness among
federal judges of the need for more rigorous review of corporate
settlement agreements. Even so, his extended challenge to an
agreed-upon settlement between a company and the government is a
rare occurrence. Of 34 foreign bribery settlements the SEC
reached with companies since 2010, only two others failed to win
judicial sign-off in less than three months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is giving its wealthiest clients the chance to invest in the single-family rental market after other investments linked to the U.S. housing recovery jumped in value. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s unit that caters to individuals and families with more than $5 million, put client money in a partnership that bought more than 5,000 single family homes to rent in Florida, Arizona, Nevada and California, said David Lyon, a managing director and investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Investors can expect returns of as much as 8 percent annually from rental income as well as part of the profits when the homes are sold, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s wealthy clients are joining a growing number of private-equity firms and individuals buying rental homes in the regions hardest hit by the U.S. housing crash. Blackstone Group LP (BX) has spent $2.7 billion, and said last month it accelerated purchases as home prices rise faster than anticipated. Even after home values in November gained by the most in six years, investors are wagering on rental properties as an alternative to housing-related stocks and mortgage debt that&#8217;s already soared. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The traditional places people might look -- homebuilder stocks and appliance makers -- probably aren&#8217;t the best places for new investments,&#8221; said John Buckingham, chief investment officer at Al Frank Asset Management in Aliso Viejo, California, which oversees about $4.5 billion. &#8220;They&#8217;ve had fantastic runs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

PulteGroup Inc., the largest homebuilder by market value, was the biggest gainer on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index last year, rising 188 percent, helping an index of 11 builders more than double since the end of 2011, and raising concern among analysts including Michael Widner of Stifel Nicolaus  Co. that growth is already priced in.

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM), UBS AG (UBSN) and Depfa Bank Plc took advantage of the city of
Milan, tricking the municipality into agreeing to a financing
deal that didn&#8217;t meet its objective of cutting borrowing costs,
wrote the judge who convicted the four banks in the fraud case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks should have informed the municipality of the
charges related to the derivatives that were part of the
transactions, Judge Oscar Magi in Milan wrote today in
explaining the convictions he handed down in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city, which &#8220;wasn&#8217;t up to&#8221; carrying out its own
analysis of the economic advantage of the financing package,
needed protection and clear information, Magi said.
&#8220;Information deficiencies manifested themselves and caused a
grave asymmetry of information,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks, whose employees involved in the case were
registered with Britain&#8217;s Financial Services Authority, violated
U.K. rules by failing to inform the city that it was a
counterparty to the lenders rather than a customer. The banks
acted as arrangers of a bond sale, or advisers to the
municipality, as well as its counterparties, the judge wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When contacted by Bloomberg News, the banks said they
disagree with the verdict and plan to appeal, reiterating their
stance following the December ruling. Chris Hamilton, a
spokesman for the FSA in London, declined to immediately
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magi in December ordered that about 90 million euros ($122
million) of assets be seized from the banks, the amount of their
profit, and that they pay sanctions of 1 million euros each. He
also convicted nine bankers of fraud and suspended their
sentences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said Italian securities rules indicate that there
is an obligation to disclose the cost of derivatives to the
client, a duty that in this case was reinforced by the multiple
roles played by the banks. Under FSA rules, banks are required
to shield customers from conflicts of interest and failed to
inform Milan of the &#8220;obvious&#8221; conflict, Magi wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contracts, given the amounts involved, are likely to
have been vetted by the most senior managers of the banks,
according to Magi. The bankers then &#8220;executed&#8221; directives they
were given, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. will introduce
computers from Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Acer Inc. (2353) and other
manufacturers in the next two months, seeking to make up for the
dearth of tablets and touch-screen devices that marred the debut
of its flagship Windows 8 software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Hewlett-Packard Envy series device, doubling as a tablet
and laptop, is available for order now at $849.99, while Acer
will sell a 10-inch tablet for $499. Asustek Computer Inc. (2357)&#8217;s
convertible tablet weighs just over 1.5 pounds and has two
batteries for 19 hours of battery life, according to Aidan
Marcuss, principal director at Windows Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chip delays and Microsoft&#8217;s restrictions on new hardware
meant that the company&#8217;s Windows operating system, released 
on Oct. 26, was featured on a limited number of tablets. 
Windows 8 was designed to win back customers moving to
Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad and tablets with Google Inc.&#8217;s Android
software, making it critical that Microsoft&#8217;s hardware partners
offer compelling touch-screen devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t have concerns about awareness, and I don&#8217;t have
concerns about interest,&#8221; Tami Reller, chief financial officer
for the Windows unit, said in an interview, when asked about
Windows 8 demand. &#8220;Now I feel increasingly good about mapping
that interest to having those customers find the device they
want on the shelf.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Executive Vice President Todd Bradley last
month described Windows 8&#8217;s initial sales as slower than many
had expected. Microsoft now has 2,000 devices certified for use
with the new Windows, double what was available when the
operating system was released, Reller said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Devices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern at the release in October was the lack of
machines with Intel Corp. (INTC)&#8217;s latest low-power chips, code-named
Clover Trail. In early December, only two Clover Trail devices
were on sale in the U.S., and only low quantities, Marcuss said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new machines, targeted at consumers, from Hewlett-
Packard, Acer and Asustek all use that chip, which provides a
longer battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)&#8217;s ThinkPad Tablet 2, aimed at business
customers with 10 hours of battery life, goes on sale this month
for $699. Microsoft is also trying to get cheaper notebooks with
touch features into stores since Window 8&#8217;s new design is
focused around finger swipes and other gestures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New devices that run on Windows RT, a variant of the
operating system that runs on chips with technology from ARM
Holdings Plc (ARM), won&#8217;t be released this spring, Reller said.
Microsoft is still focused on getting the five announced in
October into stores in large numbers, she said. One partner,
Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), has opted not to sell its Windows RT
tablet in the U.S., she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Limited Selection &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) Chief Executive Officer Paul Jacobs, whose
company makes chips for Windows RT tablets, raised concerns
about the limited selection, a result of Microsoft&#8217;s
restrictions on which manufacturers could make tablet devices
for that system, he said. Jacobs said in an interview last week
that his company hasn&#8217;t been surprised by muted demand for the
new Windows, as shown by the chipmaker&#8217;s cautious forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that there were only a handful of manufacturers
that were allowed to participate, definitely in my mind held
down the competition on form factors and everything that I would
have liked to have seen,&#8221; Jacobs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs said he&#8217;s confident in the long-term opportunity for
his chips in computers, and remains committed to investing in
the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reller said more Windows 8-based tablets will probably be
sold, compared with those running Windows RT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will scale over time, but right now we&#8217;re focused on
making sure the designs that have been built do have commercial
availability and commercial success, and we&#8217;ll stay focused on
that for the short-term,&#8221; said Reller, who declined to provide
updated sales numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest investment-grade bond
loss in 14 months is bolstering Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s view
that the unprecedented bull market in the notes is over.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. disagrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With bonds of the most-creditworthy borrowers from the U.S.
to Europe and Asia losing 0.8 percent in January, Bank of
America strategist Hans Mikkelsen cut his forecast for
investment-grade debt returns last week, saying a sustained
shift away from notes will cause borrowing costs to soar. At
JPMorgan, Eric Beinstein said he&#8217;s skeptical bond losses will
deepen because the biggest debt buyers are unlikely to switch to
equities and central banks will keep supporting the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt strategists at the two biggest U.S. banks are coming
into conflict after a 44 percent rally since 2008 left yields at
a record-low 2.55 percent in December and the best start to a
year for stocks in two decades added $2.6 trillion to their
market value. JPMorgan anticipates more government stimulus that
bolsters credit as the International Monetary Fund lowers its
forecast for global growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite concerns about a potential rotation out of
credit, demand for investment-grade debt will continue to be
supported,&#8221; Greg Hall, managing director in debt capital
markets at Barclays Plc in New York, wrote in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, won support from Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite for shale-gas exploration plans that some of the
country&#8217;s residents and lawmakers oppose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithuania needs to find out to how far its shale-gas
reserves can go as an alternative to Russian natural gas,
spokeswoman Daiva Ulbinaite quoted the president as saying today
after a meeting with Jay Johnson, Chevron&#8217;s head of Eurasia,
Europe and Middle East exploration and production, in the
capital, Vilnius. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East European countries, including Poland and Ukraine, are
turning to shale gas in their efforts to lower energy costs and
their dependence on Russian supplies. Chevron in October bought
50 percent of a Lithuanian oil and gas recovery company and in
January submitted the only bid in a tender for shale-gas
exploration rights in the Baltic nation. Some landowners and
lawmakers have urged the government to halt the tender on
concern that the exploration process could contaminate ground
water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect to be able to engage with the local
communities&#8221; and assuage their concerns, Chevron&#8217;s Johnson told
reporters at the president&#8217;s office. &#8220;We&#8217;re very pleased with
the chance to help create Lithuania&#8217;s energy future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reserve Potential &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithuania, which wants to reduce it&#8217;s total dependence on
Russia&#8217;s Gazprom OAO (GAZP) for natural gas supplies, probably has
about 180 billion cubic meters of recoverable shale gas, KPMG
said in a report in May. That&#8217;s the equivalent of 60 years of
gas consumption in the country, at current usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shale-gas reserves in Lithuania, at an estimated depth of 2
kilometers (1.2 miles), are twice as close to the surface as in
neighboring Poland, so should be easier and cheaper to extract,
KPMG said, citing geological studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will assist LL Investicijos UAB, the Lithuanian
company it half owns, with well design and seismic exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our first step is the assessment of what the resource
potential is,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;At that point we report to the
government and we work with the government to determine any
future progress.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron recently opened an office in Lithuania, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President Gary Cohn said he&#8217;s &#8220;bullish&#8221; on China even after his firm last week sold a $1 billion stake in Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation&#8217;s largest bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can absolutely still make money off Chinese banks,&#8221; Cohn, 52, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television&#8217;s Susan Li in Hong Kong yesterday, without naming specific banks. &#8220;We are very positive, optimistic, but cautious, about where China&#8217;s going.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s sale of the stake followed an almost 50 percent advance in ICBC stock from its 2012 low. Investing in local lenders in China has reaped bigger profits for foreign banks than operating their own franchises in the world&#8217;s second- largest banking market. BNP Paribas SA in December said it plans to increase investments in Bank of Nanjing Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm sold part of an investment first made in January 2006 when Goldman Sachs and client funds it manages agreed to invest $2.58 billion in Beijing-based ICBC. The U.S. bank and the funds have since offloaded ICBC shares at least five times, data compiled by Bloomberg show, and the New York- based firm has recorded more than $3.1 billion of gains on its proprietary holding, according to company filings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the latest transaction, Goldman sold 1.35 billion shares at HK$5.77 each, 3 percent lower than the Chinese lender&#8217;s HK$5.95 closing price in Hong Kong on Jan. 28. It continues to hold more than $1 billion of ICBC stock, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Very Happy&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will continue to be invested in China,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s been an important strategic relationship with them for a long period of time and we&#8217;re very happy being shareholders of ICBC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Global financial firms including Temasek Holdings Pte, Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. invested a combined $33 billion in Chinese banks from 2001 to 2009, according to data compiled by the China Banking Regulatory Commission. Profits at the biggest local lenders, which are controlled by the government, have since defied the global economic slowdown and risen to a record. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earnings at ICBC, the world&#8217;s biggest lender by market value, probably gained 10 percent to 229.7 billion yuan ($36.8 billion) last year, according to the average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. That would mark its seventh year of record profit since becoming publicly traded in 2006. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although shares of Hong Kong-listed Chinese lenders have rallied since mid-September as the U.S. announced a third round of quantitative easing, they continue to trade at close to record-low valuations on concern that non-performing loans will rise. ICBC is trading at about 6.7 times its estimated earnings for 2013, compared with 11.2 for Goldman Sachs and 9.1 for JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chinese banks are set to report fourth-quarter results next month and first-quarter earnings in April. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass and Jeffrey McCracken" date="Feb 05, 2013  4:21 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-05/microsoft-loan-is-said-to-help-dell-while-avoiding-favoritism.html"><headline>Microsoft Loan Said to Help Dell While Avoiding Favorites</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is using a $2 billion loan to help finance Dell Inc. (DELL)&#8217;s $24.4 billion buyout to bolster one of the largest makers of computers using Windows software and fend off competition from Google Inc. and Apple Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve Ballmer, Microsoft&#8217;s chief executive officer, discussed the loan with Dell founder and CEO Michael Dell, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. Microsoft opted for a loan rather than an equity investment to avoid rankling other personal-computer makers that use Windows, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dell is going private as it seeks leeway to cut jobs and adopt strategy shifts needed to court high-margin customers spending billions on data centers. Microsoft, which counts on Dell to sell PCs and servers with its software, has a vested interest in boosting Dell&#8217;s competitiveness without jeopardizing relationships with other partners such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft is taking a more neutral stance, not giving Dell a favored nation status among their PC partners,&#8221; Jeffrey Fidacaro, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt  Co., said in an interview. &#8220;I was anticipating that they would get a preferred share or something structured, as opposed to a $2 billion loan. That gives them less of a presence and influence on the management after the deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;PC Ecosystem&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s investment helps to support &#8220;the long term success of the entire PC ecosystem,&#8221; the company said in a statement. Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment beyond the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft won&#8217;t be involved in day-to-day operations, Dell Chief Financial Officer Brian Gladden said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) advised Microsoft on the transaction, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking a stake in Dell would have amplified a rift with PC makers that developed after Microsoft pushed into the hardware market in October with its first machine, a tablet called Surface, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc. The loan may be a less worrisome alternative, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s likely to be somewhat more palatable under those terms,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There will still be some uneasiness until the full details of the relationship become clear in practice not just terms on paper.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Similar Path &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft went down a similar path in 2011, when it announced a partnership agreement with handset manufacturer and Windows Phone licensee Nokia Oyj. (NOK1V) Still, Microsoft maintains a close relationship with other Windows Phone sellers, including HTC Corp. (2498) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the loan to Dell, Microsoft adds to a lengthening list of strategic investments in technology companies. The software maker has a stake in Facebook Inc. and invested $300 million in a Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS) subsidiary to focus on e-readers. It also invested $5 billion in 1999 into what was then ATT Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft invested $150 million in then-foundering Apple in 1997. The investment contributed to the very survival of Apple and helped put the company on the long path toward becoming the world&#8217;s most valuable technology company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard seized on Dell&#8217;s buyout as an opportunity to seek new business, saying in a statement that its competitor faces &#8220;a tough road ahead.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Leveraged buyouts tend to leave existing customers and innovation at the curb,&#8221; Hewlett-Packard said. &#8220;We believe Dell&#8217;s customers will now be eager to explore alternatives, and HP plans to take full advantage of that opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dell&#8217;s shares gained 1.1 percent to $13.42 at the close in New York, while Hewlett-Packard advanced 2.7 percent to $16.61 and Microsoft was little changed at $27.50. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Earle and Don Jeffrey" date="Feb 05, 2013  4:15 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-05/jury-in-exxon-case-told-mtbe-still-in-new-hampshire-wells.html"><headline>Jury in Exxon Case Told MTBE Still in New Hampshire Wells</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A gasoline additive that contaminated
New Hampshire&#8217;s drinking water still shows up in wells six years
after it was banned, an expert on fuel spills told a jury
deciding whether ExxonMobil Corp. is liable for the damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Lynn, a manager of the state&#8217;s petroleum remediation
section, testified for the state in Concord today that the
additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, has recently been
detected in sites including a daycare center&#8217;s water supply. He
said the chemical moves through water quickly and unpredictably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s widespread in drinking-water wells and it shows up
frequently in places that we don&#8217;t expect it,&#8221; Lynn said.
&#8220;Groundwater levels are very high in New Hampshire, which makes
our state very vulnerable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire might be seeking more than $200 million from
ExxonMobil, the last defendant on trial in the $816 million
lawsuit filed in 2003. The trial began Jan. 14. The case is one
of scores involving MTBE brought since 2000 against oil
refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil, based in Irving, Texas, has argued that it
can&#8217;t be held liable because when it put MTBE into gasoline it
was complying with federal regulations that pre-empt state law.
The company contends MTBE was added to make gasoline burn more
thoroughly and thus reduce air pollution as required under the
1990 Clean Air Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clean-Air Program &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent Colburn, who once worked for New Hampshire&#8217;s
Department of Environmental Services, testified Jan. 28 that the
state wouldn&#8217;t have participated in a federal clean-air program
called reformulated gasoline, or RFG, if ExxonMobil had warned
of the the additive&#8217;s risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil said in court papers the state was aware of
MTBE&#8217;s risks when it opted into the RFG program in 1991 because
several years of studies on the additive had already been done.
New Hampshire extended its participation in the the clean-air
program in 1997. By 1999, the state was trying to get out of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE, which is highly soluble in water and thus can be
carried great distances from where it leaked, is a &#8220;toxic
chemical that does not belong in the state&#8217;s drinking water,&#8221;
Jessica Grant, an attorney for New Hampshire, said in opening
remarks to the jury. It leaked from gas stations, vehicle
junkyards, underground storage tanks and pipe fittings, the
state said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire said that about 40,000 wells are contaminated
with MTBE and about 5,590 at levels determined to be unfit for
drinking. The additive was banned in New Hampshire as of January
2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monetary Damages &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of contaminated wells is a factor in determining
monetary damages if ExxonMobil is found liable. The state is
also seeking damages based on market share of gasoline sales in
New Hampshire during the period covered by the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil&#8217;s share was about 30 percent, the state said.
Based on an estimated cost of $816 million to test for, monitor
and clean up the groundwater, New Hampshire could be seeking
about $245 million from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 15, New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver
agreed to dismiss the other defendant from this trial, Citgo
Petroleum Corp., while the company and the state work to
complete a settlement. Citgo is the Houston-based unit of
Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the country&#8217;s state-owned oil
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citgo Liability &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citgo&#8217;s market share ranged from 3.1 percent to 8.7
percent, New Hampshire said. Based on those figures, the state
could be seeking $25 million to $71 million from Citgo. If an
accord&#8217;s not reached by Feb. 15 and no extension is approved,
Citgo would be reinstated to the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides ExxonMobil and Citgo, New Hampshire also sued Shell
Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA
and Hess Corp. All settled before the trial began except
ExxonMobil and Citgo. Shell and Sunoco agreed to pay New
Hampshire $35 million in a settlement announced in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire has received more than $100 million in
settlements from defendants so far, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE lawsuits have also been consolidated in federal court
in New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and motions. In
2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York City
$104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells in
the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire&#8217;s lawyers said last week they hoped to
conclude their case by Feb. 21. ExxonMobil would then begin
presenting its case. Previously, the lawyers had said the trial
could last more than four months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-C-0550, New
Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama is trying to rally business support for his immigration proposals at a White House meeting today with a dozen chief executive officers, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Lloyd Blankfein and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)&#8217;s Marissa Mayer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama is pressuring Congress to act by mid-year on comprehensive immigration legislation that would include a path to citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t think of a better topic that will galvanize a lot of the resources necessary in the country to improve the competitive effectiveness of U.S. business,&#8221; Motorola Solutions Inc. Chief Executive Officer Greg Brown said as he headed into the meeting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama also is lobbying for the support of unions and Democratic-leaning activist groups, telling them in a meeting this morning that rewriting immigration law is his top legislative priority for the next few months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are all on the same page,&#8221; said Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, the nation&#8217;s largest labor federation. He is working with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to find common ground on the issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Republican Objections &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a sign of the hurdles to passage of a new law, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee warned today against a &#8220;rush to judgment&#8221; on the issue, saying that there are lots of questions about how a legalization program would work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp.
raised $2 billion in a two-part bond offering that included
floating-rate debt yielding less than the benchmark interest
rate for more than $300 trillion of financial products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest computer-services provider issued equal $1
billion portions of notes due 2015 that pay 2 basis points less
than the London interbank offered rate and 1.25 percent
securities maturing 2018 that yield 47 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s floater sale follows offerings last year by Coca-Cola
Co. and Procter  Gamble Co., which both issued securities
paying less than Libor, the rate at which banks say they can
borrow in dollars from each other. Proceeds from IBM&#8217;s sale will
be used for general corporate purposes, the Armonk, New York-
based company said today in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer maker&#8217;s $1.6 billion of 7.625 percent bonds
due October 2018 traded yesterday at 132 cents on the dollar to
yield 1.7 percent, or 81 basis points more than Treasuries,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM last sold floating-rate debt in December 2010, with a
$1 billion offering of securities due June 2012 that paid 3
basis points more than Libor, Bloomberg data show. The new bonds
are expected to be rated Aa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) economist
Jim O&#8217;Neill, who bound Brazil to Russia, India and China to form
the BRIC investing strategy, will retire this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill, 55, will step down from his current role as
chairman of the asset-management division, which he has held
since 2010, the New York-based firm said today in a statement.
He joined the company in 1995 as a partner, became head of
global economics, commodities and strategy research in 2001 and
was added to the European management committee in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In each of his roles at the firm, Jim has served our
clients by formulating views on global economic and market
themes and helping them to be positioned for the most
significant investment opportunities,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn wrote in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill said in an e-mail he hadn&#8217;t decided what he&#8217;ll do
when he leaves Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim O&#8217;Neill and Eric Lane will continue to co-head the
asset-management division, and there are no plans to replace
O&#8217;Neill as chairman, Andrea Raphael, a Goldman Sachs
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The position was created for him
when he joined the unit, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill developed the BRICs theory following the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, after becoming Goldman Sachs&#8217;s sole chief
economist, to reflect the waning influence of the U.S. on the
world&#8217;s economy. In the years afterward, it was central to
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s economic outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Manchester Fan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is a frequent commentator for media outlets, appearing
on Bloomberg Television and CNBC. An Englishman who is the son
of a postman and graduated from Sheffield University, he has
also worked for Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Goldman Sachs, O&#8217;Neill was head of global
research for Swiss Bank Corp., a firm he joined in 1988,
according to his biography. That company bought S.G. Warburg 
Co., the advisory firm founded by Siegmund Warburg, in 1995,
before joining with Union Bank of Switzerland to form UBS AG in
a deal completed in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lifelong fan of Manchester United, the most successful
soccer club in the U.K., O&#8217;Neill once sat on its board and later
was part of a group considering making a takeover bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill recently published a book entitled &#8220;The Growth
Map: Economic Opportunity in the BRICs and Beyond.&#8221; It updated
and expanded his theory that the BRIC nations would join the
U.S. and Japan as the world&#8217;s biggest economies by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Extremely Overvalued&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So popular has the BRIC term become that its leaders now
meet for annual summits alongside South Africa. O&#8217;Neill remained
a defender of the theory even as the economies slowed and the
membership of Russia was questioned by some because of
governance concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his current role, O&#8217;Neill publishes a regular report to
clients, combining views on the global economic outlook with
details of his travels and commentary on Manchester United&#8217;s
performances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His most recent report, released Jan. 25, cited
&#8220;considerable evidence&#8221; that economies are improving around
the world and suggested the yen is &#8220;extremely overvalued.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told Bloomberg Television in October that he didn&#8217;t
apply to replace Mervyn King as the next governor of the Bank of
England, saying he didn&#8217;t think it was &#8220;appropriate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior Republican lobbyist at
Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. is leaving the bank for a job with Rio
Tinto Group, the world&#8217;s second biggest mining company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd Malan, 46, will be vice president of external affairs
for the U.S. and South America at the mining company. He will
handle regulatory and legislative issues, and work with
institutions like the World Bank and the International Finance
Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malan joined Goldman Sachs in 2008 as the bank, long known
as a breeding ground for Treasury secretaries and top White
House aides, became a symbol of Wall Street greed during the
subprime loan meltdown. He was part of a new lobbying team
brought in to deal with the fallout from the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with running Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Political Action
Committee, Malan lobbied on the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that
overhauled U.S. financial regulation. He also worked on the
bank&#8217;s defense of subprime loan investigations by the Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Goldman Sachs settled the SEC case in July
2010 for $550 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At London-based Rio, one of Malan&#8217;s first tasks will be
helping the company in Washington as it seeks to protect an
estimated $14 billion investment in a Mongolian copper mine that
has come under fire from the government there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake Siewert, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, said Malan
&#8220;was an invaluable part of our D.C. team and will be a terrific
asset for Rio.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Taylor Tepper" date="Feb 05, 2013 12:46 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-05/euro-to-test-3-year-yen-high-jpmorgan-says-technical-analysis.html"><headline>Euro to Test 3-Year Yen High, JPMorgan Says: Technical Analysis</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The euro may rally to its highest
level against the yen in more than three years after breaking
through a 2011 high, according to JPMorgan Chase and Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 17-nation currency will target a level of 127.95/128.50
yen per euro, near the 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
decline from the June 2009 peak, Niall O&#8217;Connor, a technical
analyst at JPMorgan, wrote today in a note to clients. The
shared currency, which has gained 23 percent versus the yen
during the past three months, will find support at 123.20 after
breaking through &#8220;the important 123.35 high from 2011,&#8221;
O&#8217;Connor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The yen weakness story is very much still intact and
there is no sign of a reversal,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said in a telephone
interview from New York. &#8220;One twenty-eight is the next big
target zone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro gained 1.5 percent to 126.72 at 12:20 p.m. in New
York after falling as much as 1.6 percent yesterday, the biggest
intra-day drop since Jan. 2. The euro last reached 128.50 yen on
Jan. 20, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Support refers to an
area on a chart where buy orders may be clustered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a new high or low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jason Corcoran" date="Feb 05, 2013 10:06 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-05/goldman-sachs-hired-by-russia-as-corporate-broker-to-boost-image.html"><headline>Russia Hires Goldman as Corporate Broker to Boost Image</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (G) has been
hired by the Russian government to burnish the nation&#8217;s image
overseas and attract more institutional investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has signed a three-year agreement with the Economy
Ministry and the Russian Direct Investment Fund to advise on
issues such as communicating government decisions and setting up
meetings with investors, according to Sergei Arsenyev, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s managing director of investment banking in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The pool of investors that Russia talks to is the
dedicated emerging-markets base, and it&#8217;s been difficult for
them to break out to a wider investor pool and a global base,&#8221;
Arsenyev, 41, who handles the bank&#8217;s Kremlin relations, said in
a telephone interview. &#8220;We think valuations in Russia remain
very attractive, and there are many interesting opportunities
for investors on the public and private side.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Vladimir Putin last year ordered the government
to improve Russia&#8217;s standing in the World Bank&#8217;s Doing Business
rating to 20th by 2018. It climbed eight positions to 112 in the
latest study in October. While that&#8217;s better than emerging-
market competitors India and Brazil, Russia remains the worst
among major economies in graft, Transparency International said
in December in its annual Corruption Perceptions Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t know how to communicate with investors,&#8221; Deputy
Economy Minister Sergei Belyakov told reporters last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Privatization Push &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest energy exporter plans to raise a record
$10 billion from asset sales this year, First Deputy Prime
Minister Igor Shuvalov said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television last month. While corruption continues to be an
issue, it&#8217;s less so for foreign investors who have already
committed to Russia, Shuvalov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is one of 23 foreign and domestic banks
selected to advise Russia on its 1 trillion-ruble ($33 billion)
privatization program. Last year it helped advise OAO Sberbank,
Russia&#8217;s largest lender, on a $5.2 billion equity sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with the Kremlin &#8220;is similar to a corporate
broking arrangement, which every FTSE 100 company has,&#8221; said
Arsenyev, who switched to investment banking a year ago after 17
years in research. &#8220;It&#8217;s to make sure the market message is
crystallized. Our work is strictly limited to the investor base
and making sure the government is meeting the right people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Promoting Moscow &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British companies typically hire corporate brokers to serve
as a liaison with investors and to help them comply with stock
market rules. The assignments, compensated with a nominal fee or
sometimes unpaid, can lead to more lucrative business such as
managing share deals and advising on mergers and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal also includes advising Russia on its bid to
transform Moscow into an international financial center and to
attract more capital, Arsenyev said. Moscow ranked 64th on the
Global Financial Centers Index in September, a survey compiled
by Z/Yen Group, a London-based consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s premier financial centers have succeeded
because  of &#8220;good rule of law,&#8221; Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs
chief executive officer, said at last month&#8217;s World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You want to go into a place that&#8217;s fair, where if you
make an investment you can recover your investment,&#8221; he said at
a panel discussion. &#8220;You can go into the U.K. and sue the U.K.
government and have a reasonable chance that a court will decide
that fairly. There are other places where I think people
implicitly know they can&#8217;t.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Struggles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 58, who is a member of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev&#8217;s advisory committee for turning Moscow into a
financial center, has struggled to build a business in Russia.
The New York-based bank scaled back operations in Moscow soon
after opening an office in 1994 amid a worldwide retrenchment.
It returned in 1998, managing Russia&#8217;s sale of bonds a month
before the country defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt.
That prompted it to withdraw almost entirely before ramping up
again in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the default, the bank has been overlooked by Russia
for three sovereign bond deals in 2010 and 2011 and $7 billion
in euro bonds last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Russia could borrow as much as $7 billion this year,
according to the budget. The government is prepared to wait for
companies to meet their borrowing needs to avoid crowding the
market, Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said in a Dec.
24 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Private Equity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, along with BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and Singapore-
based Templeton Asset Management Ltd. signed an accord with the
Russia&#8217;s sovereign private-equity fund in June to invest in
Russian companies preparing for initial public offerings. The
fund is led by Kirill Dmitriev, a former Goldman Sachs banker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. securities firm is led in Moscow by Paolo Zannoni,
who took over last year from co-heads Chris Barter and Jean Raby. Barter left the firm to set up a private-equity group,
while Raby returned to France with Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zannoni, who had been chairman of Italian investment
banking, previously worked in the former Soviet Union for Fiat
SpA. He had been sent to Moscow in the early 1990s by then
chairman Giovanni Agnelli to buy Russian carmaker OAO AvtoVAZ,
which was supposed to be privatized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moscow Exchange&#8217;s valuations trail the biggest emerging
markets, while Russian issuers prefer to sell equities in
London. Russia&#8217;s benchmark Micex Index (INDEXCF) has gained 4.5 percent
this year, beating the MSCI&#8217;s Emerging Markets Index&#8217;s 1.1
percent advance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrey Kostin, chairman of VTB Group, Russia&#8217;s second-
biggest bank, said on Nov. 15 that the country was undervalued
&#8220;because of its image of corruption and lack of necessity to
comply with law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies on the Micex Index have an average valuation of
5.9 times estimated earnings, compared with 16.6 for India&#8217;s BSE
Sensex Index (SENSEX), 19.9 for Brazil&#8217;s Bovespa (IBOV) and 13.4 for China&#8217;s
Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP), data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Benjamin Harvey" date="Feb 05, 2013  7:20 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-05/goldman-turns-negative-on-turkish-banks-as-earnings-peak-seen.html"><headline>Goldman Turns Negative on Turkish Banks as Earnings Peak Seen</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. turned
negative on Turkish bank stocks, saying it&#8217;s concerned that
central bank tightening will hurt earnings while rising U.S.
Treasury yields lure funds away from the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish bank earnings will probably peak this quarter &#8220;and
then decline sequentially,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts Dmitry Trembovolsky and Alexey Butylin said in an e-mailed report dated
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yapi  Kredi Bankasi AS (YKBNK), part-owned by Italy&#8217;s UniCredit
SpA (UCG), is most vulnerable to a retreat in its share price, the
analysts said. The Turkish bank stock index has gained 42
percent in the past 12 months, outperforming the 7.8 percent
gain by the MSCI Emerging Markets Financials Index (MXEF0FN) over the same
period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yapi  Kredi
shares surged 93 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governor of the nation&#8217;s central bank, Erdem Basci, has
said he&#8217;ll limit loan growth to 15 percent this year as he
attempts to reduce the import-driven current-account deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bear case for Turkish banks concentrates on three
points: risks to earnings, sizable outperformance over the past
12 months and rising U.S. yields,&#8221; Goldman Sachs (GS) said. &#8220;As
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields have moved to 2 percent, the key
bull argument on fund flows has weakened. Repatriation of flows
into the U.S. has potential to threaten Turkish macro stability,
and could ultimately result in a much more hawkish Turkish
central-bank response.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of foreign investors&#8217; holdings of Turkish stocks
and bonds fell by more than $1 billion in the week to Jan. 25,
according to data published by the central bank on Jan. 31.
Foreign investors purchased $5.9 billion in Turkish stocks and
$17.3 billion in Turkish bonds in the year to Jan. 25, according
to the data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nestle SA (NESN), the world&#8217;s largest food
company, should rebrand products to get approval from South
Africa&#8217;s antitrust authority for its planned takeover of Pfizer
Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s baby nutrition division, the regulator recommended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle should license existing Pfizer infant formula
products to be sold by a third party for 20 years under a
different brand to avoid an increase in infant formula prices
resulting from the merger, the country&#8217;s Competition Commission
said in a statement today. The Vevey, Switzerland-based company
will make its arguments tomorrow in a hearing before the
Competition Tribunal, which will rule on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitors have told the commission the proposed deal
raises &#8220;serious competition concerns,&#8221; the regulator said.
Nestle would be able to reintroduce the Pfizer products under
their original brands after the 20-year period, according to the
commission&#8217;s recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle is seeking international approval for the
acquisition, which will give it access to more customers in
developing nations such as China. Mexico&#8217;s antitrust regulator
blocked the deal in its domestic market in November, forcing a
divestment of assets in that market. Chinese and Australian
officials cleared the transaction in their countries that same
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nestle won&#8217;t oppose the conditions set out by the
commission,&#8221; Ravi Pillay, a spokesman for Nestle South Africa,
said by phone from Johannesburg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest payments network, posted a fiscal first-quarter profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates as consumer card purchases accelerated. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 advanced 26 percent to $1.29 billion, or $1.93 a share, from $1.03 billion, or $1.49, a year earlier, the Foster City, California-based company said today in a statement. That beat the $1.79 average estimate of 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Results include significant continued investments in our core business, accelerating international expansion and the deployment of next-generation payment solutions,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf, who succeeded Joseph W. Saunders in November, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scharf, 47, inherited a goal of deriving more than half of Visa&#8217;s revenue from outside the U.S. by 2015. A long-term global consumer shift to electronic payments, particularly in the Asia- Pacific region, may help. Purchases there are projected to generate 42 percent, or $9.03 trillion, of worldwide card spending at merchants in 2016, up from 36 percent at the end of 2011, the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter, said in its latest issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cash Flow &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visa said it would generate about $6 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2013, fueled by tax benefits related to a settlement of a lawsuit over credit-card &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, or interchange. Guidance on taxes from California officials led Visa&#8217;s tax rate to fall to 28 percent in the quarter and boosted results by 11 cents a share, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, erasing earlier declines, as better-than-estimated earnings overshadowed concern over Europe&#8217;s debt crisis before a gathering of euro-area leaders tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time Warner Inc. surged 4.1 percent after affiliate fees from cable-TV providers boosted profit. Walt Disney Co. gained 0.4 percent after sales topped estimates and its interactive unit posted its first profit since 2009. GameStop Corp. plunged 6 percent after a report said Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s next Xbox console will require an Internet connection. DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. dropped 3.9 percent after the company pulled one movie from its schedule and delayed the release of another. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to 1,512.12. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 7.22 points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,986.52. More than 6.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges today, or 5.1 percent above the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most of the bad news is well-known and the better news is still playing,&#8221; David Sowerby, fund manager at Boston-based Loomis Sayles  Co., said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees about $180 billion. &#8220;In a tug-of-war with Europe, the good news, which is earnings, respectable valuations, and continued low interest rates, is winning the war.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. equities slumped earlier in the day amid concerns Europe&#8217;s debt crisis may worsen. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will head a meeting of policy makers tomorrow in Frankfurt as euro-area leaders gather for a summit in Brussels. The euro has retreated from a 14-month high against the dollar reached on Feb. 1 as Spain&#8217;s premier faced opposition calls to resign. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Record High &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has rallied 6 percent in 2013 as U.S. lawmakers reached a budget compromise and companies reported better-than- estimated earnings. The benchmark equity gauge is 3.4 percent below its record high reached in October 2007. It has more than doubled since bottoming in March 2009 as the Federal Reserve conducted three rounds of bond-buying to lower interest rates and boost economic growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., News Corp. and Prudential Financial Inc. are among 24 companies in the SP 500 reporting earnings today. About 74 percent of the 303 index members that have released results so far in the earnings season exceeded profit projections, and 67 percent beat sales estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time Warner, owner of the HBO cable network and the Warner Bros. film studio, rose $2.05 to $52.01. Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes has concentrated the company&#8217;s growth strategy on its TV business. He fostered the development of costly shows, such as HBO&#8217;s &#8220;Game of Thrones,&#8221; and signed rights deals for major sports programming, including the NCAA basketball tournament, to command higher fees from pay-TV providers such as Comcast Corp. and DirecTV. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Buyback Program &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York-based company also announced a new buyback program and boosted its dividend 11 percent to almost 29 cents a share, up from 26 cents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, advanced 23 cents to $54.52. The owner of the &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; and &#8220;Avengers&#8221; franchises said first-quarter profit adjusted for some items was 79 cents a share, topping the 77-cent average of 26 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 5.2 percent to $11.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ralph Lauren Corp. surged 5.9 percent to $174.63. The retailer of its namesake brand clothing reported fiscal third- quarter profit that topped analysts&#8217; estimates, helped by lower- than-expected expenses and cheaper cotton. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3M Jumps &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;3M Co. jumped 1.2 percent to $102.69, for the biggest advance in the Dow. The maker of products ranging from Scotch tape to dental braces authorized a stock buyback program of as much as $7.5 billion and increased the quarterly dividend by 7.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aflac Inc. fell 4.3 percent to $51.18 after the largest seller of supplemental health insurance forecast profit that fell short of analysts&#8217;s estimates. A weaker yen is pressuring results at Aflac, which gets most of its revenue in Japan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GameStop tumbled $1.61 for the second-biggest decline in the SP 500 to $25.20. The world&#8217;s largest video-game retailer surged 16 percent over the previous three days. Microsoft&#8217;s next console will include technology that registers video games over the Internet and renders resold titles useless, the gaming website Edge.com said today, without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mr. Peabody &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;DreamWorks, the independent studio behind the &#8220;Madagascar&#8221; films, dropped 68 cents to $16.75. &#8220;Me and My Shadow&#8221; was pulled from the schedule and put back in development, DreamWorks Animation said. &#8220;Mr. Peabody  Sherman,&#8221; planned for theaters in November 2013, will now be released in March 2014. The change reduces the company&#8217;s 2013 release slate to two movies from three. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. led declines in the SP 500, falling 9.7 percent to $60.50. The freight broker reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wynn Resorts Ltd., which depends on its Macau unit for most of its revenue, dropped 2 percent to $123.30. China&#8217;s government will start taking action this month to clamp down on junket operators that bring gamblers from the mainland to Macau, the London-based Times reported on its website, citing unidentified people in law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. fell 0.1 percent to $457.35, erasing an earlier rally of as much as 1.9 percent. A report showed that Legg Mason Inc. fund manager Bill Miller said the stock may be worth 50 percent more than its current price. Miller told the Financial Times the shares could be worth more if the company were to keep all its cash on its balance sheet and put future free cash flow into a dividend. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jacqueline Simmons and Aaron Kirchfeld" date="Feb 06, 2013  3:50 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-06/goldman-jumps-in-m-a-liontree-emerges-in-50-billion-day.html"><headline>Goldman Jumps in M&amp;amp;A, LionTree Emerges in $50 Billion Day</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Three banks climbed to the top of the merger rankings within 24 hours after landing roles on this year&#8217;s two largest deals valued together at almost $50 billion, as a mergers and acquisition recovery gathers strength. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) have taken the lead, displacing Barclays Plc (BARC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) and vaulting Goldman to first place from third, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. LionTree Advisors LLC, a boutique founded last year, won the lead role advising Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA) in its $23.3 billion takeover of U.K. cable operator Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The three large lenders won advisory roles on the Liberty Global (LBTYA) deal and the bid to take Dell Inc (DELL). private in a transaction valued at $24.4 billion. The equity value of those deals accounts for about one-eighth of the $205 billion announced so far this year in an MA recovery that may be gathering speed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am surprised the MA recovery has taken so long,&#8221; said Philip Keevil, a partner at New York-based Compass Advisers Group LLC, which is merging with Richmond Park Partners to form Compass Partners. &#8220;I do think you are going to see an increase in deals where companies in one market want to be in more than one market, or a No. 3 player in a particular market is seeking acquisitions to become No. 1.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Earle and Don Jeffrey" date="Feb 06, 2013  2:04 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-06/exxonmobil-disputes-new-hampshire-well-count-with-mtbe.html"><headline>ExxonMobil Disputes New Hampshire Well Count With MTBE</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Corp. told a jury that the
number of New Hampshire wells contaminated with a gasoline
additive is less than one-fifteenth as many as the state has
contended in its trial seeking damages from the oil company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Lender, a lawyer for ExxonMobil, cross-examined a
witness who is a state expert on oil spills today in Concord.
New Hampshire has said that as many as 5,590 wells may have more
than 13 parts of the additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or
MTBE, per billion parts of water, a level the state has
determined makes it unfit for drinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We know and you know that the state has only found 349
wells with contamination above 13 parts per billion in 30 years,
isn&#8217;t that right?&#8221; Lender said to the state&#8217;s witness, Gary
Lynn, a manager of its petroleum mediation section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every fifth or sixth well has detectable levels of MTBE
in it,&#8221; Lynn replied. &#8220;How much more widespread can it be?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire might be seeking more than $200 million from
ExxonMobil, the last defendant on trial in the $816 million
state-court lawsuit filed in 2003. The number of wells found to
be contaminated with MTBE is one factor in determining damages
if ExxonMobil is found liable. The trial began Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oil Refiners &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of scores of cases involving MTBE filed since
2000 against oil refiners, fuel distributors and chemical
makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn, questioned yesterday by the state, testified that
MTBE still shows up in wells six years after it was banned. He
said the chemical moves through water quickly and unpredictably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s widespread in drinking water wells, and it shows up
frequently in places that we don&#8217;t expect it,&#8221; Lynn said,
mentioning a daycare center&#8217;s water supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil, based in Irving, Texas, has argued in court
that it isn&#8217;t liable for damage because it added MTBE to
gasoline to comply with federal regulations that pre-empt state
law. Oil companies added MTBE to make gasoline burn more
thoroughly in order to reduce air pollution, as required under
the 1990 Clean Air Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent Colburn, who once worked for New Hampshire&#8217;s
Department of Environmental Services, testified Jan. 28 that the
state wouldn&#8217;t have participated in a federal clean-air program
called Reformulated Gasoline, or RFG, if Exxon had warned of the
the additive&#8217;s risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RFG Program &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil said in court that the state was aware of MTBE&#8217;s
risks when it opted into the RFG program in 1991 because there
had been studies of the additive for several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additive was banned in New Hampshire as of January
2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE, which is highly soluble in water and thus can be
carried great distances from where it leaked, is a &#8220;toxic
chemical that does not belong in the state&#8217;s drinking water,&#8221;
Jessica Grant, an attorney for New Hampshire, said in opening
remarks to the jury. It leaked from gas stations, vehicle
junkyards, underground storage tanks and pipe fittings, the
state said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lender raised questions today about who was responsible for
the leaks that put MTBE into the groundwater. He cited a state
DES memo that said serious violations by the owners of a
junkyard in Chester had resulted in contaminating the water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;All the Things&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the owners had done all the things they were supposed
to do, we wouldn&#8217;t have had MTBE in the groundwater, right?&#8221;
Lender asked Lynn during cross-examination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even if you do everything you&#8217;re supposed to do, there&#8217;s
a potential for MTBE to get into the groundwater,&#8221; Lynn
replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of contaminated wells is one element in the
determination of monetary damages if ExxonMobil is found liable.
The state is also seeking damages from the companies based on
their market share of gasoline sales in New Hampshire during the
period covered by the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil&#8217;s share was about 30 percent, the state said.
Based on an estimated cost of $816 million to test for, monitor
and clean up the groundwater, New Hampshire could be seeking
about $245 million from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citgo Petroleum &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 15, New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver
agreed to dismiss Citgo Petroleum Corp., the other defendant,
from the trial while the company and the state work to complete
a settlement. Citgo is the Houston-based unit of Petroleos de
Venezuela SA, the country&#8217;s state-owned oil company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citgo&#8217;s market share ranged from 3.1 percent to 8.7
percent, New Hampshire said. Based on those figures, the state
could be seeking $25 million to $71 million from Citgo. If an
accord isn&#8217;t reached by Feb. 15 and no extension is approved,
Citgo would be reinstated to the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides ExxonMobil and Citgo, New Hampshire also sued Shell
Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips, Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA
and Hess Corp. All settled before the trial began except
ExxonMobil and Citgo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire has received more than $100 million in
settlements from defendants so far, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE lawsuits have also been consolidated in federal court
in New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and motions. In
2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York City
$104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells in
the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire&#8217;s lawyers said last week they hoped to
conclude their case by Feb. 21. ExxonMobil would then begin
presenting its case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is New Hampshire v. Hess Corp., 03-C-0550, New
Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human Rights Foundation, headed by
Chairman Garry Kasparov, demanded that Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
end a consulting agreement with the Russian government led by
President Vladimir Putin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s deal with Putin ranks among the worst
examples ever of a company seeking to bolster its profits by
laundering the financial reputation of a country led by a
corruptly elected despot,&#8221; Kasparov, the former chess champion
and leader of Russia&#8217;s Solidarity opposition group, said in a
statement. &#8220;By doing business with Putin, Goldman Sachs is
acting as an enemy of free enterprise and economic freedom.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#148;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, signed a three-year agreement with Russia&#8217;s Economy
Ministry and the Russian Direct Investment Fund to help set up
meetings with investors and better communicate government
decisions, according to Sergei Arsenyev, the company&#8217;s managing
director of investment banking in Moscow. Blankfein, 58, is also
a member of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev&#8217;s advisory committee
on turning Moscow into a financial center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is in the long-term interest of Russia and its people
to attract foreign investment,&#8221; Michael DuVally, a spokesman
for New York-based Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mail. &#8220;That is
why we are pleased to play a role helping to make Russia more
open to foreign investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asset Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest energy exporter plans to raise a record
$10 billion from asset sales this year, First Deputy Prime
Minister Igor Shuvalov said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television last month. While corruption remains a concern, it&#8217;s
less so for foreign investors who have already committed to
Russia, Shuvalov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by Putin, 60, Russia ranked 133 out of 176 countries
and territories in Transparency International&#8217;s 2012 corruption
perceptions index, tied with Iran, Kazakhstan and Honduras. The
U.S. Congress imposed a visa ban and asset freeze in December on
Russian officials allegedly linked to the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky and other human-rights abuses. Russia responded with a
law that bans U.S. adoptions of Russian children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
conducted a review of its business standards and practices and
released a set of recommendations in January 2011 to ensure the
standards treat clients fairly and &#8220;contribute to overall
financial stability and economic opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Rights Foundation, based in New York, was founded in
2005 to raise awareness about &#8220;the vulnerability of freedom
around the world,&#8221; according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s appalling that Goldman Sachs sees nothing wrong with
defending a regime that has made a farce of the legal system,
ignored property rights and murdered and imprisoned brave men
and women who have sought to promote economic freedom,&#8221;
Kasparov said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Lithuanian parliamentary committee
called for a moratorium on shale-gas exploration in the Baltic
nation as well as a legal investigation of a local company
that&#8217;s half owned by Chevron Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government should halt shale-gas exploration and
production until competent European Union institutions give an
opinion&#8221; on the safety of related technologies, the
Environmental Protection Committee said today in a statement on
the website of the legislature in Vilnius, the capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also check the legality of agreements that LL
Investicijos UAB has concluded with landowners and make sure
prosecutors &#8220;defend the public interest&#8221; with regard to the
oil and gas recovery company&#8217;s activities, the committee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, a U.S. energy company, last year bought 50 percent
of LL Investicijos and in January submitted the only bid in a
tender for shale-gas exploration rights in Lithuania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Dalia Grybauskaite this week said that Chevron&#8217;s
plans were important for helping the country find out how far
its shale-gas reserves can go as an alternative to Russian
natural gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki and Jeffrey McCracken" date="Feb 06, 2013  9:13 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-06/jpmorgan-said-to-cut-investment-bank-pay-3-asset-managers-gain.html"><headline>JPMorgan Said to Cut Trader Pay, Asset Managers Get Raise</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. paid investment
bankers and traders about 3 percent less in 2012 as shaky
economies in the U.S. and Europe put a damper on deals, said two
people with knowledge of the firm&#8217;s compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portfolio managers and other executives in asset management
received an average 6 percent increase in salary and bonuses,
according to two other people briefed on pay at New York-based
JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior investment bankers and traders had braced for
steeper reductions exceeding 10 percent, one person said, after
global deals slid 13 percent to $2.67 trillion in 2012. Net
income at JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank for the first nine months
of 2012, before it was merged with the corporate bank and
treasury services divisions, dropped 15 percent to $5.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts pale next to those inflicted on JPMorgan Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and on some peers at rival banks.
Dimon&#8217;s pay was halved after the bank suffered its worst-ever
trading loss in the so-called London Whale episode. Top
employees at UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest lender, will take a 7
percent reduction in their bonus pool and get paid with bonds
whose value could be wiped out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior executives at JPMorgan bore a heavier share of bonus
cuts in the investment bank to insulate junior and mid-level
staff from harsher reductions, said one of the people, who
requested anonymity because pay discussions are private. Joe Evangelisti, a company spokesman, said the firm had no comment.
JPMorgan paid the approximately 26,000 employees in its
investment bank an average of $314,980 for the 12 months ended
Sept. 30, the most recent data available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s industry-leading profit
margins and disposal of non-drug businesses still haven&#8217;t closed
the valuation gap with rival drugmakers. No wonder its chief
executive officer is contemplating a full breakup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Ian Read said last week that he may consider separating
Pfizer&#8217;s branded medicines from its generic products businesses
as part of his strategy to slim down the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker. Despite already divesting animal health and infant
nutrition units from one of the most profitable pharmaceutical
companies, Read still is faced with a stock that trades for a
lower price relative to earnings than almost 80 percent of
similar-sized peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splitting New York-based Pfizer in half may help investors
better gauge the true value of its two businesses, which Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. estimates to be about $35 billion more than its
market capitalization of $201 billion. A breakup would follow
similar moves by companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,
which fetches a valuation that&#8217;s two-thirds higher than Pfizer&#8217;s
as a pure-play drugmaker after having spun off baby formula
maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. four years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re on Pfizer&#8217;s board of directors, you&#8217;re
scratching your head and thinking, &#8216;Why is this happening? We&#8217;re
a great operator,&#8217;&#8221; Peter Sorrentino, a senior fund manager at
Huntington Asset Advisors Inc. in Cincinnati, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;Investors play it cautious and put less
of a premium on businesses when there are too many things to
understand and analyze. Pulling them apart, you can probably do
the shareholders better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

When asked about the possibility of a breakup of the company, Pfizer Inc. Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said they would move towards a separate management, and then would be able to evaluate whether shareholders would prefer to have the option to invest in two distinct companies or not. Close

&lt;p&gt;George Lucas has no plans to sell his
$2.02 billion stake in Walt Disney Co., his spokeswoman said,
following a regulatory filing by the company that allows the
&#8220;Star Wars&#8221; creator to divest the stock at his discretion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas, 68, holds 37.1 million shares of Burbank,
California-based Disney, a 2.1 percent stake, according to a
registration yesterday by the film, TV and theme-park company.
Disney agreed to register the stock as part of its accord to
purchase the filmmaker&#8217;s Lucasfilm Ltd. The deal was completed
on Dec. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;George Lucas currently has no plans to sell his Disney
stock,&#8221; Lynne Hale, a spokeswoman for Lucasfilm, said in an e-
mail. &#8220;This was a required filing in conjunction with the sale
of Lucasfilm to Disney.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas plans to donate most of the proceeds from the sale of
his company to education, the Hollywood Reporter said at the
time of the deal, without mentioning a specific school or group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.3 percent to $54.36 at the close in New York.
The stock has advanced 9.2 percent this year, while the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index has gained 5.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company bought Lucas&#8217;s &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; empire for stock
and a cash payment of $2.21 billion to develop a new film series
based on the sci-fi adventure movies. Robert Iger, Disney&#8217;s
chairman and chief executive officer, said this week the world&#8217;s
largest entertainment company also planned two films based on
characters from the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the sale of his company, Lucas became the second-
largest non-institutional shareholder in Disney, behind the
trust of late Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, who sold Pixar
to Disney in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yandex NV rallied a second day in New
York as HSBC Holdings Plc upgraded the shares after the Russian
Internet company overtook Microsoft Corp. on global searches and
data showed web advertising grew last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yandex rose 0.7 percent to $24.50, after jumping
1.7 percent yesterday. Russia&#8217;s most-used search engine trades
at 29 times estimated earnings, almost seven times the average
valuation of companies listed on Bloomberg Russia-US Equity
Index. The gauge of the most-traded Russian stocks in the U.S.
fell 0.9 percent to 103.91 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yandex unseated Microsoft&#8217;s Bing to become the world&#8217;s
fourth-biggest engine by number of searches in November for the
first time on record, data researcher ComScore Inc. said
yesterday. HSBC boosted its recommendation on Yandex shares,
which have climbed 14 percent in 2013, to the equivalent of buy
from neutral, according to a client note dated today. Yandex got
90 percent of third-quarter revenue from text-based ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yandex remains well positioned as the Russian search
leader,&#8221; Jean Kaplan and Herve Drouet, London-based analysts at
HSBC, wrote in the report. &#8220;We see contextual advertising as
the fastest growing, most scalable, and resilient segment within
Russian media, and we expect Yandex to remain dominant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web advertising in Russia, home to at least 16 million
Internet users, rose 35 percent in 2012, outpacing 13 percent
growth in total advertising, according to an Association of
Communication Agencies of Russia report this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Yandex surpassed Bing by number of searches, it
trailed Google Inc., Beijing-based Baidu Inc. and Yahoo! Inc.,
Reston, Virginia-based ComScore said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Nowhere Near&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searches on Yandex rose to 4.6 billion in November and 4.8
billion in December, while the tally for Bing held at 4.5
billion in both months. The Russian Internet company had the
lowest number of so-called unique searchers among the world&#8217;s
five biggest providers, the data showed. Yandex had 74.4 million
users in December, compared with 268.6 million for Microsoft,
according to ComScore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Russian speakers prefer Internet searches in Russian, and
Yandex firmly holds the biggest share, competitors are nowhere
near it,&#8221; Konstantin Chernyshev, the head of research at
UralSib Capital Corp., which rates Yandex a buy, said by phone
from Moscow yesterday. &#8220;The Russian Internet advertising market
expands and Yandex wins. You don&#8217;t advertise your shoe repair
kiosk on national television, you advertise it on Yandex.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online advertising in Russia will rise by an average 22
percent a year between 2013 and 2016, Chernyshev said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Russian Audience&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s thanks to the Russian audience that the number of
Yandex searches grew,&#8221; Tatiana Komarova, a Moscow-based
spokeswoman for the company, said by e-mail yesterday.
&#8220;Internet penetration is still low in Russia and it continues
to grow by adding older people and residents of small towns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia had 16.1 million IPv4 addresses in the third quarter

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, said it disrupted a cybercrime operation known
as the Bamital botnet that took control of hundreds of thousands
of personal computers by infecting them with malicious software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft worked with Symantec Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
antivirus-software maker, to seize Bamital data and evidence
yesterday at Web-hosting facilities in Weehawken, New Jersey,
and Manassas, Virginia. Microsoft had filed a lawsuit in federal
court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Jan. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malware hijacked browsers and redirected them to search
websites of Bamital&#8217;s choosing, according to the complaint.
Microsoft and Symantec yesterday directed users to tools
designed to help clean affected computers. The number of
affected computers ranges between 250,000 and 1 million, Richard
Boscovich, assistant general counsel, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The malware exposed computers to a huge range of security
vulnerabilities such as identity theft,&#8221; said Boscovich, of
Microsoft&#8217;s Digital Crimes Unit. &#8220;It also potentially took them
to other malware.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamital&#8217;s actions also took millions of dollars away from
the search engines of advertisers, Boscovich said. Through the
litigation, filed against &#8220;John Does 1-18, Controlling a
Computer Botnet Thereby Injuring Microsoft and Its Customers,&#8221;
Microsoft seeks control over the Bamital botnet, disgorgement of
profits, and unspecified compensatory damages and legal costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Eastern European&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We definitely believe that it&#8217;s of Eastern European
origin, and the people behind the botnet are more likely either
Russian or Ukranian,&#8221; Boscovich said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said that in one instance, company investigators
&#8220;found that Bamital rerouted a search for &#8216;Nickelodeon&#8217; to a
website that distributed malware, including spyware that is
designed to track the activities of the computer owner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010, Bamital has attacked 8.2 million to 8.3 million
computers, Boscovich said. Symantec has estimated that 1.2
million to 1.4 million computers were actively infected with the
malware since 2011. The current number of infected computers
won&#8217;t be known for at least 24 hours, Boscovich said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed under several civil laws, including
the Lanham Act and the Computer Fraud  Abuse Act. Boscovich
said he doesn&#8217;t know of a criminal investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft v. John Does 1-18, 13-cv-00139, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
payments network, posted a fiscal first-quarter profit that beat
analysts&#8217; estimates as consumer card spending accelerated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 advanced 26
percent to $1.29 billion, or $1.93 a share, from $1.03 billion,
or $1.49, a year earlier, the Foster City, California-based
company said yesterday in a statement. That beat the $1.79
average estimate of 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Results include significant continued investments in our
core business, accelerating international expansion and the
deployment of next-generation payment solutions,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Charlie Scharf, who succeeded Joseph W. Saunders in November, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scharf, 47, inherited a goal of deriving more than half of
Visa&#8217;s revenue from outside the U.S. by 2015. A global consumer
shift to electronic payments, particularly in the Asia-Pacific
region, may help. Purchases there are projected to generate 42
percent, or $9.03 trillion, of worldwide card spending at
merchants in 2016, up from 36 percent at the end of 2011, the
Nilson Report, an industry newsletter, said in its latest issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa slipped 1.9 percent to $157.82 at 1:53 p.m. in New
York after Timothy Willi, an analyst at Wells Fargo  Co.,
downgraded the shares to market perform from outperform. The
stock, which climbed almost 50 percent in the past year, doesn&#8217;t
provide enough &#8220;upside potential,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price Targets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Willi joined at least 10 other analysts, including
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Tien-tsin Huang and Craig Maurer at CLSA
Ltd., in raising their price targets for Visa this week. The
stock is now projected to reach $172.26 within the next 12
months, up from $165.91 at the end of last week, according to
the average of 32 analysts&#8217; predictions in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending on Visa debit and credit cards in the Asia-Pacific
region, the firm&#8217;s second-biggest market after the U.S., climbed
about 13 percent, the company said. Purchases surged almost 37
percent in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa, while
spending in Central and South America and the Caribbean rose
about 22 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is an &#8220;interesting&#8221; opportunity for Visa, Scharf
said in a conference call with analysts after results were
announced. Payments in the country are dominated by Shanghai-
based China UnionPay, which surpassed MasterCard Inc. in the
first half of last year to become the world&#8217;s second-biggest
payments network by customer spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Good Partner&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re there, we make money there, and we&#8217;ve got some
great partners there,&#8221; Scharf said of China. &#8220;It&#8217;s important
for us to be a good partner to people within the country to
bring the benefits of Visa to China. And in my conversations
with people from China, they want us there. They think we can
add value not just because of the brand but because of what our
network is versus maybe what China UnionPay is today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa said it would generate about $6 billion in free cash
flow in fiscal 2013, fueled by tax benefits related to a
settlement of a lawsuit over credit-card &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, or
interchange. Guidance on taxes from California officials led
Visa&#8217;s tax rate to fall to 28 percent in the quarter and boosted
results by 11 cents a share, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Processed Transactions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating revenue rose 12 percent to $2.85 billion from a
year earlier, beating the $2.82 billion estimate of analysts in
the Bloomberg survey. Worldwide spending on Visa payment cards
climbed to $1.08 trillion, an 8.7 percent increase when adjusted
for currency fluctuations. Total processed transactions
increased 4 percent to 14.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchases on debit cards climbed 3.6 percent in the last
three months of 2012 after a 0.2 percent decline in the
preceding quarter. Credit-card spending surged 12 percent in the
most recent period, up from 9.7 percent growth in the fiscal
fourth quarter, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa&#8217;s lead in the U.S. debit-card market continued to
erode as Dodd-Frank Act rules helped competitors gain share.
Spending on Visa debit cards in the U.S. slid 3.6 percent in the
fiscal first quarter even as volume in the rest of the world
surged 29 percent, adjusted for currency changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, led by CEO Ajay Banga, 53, said last week that
fourth-quarter profit increased 18 percent, excluding litigation
charges. On Feb. 5, the Purchase, New York-based company doubled
its quarterly dividend to 60 cents a share and approved a stock
repurchase program of as much as $2 billion. In October, Visa
announced it was boosting its quarterly payout by 50 percent to
33 cents a share, and yesterday the company said it may buy back
as much as $2.9 billion in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saunders, 67, who led Visa through a 2008 initial public
offering that raised $19.7 billion, the most in U.S. history, is
retiring and will step down as non-executive chairman at the end
of March, Visa said in a statement last week. He will be
succeeded by Robert W. Matschullat, a former chairman of Clorox
Co., where he&#8217;s currently lead director. He also has been a
director at Visa since 2007 and Walt Disney Co. since 2002. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Growing Market &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian advertising market grew to 300 billion rubles
($10 billion) in 2012, with Internet ads expanding more than any

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. will run a U.S.
advertising campaign urging consumers to drop Google Inc.&#8217;s
Gmail in favor of its own online e-mail services, stepping up
their rivalry for Internet users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Television, print and online spots starting today will
feature the word &#8220;Scroogled!&#8221; in the colors of Google&#8217;s logo,
criticizing the operator of the world&#8217;s most popular search
engine of scanning the text of e-mail messages in order to
tailor ads to users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, unveiled
Outlook.com in July to eventually replace its free online e-mail
service Hotmail. The company, whose Bing search engine competes
with Google&#8217;s is trying to gain more customers in the U.S.,
where Hotmail had less than half as many users as Gmail or Yahoo
Inc.&#8217;s online e-mail service, according to November data from
ComScore Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ad campaign includes messages such as &#8220;Think Google
respects your privacy? Think again,&#8221; and &#8220;Google goes through
every word of every Gmail that&#8217;s sent or received to sell ads.&#8221;
Microsoft says its online services don&#8217;t scan e-mails for
targeted ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Gaither, a spokesman for Google, said no humans read
e-mail or account information in order to show ads or related
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Advertising keeps Google and many of the websites and
services Google offers free of charge,&#8221; Gaither wrote in an e-
mail. &#8220;We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive
and relevant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online Petition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides poking fun at Google with the first such nationwide
campaign from Microsoft targeting Gmail, Microsoft will also ask
users to sign a petition calling on the search engine to stop
scanning e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign follows a &#8220;Don&#8217;t Get Scroogled&#8221; effort
targeting Google&#8217;s shopping services during the holidays, and

aloud from the letters he delivers and confronts a worker about
a medical condition in her office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. overrode an
independent analysis of home loan portfolios by buying and
selling defective loans to create a sanitized version of the
pool, which was then securitized and sold, a court was told. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FSA Asset Management LLC, which bought the residential
mortgage-backed securities that later collapsed in value, and
its parent Franco-Belgian bank Dexia SA filed hundreds of e-
mails and transcripts of employee interviews in federal court in
Manhattan on Feb. 4, urging a judge not to throw out their
lawsuit over the collateralized securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan received reports from independent mortgage loan
underwriters showing that 20 percent to 80 percent of the loans
in samples used for testing didn&#8217;t meet the underwriting
guidelines, including fraudulent home appraisals or missing
documentation, FSA Asset Management, or FSAM, said in the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rather than disclose these known defects to FSAM,
defendants bought and sold massive quantities of defective
loans,&#8221; FSAM said. &#8220;Defendants secretly overrode the
independent loan underwriters&#8217; determinations, creating a final,
sanitized version.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FSAM failed to expressly assign fraud claims related to the
securities to Dexia, so the bank isn&#8217;t allowed to sue under New
York law, JPMorgan said in a Jan. 21 filing, urging the judge to
throw out the lawsuit without a trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FSAM also can&#8217;t sue because it had recovered the full
purchase price of the securities it bought so it suffered no
harm, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs purchased more than $1.6 billion of
residential mortgage-backed securities in 51 offerings between
2005 and 2007, according to an amended statement of claim filed
in New York State court in May. The purchases were made from
JPMorgan and two banks the New York-based lender acquired during
the 2007 credit crisis, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants rehash the well-worn &#8216;don&#8217;t blame us, blame
the financial crisis&#8217; defense, which numerous courts have
rejected,&#8221; Dexia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Dexia SA v. Bear Stearns  Co. 12-cv-04761.
U.S. District Court Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Kuritzky took in the view for
only a few seconds after racing up midtown Manhattan&#8217;s tallest
building. The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. associate then returned
to the lobby to run the 1,576 steps a second time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuritzky raised $20,000 last night for the Multiple Myeloma
Research Foundation by twice climbing the 1,050 feet (320 meters)
from lobby to observation deck at the 36th annual Empire State
Building Run-Up. It&#8217;s the second consecutive year Kuritzky was
one of the event&#8217;s highest fundraisers after collecting $85,000
in donations in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fundraising gets harder and harder, and to try and keep
it consistent you have to do something different and more
creative,&#8221; Kuritzky, 26, said in an interview between trips.
&#8220;Running twice is a way to get more people talking and garner a
little more interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The race, which began with 14 finishers in 1978, had 738
entrants ranging in age from 21 to 70 and representing 18
countries including Japan, Israel and Papua New Guinea.
Organized by the New York Road Runners, the event raised about
$600,000 for MMRF and other charities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Bourne won the men&#8217;s invitational with a time of 10
minutes, 12 seconds. Suzy Walsham won the elite women&#8217;s heat,
her fourth title, in 12:05. Both winners are from Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuritzky, whose mother died of breast cancer when he was 15,
has run the New York City Marathon and a 140.6-mile (226-
kilometer) Ironman-distance triathlon to raise money for cancer
research, and last year competed in the RBC Decathlon, where he
was the top fundraiser with more than $90,000 in pledges. He
called last night&#8217;s double run the most intense race he&#8217;s done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second Run &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing his first trip, he lay down for 10 minutes.
After about an hour, he returned to the starting line for a
second time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My lower back hurts and my lungs feel like they are
popping out of my chest,&#8221; he said after finishing the second
run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuritzky, who played soccer for Cornell University in 2005-
07, said his original goal of running twice in a total of 28
minutes was determined after friends and colleagues thought his
initial estimate of a half hour was too generous. He ran the
first heat in 13:19, and the MMRF said that while it did not
have his exact time on the second run, he did come in under his
goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event was invitation-only prior to 2011, when MMRF
became the title sponsor and benefiting charity thanks in part
to a $50,000 donation from SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio
manager Nick Tiller. The roughly 125 runners in the MMRF group
last night raised about $500,000, according to the foundation,
bringing their three-year total to $1.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top Team &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMRF&#8217;s top fundraising team was PricewaterhouseCoopers,
at $23,500, according to the foundation. The highest individual
fundraisers were Mary Weidner and Bill West at $45,700, followed
by Touche Howard, who raised $30,000 by running the course while
wearing 50 pounds of firefighting gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bourne, a 29-year-old ecologist for the Australian
government in Canberra, said he typically races mountain running
and cross-country events. He said he took the lead around the
60th floor and took in the nighttime Manhattan skyline before
crossing the finish line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a great feeling, knowing I was in the lead by a
comfortable margin and could look out over the edge and enjoy
the view for a second,&#8221; he said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walsham, 39, who won the event from 2007-09 and placed
second last year, said each year she learns that limits can be
pushed a little bit further. Runners pull themselves up along
the handrails to spread the work between their arms and legs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Course Records &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Normally I&#8217;m sitting on the ground thinking, &#8217;What am I
doing this for?&#8221;&#8217; she said after the race. &#8220;This is the best
I&#8217;ve felt in years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course record of 9:33 was set by Paul Crake of
Australia in 2003, according to the NYRR, which also organizes
the New York City Marathon. The women&#8217;s record of 11:23 was set
in 2006 by Andrea Mayr of Austria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuritzky won the MMRF group in 2011, and last year raced in
the invitational heat, where Goldman Sachs colleagues and
friends pledged $10,000 for every elite runner he passed. He
said last night that he had no idea what he might do in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s an ongoing battle to figure out what&#8217;s next without
crossing over into that area of pure insanity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
taking suggestions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would he considering running three times in one night? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Absolutely not,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil deliveries from Chevron Corp.
fields in Indonesia&#8217;s Riau province are likely to return to
normal today after delays caused by a pipeline leak, according
to the country&#8217;s energy regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Feb. 5 breach on the 76-kilometer (47 miles) line
disrupted deliveries of oil from the Bangko area to the Dumai
terminal, Gde Pradnyana, deputy of operations at SKK Migas said
in e-mailed statement. Production at Chevron&#8217;s fields has not
been affected and output is being stored in tanks amid repairs
to the pipe, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PT Chevron Pacific Indonesia produced 327,692 barrels of
oil a day as of Jan. 27, representing about 40 percent of
Indonesia&#8217;s oil output, according to data from the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Pacific Indonesia&#8217;s response team has contained the
leak and begun clean-up work, Alexander Yelland, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &#8220;We are
working to minimize any impact to production&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
cause of the incident is currently being investigated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline delivers output from the Duri field in the
Rokan oil block, Yelland said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is trying to stem a decline in maturing fields
amid a lack of new discoveries. Oil output may shrink to 830,000
barrels a day this year, the lowest since 1969 when Indonesia
produced 742,000 barrels, according to data from SKK Migas on
Feb.1. That would also be less than the government&#8217;s sales
target of 900,000 barrels a day in the 2013 state budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dakin Campbell and Dawn Kopecki" date="Feb 07, 2013 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-07/jpmorgan-overtakes-wells-fargo-as-most-valuable-u-s-bank.html"><headline>JPMorgan Overtakes Wells Fargo as Most Valuable U.S. Bank</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, reclaimed the No. 1 title by market value
as the impact of last year&#8217;s wrong-way bet on derivatives fades
and investors wager on an investment-banking rebound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares rose 1.6 percent this week, valuing the
bank at $184.9 billion through yesterday. That eclipsed the
$184.2 billion for Wells Fargo  Co., which slipped to No. 2 on
Feb. 5 after being the most valuable since Oct. 28, 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recovery shows JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has blunted fallout from last year&#8217;s trading loss, which
wiped out as much as $51 billion in shareholder value. Wells
Fargo, led by CEO John Stumpf, 59, has seen the rise of its
shares slow amid investor concerns that weaker mortgage lending
and shrinking margins will crimp profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Capital-market firms like JPMorgan have been burdened
quite heavily by the financial debacle, more so than regional or
national banks like Wells Fargo,&#8221; said Gerard Cassidy, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets. &#8220;As they continue to throw the
baggage overboard, all of these legacy issues that have been
hampering profit are going away. Owning the riskier names is
more attractive today in this economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should bypass regional lenders for universal
banks such as New York-based JPMorgan because the larger firms
have lower price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios and the
Federal Reserve&#8217;s bond purchases will encourage trading and hurt
lending spreads, David Konrad, a KBW Inc. analyst, said in his
2013 outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Below Book&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has gained 11 percent this year, outpacing Wells
Fargo&#8217;s 2.3 percent advance and the 7.3 percent climb for the
24-company KBW Bank Index. JPMorgan trades at 0.95 times book
value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, compared with 1.27
for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you are less worried about risk you will start to bid
up these shares, which are trading at below book,&#8221; said
Jennifer Thompson, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC. &#8220;That&#8217;s
where you will focus in terms of relative upside.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan lost more than $6.2 billion in the first nine
months of last year from trades on credit derivatives made at
its chief investment office in London. The trader who amassed
the position came to be known as the London Whale because the
bets were big enough to move the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dimon&#8217;s &#8216;Tempest&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank first disclosed losses from the wagers in May,
almost a month after Dimon dismissed initial news reports on the
wagers as a &#8220;tempest in a teapot.&#8221; Dimon, 56, whose pay was
cut 50 percent this year to $11.5 million, said last month that
the company is almost done booking losses from the trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan sustained a black eye, as did Jamie Dimon,&#8221;
Cassidy said. Now &#8220;the market has given its verdict: the London
Whale was a trading problem that was blown out of proportion and
now it&#8217;s been put back into perspective.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG analysts led by Matt O&#8217;Connor upgraded
JPMorgan to buy from hold on Jan. 25, citing a 30 percent
underperformance in the shares compared with global banks since
early August. JPMorgan, which posted a third straight year of
record profit with $21.3 billion for 2012, may see annual
operating expenses drop as much as $5 billion as costs to
service mortgages fall, the analysts said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo&#8217;s mortgage revenue, which helped the lender
report record profit of $18.9 billion last year, may decline 18
percent this year to $10 billion from 2012 once loan repurchases
are discounted, Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities
LLP, wrote in a Jan. 29 research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Susan Decker" date="Feb 07, 2013 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-07/google-joins-jpmorgan-in-seeking-software-patent-limits.html"><headline>Google Joins JPMorgan in Seeking Software Patent Limits</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. owes its creation in part
to a patented software algorithm for ranking documents in a
database, issued to company founder Larry Page and owned by
Stanford University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest search-engine company contends that too
many other software patents hurt innovation more often than they
lead to viable businesses. Google, along with JPMorgan Chase 
Co. and the Yelp Inc. business-review site, say they need to be
able to quickly resolve cases in which a patent owner sues a
large number of companies over widely used software features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeals court specializing in U.S. patent law will
consider the issue tomorrow, in arguments about when software
programs represent legitimate innovations and when they simply
computerize ideas that couldn&#8217;t otherwise be patented. The
question is important because challenging an invention&#8217;s
eligibility for a patent can be quicker and cheaper than
contesting a patent&#8217;s validity on other grounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The patent system has had a hard time figuring out what
patents are valid when you are using a computer to make
something easier,&#8221; said Lynn Pasahow, who represented
Amazon.com Inc. in its 1999 lawsuit alleging Barnes  Noble Inc.
violated a patent for one-click shopping. &#8220;There&#8217;s an idea out
there that it&#8217;s like pornography, you know it when you see it,
or when the Federal Circuit or Supreme Court rules on it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in Washington has divided technology companies that have
filed legal arguments with the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patent Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, Facebook Inc. and Red Hat Inc. say patent standards
are too lax. International Business Machines Corp. warns that
stringent rules could stifle innovation. Computer software was
the fastest-growing area of patents between 1980 and 2005,
according to a report this month by the Brookings Institution, a
Washington research group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While technology companies often use the derisive term
&#8220;trolls&#8221; for patent holders that don&#8217;t make products, they
direct particular ire at owners of software patents who sue
dozens, or even hundreds of companies claiming to have invented
aspects of widely used technologies like online shopping,
Internet mapping or tracking delivery vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the more than 5,600 patent-infringement lawsuits filed
in the U.S. last year, more than 12 percent were filed by just
10 companies over software, according to Bloomberg Law data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Coming up with a product that&#8217;s useful requires some
difficult and sophisticated programming -- that&#8217;s the hard
part,&#8221; Suzanne Michel, Google&#8217;s senior patent counsel, said in
an interview. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a system that&#8217;s over-rewarding the
easy stuff and blocking off the hard part of innovation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unclear Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the legal rules weren&#8217;t clear enough for the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to reject vague applications,
said former PTO Director David Kappos, who left his post Feb. 1
and is now with the Cravath Swaine  Moore law firm. That
doesn&#8217;t mean software patents aren&#8217;t valuable, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Look at Google -- who would be the first of us to throw a
stone and say that wasn&#8217;t a great idea?&#8221; Kappos said. &#8220;If
you&#8217;ve got a patent and sue 50 to 100 manufacturers all at once,
what you&#8217;re really saying is that your patent covers the
problem, not the particular solution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents before the Federal Circuit concern a
computerized method for using an intermediary to make sure
buyers and sellers meet their obligations in stock and currency
trading. Patent owner Alice Corp., an Australian company jointly
owned by National Australia Bank Ltd. and Alice Ventures Pty,
filed infringement claims in 2007 against CLS Bank
International, which settles about $4.5 billion foreign-exchange
transactions daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2011 Ruling &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in Washington ruled in 2011 that the idea
of using an intermediary to settle trades isn&#8217;t eligible for a
patent, and computerizing the notion didn&#8217;t make it patentable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2-1 decision in July, the appeals court reversed that
decision, ruling that Alice&#8217;s suit should proceed because the
patents cover &#8220;practical applications of the invention&#8221; and
not an abstract idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Circuit agreed to have all active judges on the
court rehear the case tomorrow, with a focus on how to determine
if a computer-implemented invention can be patented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s been a push for the past decade or even longer,
with voices saying these shouldn&#8217;t be patentable,&#8221; said Scott Doyle, a patent lawyer with Shearman  Sterling in Washington,
who successfully represented Daimler AG&#8217;s Mercedes-Benz unit
against claims it infringed a patent for a monitor to detect
when a motorist is drowsy. &#8220;They are trying to figure out a
workable way to deal with these cases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long-Standing Practices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Clearing House Association, a trade group representing
the largest commercial banks, said in a filing that too many
patents simply add a computer to long-standing business
practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some software patents are dangerously broad and
dangerously vague,&#8221; said Julie Samuels, a staff lawyer with the
Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco. &#8220;If I had a
magic wand and could go to day one, software should not be
patented at all. The harm software patents cause outweighs the
benefit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the appeals court&#8217;s July ruling, Circuit Judge Richard Linn said that, unless it&#8217;s &#8220;manifestly evident&#8221; that patents
cover abstract ideas ineligible for protection, they should be
challenged on other grounds, such as whether they&#8217;re new or
obvious variations of others&#8217; work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Threshold Issue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group that includes British Airways, Intuit Inc., Twitter
Inc., Yelp and SAP AG said the ruling may keep courts from
quickly resolving cases about patents that wouldn&#8217;t have been
issued under current standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It encouraged trial courts to delay deciding this
threshold issue of law, allowing innovation-harming patents to
stand for months or years without any judicial scrutiny,&#8221; the
companies said in a Dec. 7 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, which has received the most U.S. patents for the past
20 years, said in a Dec. 7 filing that the &#8220;vast majority of
computer-implemented inventions are patent eligible&#8221; and
created technology that transformed society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Software patents as a class are under attack and have
been ever since the software industry began to rely on patent
protection as a rule rather than an exception,&#8221; IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Business Software Alliance, whose members include Apple
Inc. and Microsoft Corp., said the Alice patents shouldn&#8217;t have
been issued because they cover &#8220;an idea that has existed in
non-digital form for millennia.&#8221; Still, the group said,
software inventions &#8220;constitute a growing and significant
portion of both the U.S. economy and U.S. export market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Federal Circuit will try to clarify the rules,
it&#8217;s unlikely to foreclose patenting of all software, said Erika
Arner, a lawyer in Washington who represented a patent owner in
a 2010 Supreme Court case involving business method patents,
which often overlap with software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court is aware that the patent office has been
issuing patents on software for 20 to 30 years, so there are
tens of thousands of patents that represent settled property
rights by inventors around the world,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; CTC Media Inc. fell a sixth day,
the longest losing streak since December, after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. downgraded the Russian television company less than a
month after recommending investors buy the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of CTC traded on the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped
0.9 percent to $10.08 in New York today, the lowest close since
Jan. 24. Trading volume exceeded the daily average for the past
three months by 52 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
This week&#8217;s 5.4 percent slump trimmed CTC&#8217;s advance in 2013 to
30 percent. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-
traded Russian stocks in the U.S. added 0.4 percent today to
104.29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent rally in CTC&#8217;s shares -- it is the best

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. appeals court specializing in
patent law grappled today with questions about when computer
programs should be eligible for legal protection in a case
that&#8217;s divided the judges and the software industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten judges at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in Washington heard arguments about how to distinguish
software innovations from programs that computerize unpatentable
ideas, seeking what Circuit Judge Pauline Newman called &#8220;the
point where one moves from the abstract to the concrete.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc., Facebook Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. are
among companies that say patent standards for software are too
lax and lead to expensive litigation. Stricter rules about what
types of software can be patented could make it cheaper and
quicker to weed out lawsuits over patents that cover the use of
a computer to implement a concept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broad use of computer software in every industry has
generated interest and debate about the case, with Internet
retailers and financial institutions generally seeking tighter
standards. Technology companies are divided, depending on the
nature of their businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An idea can be done entirely by the human mind or with a
pen and paper,&#8221; Mark Perry, a lawyer with Gibson Dunn in
Washington, told the court. Perry represents CLS Bank
International, which is appealing a ruling that it must face a
lawsuit over software patents. It&#8217;s not enough, he said, &#8220;to
take an abstract idea while adding the word computer to it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Settlement Intermediary &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on their questions and their past rulings, the judges
seemed divided, said Brad Wright, a patent lawyer with Banner 
Witcoff in Washington who attended the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court appears fractured and a split decision is
likely,&#8221; Wright said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents in the Federal Circuit case concern a
computerized method for using an intermediary to make sure
buyers and sellers meet their obligations in stock and currency
trading. CLS, which settles about $4.5 billion of foreign-
exchange transactions daily, was accused of infringement in 2007
by patent owner Alice Corp., a Melbourne-based company jointly
owned by National Australia Bank Ltd. and Alice Ventures Pty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright said a decision probably won&#8217;t be released for
several months, predicting at least some aspects of the Alice
patents probably will be upheld. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in Washington ruled in 2011 that the idea
of using a third party to settle trades isn&#8217;t eligible for a
patent, and computerizing the notion didn&#8217;t make it patentable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Specific Method &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2-1 decision in July, the appeals court reversed that
decision, ruling Alice&#8217;s suit should proceed because the patents
cover &#8220;practical applications of the invention.&#8221; Today&#8217;s
arguments were before all nine active judges plus Circuit Judge
Richard Linn, who wrote the original opinion and is now a senior
judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve not claimed the idea of reducing risk&#8221; in the
patent, said Alice&#8217;s lawyer, Adam Perlman of Williams  Connolly
in Washington. &#8220;We&#8217;ve patented a specific method of doing it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circuit judges Timothy Dyk and Jimmie Reyna questioned
whether Alice incorporated use of a computer into a standard way
of doing business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A human being could do these steps, even if more
inefficiently,&#8221; Dyk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore said the claims of the Alice
patents cover specific systems and physical components needed to
implement the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is so far from just a computer doing an abstract
idea,&#8221; Moore said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office said the court should
set up a flexible test that looks at whether the computer is
added to the description of an idea to obtain a patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Not Enough&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At what step does the hardware or computer become an
inseparable part of the whole?&#8221; said PTO lawyer Nathan Kelly.
&#8220;If the computer system is just there to make the idea
patentable, that&#8217;s not enough.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics say software patents too often reward those who try
to cover any way of performing a computer function, instead of
those who make the products after experimentation and research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can have a great idea for a self-driving car,&#8221; Perry
said. &#8220;But Google is spending billions of dollars on it and
should get the patent. The person who wrote down the idea and
brought it to the patent office shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Helping Economy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, along with a group that includes British Airways,
Intuit Inc., Twitter Inc., Yelp Inc. and SAP AG, said the
court&#8217;s July ruling may keep judges from quickly resolving cases
about patents that shouldn&#8217;t have been issued under standards
set in recent Supreme Court cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp., which has received
the most U.S. patents for the past 20 years, and a lobbying
group whose members include Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc., said
software needs legal protection because it contributes to the
nation&#8217;s economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CLS Bank v. Alice Corporation, 11-1301, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower-court case is CLS Bank International v. Alice Corp.,
07cv974, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp.
turned its Watson computer into a virtual assistant to cancer
doctors, showing how it&#8217;s converting the high-powered machine
into a revenue generator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM worked with health insurer WellPoint Inc. and New
York&#8217;s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to adapt the
computer, which beat humans in &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; in 2011, into three
commercial products. Watson will answer medical questions from
doctors, researchers, medical centers and insurance carriers,
the world&#8217;s largest computer-services company said today at an
event in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a major milestone in IBM&#8217;s commercialization of
Watson,&#8221; said Manoj Saxena, IBM&#8217;s general manager for Watson
solutions. &#8220;We have significant plans this year for scaling
Watson.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health-care products will contribute toward IBM&#8217;s goal
of generating $16 billion in revenue from business analytics by
2015. By the end of 2013, 1,600 providers and 50 percent of
nurses in the system of WellPoint, the second-largest U.S.
health insurer, will be using a Watson product for recommending
whether medical procedures should be approved, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health care faces a challenge of &#8220;too much information,
not enough time,&#8221; said Lori Beer, the executive vice president
for information technology at WellPoint. &#8220;Medical literature is
doubling every five years. How do we keep up with that?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Accuracy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WellPoint, based in Indianapolis, plans to make money by
helping doctors make more accurate treatment decisions, reducing
the time it has to spend pre-authorizing procedures and selling
the product to other insurers, she said in an interview. Neither
company provided revenue forecasts for Watson services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Watson became 240 percent faster and 75 percent
smaller so it can run on a single server, IBM said today. The
Armonk, New York-based company now can install a Watson machine
on-site for a business or remotely via cloud computing to a
personal computer, tablet or smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later this year, IBM will announce products for the finance
industry similar to Watson&#8217;s health-care applications, Saxena
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Corp. lost its bid for a
mistrial in a lawsuit by New Hampshire claiming it contaminated
the state&#8217;s water supply with a gasoline additive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil moved for the mistrial, claiming that a state
witness&#8217;s remark in front of the jury violated the judge&#8217;s
previous order to not talk about two funds for cleaning up
contaminated sites. New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter
Fauver ruled before the trial began that no mention could be
made of the funds because the jurors might believe the state
didn&#8217;t need any more money for the cleanup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A mistrial is not warranted,&#8221; Fauver said in his ruling
yesterday. &#8220;Irreparable prejudice has not resulted from trial
testimony to date.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Beckett, a hydrogeologist, testified Feb. 6 that cost
is a factor in monitoring groundwater contamination by the
additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s not enough money to find everything out about a
site,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fauver sent the jury home on Feb. 7 so that the two sides
could argue the issue before him. The trial began on Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire funds have received $213 million from the
oil companies since 1989 through a 1.5 cents-a-gallon fee on all
oil products imported into in the state. The funds have $4
million left in them, the state has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Hands Tied&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now we&#8217;re in a situation, hands tied behind our back,
where we can&#8217;t say that the state does have resources for
remediation,&#8221; ExxonMobil lawyer James Quinn told the judge Feb.
6. Quinn asked Fauver to reconsider his ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fauver said he wouldn&#8217;t reverse his opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendant&#8217;s argument that the state received money from
collateral sources, so its damages figure should be reduced,
remains inappropriate, and defendants will not be entitled to
present it to the jury,&#8221; Fauver said in the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire might be seeking more than $200 million from
ExxonMobil, the last defendant on trial in the $816 million
lawsuit filed in 2003. This is one of scores of cases involving
MTBE filed since 2000 against oil refiners, fuel distributors
and chemical makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil, based in Irving, Texas, has argued in court
that it isn&#8217;t liable because it added MTBE to gasoline to comply
with federal regulations, which pre-empt state law. Oil
companies added MTBE to make gasoline burn more thoroughly in
order to reduce air pollution, as required under the 1990 Clean
Air Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additive Banned &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire banned the additive as of January 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE, which is highly soluble in water and thus can be
carried great distances from where it leaks, is a &#8220;toxic
chemical that does not belong in the state&#8217;s drinking water,&#8221;
Jessica Grant, a lawyer for the state, said in opening remarks
to the jury. It leaked from gas stations, vehicle junkyards,
underground storage tanks and pipe fittings, the state said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state is seeking monetary damages in part based on
ExxonMobil&#8217;s market share of gasoline sales in New Hampshire
during the period covered by the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil&#8217;s share was about 30 percent, the state said.
Based on an estimated cost of $816 million to test for, monitor
and clean up the groundwater, New Hampshire could be seeking
about $245 million from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citgo Dismissed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 15, Fauver agreed to dismiss Citgo Petroleum Corp.,
the other defendant, from this trial while the company and the
state work to complete a settlement. Citgo is the Houston-based
unit of Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the country&#8217;s state-owned oil
company. If an accord isn&#8217;t reached by Feb. 15 and no extension
is approved, Citgo would be reinstated to the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides ExxonMobil and Citgo, New Hampshire also sued Shell
Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips, Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA
and Hess Corp. All settled before the trial began except
ExxonMobil and Citgo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire has received more than $100 million in
settlements from defendants so far, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE lawsuits have also been consolidated in federal court
in New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and motions. In
2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York City
$104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells in
the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire&#8217;s lawyers said last week they hoped to
conclude their case by Feb. 21. ExxonMobil would then begin
presenting its case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is New Hampshire v. Hess Corp., 03-C-0550, New
Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire doesn&#8217;t have enough
money to clean up spills of a gasoline additive that have
contaminated the water supply, a state environmental official
testified at a trial seeking damages from ExxonMobil Corp. for
the pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These funds have never been adequate to do all the work
that&#8217;s out there,&#8221; Michael Wimsatt, director of the Department
of Environmental Service&#8217;s Waste Management Division, told
jurors today in the state-court trial in Concord. &#8220;We have to
decide which work is most important.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time the jury heard about two petroleum
clean-up funds that the judge had previously ruled couldn&#8217;t be
mentioned in testimony. The funds have collected about $213
million through a gasoline import tax since their creation in
1988. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire might be seeking more than $200 million from
ExxonMobil, the last defendant on trial in the $816 million
lawsuit filed in 2003. This is one of scores of cases since 2000
over the additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, against
oil refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil lost a bid for a mistrial last week over its
claim that a state witness&#8217;s remark in front of the jury
violated Judge Peter Fauver&#8217;s previous order not to talk about
the cleanup funds for contaminated sites. Fauver issued a ruling
Feb. 8 that redefined what could be said about the funds and
ordered the state to present Wimsatt, who serves on the
disbursement board for the funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defense Attorneys &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On cross-examination, defense attorneys tried to show that
MTBE remediation isn&#8217;t as expensive as environmental officials
have suggested and that contamination incidents are declining. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Can you tell the jury if any new sites were opened last
year?&#8221; asked Bill Stack, an attorney for ExxonMobil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that number,&#8221;  Wimsatt replied. &#8220;There was
certainly work that we did on these sites.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Wimsatt&#8217;s testimony, hydrogeology expert Gary
Beckett returned to the stand. He testified that 228 MTBE sites
have been identified as needing additional screening, at a cost
of $85,000 per site, and that 85 of those would require more
extensive work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil, based in Irving, Texas, has argued in court
that it isn&#8217;t liable because it added MTBE to gasoline to comply
with federal regulations, which pre-empt state law. Oil
companies added MTBE to make gasoline burn more thoroughly in
order to reduce air pollution, as required under the 1990 Clean
Air Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highly Soluble &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE is highly soluble in water and thus can be carried
great distances from where it leaks. New Hampshire banned the
additive as of January 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state is seeking monetary damages in part based on
ExxonMobil&#8217;s market share of gasoline sales in New Hampshire
during the period covered by the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil&#8217;s share was about 30 percent, the state said.
Based on an estimated cost of $816 million to test for, monitor
and clean up the groundwater, New Hampshire could be seeking
about $245 million from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial began on Jan. 14. New Hampshire&#8217;s lawyers have
said they hope to conclude their case by Feb. 21. ExxonMobil
would then begin presenting its case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in water utilities, infrastructure and water rights offers stable, long-term returns, Kyung-Ah Park, head of the environmental markets group at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Water&#8217;s an indispensable necessity, and supply is very inelastic,&#8221; Park said in New York. Water infrastructure is a way to invest in the megatrend, said the executive of a world in which one in eight, or 884 million people, still lack access to safe water supplies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With demand for water growing twice as fast as a global population expected to reach 8 billion by 2025, and much of the developed world&#8217;s water infrastructure aging faster than it can be replaced, municipalities constrained by the amount they can charge customers need to seek alternative financing, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Public-private partnerships where municipalities join with private water operators in water and water-treatment operations, some with incentives, are one model being used more, particularly in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Managing or buying aging municipal water systems presents some of the best opportunities for private investors in water infrastructure, said Matthew Diserio, president of Water Asset Management LLC, a New York-based investment fund. Private companies running municipal water supplies can wring efficiencies from aging systems and offer investors returns as high as 12 percent annually, Diserio said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The reason this business is so phenomenal is that water rates go only in one direction &#8211;- up,&#8221; he said at the Feb. 8 conference sponsored by Goldman, General Electric Co. and the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based group that works to involve business in solving global environmental issues. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Water Bill &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You don&#8217;t get rich off rates, you get a decent return,&#8221; Diserio said. Private operators are still regulated by government-appointed commissions and need to invest a large portion of their profit rebuilding aging systems, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Representative Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat, said he plans to reintroduce a bill to spur investment in U.S. water infrastructure by removing the cap on Private Activity Bonds, tax-exempt debt that state and local governments can issue to fund private investment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least a fourth of U.S. water is lost to leaks from treatment plants to the tap, and repairs would cost at least $600 billion over the next 20 years even as state and federal spending declines leave a funding gap of $220 billion, Pascrell said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a pretty good investment,&#8221; he said. Economic risk is placed on the private entity, not on the municipality. It&#8217;s a win-win.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Matthew Campbell and Christine Harper" date="Feb 11, 2013 11:36 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-11/goldman-sachs-names-gregg-lemkau-co-head-of-global-mergers-1-.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Names Lemkau, Pozzi to New Mergers Roles</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
world&#8217;s top-ranked mergers and acquisitions adviser this year,
named Gregg Lemkau to help lead that business worldwide and put
Gilberto Pozzi in Lemkau&#8217;s prior role running MA in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemkau, a 43-year-old U.S. citizen who lives in London,
will be global co-head with Gene Sykes, 55, who lives in Los
Angeles, according to a memo to employees today. A spokeswoman
for New York-based Goldman Sachs confirmed the promotions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks are looking for a rebound in takeovers
after global MA rose to the highest level in four years during
the last quarter of 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The surge softened the impact of a 9 percent decline
for the full year. About $220 billion in transactions have been
announced so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemkau was co-head of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s global technology,
media and telecom group and has advised on transactions
including the $8.5 billion sale of Skype to Microsoft Corp. and
the $16.5 billion sale of Medimmune LLC to AstraZeneca Plc. He
will work closely with Michael Carr, who runs MA in the
Americas, as well as with Sykes, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported Lemkau&#8217;s move earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemkau&#8217;s promotion is part of a shift in management toward
younger executives who were promoted to partner after the firm
went public in 1999 and ceased to be a true partnership. Among
the 30 current members of the management committee, 15 became
partners before the IPO. The memo didn&#8217;t say Lemkau would be
joining the management committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Partnership Class &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemkau was promoted to partner in October 2002, and was
part of the same 78-member partnership class that included
William C. Dudley, now the president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York; Carsten Kengeter, who later became head of UBS AG&#8217;s
investment bank; and Harvey M. Schwartz, who became Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s chief financial officer late last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pozzi, a 47-year-old Italian who has been co-head of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s global consumer retail group since 2010, will
continue to be responsible for some clients in that sector while
overseeing deals throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa,
the firm said in a separate memo. Pozzi joined Goldman Sachs in
London in 1995 and was promoted to partner in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pozzi&#8217;s deals have included Unilever NV&#8217;s acquisition of
Russia&#8217;s Kalina consumer group and Mittal&#8217;s takeover of Arcelor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Francois-Xavier &#8220;FX&#8221; de Mallmann, 42, will succeed Pozzi
as co-head of Goldman&#8217;s global consumer retail group alongside
Kathy Elsesser. De Mallman, who is based in London and has
French and Swiss citizenship, will also remain responsible for
investment-banking services in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, a role he&#8217;s held since January 2012. De Mallmann joined
Goldman Sachs in 1993 and has been a partner since 2004. &lt;/p&gt;

markets to confirm recovery before raising individual estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advance in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Enhanced
Commodity Index will include a 2 percent gain in energy, with
precious metals to climb 5 percent and livestock to advance 4.5
percent, the bank said in a report e-mailed today and dated
yesterday. Agriculture will be down 3.5 percent and industrial
metals will fall 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Renewed optimism has been mostly based on momentum and
forward-looking survey data and far less on hard data and
physical markets, which remain lackluster,&#8221; analysts led by New
York-based Jeffrey Currie wrote in the report. &#8220;We are
maintaining our price targets and recommendations and will wait
for hard data and physical markets to confirm the optimism
before raising estimates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Enhanced gauge is up 3.8 percent since the
start of the year after declining 0.1 percent in 2012, the worst
performance since 2008. Brent crude oil has gained 6.1 percent
this year in London, and cotton jumped 9.7 percent, while nickel
is 6.6 percent higher in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank lowered its outlook for commodities to &#8220;neutral&#8221;
last month while forecasting a 5 percent return in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing in the U.S. reached a nine-month high in
January and expanded for a fourth month in China, while services
industries also gained, reports showed this month. The Institute
for Supply Management&#8217;s employment gauge jumped to the highest
since February 2006, according to a Feb. 5 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chinese Housing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman recommended buying copper to &#8220;capture the Chinese
housing completion cycle&#8221; and a long position in the Brent GSCI
Index to benefit from the &#8220;backwardation required by low crude
inventories.&#8221; Goldman said copper will trade at $9,000 a metric
ton in six months and Brent crude will be at $110 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil traded near a nine-month high amid worsening
tensions around Iran&#8217;s nuclear program. Brent for March
settlement was at $117.84 a barrel, down 0.9 percent, by 2:41
p.m. on the London-based ICE Futures Europe. Copper for three-
month delivery slid 1.3 percent to $8,187.50 a ton in London, up
3.2 percent since the start of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So-called backwardation, signaling tight supplies, means
that investors can get positive returns from rolling their
positions from nearby to longer-dated contracts, Goldman said.
High &#8220;roll yields&#8221; are available in Brent and soybeans, while
investors may also get them in copper later this year, the bank
said in a separate report dated Feb. 8. Positive returns are
possible even if prices are stable or falling, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Going forward, we expect the roll yield to contribute a
larger share of the return from commodity investments than was
the case in the years when long-dated prices were rising
structurally,&#8221; the bank wrote. &#8220;This would be in line with the
experience from the 1990s when we last saw stable long-dated
commodity prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s largest

of floating-rate debt in almost five years. The company
initially planned an offering of $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney sold two-year notes that yield one basis point less
than the three-month London interbank offered rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities are rated A2 by
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and A at Standard  Poor&#8217;s, the data

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest

sales of non-carbonated drinks in North America such as Powerade
helped counter lower demand in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income climbed to $1.87 billion, or 41 cents a share,
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said today in a statement. Excluding
restructuring costs and other items, profit was 45 cents a
share, compared with the 44-cent average of 13 analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent is working to meet
growing consumer demand for healthier beverages with products
such as Simply Orange, Honest Tea and Powerade. Global volume
sales rose 3 percent in the quarter, trailing the 5.4 percent
growth estimated by Mark Swartzberg, an analyst at Stifel
Financial in New York, who has a hold rating on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Global diversification continues to pay dividends for the
company even though you might have a little bit of softness in
some regions like Europe, China or North American carbonated
soft drinks,&#8221; Thomas Mullarkey, an analyst for Morningstar Inc.

grow unit case volume globally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mullarkey has a three-star rating on the shares, the
equivalent of a hold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A groundwater expert has vacillated
on how much work must be done on New Hampshire sites
contaminated with a gasoline additive, an ExxonMobil Corp.
lawyer said in a trial to determine whether the company is
liable for damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Beckett, a state witness who is a hydrogeologist,
testified yesterday that 228 sites in the state require
additional monitoring because of contamination by the additive
methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, at a cost of $85,000 each.
He said 85 of those sites need even more extensive work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Your opinions have changed a bit over the course of the
case, right?&#8221; David Lender, a lawyer for ExxonMobil, asked
Beckett today during cross-examination in court in Concord. Had
Beckett relied on the state&#8217;s standard for MTBE in drinking
water of 13 parts per billion, fewer sites would require
additional testing, Lender said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If that had been the only criteria, yes,&#8221; Beckett said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve expanded the criteria to be more robust and more
encompassing of all the site information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire might be seeking more than $200 million from
ExxonMobil, the last defendant on trial in the $816 million
lawsuit filed in 2003. The number of wells found to be
contaminated with MTBE is one factor in determining damages if
ExxonMobil is found liable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has received $213 million from oil companies for
two MTBE cleanup funds since 1989 through a 1.5 cents-a-gallon
fee on all gasoline imported into the state. The funds have
$4 million left in them, the state has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Federal Law &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil, based in Irving, Texas, has argued in court
that it isn&#8217;t liable for damage because it added MTBE to
gasoline to comply with federal regulations, which pre-empt
state law. Oil companies added MTBE to make gasoline burn more
thoroughly in order to reduce air pollution, as required under
the 1990 Clean Air Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state was aware of MTBE&#8217;s risks when it opted into a
clean-air program in 1991 because the additive already had been
studied for several years, ExxonMobil said in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire banned the additive as of January 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State witness Gary Lynn, a manager of the state Department
of Environmental Services&#8217; petroleum mediation section,
testified that MTBE still shows up in wells six years after it
was banned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE, which is highly soluble in water and thus can be
carried great distances from where it leaked, is a &#8220;toxic
chemical that does not belong in the state&#8217;s drinking water,&#8221;
Jessica Grant, a lawyer for the state, said in opening remarks
to the jury. It leaked from gas stations, vehicle junkyards,
underground storage tanks and pipe fittings, the state said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monetary Damages &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the number of contaminated wells, the state is
seeking monetary damages based on ExxonMobil&#8217;s market share of
gasoline sales in New Hampshire during the period covered by the
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil&#8217;s share was about 30 percent, the state said.
Based on an estimated cost of $816 million to test for, monitor
and clean up the groundwater, New Hampshire could be seeking
about $245 million from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 15, New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver
agreed to dismiss Citgo Petroleum Corp., the other defendant,
from this trial while the company and the state work to complete
a settlement. Citgo is the Houston-based unit of Petroleos de
Venezuela SA, that country&#8217;s state-owned oil company. If an
accord isn&#8217;t reached by Feb. 15 and no extension is approved,
Citgo would be reinstated to the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Companies Settle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides ExxonMobil and Citgo, New Hampshire also sued Shell
Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips, Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA
and Hess Corp. All settled before the trial began except
ExxonMobil and Citgo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire has received more than $100 million in
settlements from defendants so far, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is one of scores involving MTBE that have been
filed since 2000 against oil refiners, fuel distributors and
chemical makers. MTBE lawsuits have been consolidated in federal
court in New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and motions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York
City $104.7 million after finding the company liable for
polluting wells in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire trial began Jan. 14. The state said it
may rest its case Feb. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is New Hampshire v. Hess Corp., 03-C-0550, New
Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz said the banking industry&#8217;s
average return on equity will rise above 12 percent as some
firms shrink or exit businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think the industry will migrate to higher returns
because it will have to,&#8221; Schwartz, 48, said today at the
Credit Suisse Financial Services Forum in Miami. It might be a
&#8220;question of excess capacity coming out over a long period of
time,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, made
a 10.7 percent return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity
last year, up from 3.7 percent in 2011. Schwartz, who last month
called the 2012 figure &#8220;not particularly aspirational,&#8221; said
today that the New York-based company doesn&#8217;t yet have
sufficient information to provide investors with a ROE target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of the audience members at the conference
said in a poll that they expected average return on equity for
the industry to settle at around 12 percent, according to Howard Chen, a Credit Suisse Group AG analyst at the event. Schwartz,
who replaced David A. Viniar, 57, as CFO at the end of January,
said he&#8217;d be surprised if that consensus view proved accurate
over the long run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More banks will exit capital-intensive businesses like
fixed-income trading because they&#8217;re under pressure from
shareholders to boost returns, Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re not in a leading position in one of those
businesses, it&#8217;s difficult to stay committed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
just a question of who executes better and who gets that
share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mortgage Size &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his presentation, Schwartz detailed Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
decision to stick with its mortgage business even after an
initial regulatory proposal in December 2011 threatened to
increase the capital requirement by 260 percent. Instead, the
firm waited, which he said paid off when regulators released a
new set of rules that raised the capital requirement by 170
percent instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was driven in part by the importance of the
mortgage business, which has been a part of the company for
almost 30 years, Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To scrap that and then potentially have to rebuild it?&#8221;
Schwartz said. &#8220;Mortgages remain a critical asset class for our
clients and obviously an important business for the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm has in the past de-emphasized the size and
importance of its mortgage-underwriting business, an area that
came under legal and regulatory scrutiny after the financial
crisis. Viniar said on an Oct. 19, 2010, conference call that
mortgages have &#8220;always been the smallest&#8221; of the firm&#8217;s fixed-
income, currency, and commodity businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Really Tiny&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are really tiny in the market,&#8221; Viniar told analysts
at the time. &#8220;We were an underwriter, we did it. We are a
player in the market. But we&#8217;re just not one of the leading
players.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit employed 40 percent fewer employees in 2012 than
in 2008 and made 14 percent less revenue and 22 percent less in
pretax earnings, according to a slide that accompanied
Schwartz&#8217;s presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rose 1 percent to $153.76 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading at 11:03 a.m., the highest since
April 2011, amid optimism that bank profits will rise. The
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index climbed 6.4 percent this year
through yesterday, and the KBW Bank Index advanced 7.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GLC Advisors  Co., the advisory arm

restructuring advisory practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhandari was previously a managing director in the
leveraged finance group at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong and New
York, GLC said an e-mailed statement. At GLC he will focus on
debt advisory, private placement and restructuring services,
based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLC Advisors is adding to a restructuring advisory team
that has worked on more than 150 transactions involving $300
billion of securities, according to the firm&#8217;s website. Chairman
Thomas Benninger founded GLC in 2005 after heading the
restructuring group at UBS AG, and has recruited bankers from
UBS&#8217;s restructuring team including Soren Reynertson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Goldman Sachs, Bhandari was a managing director with
UBS in the restructuring and leveraged finance groups where he
worked with Benninger and Reynertson. Earlier he worked at DLJ
in the restructuring and leveraged finance teams. Bhandari is a
graduate of Brown University and Harvard Business School. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., the
world&#8217;s biggest payment networks, won dismissal of a price-
fixing lawsuit brought by a group representing operators of
automated teller machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington today
also threw out two related suits, ruling that all the plaintiffs
failed to show the companies conspired to restrict independent
ATM operators from charging varying prices for customers using
alternative networks such as STAR, Shazam Inc. or TransFund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs have not set forth sufficient facts to support
their claim that there was a horizontal conspiracy,&#8221; Jackson
wrote in her 39-page opinion. &#8220;Notably absent from each of the
complaints are facts showing the existence of an agreement, the
essential element of any conspiracy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dismissal of the suit leaves ATM operators grappling
with the same alleged anti-competitive landscape that they
claimed prevents them from attracting customers by offering a
discount by making a transaction over less expensive networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allegations in the lead case were made by the National
ATM Council Inc., a trade group based in Jacksonville, Florida,
and 13 operators of ATMs in nine states. The group sought to
represent the 350 non-bank ATM operators nationwide and asked
for triple damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ATM operators claim that the &#8220;overwhelming&#8221; majority
of so-called PIN debit cards used for ATM transactions are
branded by Visa or MasterCard. Under a uniform agreement, the
operators can&#8217;t charge less for transactions over a network that
competes with Visa and MasterCard, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Network Access &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to accept one of these cards, an ATM operator must
have access to the Visa and MasterCard networks. Independent or
non-bank operators must be sponsored by a financial institution
that is a member of the Visa and MasterCard networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What is missing is any discussion of what the ATM
operator&#8217;s costs are, and whether they change if the operator
uses a Visa or MasterCard network or an alternative network,&#8221;
Jackson said. &#8220;Those facts are fundamental, and without them,
there is no basis for the conclusions&#8221; that the access fees are
&#8220;inflated&#8221; or &#8220;supra-competitive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said a &#8220;critical problem&#8221; in all three
complaints is that the plaintiffs do not make clear who pays
whom in these transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;No Facts&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are no facts in the complaints that support a
conclusion that prices would be lower if the restrictions at
issue were lifted,&#8221; Jackson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Issokson, a spokesman for MasterCard, based in
Purchase, New York, said in an e-mail that the company was
pleased with the ruling. Will Valentine, a spokesman for Foster
City, California-based Visa, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for the ATM group, Daniel Small of Cohen Millstein
Sellers  Toll Pllc in Washington, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to
a phone message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead case is National ATM Council v. Visa Inc., 11-
cv-1803, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical stocks, which have
soared in the past year to valuations not seen since 2001, are
poised to extend their rally as investors grow more confident
the industry has weathered a decade-long shortage of new drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large pharmaceutical stocks such as Sanofi, Novartis AG and
Pfizer Inc. are still cheaper relative to next year&#8217;s estimated
earnings than are market benchmarks such as the U.S.&#8217;s Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fundamental change in the way pharmaceutical companies
are positioned leaves room for shares to erase that gap and rise
another 20 percent in two years, said Ori Hershkovitz, a partner
at Sphera Funds Management Ltd., a health-care hedge fund in Tel
Aviv. Companies have become more diversified -- in geography and
products -- and have built stronger pipelines of experimental
drugs even as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved 39
new drugs last year. That&#8217;s the most since 2000, according to
Bloomberg Industries data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not a simple comeback,&#8221; Hershkovitz, who owns
Pfizer and Sanofi shares, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s
of historical magnitude because they&#8217;re changing the business
model. It&#8217;s not pharmaceuticals as we knew it. It&#8217;s new
companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Investors had punished drug stocks as their pipelines ran dry and blockbuster
drugs such as Pfizer&#8217;s Lipitor cholesterol-lowering pill, the asthma treatment Singulair from Merck  Co. and Sanofi&#8217;s Plavix blood thinner lost patent protection and faced generic competition. Close

&lt;p&gt;Baupost Group LLC, the Boston-based
hedge fund run by Seth Klarman, sold its remaining stakes in
Hewlett-Packard Co. and Microsoft Corp. in the fourth quarter,
abandoning bets on two firms tied to the personal-computer
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baupost sold 14.4 million shares of Palo Alto, California-
based Hewlett-Packard and 1.4 million shares of Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, according to a regulatory filing
today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm
bought 7 million shares of New York-based American International
Group Inc., the insurer that repaid a U.S. bailout last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klarman, known for his emphasis on undervalued securities,
invested in Hewlett Packard and Microsoft in 2011. He started
selling shares in both companies in the third quarter of 2012,
according to regulatory filings, and completely exited his
positions by year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personal computer industry is facing its second

&lt;p&gt;Peru plans to destroy coca bushes
this year at a faster pace than growers expand output as the
government seeks to curtail cultivation that has expanded for
six straight years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will eradicate a record 22,000 hectares
(54,363 acres) of coca plants this year, which will reduce the
size of the crop by 6 percent, Carmen Masias, the nation&#8217;s drug
czar, told reporters in Lima. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru&#8217;s cultivation of the plant used to make cocaine
increased 2 percent to 62,500 hectares in 2011, according to the
United Nations, even after the government removed about 10,000
hectares of bushes. The Andean nation, which previously relied
solely on foreign aid to finance eradication, will contribute 40
percent of this year&#8217;s $30 million budget to expand the program,
Masias said. Total spending on the drug fight will rise 16
percent to $278 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Eradication is completely indispensable but must go hand
in hand with development&#8221; of alternative crops, such as cocoa
and palm oil, Masias said. The U.S. government, the main source
of drugs aid to Peru, agreed last year to provide $135 million
through 2017 for alternative development, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Ollanta Humala&#8217;s government removed about 14,000
hectares of coca bushes last year, 40 percent more than in 2011,
to slow growth in a crop that the United Nations says now rivals
Colombia&#8217;s as the world&#8217;s largest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive to curtail cultivation will be extended to the
valley of the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro Rivers, an area of
jungle in the south of the country where holdout members of the
Shining Path, a Maoist insurgency group, are active, Masias
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is also removing coca bushes for the first
time in the Monzon valley in northern Peru, where the crop has
been grown for the drug trade for 80 years, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inversiones Alsacia SA bonds
tumbled, pushing yields up the most in 15 months, as JPMorgan
Chase  Co. recommended selling the Chilean bus operator&#8217;s debt
and Fitch Ratings said it may lower its rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on dollar-denominated notes due 2018 rose 41 basis
points, or 0.41 percentage point, to 8.72 percent at 2:02 p.m.
in Santiago, the biggest increase on a closing basis since
October 2011. The price of the securities dropped 1.72 cents to
96.92 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan lowered its recommendation yesterday to the
equivalent of sell, saying Alsacia&#8217;s ability to service its debt
is deteriorating. Fitch said it may cut the company&#8217;s BB
ranking, two levels below investment grade, citing the company&#8217;s
shrinking profit, slower growth and declining demand for bus
transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The use of reserve funds is imminent,&#8221; Fitch analysts
Astra Castillo in Monterrey, Mexico, and Omar Valdez in New York
wrote in a report yesterday. &#8220;Debt coverage for the coming
payments is highly uncertain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telephone calls to Patricio Pinto, Alsacia&#8217;s head of
corporate affairs, weren&#8217;t answered during business hours today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company sold $464 million of the bonds two years ago
with a yield of 8 percent. That yield was higher than the
expected 7.5 percent, spurring Fitch to cut its rating by one
level to BB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alsacia&#8217;s debt service coverage ratio was 1.12 at the end
of January, compared with a level of 1.1 that may require the
company to start making early payments, JPMorgan analysts Daniel Sensel and Daniela Savoia wrote in a research report yesterday.
JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp. managed the original bond
sale in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even though we believe the company has enough cash to
take care of operating expenses and debt service, we believe
there will be some volatility in the short term until there is
more clarity about the plans of the company to avoid a possible
break&#8221; of the debt ratio in April, Sensel and Savoia wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAO Rosneft, Russia&#8217;s largest oil
producer, and Exxon Mobil Corp. said they may expand cooperation
in Alaska, Russia&#8217;s arctic waters and liquefied natural gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft now has an option to take a 25 percent share in the
Point Thomson project, a gas condensate deposit, on Alaska&#8217;s
North Slope. That&#8217;s part of the deal signed today by Igor Sechin, Rosneft&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Greenlee,
Exxon&#8217;s exploration head, at Russian President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s
residence outside Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft may contribute seven offshore licenses gained today
from Russia&#8217;s Natural Resources ministry to its arctic venture
with Exxon, Greenlee said. Rosneft this month announced it
agreed to pay 5.4 billion rubles ($180 million) to the ministry
for 12 licenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft has formed partnerships with Exxon, Statoil SA and
Eni SpA as it looks to explore Russia&#8217;s offshore areas and tight
oil fields, while also gaining opportunities abroad. Rosneft and
Exxon are exploring the Kara Sea and drilling pilot wells on
tight oil deposits in Siberia. Rosneft has entered into Exxon
projects in Texas and Canada as Rosneft&#8217;s board approved
expanding a cooperation agreement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies, which are partners at the Exxon-led
Sakhalin-1 project on Russia&#8217;s Pacific coast, will study
opportunities to liquefy natural gas in Asia including the
possible construction of an LNG plant cooling the fuel for
tanker travel, according to a joint statement today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest buyers of
corporate debt are seeking refuge in shorter-maturity bonds as
concern deepens that a three-decade rally will end in losses as
interest rates rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. is planning two actively-managed exchange-
traded funds focused on short-term debt, with one seeking to
have principal repaid within a year, the world&#8217;s biggest money
manager said in regulatory filings. Loomis Sayles  Co. has
favored five- and 10-year corporate notes since April as it&#8217;s
shifted away from 30-year bonds at its Core Plus Fixed Income
team, which oversees about $9.5 billion, said Peter Palfrey, a
money manager at the Boston-based firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt from the most-creditworthy borrowers has become more
vulnerable with the extra yield investors demand to hold the
notes rather than Treasuries declining an unprecedented 4.56
percentage points since the end of 2008, reducing the cushion
that helps preserve gains when benchmark rates rise. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. President Gary D. Cohn said this week he&#8217;s
concerned some investors don&#8217;t understand that bonds will lose
value as benchmark yields inevitably climb from record lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do see a significant increase in appetite for shorter-
dated, shorter-duration exposures,&#8221; Edward Marrinan, a macro
credit strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;That&#8217;s a trend that is gaining
traction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hwang-DBS (Malaysia) Bhd., the
investment bank backed by Southeast Asia&#8217;s largest lender, is
considering a sale after the death of its founder last year, one
person with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which counts Singapore-based DBS Group
Holdings Ltd. and Malaysia&#8217;s Hwang Enterprises Sdn. as its
largest shareholders, has asked Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to find
potential buyers, the person said, asking not to be identified
as the information is private. Founder Hwang Sing Lue died on
Dec. 16, the company said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hwang-DBS rose 5 percent to close at 3.98 ringgit in Kuala
Lumpur today, its highest level in more than a decade, giving
the Penang-based company a market value of about 1 billion
ringgit ($323 million). The sale is still at an early stage and
potential buyers include other Malaysian investment banks, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possible sale was reported on Feb. 9 by the Star
newspaper, which cited people it didn&#8217;t identify. Hwang-DBS
Managing Director Alex Hwang Lip Teik wasn&#8217;t immediately
available to comment when a call was made to his office in
Penang today. Karen Ngui, a spokeswoman for DBS Group, declined
to comment on the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaysian banks and brokerages have been merging in recent
years amid increased competition from overseas firms. Last year,
KN Kenanga Holdings Bhd. acquired the investment banking and
broking unit of ECM Libra Financial Group Bhd. for 875 million
ringgit, while RHB Capital acquired OSK Holdings Bhd.&#8217;s
investment bank for 2 billion ringgit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hwang-DBS began operations in 1973 under the name Southern
Stock Brokers Sdn. and HwangDBS Investment Bank Bhd. was created
in December 1992, according to the company&#8217;s website. Through
its units, DBS Group controls about 28 percent of the company,
while Hwang Enterprises owns another 27 percent, data compiled

&lt;p&gt;Water wells with no detectable level
of a gasoline additive can show high concentrations a few months
later, a water treatment specialist told a New Hampshire jury
considering whether ExxonMobil Corp. is liable for contaminating
some of the state&#8217;s supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you get a good test today, that&#8217;s a snapshot of today,
and it&#8217;s no guarantee that you won&#8217;t have a problem tomorrow,&#8221;
Stephen Guercia, who was hired by the state to estimate the
costs of testing and cleaning wells, said in court in Concord
today. &#8220;This is an example of the need to test wells
repeatedly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire might be seeking more than $200 million from
ExxonMobil, the last of seven defendant oil companies on trial
after they were sued in 2003. The number of wells found to be
contaminated with the additive is one factor in determining
damages if ExxonMobil is found liable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guercia said the cost of testing, treating and monitoring
the state&#8217;s 250,000 private wells over 20 years would be about
$450 million. That&#8217;s in addition to two estimates from other
state witnesses: $195 million to clean up 85 high-risk wells and
$173 million to test and monitor 228 sites with levels of the
additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, in water of 13
parts per billion. Those estimates total $818 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil lawyer David Lender suggested during cross-
examination today that Guercia relied on estimates of well
contamination by another state witness, Graham Fogg, whose
reliability the oil company has questioned in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Unreliable&#8217; Numbers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the jury concludes that Dr. Fogg&#8217;s projections are
unreliable, then by definition all the numbers we just saw would
also be unreliable, right?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guercia replied that he was &#8220;comfortable with&#8221; Fogg&#8217;s
projections and &#8220;the numbers he came up with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has received $213 million from oil companies for
two MTBE cleanup funds since 1989 through a 1.5-cent-per-gallon
fee on all gasoline imported into in the state. The funds have
$4 million left in them, the state said in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil, based in Irving, Texas, has argued in court
that it isn&#8217;t liable for damage because it added MTBE to
gasoline to comply with federal regulations, which pre-empt
state law. Oil companies added MTBE to make gasoline burn more
thoroughly in order to reduce air pollution, as required under
the 1990 Clean Air Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additive Studies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state was aware of MTBE&#8217;s risks when it opted into a
federal clean-air program in 1991 because there had been studies
of the additive for several years before that, ExxonMobil said
in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire banned the additive as of January 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State witness Gary Lynn, who works for the Department of
Environmental Services, testified that MTBE still shows up in
wells six years after it was banned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE is highly soluble in water and can be carried great
distances from where it leaked, Jessica Grant, a lawyer for New
Hampshire, told the jury during opening statements. It leaked
from gas stations, vehicle junkyards, underground storage tanks
and pipe fittings, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the number of contaminated wells, the state is
seeking monetary damages based on ExxonMobil&#8217;s market share of
gasoline sales in New Hampshire during the period covered by the
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil&#8217;s share was about 30 percent, the state said.
Based on the estimated cost of $818 million to test for, monitor
and clean up the groundwater, New Hampshire could be seeking
about $245 million from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citgo Dismissed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 15, New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter
Fauver agreed to dismiss Citgo Petroleum Corp., the other
defendant, from this trial while the company and the state
negotiated a settlement. If an accord isn&#8217;t reached by Feb. 15
and no extension is approved, Citgo would be reinstated to the
trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando Garay, a spokesman for Citgo, the Houston-based
unit of Petroleos de Venezuela SA, that country&#8217;s state-owned
oil company, declined to comment on a settlement. Mary Maloney,
an assistant attorney general for New Hampshire, also declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state said it expects to rest its case on Feb. 21.
ExxonMobil will then present its side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is New Hampshire v. Hess Corp., 03-C-0550, New
Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The California State Teachers&#8217;
Retirement System, in a governance dispute with Walt Disney Co.,
will oppose the election of six directors, including Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $158 billion state pension, with 5.28 million Disney
shares, will oppose an amendment to the company&#8217;s stock
incentive plan and cast a &#8220;no&#8221; advisory vote on executive pay,
according to a statement today. Calstrs also will vote in favor
of splitting the chairman and CEO roles in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposition comes after Disney, the world&#8217;s largest
entertainment company, reported earnings-per-share growth of 24
percent in its last fiscal year and share-price returns more
than double the SP 500 Index. Iger, 62, has said he will step
down as chief executive in March 2015 and serve as chairman
until June 2016. His predecessor, Michael Eisner, had tangled
with investors over board composition before his departure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Here we go again, sliding back into a governance
structure that has already proved detrimental to the company&#8217;s
long-term growth and to its shareholders&#8217; interests,&#8221; Anne Sheehan, Calstrs director of corporate governance, said in the
statement. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been through this fight before, in 2004-05,
which resulted in the ouster of then-CEO Michael Eisner and a
shareholder revolt that led to the separation of the board chair
and CEO positions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock Grants &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney has come under fire from investors and proxy
advisers in the past year over its executive pay and the
decision to combine the top jobs under Iger. The Burbank,
California-based company&#8217;s CEO received $40.2 million in total
compensation last year, based on regulatory reporting rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s standards for electing a chairman are &#8220;clear and
workable,&#8221; the company said in a January filing. The suggestion
&#8220;that the current standard led to a poor decision to elect Mr.
Iger Chairman is unfounded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the filing, Disney changed Iger&#8217;s pay criteria
based on feedback from investors. He must now meet earnings per
share and stock-price targets before receiving all of his stock
grants. Ninety-two percent of the target value of Iger&#8217;s
compensation is contingent on financial results and the stock&#8217;s
performance, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earnings Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company declined to comment today beyond what it
previously published in the Jan. 18 proxy statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s earnings rose 24 percent to $3.13 a share in the
fiscal year ended Sept. 29. Over Iger&#8217;s eight-year tenure as
CEO, earnings have risen at a 14.8 percent average annual rate,
according to Disney&#8217;s filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s total return to shareholders for the fiscal year
was 76 percent, more than double the 30 percent return for the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock fell 0.2 percent to $54.88 at the close in New
York York, after hitting an all-time high last week. Disney has
gained 10 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last year&#8217;s annual meeting, Calstrs opposed Disney&#8217;s
executive pay plan and the decision to combine the top jobs.
This year&#8217;s shareholder meeting is scheduled for March 6 in
Phoenix, Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut about two
dozen U.S. equities traders and sales staff after that unit&#8217;s
revenue declined last year, according to two people with
knowledge of the reductions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some senior employees voluntarily left after their bonuses
shrank more than those of their fixed-income counterparts amid a
push to more closely align pay with revenue, said one of the
people, who asked not to be identified because the decisions
weren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fixed-income unit generated $15.4 billion in revenue
last year, up 4 percent from 2011, while revenue from the
equities division, run by Tim Throsby, slipped 1.8 percent to
$4.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About three managing directors and 18 executive directors,
including Andrew Crofton and Julian Plant, were cut, according
to one of the people. Kevin Smart, a vice president in the unit,
also lost his job, two people said. Equities derivatives traders
and sales people also were affected, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
company, said she couldn&#8217;t comment on the departures. Plant also
declined to comment, while Crofton and Smart didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throsby, who previously ran equity derivatives sales and
trading, was promoted in September to run the entire unit as
part of a broader management shakeup. Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon, 56, ousted top managers and shuffled others around
after traders in the chief investment office lost more than $6.2
billion on a bad derivatives bet in the first three quarters of
last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. SA,
the world&#8217;s second-largest bottler of the soft drink, gained
in Athens trading after the company increased its sales volume
in emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece&#8217;s largest company by market value said revenue
climbed 5 percent in the fourth quarter to 1.6 billion euros
($2.1 billion) on volume growth in countries including Russia,
Nigeria and Poland. Coca-Cola HBC maintained volume for the full
year, compared to a 1 percent decline in 2011, it said today in
a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An 8 percent boost in volume in emerging markets in the
fourth quarter, as well as a 5 percent decline in cases of
drinks sent to established markets, were a &#8220;positive&#8221;
surprise, Mike Gibbs, an analyst at JP Morgan Cazenove with an
overweight recommendation on the shares, said today in a note.
&#8220;We think that the worst of the margin pain is now behind.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC is shifting its primary listing to London
from the Greek stock exchange in an effort to reduce exposure to
Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis and improve access to
international investors. The change is expected to be completed
early in the second quarter of 2013, Chief Executive Officer
Dimitris Lois said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose as much as 3.2 percent to 19.97 euros and
were up 2.7 percent at 3:57 p.m. in Athens, taking the 12-month
gain to 37 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue growth outpaced volume gains for the sixth
consecutive quarter, Coca-Cola HBC said. &#8220;We gained or
maintained volume share in sparkling beverages in 21 out of 28
markets,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wider Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the successes came as the bottler posted a wider-
than-expected fourth-quarter loss and forecast that currency-
neutral revenue per case will grow at a slower pace this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth-quarter loss widened to 45.8 million euros
compared with a deficit of 11.6 million euros a year earlier.
The average of five analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg
was for a loss of 26 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher input costs, unfavorable currency swings and higher
operating expenses weighed on 2012 profit, which fell 28 percent
to 190.4 million euros, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC said it is targeting free cash flow of 1.3
billion euros for the period ending Dec. 31, 2015. Annual net
capital expenditure is expected to range from 5.5 percent to 6.5
percent of net sales in the period, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect challenging conditions to persist across most&#8221;
markets, CEO Lois said in a phone interview. While &#8220;we don&#8217;t
really see any signs of stabilization&#8221; in Greece, Italy and
Ireland, &#8220;we are positive about Russia and Nigeria,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company expects to incur costs of 50 million euros in
2013 tied mainly to infrastructure and distribution, Chief
Financial Officer Michalis Imellos said by phone. On an
annualized basis, these will yield savings of about 30 million
euros from 2014, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currency-neutral input costs per case will rise at a low
single-digit pace, led by sugar, resin and aluminum, though the
rate will be slower than in 2012 and 2011, Imellos said. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore and Heather Hauswirth" date="Feb 15, 2013 12:55 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-15/jpmorgan-said-to-fire-traders-realign-pay-amid-slump.html"><headline>JPMorgan Said to Fire Traders, Realign Pay Amid Slump</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., grappling with
Wall Street&#8217;s worst year for stock-trading since 2008, cut pay
at the equities unit about 4 percent and pushed out about three
dozen employees, people with knowledge of the moves said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two dozen U.S. traders and sales staff were fired,
and some senior employees left voluntarily as the unit aligned
pay more closely with revenue, said the people, asking to not be
identified because the measures aren&#8217;t public. The bank also
dismissed equity analysts last week, three people said, with one
saying about a dozen were affected. Industrywide equities-
trading revenue fell 5 percent last year, the third straight
annual drop, according to analytics firm Coalition Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has pared equities jobs each year since 2008,
former and current executives said. Equities-trading chief Tim Throsby has been reviewing the unit since around March, these
people said. Assisted by Marc Badrichani and Jason Sippel, he
found that pay for equities traders and sales staff was too high
compared with revenue, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit posted a 1.8 percent drop in revenue to $4.4
billion last year, compared with a 4 percent gain in fixed-
income trading revenue to $15.4 billion. About three managing
directors and 18 executive directors were cut, including Andrew Crofton and Julian Plant, current and former executives said.
Kevin Smart, a vice president, also left, two people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock Gain &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
company, said she couldn&#8217;t comment on the departures. Plant
declined to comment, while Crofton and Smart didn&#8217;t respond to
messages. The bank&#8217;s stock gained 12 percent this year through
yesterday and declined 31 cents to $48.91 at 12:52 p.m. in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan eliminated teams of equity analysts in New York
and San Francisco around Feb. 6, including Dane Mott who covered
accounting, Chris Blansett, who covered semiconductors, Scott Levine, who covered engineering and environmental services and
Matthew Heimermann, who covered insurers, according to two
people familiar with the cuts. The analysts didn&#8217;t return calls
for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities trading was hardest-hit by job cuts in 2012, with
the top 10 investment banks eliminating 2,700 front-office
workers, or about 14 percent, according to data released
yesterday by Coalition. Equities-trading revenue at the 10 banks
was $33 billion, the lowest since 2008, Coalition said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cash Equities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash equities, the trading of common shares on public
exchanges, produced $10 billion in revenue at the 10 largest
investment banks, down 40 percent from 2008 as firms grappled
with plunging volume, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities account for about a quarter of total trading and
investment-banking revenue. They include commissions and gains
from buying and selling stocks, futures, options and other
equity derivatives, as well as fees and interest income from
providing services and lending to hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throsby and other executives prepared staff in the Americas
for reductions and lower pay with a conference call on Jan. 17,
the day after the bank reported a record $21.3 billion in net
income for 2012. Headcount, executives said, would be coming
down, according to two people on the call. The bank would
probably replace more highly paid senior executives with less-
costly junior traders and sales staff, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay in the broader investment bank, which includes
dealmakers and fixed-income traders, fell by about 3 percent in
2012, people briefed on the compensation said this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throsby, who joined JPMorgan from Citadel Investment Group
LLC almost three years ago, was promoted in September from
running derivatives trading and sales to head all equities
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, ousted top
managers and shuffled others around after traders in the chief
investment office lost more than $6.2 billion on a bad
derivatives bet in the first three quarters of last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management says
Macau casino bonds that have rallied for 16 months are likely to
withstand any crackdown aimed at cleaning up the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd.&#8217;s 8.5 percent dollar notes
due December 2020 rose every week this year for a 5.9 percent
return, with the yield touching a record-low 6.84 percent on Feb.
14, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield on Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd.&#8217;s 4.625 percent yuan securities reached
3.48 percent yesterday, the least since they were sold in
December 2010. Casino stocks plunged the most since July after
the Times of London reported on Feb. 5 that a crackdown on
triad-linked junket operators was imminent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Previous cooling and policy measures have generally been
positive to the long-term health of the market,&#8221; Salman Niaz, a
bond-fund manager in Singapore at Goldman Sachs Asset, said in a
Feb. 15 e-mail interview. &#8220;Given the high free-cash flow
generated by the operators and the limited leverage, the credit
profile is unlikely to deteriorate materially in the near
term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record-low borrowing costs will help tycoons fund more than
$16 billion of expansion plans in the world&#8217;s biggest gambling
hub. Melco Chief Executive Officer Lawrence Ho, son of the
city&#8217;s former gaming monopoly holder Stanley Ho, said this month
he hadn&#8217;t heard of any crackdown and that his casinos were &#8220;jam
packed&#8221; over last week&#8217;s Chinese New Year holiday. Billionaire
Lui Che Woo&#8217;s Galaxy also had 100 percent occupancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adelson, Wynn &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian casino notes rose every month since September 2011 to
a record on Jan. 31, according to an index compiled by Credit
Suisse Group AG, and outpaced U.S. counterparts in January by
the most since May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former Portuguese colony ended Stanley Ho&#8217;s 40-year
monopoly on gambling in 2002, and by the end of last year it
played host to 35 casinos, according to government statistics.
The Hong Kong units of companies controlled by Sheldon Adelson
and Steve Wynn currently have plans to invest $6.6 billion on
new gaming tables and hotel rooms in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casino revenue in Macau rose 13 percent to $38 billion in
2012, according to data published by the Gaming Inspection and
Coordination Bureau, compared with $6.2 billion of takings on
the Las Vegas strip. CLSA Ltd. forecasts annual revenue in the
former colony will reach $100 billion by 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Substantial Expansion&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Macau businesses are highly cash generative and
there&#8217;s a substantial expansion in tables et cetera underway,&#8221;
Edmund Harriss, London-based investment director at Guinness
Atkinson Asset Management, said in a Feb. 14 interview.
&#8220;Crackdowns are part and parcel of the industry. As a
bondholder, I see the businesses as attractive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guinness manages $436 million of assets and owns Galaxy&#8217;s
yuan-denominated notes, Harriss said. Goldman Sachs Asset
Management oversees $854 billion globally, including emerging-
market debt funds that hold Melco&#8217;s Chinese-currency bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As middlemen and moneylenders, junket operators help bring
high-rollers to Macau, who account for 70 percent of casino
revenue. China will clamp down on the operators after the Lunar
New Year, the Times reported. Police detained people from at
least three of the biggest junket companies in December, the
Wall Street Journal reported in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We haven&#8217;t heard anything like that,&#8221; Melco CEO Lawrence
Ho said on a conference call on Feb. 6. &#8220;We continue to be very
positive. This year is definitely going to be better than last
year.&#8221; Galaxy, Sands China Ltd., and MGM China Holdings Ltd.
all declined to comment when contacted earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Headline Risks&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macau&#8217;s government will strengthen its licensing system for
junket operators and work with law enforcement to tackle
gambling-related crimes, Francis Tam, secretary for economy and
finance, said on Feb. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While crackdowns have resulted in headline risks, these
have only moderately restrained the fundamental story,&#8221; Kevin McSweeney, a Toronto-based fixed-income manager at CI
Investments Inc., which manages $74 billion of assets including
casino bonds, said in an e-mail today. &#8220;Macau is an ever-
growing hub. While equities are subject to growth risk, cash
flow at these levels of gaming supply is excellent and pricing
power should provide a tailwind.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s new leadership led by incoming president Xi Jinping
takes over in March, after pledging to cut lavish spending and
fight corruption. A crackdown on Macau junket operators can&#8217;t be
ruled out, Lantis Li, a Hong Kong-based gaming analyst at
Capital Securities Corp., said in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visitors Surge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macau received 994,192 visitors during the Golden Week
holiday from Feb. 10 through Feb. 16, with mainland Chinese
accounting for two-thirds of them, according to data published
by the tourist office on its website. The total represents a 21
percent jump from same holiday in January last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trends on the ground are very strong, certainly with
the mass market,&#8221; said Grant Govertsen, a Macau-based analyst
at Union Gaming. &#8220;Visitations and gaming levels are robust.&#8221;
Revenue will climb to as much as $44 billion this year, he said
in a Feb. 15 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring Chinese sovereign bonds against non-
payment using five-year credit-default swaps dropped four basis
points this month to 65 in New York yesterday, according to data
provider CMA. It touched 72 basis points on Feb. 4, the highest
since October. The contracts pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities should a borrower fail to
adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Resorts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yuan was little changed at 6.2424 per dollar as of
12:14 p.m. in Shanghai, according to China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.02
percent to 6.3265, after gaining 0.11 percent last week while
the onshore market was shut for the Lunar New Year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the government&#8217;s 10-year bonds was 3.60
percent yesterday, compared with 3.61 percent on Jan. 31. The
yield has climbed 25 basis points in the past six months as
growth in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy accelerated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wynn Macau Ltd. plans to invest $4 billion in a new resort
in Macau, which will add as many as 500 gaming tables, the
company said in June last year. MGM China Holdings will spend
$2.6 billion on its second casino resort in the gambling hub,
according to an October statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galaxy is allocating $2.1 billion to add 500 tables by 2015,
it said in April. A new round of expansion could start by early
2014 on Macau&#8217;s Cotai strip, costing as much as HK$50 billion
($6.4 billion), spokeswoman Yoko Ku said in an interview in
December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Casino Stocks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Industries Macau (China) Index of six gaming
stocks dropped 6.7 percent in the two days through Feb. 7. It
made up most of that decline by Feb. 15 before falling 3.8
percent so far this week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Galaxy&#8217;s stocks dropped 5.2 percent today, snapping a
three-day gain since trading resumed in Hong Kong after the
Lunar New Year. Melco shares declined 1.9 percent, following a
6.9 percent advance in the previous three days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The recent noise about possible regulatory changes may
reduce growth expectations, which has affected the share prices
but has less impact on credit,&#8221; Goldman&#8217;s Niaz said. Further
efforts to improve controls, transparency and fair practices
would be long-term positive for the market, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd., Australia&#8217;s
largest soft-drink bottler, posted full-year profit that missed
analyst estimates after taking A$146 million ($150 million) of
writedowns on its packaged food business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell 22 percent to A$460 million in 2012, the
Sydney-based Coke bottler said in a statement today. That
compares with the A$558 million average of nine analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profit before one-time charges
rose to the top of the company&#8217;s forecast of a four percent to
five percent growth rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imports of cheaper overseas produce and a 20 percent fall
in the price of fresh fruit forced a writedown at its SPC
Ardmona foods business, whose products include tinned tomatoes
and Goulburn Valley fruit in syrup, the company said. The
previous year&#8217;s profit included a A$60 million one-time gain
related to the sale of its beer venture to SABMiller Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The high Australian dollar continues to have an impact on
SPC, reducing its product&#8217;s competitiveness versus imports,&#8221;
Mark Christensen, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in Sydney, wrote
in a Feb. 5 note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil shares rose 1.7 percent to A$13.86 at
10:36 a.m. in Sydney. The stock has gained 17 percent in the
past year, trailing the 20 percent rise in the benchmark SP/ASX
200 index. The Coke bottler is 29 percent owned by the Coca-Cola
Co., the world&#8217;s biggest soft-drink maker, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Restructuring Charges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one-time items included a A$48 million writedown of
goodwill in the SPC Ardmona business and A$98 million in
restructuring charges as it cut the value of inventory to more
realistic selling prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our business is in the best shape ever,&#8221; Terry Davis,
managing director, told an investor briefing in Sydney. Coca-
Cola Amatil&#8217;s level of profit margin, which was 21 percent in
its Australian drinks business during the year, &#8220;are still seen
as the benchmark performance levels across the global Coke
system&#8221;, he said, referring to the group of companies that
bottle Coca-Cola&#8217;s concentrates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total revenue increased 6.3 percent to A$5.18 billion
during the period, while cost of goods sold -- the amount spent
on cans, bottles, soft-drink concentrate and other product
inputs -- was little changed at 56 percent of trading revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings before interest and tax in Australia rose 3.3
percent to A$627 million as the company increased sales volumes
in the face of discounting by Asahi Group Holdings Inc., the
Australian bottler of Pepsi and Schweppes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Indonesian Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia and Papua New Guinea posted a 17 percent rise in
Ebit to A$103 million, with volumes up 10 percent on the back of
strong performances from Minute Maid Pulpy juice, the company
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales from the unit would exceed A$1 billion during the
year, Davis said, and it would take up about A$200 million of
the A$420 million the company plans to spend on capital projects
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebit from New Zealand and Fiji fell 12 percent to A$70
million as New Zealand experienced a cool, wet summer and local
retailers reduced stock levels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley and JPMorgan Chase  Co. were chosen to compete to
handle the government&#8217;s sale of a stake in OAO Alrosa, the
world&#8217;s largest diamond miner by output, the Russian Economy
Ministry said in a statement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government plans to sell 7 percent of Alrosa, according
to a Feb. 5 statement by the nation&#8217;s property-management
agency. Alrosa, 51 percent owned by the Russian government,
accounts for one-quarter of global diamond production by&#160;value,
according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia is reviving efforts to reduce the government&#8217;s role
in the economy after Rosneft, Russia&#8217;s largest oil company,
agreed in October to take over TNK-BP, owned equally by London-
based BP Plc and a group of billionaires, for $54.8 billion in
the third-biggest petroleum acquisition. Russia raised 159.3
billion rubles ($5.3 billion) through the sale in August of 7.6
percent in OAO Sberbank, the nation&#8217;s largest lender. Other
companies earmarked for privatization this year include lender
VTB Group, shipper OAO Sovcomflot and Russian Railways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government wants to raise 260 billion rubles to 270
billion rubles from no fewer than eight asset sales in 2013, up
from an estimated 223 billion rubles this year, Economy Minister
Andrei Belousov said in televised remarks at a Cabinet meeting
in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are among 23
foreign and domestic banks selected to advise on a 1 trillion-
ruble, three-year asset sale program. The three banks, along
with Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG, helped advise on last
year&#8217;s Sberbank asset sale. Separately, New York-based Goldman
Sachs said this month it had been hired by the Kremlin to help
improve Russia&#8217;s image and attract more institutional investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alrosa, based in Mimy, Russia, and traded on the over-the-
counter market in Moscow, advanced 1.1 percent to 31.88 rubles.
The stock has gained 6.3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland had its first profit in the seven years since it opened as attractions such as Toy Story and Grizzly Gulch helped draw mainland Chinese visitors to the theme park. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The venture between Walt Disney Co. and the city&#8217;s government, made a profit of HK$109 million ($14 million) in the year ended September, compared with a loss of HK$237 million a year earlier, according to a statement yesterday. Walt Disney owns 48 percent of the park and the Hong Kong government holds 52 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland has been adding attractions to woo visitors from government-owned Ocean Park and to benefit from an increase in tourists from mainland China. It is still assessing the scale and timing for further expansion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are still negotiating with all the shareholders,&#8221; Managing Director Andrew Kam said at a press conference. &#8220;The expansion is a matter of when, how and what scale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fiscal-year sales rose 18 percent to HK$4.27 billion, according to the statement. Attendance climbed 13 percent to 6.73 million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;China Visitors &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland, which opened in September 2005, has also had to contend with the local Ocean Park, which had 7.1 million visitors in the fiscal year that ended in June, a 20 percent jump from a year ago. Ocean Park&#8217;s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, rose 49 percent to HK$505.4 million for the fiscal year and overall revenue reached HK$1.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both have benefited from visitors from China&#8217;s mainland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Total visitor arrivals to the former British colony rose 16 percent to 43.8 million for the first 11 months in 2012, with the number of tourists from the mainland climbing 24 percent to 31.4 million, according to provisional figures from the Hong Kong Tourism Board. Mainland visitors accounted for nearly 72 percent of the city&#8217;s total number of tourists. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walt Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, this month posted first-quarter earnings that beat analysts&#8217; estimates as the interactive unit registered its first profit and new theme-park attractions drew more visitors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Kit Chellel" date="Feb 18, 2013 10:22 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-18/ibm-u-k-staff-say-change-to-cover-pension-deficit-unfair.html"><headline>IBM U.K. Staff Say Change to Cover Pension Deficit Unfair</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. unfairly changed its U.K. pension plan in an effort to
reduce an 890 million-pound ($1.4 billion) deficit, according to
a lawsuit by workers who claim a breach of trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2009 changes, known within IBM as &#8220;Project Waltz,&#8221;
reduced retirement benefits for about 4,500 workers, lawyers for
some of the employees said in court documents setting out their
claim. In 2008, the pension plan went from a surplus to a
deficit as a result of stock market declines, IBM said in its
court papers from the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What IBM did not do, contrary to what it is accused of,
is either break any &#8216;promises&#8217; or renege on any &#8216;assurances,&#8217;&#8221;
the information technology company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s pension plans had a deficit of about $10.4 billion at
the end of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company altered the plans to make them more affordable and less
volatile, it said in the U.K. trial documents. The employees
argue in their court filings the pension losses were a result of
investing in equities, &#8220;the risks of which IBM had knowingly
and willingly embraced.&#8221; A trial on the group&#8217;s claim started
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the workers&#8217; lawsuit, Project Waltz closed to
most employees the company&#8217;s defined benefit plan, which
delivers set payments during retirement; changed early
retirement terms; and stopped plan members benefitting from pay
increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said its pension trustee refused to enact the Project
Waltz changes until a court ruled on their legality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Perhaps Unsurprisingly&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The changes proved to be, perhaps unsurprisingly,
unpopular with many of the affected members,&#8221; the company said.
Its U.K. business was &#8220;uncompetitive&#8221; and the Armonk, New
York-based company set a goal to increase profit margins there
to 34 percent by the end of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Young, a lawyer for the employees taking part in the
trial, declined to comment. IBM&#8217;s U.K. spokesman Ken Saunders

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. investor Audley
Capital Advisors LLP plans to nominate five candidates for the
board of the metallurgical-coal producer, which it says lacks
&#8220;consistent&#8221; leadership and hasn&#8217;t done enough to curb costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter has had four chief executive officers in the last
five years and has a &#8220;stale and out-of-depth&#8221; board, London-
based Audley said today in a statement. The mining company&#8217;s
production growth and cost-reduction efforts have been
disappointing, Audley said. Walter should have used more equity
to fund its 2011 takeover of Western Coal Corp., Audley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we see as poor financial and strategic judgment by
the current board has weighed heavily on the company and
prevented it from creating value for its shareholders,&#8221; Audley
co-founder and Managing Partner Julian Treger said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audley previously called for change at Walter in July 2011,
when it said the Birmingham, Alabama-based company should
explore a sale because it lacked the leadership to take
advantage of an &#8220;unprecedented market opportunity&#8221; after coal
prices jumped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter had completed its acquisition of Western Coal in
April 2011 for C$5.3 billion ($5.2 billion) including debt.
Keith Calder resigned as CEO two months later after telling the
board he had differing opinions concerning &#8220;management
philosophy.&#8221; Current CEO Walter J. Scheller III was appointed
September 2011, replacing interim CEO Joseph B. Leonard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Discussions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter rose 5.4 percent to $39.96 at the close in New York.
The shares have dropped 39 percent in the past 12 months, while
the Stowe Global Coal Index declined 29 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audley hasn&#8217;t discussed its proposed slate of directors
with Walter, the coal company said today in a statement. Walter
said it&#8217;s &#8220;fully committed to creating value for all
shareholders through the successful execution of the company&#8217;s
strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter also said in a separate statement that it appointed
Mary R. Henderson, managing partner at consulting company
Henderson Advisory, as an independent director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audley&#8217;s latest suggestions are more specific and
actionable than what it said in July 2011, said Lucas Pipes, a
New York-based analyst at Brean Capital LLC, said today by
telephone. Pipes has a hold rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audley&#8217;s proposed nominees include Treger; Eddie Scholtz, a
former executive at BHP Billiton Ltd. and CIC Energy Corp.; Mark Lochtenberg, chairman of Australia&#8217;s Cockatoo Coal Ltd. and a
former co-head of Glencore International Plc&#8217;s coal business;
Robert Stan, the former CEO of Canada&#8217;s Grande Cache Coal Corp.;
and Lawrence Clark Jr., CEO of closely held U.S. coal company JW
Resources Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of metallurgical coal has declined after a
slowdown in demand from Chinese steelmakers. Asian buyers are
paying $165 a ton for the raw material in the current quarter,
30 percent lower than a year earlier, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exchanges and clearing firms would
have to routinely test their technology for stability and
security under a rule being drafted by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Chairman Elisse B. Walter told an audience at American
University&#8217;s Washington College of Law today that the agency has
accelerated a proposal for a mandatory technology-review
program. It would require market participants, including
exchanges, clearing firms and other trading platforms, to test
how their systems respond to outages and notify the agency about
any disruptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule would convert a voluntary program, known as
Automation Review Policy, that was created after the Oct. 16,
1987, market crash known as &#8220;Black Monday.&#8221; Under that
program, exchanges voluntarily follow SEC guidance and submit to
periodic SEC inspections of their systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A voluntary standard is no substitute for a mandate and a
requirement that you must follow,&#8221; Walter told reporters after
the speech. She declined to say when the SEC might release a
rule proposal for public comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter&#8217;s speech surveyed the SEC&#8217;s efforts to improve its
technology in an era of high-frequency traders and electronic
market makers. The commission&#8217;s Midas database and planned
consolidated audit trail are key to that effort, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Complex Plumbing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated audit trail will trace how orders are
routed through the equity market&#8217;s complex plumbing. Midas will
allow the commission to view all orders, order cancellations and
trade executions on U.S. exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the SEC has said the Midas data will help it
reconstruct the causes of market crashes, Walter said today that
it could also inform how new regulations are written. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC staff will likely use Midas to analyze the practice of
offering quotes and then quickly canceling them. The exercise
could provide a &#8220;clearer picture&#8221; about the impact of a
potential rule requiring high-frequency traders to maintain a
quote to buy or sell a security for a minimum amount of time,
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission is considering publicly releasing the
studies it performs using Midas data, Walter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whatever the data reveals, the SEC will have a
substantially deeper understanding of where and how we should
and can act to make the markets more stable for investors,&#8221; she
said during the speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency also is developing models to identify suspicious
financial results in routine public filings. In addition, a new
tool will electronically scope public companies&#8217; written
disclosures for irregularities, Walter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Through this model we hope to be able to more quickly
identify &#8216;earnings management&#8217; -&#8211; which is a nice way of saying
manipulative or even fraudulent accounting practices,&#8221; she
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest energy company by market value, said new shale projects
in the U.S. and heavy-oil developments in Canada helped swell
crude and natural gas reserves last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon added reserves equivalent to 1.8 billion barrels in
2012, raising its year-end total to 25.2 billion, the Irving,
Texas-based company said in statement today. The additions were
enough to replace 115 percent of total output and 174 percent of
its crude and liquids production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company returns to having more than half of its
reserves in liquids, instead of gas. At the end of 2012, the
company&#8217;s reserves were comprised of 51 percent liquids, such as
crude, and 49 percent gas, according to the statement, a
reversal of 2011&#8217;s percentages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-fourths of the new reserves resulted from discoveries
and re-evaluations of existing fields in the Woodford shale in
Oklahoma, the Bakken formation in North Dakota, and the Cold
Lake and Hebron developments in Canada, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon rose 1.1 cents to $89.32 at the close in New York.
The shares have increased 3.2 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Earle and Don Jeffrey" date="Feb 19, 2013  3:23 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-19/exxonmobil-didn-t-have-to-use-mtbe-oil-executive-says.html"><headline>ExxonMobil Didn&#8217;t Have to Use MTBE, Oil Executive Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Oil companies didn&#8217;t have to add
MTBE to gasoline to meet federal pollution standards, two
witnesses told a New Hampshire jury that will weigh whether
ExxonMobil Corp. is liable for contaminating the state&#8217;s
drinking water with the chemical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duane Bordvick, who worked as an executive at oil refiner
Tosco Corp., said in videotaped testimony played today in state
court in Concord that his company made MTBE-free gasoline in
California that met U.S. Clean Air Act requirements as early as
1999. Bruce Burke, an oil refinery expert, testified that there
were alternatives to adding the chemical, methyl tertiary butyl
ether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Refiners could have used ethanol instead of MTBE back in
the &#8217;80s when decisions were being made,&#8221; Burke, a senior vice
president of consulting for Nexant Inc., told the jury today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire might seek more than $200 million from
ExxonMobil, the last defendant on trial in a lawsuit filed in
2003. ExxonMobil has argued that it isn&#8217;t liable for damages
because it used MTBE to comply with federal regulations, which
pre-empt state law. MTBE was used to make gasoline burn more
thoroughly to reduce air pollution, as required under the 1990
Clean Air Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil has said in court that ethanol wasn&#8217;t a good
choice because there wasn&#8217;t enough of it when the government
required an additive. The Irving, Texas-based company has also
argued that New Hampshire was aware of the risks of MTBE when it
agreed to participate in a federal clean-air program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highly Soluble &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE is highly soluble in water and can be carried great
distances from where it is leaked. It leaked from gas stations,
junkyards, underground storage tanks and pipe fittings,
according to the state, which banned the additive as of January
2007. Bordvick said Tosco made MTBE-free gasoline because of
evidence that the additive could harm groundwater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We wanted to demonstrate that, should regulations change
to allow everyone to do this, it could be done,&#8221; Bordvick said.
&#8220;There were significant monies to be spent, but it was
doable.&#8221; Tosco is now a unit of ConocoPhillips Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire has said that it could cost about
$818 million to test, monitor and clean its groundwater. It&#8217;s
seeking damages based on the number of contaminated wells and on
ExxonMobil&#8217;s market share of gasoline sold in the state during
the period covered by the lawsuit. Based on an estimate that the
company&#8217;s share was about 30 percent, New Hampshire could ask
the jury for an award of $245 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cleanup Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has received $213 million from oil companies for
two cleanup funds since 1989 through a 1.5 cent-a-gallon fee on
all gasoline imported into in the state. The funds have
$4 million left, the state said in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citgo Petroleum Corp., the other remaining defendant in the
New Hampshire case when trial began, filed a $16 million
settlement agreement with the state on Feb. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides ExxonMobil and Citgo, New Hampshire also sued Shell
Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips, Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA
and Hess Corp. All settled before the trial began except
ExxonMobil and Citgo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state received more than $100 million in settlements
from defendants before Citgo settled, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire&#8217;s suit is one of scores of cases involving
MTBE filed since 2000 against oil refiners, fuel distributors
and chemical makers. MTBE lawsuits have been consolidated in
federal court in New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and
motions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York
City $104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells
in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire trial began Jan. 14. The state said it
expects to rest Feb. 21. ExxonMobil would then present its case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is New Hampshire v. Hess Corp., 03-C-0550, New
Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Skype unit, which
includes Lync software for corporate instant messaging and
Internet calling, is approaching $2 billion in annual sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The division is getting close to the size of Microsoft&#8217;s
SharePoint business, which focuses on tools that help employees
collaborate, according to Giovanni Mezgec, a general manager in
the Skype division. SharePoint will bring in more than $2
billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, Microsoft said
in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has 5 million
users for Lync, its Internet-calling product for companies.
That&#8217;s up from 3 million 14 months ago, Mezgec said. Microsoft
wants to sell more Lync software to corporations to catch up
with Cisco Systems Inc. in the market for Internet telephony and
communications, which Forrester Research Inc. predicts will be
worth $14.5 billion in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, paid $8.5
billion to buy Skype in 2011 to add the most popular Web-calling
service, targeted at consumers. Skype had about $800 million in
sales when Microsoft acquired the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 100 largest companies, by Fortune magazine&#8217;s
ranking, 90 are Lync customers, Mezgec said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By June, Lync users will be able to connect to Skype for
telephony, instant messaging, and to see whether contacts are
online, according to a blog post by Skype President Tony Bates,
who is speaking today at a Lync conference in San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile versions of Lync for Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone and
Apple Inc.&#8217;s iOS will be available early next month. An
application for Google Inc.&#8217;s Android smartphones is planned for
a month later, Bates said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. said its free
Outlook.com Web-based e-mail service has gained 60 million
active users in its first six months, with a third of those
switching from Google Inc.&#8217;s Gmail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had expected it to take a year to reach that
level of usage and it took Gmail two years to get there,
Dharmesh Mehta, a senior director for Outlook.com, said in an
interview. A third of active users are Gmail customers now using
Outlook.com as their primary free e-mail account, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While free e-mail isn&#8217;t a huge money-maker -- Mehta said
Outlook.com carries about 60 percent fewer advertisements than
Microsoft&#8217;s previous Hotmail product -- the Redmond, Washington-
based company considers it critical to gaining and retaining
consumers. Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, has
been losing users of its Windows operating system to smartphones
and tablets such as Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlook.com, accessed mainly via Web browsers, shares the
brand name with Microsoft&#8217;s e-mail, contacts and calendar
program, part of the Office suite of software installed on
personal computers running Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software has been in preview since July 31. Microsoft
is releasing the final version today, with features mostly
unchanged. Outlook.com works on Windows-based machines, as well
as Apple&#8217;s. There&#8217;s also an application for devices running
Google&#8217;s Android mobile-operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote the service, Microsoft is beginning what Mehta
says is the biggest-ever advertising campaign for an e-mail
product, spending &#8220;tens of millions&#8221; of dollars on U.S.
television, online, print and bus ads to market Outlook.com. The
company will also run TV ads in Europe in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also begin moving customers to Outlook.com
from its Hotmail service, Mehta said. Microsoft will initially
encourage Hotmail users to switch before moving them permanently
by the end of the first half. While Hotmail users can keep their
old e-mail addresses, they will use the new Outlook.com
interface, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Corp. challenged New
Hampshire&#8217;s assertion that it sold about 30 percent of the
gasoline containing an additive that contaminated the state&#8217;s
drinking water, a jury was told. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justine Hastings, an economics professor at Brown
University, testified for the state today in New Hampshire that
she used tax records and company reports to the government to
determine how much gasoline ExxonMobil sold there from 1988 to
2005. The state expects to use market share information in
seeking damages if the company is found liable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire said it could cost about $818 million to
test, monitor and clean up its groundwater. Based on its market
share estimate of 30 percent for ExxonMobil, it might ask the
jury for an award of $245 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-examining Hastings, ExxonMobil lawyer Deborah Barnard
said she should have used refinery data for the market share
estimate instead of the methods she used. Barnard reminded her
that when questioned by lawyers before the trial she had said
refinery information was a possible method of calculation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hastings said in court she provided a refinery-data
estimate of 6.9 percent for the jury to look at, then rejected
that figure because it didn&#8217;t accurately represent market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gasoline is co-mingled, and it can&#8217;t be traced from a
refinery to an endpoint,&#8221; Hastings said. &#8220;If you tried to
measure how many molecules come from a refinery to an endpoint,
there&#8217;s no data to base that measurement on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Federal Regulations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil has argued in court that it isn&#8217;t liable for
damage because it added methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, to
gasoline to comply with federal regulations, which pre-empt
state law. Oil companies added MTBE to make gasoline burn more
thoroughly in order to reduce air pollution, as required under
the 1990 Clean Air Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In testimony for the state yesterday, Duane Bordvick, who
worked at oil refiner Tosco Corp., said his company made MTBE-
free gasoline in California that met Clean Air Act requirements
as early as 1999. Tosco is now a unit of ConocoPhillips (COP) Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Burke, an oil refinery expert, testified that ethanol
could have been used in place of MTBE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Refiners could have used ethanol instead of MTBE back in
the 80s when decisions were being made,&#8221; Burke, a senior vice
president of consulting for Nexant Inc., said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Engine Damage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil lawyer William Stack said ethanol wasn&#8217;t a good
choice as a gasoline additive because at that time it wasn&#8217;t in
adequate enough supply and also because it caused damage to
engines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has also argued that the state was aware of the
risks of MTBE when it agreed to participate in a federal clean-
air program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE, which New Hampshire banned as of January 2007,
is highly soluble in water and can be carried great distances
from where it leaked. It leaked from gas stations, vehicle
junkyards, underground storage tanks and pipe fittings, the
state said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil is the last defendant in the state&#8217;s case. Citgo
Petroleum Corp. filed a $16 million settlement agreement with
the state on Feb. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire had received more than $100 million in
settlements from defendants before Citgo settled, according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suits Consolidated &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides ExxonMobil and Citgo, New Hampshire also sued Shell
Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips, Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA
and Hess Corp. All settled before the trial began except
ExxonMobil and Citgo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of scores of cases involving MTBE filed since
2000 against oil refiners, fuel distributors and chemical
makers. MTBE lawsuits have been consolidated in federal court in
New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and motions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York
City $104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Bear Stearns
unit asked a federal judge to throw out a regulator&#8217;s lawsuit
that claims it used misleading documents to sell $3.6 billion in
mortgage-backed securities to credit unions that later failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns, in papers filed yesterday with the U.S. court
in Kansas City, Kansas, contends that the National Credit Union
Administration board is unfairly blaming the bank because the
credit unions took widely known risks that eventually
&#8220;backfired.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite warnings from the offering documents, the news
media and even the board itself, the credit unions made the
informed decision to plunge the majority of their assets into
residential mortgage-backed securities at the height of the
housing bubble,&#8221; Bear Stearns said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ignoring its own assessment of what actually happened,
the board now seeks to blame defendants for the credit union&#8217;s
losses,&#8221; the company argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCUA, an Alexandria, Virginia-based independent federal
agency, is responsible for recovering losses to minimize the
costs to its industry-paid stabilization fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Fairbanks, an NCUA spokesman, declined to comment on
the Bear Stearns filing, saying the agency doesn&#8217;t comment on
pending litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regulator&#8217;s Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency sued the JPMorgan Chase unit in December, acting
as liquidator of the U.S. Central Federal Credit Union and the
Western Corporate Federal Credit Union, each of which were
placed into conservatorship in 2009 and into involuntary
liquidation a year later, as well as the Southwest Corporate
Federal Credit Union and Members United Corporate Federal Credit
Union, which were placed in conservatorship, then liquidation,
in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns&#8217;s offering documents said originators of the
underlying mortgages had adhered to underwriting guidelines that
had, in reality, been &#8220;systematically abandoned,&#8221; making the
investments riskier than represented, NCUA said in its
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) acquired Bear Stearns in 2008. The
regulator separately sued the New York-based bank as successor
in interest to Washington Mutual Bank and has eight other cases
pending against defendants including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
and investment banking units of Barclays Plc (BARC) and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital Inc. in November asked the court to
dismiss the claims it faced, claiming they were filed too late.
RBS Securities Inc. is appealing an adverse ruling last year by
a federal judge in Topeka, Kansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns, arguing a federal appeals court ruling in the
RBS case could address issues in the suit it faces, asked U.S.
District Judge J. Thomas Marten to consider suspending the case
until the Denver-based court rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is National Credit Union Administration Board v.
Bear Stearns  Co., 12-cv-2781, U.S. District Court, District of
Kansas (Kansas City). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. is seeking to
sell securities tied to new U.S. home loans without government
backing in its first offering since the financial crisis that
the debt helped trigger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal may close this month, according to a person
familiar with the discussions. Servicers of the underlying loans
may include the New York-based lender, First Republic Bank and
Johnson Bank, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because terms aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for so-called non-agency mortgage securities is
reviving as the Federal Reserve&#8217;s $85 billion a month of bond
purchases help push investors to seek potentially higher
returns. As deals accelerate, Pacific Investment Management Co.
is questioning the prices paid. At the same time, a weakening of
contract clauses that offer protection to investors if the loans
don&#8217;t match their promised quality is stoking debate, said Kroll
Bond Rating Agency analyst Glenn Costello. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a pretty heavy dialogue going on right now
between all participants in the market about what makes sense,&#8221;
Costello, who is based in New York, said last week in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the bank&#8217;s potential transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Redwood Offerings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redwood Trust Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG, the only
non-agency issuers since the market collapsed in 2008, have also
been working on deals this month. Redwood created $1.1 billion
of the debt in January, after issuance tied to new loans totaled
$3.5 billion in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with less than $1 billion in all of 2010 and 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds have been backed by so-called prime jumbo loans,
which are larger than allowed in government-supported programs.
For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans with the lowest costs for
borrowers using 20 percent down payments, limits range from
$417,000 to $625,500 in high-cost areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is telling investors its deal&#8217;s terms may allow
some of the so-called representations and warranties about the
mortgages from originators or itself to expire after 36 months
to 60 months, the person said. Such contract clauses, which can
be used to force loan repurchases, have led to billions of
dollars of costs for banks on debt made during the housing boom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Credit Suisse included so-called sunsets of 36 months
on certain buyback promises in a November deal, Standard 
Poor&#8217;s, the only grader to rate the bonds, said in a statement
that the move didn&#8217;t affect its view of the debt&#8217;s risks. The
ratings firm cited the &#8220;exceptionally high credit quality&#8221; of
the loans and that all of them had been reviewed by third-party
firms before being packaged into the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Skeptical View &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivals including Fitch Ratings, which publicly called SP&#8217;s
grades too high, are taking a more skeptical view. Changes such
as sunset provisions and clauses that void loan-quality
warranties if borrowers default after events such as job losses
or illness generally should require greater so-called credit
enhancement, said Rui Pereira, a managing director at Fitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit enhancement can include some bonds taking losses
before others, cash reserves or payments from the underlying
assets that exceed coupons on the securities created. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Less investor-friendly provisions are something we need
to take into account,&#8221; Pereira said last week in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Gold Standard&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuers are seeking to move past a framework for
representations and warranties provided by Redwood that
represented a &#8220;gold standard,&#8221; Kathryn Kelbaugh, a senior
analyst at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, said last month during a
panel discussion at a securitization conference in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Redwood&#8217;s latest deal, it may sell a top-rated class as
large as $561.2 million with a 2.5 percent coupon at about 102
cents on the dollar, a person familiar with that offering said
today, asking not to be named because terms aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That compares with current prices of about 99 cents on the
dollar for Fannie Mae-guaranteed 2.5 percent securities,
according to Bloomberg data. Bonds issued in recent months by
Redwood have been &#8220;insanely expensive&#8221; by comparison with
Fannie Mae debt, Pimco&#8217;s Scott Simon said in an interview
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe someone would pay anywhere near where
they have sold them,&#8221; said Simon, the mortgage-bond head at
Newport Beach, California-based Pimco, manager of the world&#8217;s
largest mutual fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher prices being discussed may signal bond buyers
are gambling that the larger loans will remain outstanding for
shorter periods if mortgage rates continue to rise, and also
suggest that investors are looking past the potentially greater
default risks of Redwood&#8217;s securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealthier homeowners may find it relatively easy to absorb
the costs of moving amid higher borrowing costs, said David Land, a mortgage-bond manager at Advantus Capital Management
Inc., who said he&#8217;s not investing in the deal because he sees
too many of the loans as having risky features. By paying
premiums more than face value, bondholders would also risk being
damaged by homeowner refinancing if rates drop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wix.com Inc., an Israeli provider of
online tools that help people create websites, chose JPMorgan
Chase  Co. to lead its initial public offering in the U.S.,
according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wix, based in Tel Aviv, will seek about $75 million in the
offering, said the people, who asked not to be named because the
plans are private. Caesarstone Sdot Yam Ltd. was the last
Israeli company to list in New York, raising $84.25 million in
its IPO a year ago. The maker of quartz-based countertops led
gains on the Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of the largest
Israeli companies in the U.S. yesterday, jumping 7.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2006, Wix joins Kamada Ltd., which makes medical
treatments, and software developer Babylon Ltd. among Israeli
companies looking to list in the U.S., after Caesarstone&#8217;s 127
percent surge since its March debut made it the second-most
successful foreign IPO in New York. The 24-stock Israeli-US
measure has rallied 3.1 percent in 2013, while the Nasdaq
Composite Index has gained 6.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The appetite for IPOs is strong,&#8221; Linda Killian,
portfolio manager of the Renaissance Global IPO Plus Aftermarket
Fund, which has about $10 million in assets, said by phone
yesterday. &#8220;There&#8217;s tremendous demand for tech deals, except
they need to have a differentiated product and be able to show
growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renaissance Global holds shares of Caesarstone and
SodaStream International Ltd., the Airport City, Israel-based
maker of home soda machines that debuted on U.S. markets in
2010. SodaStream has rallied 162 percent since its offering.
Renaissance&#8217;s IPO Plus Aftermarket fund has returned 14 percent
in 2013 and beaten 99 percent of its peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online Platform &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Israel-US index rose 1.1 percent to 89.04
yesterday, climbing for the first time in four trading days.
Israel&#8217;s benchmark TA-25 Index added 1.4 percent to 1,241.90 in
Tel Aviv. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wix runs an online platform that allows people to create
web pages without the need for computer-programming skills,
according to the company&#8217;s website. Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman
for JPMorgan, declined to comment when contacted by e-mail
yesterday. Michael Eisenberg, a Wix board member and partner at
Benchmark Capital, the venture-capital firm that invested in Wix
in 2010, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamada, based in Nes Ziona, Israel, hired Morgan Stanley
and Jefferies Group Inc. to arrange the sale of as much as $50
million of stock in the U.S., a person familiar with the plans
said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babylon, which has lost 3.2 percent in Tel Aviv this year
through yesterday, will seek to raise $115 million in a New York
IPO, Chief Executive Officer Alon Carmeli said Jan. 9. Babylon
gained 2.7 percent to 21.16 shekels, or $5.78, in Tel Aviv
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slow 2012 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli companies have sold $417 million of stock in IPOs
globally over the past two years, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Caesarstone was the only Israeli company to undertake an
IPO in 2012, making it the slowest year for initial share sales
since 2009, when D-Pharm Ltd. raised $6.47 million in Tel Aviv,
the only IPO that year, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bessemer Venture Partners and Mangrove Capital Partners SA
invested in Wix in 2007, according to the company&#8217;s website,
while Insight Venture Partners and DAG Ventures LP invested in
2011, the website shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Bloomberg News" date="Feb 20, 2013 10:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-20/coca-cola-says-all-products-sold-to-consumers-in-china-are-safe.html"><headline>Coca-Cola Says All Products Sold to Consumers in China Are Safe</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, said that all of its products sold in China
are safe, after local media reported some imported items failed
to meet Chinese quality standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some products, including fruit and vegetable juice
concentrates that Coca-Cola imported into China late last year,
were destroyed due to chemical contents or returned, the
Chinese-language Economic Daily reported on its website today,
citing the nation&#8217;s quality regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The items were imported as research samples and have no
impact on Coca-Cola products sold to local consumers, Sharolyn
Choy, a Singapore-based company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed
response to Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juice concentrates were &#8220;incorrectly tagged&#8221; and two
cases of Sokenbicha, a Japanese blended tea brand owned by Coca-
Cola, were returned due to lack of necessary documents for
customs clearance, Choy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Elizabeth Dexheimer" date="Feb 20, 2013  9:04 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-20/jpmorgan-leads-u-s-banks-lending-least-of-deposits-in-5-years.html"><headline>JPMorgan Leads U.S. Banks Lending Least Deposits in 5 Years</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup Inc. are lending the smallest portion of their deposits in five years as cash floods in from savers and a slow economy damps demand from borrowers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average loan-to-deposit ratio for the top eight commercial banks fell to 84 percent in the fourth quarter from 87 percent a year earlier and 101 percent in 2007, according to data compiled by Credit Suisse Group AG. Lending as a proportion of deposits dropped at five of the banks and was unchanged at two, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consumers and companies are reluctant to take on risk until they see more signs that business is improving, even as the Federal Reserve maintains near-record low interest rates designed to fuel growth. Putting more of the unused money to work could boost profit and help turn around the U.S. economy, whose 0.1 percent annualized drop in the fourth quarter was its worst showing since 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to see sustainable economic activity before lending picks up,&#8221; said Paul Miller, an analyst who follows the industry at FBR Capital Markets Corp. Until then, banks will be stuck with idle cash, Miller said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no place for them to put it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bankers are also holding back as regulators and investors pressure them to curtail risks that fueled the 2008 global credit crisis. They&#8217;re facing a barrage of new federal rules and capital requirements that require them to hold more funds in reserve and evaluate borrowers more stringently, amid concern that loans made at current rates may turn into losers when more normal levels return. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithuania&#8217;s energy minister publicly
restated support for Chevron Corp&#8217;s plans to explore for shale
gas in the country following criticism of the project from a
parliamentary committee earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy Minister Jaroslav Neverovic backed the project after
meeting today with the head of Chevron&#8217;s Lithuanian
representative office, the ministry in Vilnius said on its
website. A parliamentary committee on Feb. 6 called for a
moratorium on the project and an investigation into the local
company that is 50 percent-owned by Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, a U.S. energy company, last year bought 50 percent
of LL Investicijos and in January submitted the only bid in a
tender for shale-gas exploration rights in Lithuania. The Baltic
country wants to join Poland and Ukraine and lower energy costs
and dependence on Russian supplies by turning to shale gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government has committed itself to undertake shale-
gas exploration and, in the future, after suitable preparations,
to consider the issue of production,&#8221; Neverovic said. &#8220;We have
to support new innovative opportunities to reduce the cost of
the energy resources we consume.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investments by Chevron would also create jobs and give
Lithuania access to new technologies and other know-how,
Neverovic said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has pledged to abide by the highest environmental
and safety standards in its work, and to engage in active dialog
with any social groups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BG Group Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s third-
largest oil and natural gas producer, is working with Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. as it considers selling pipelines and other
equipment at its Australian liquefied natural gas project, said
two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BG is studying the sale of assets around the plant on
Curtis Island in Queensland state, the people said, asking not
to be identified as the details are private. The infrastructure
around the project includes a 540-kilometer (336-mile) pipeline
to carry coal seam gas from Surat Basin to the processing plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reading, U.K.-based explorer is trying to balance
record capital spending on fields from Australia to Brazil with
lower-than-expected oil and gas production. The company this
month said it is targeting $8.1 billion of asset sales by the
end of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman at QGC, BG&#8217;s Brisbane-based unit, referred
questions to the company&#8217;s headquarters in London. Hayley
Morris, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Sydney, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BG plans to build two processing units at the plant near
Curtis Island, more than 300 kilometers north of Brisbane, with
a combined capacity of 8.5 million metric tons of LNG a year.
The facility is due to start fuel shipments next year, the
company has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BG said in May the cost for building the project, which
will convert coal-seam gas to LNG for shipment to overseas
markets, had jumped 36 percent to $20.4 billion because of gains
in the Australian dollar and rising labor expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China National Offshore Oil Corp. in November agreed to pay
$1.93 billion to increase its stake in the LNG project to 50
percent from 10 percent. The deal also included a contract for
BG to supply the Chinese company with 5 million metric tons a
year of LNG for 20 years, starting in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) named Jose de Menezes Berenguer Neto, once a contender to run Banco Santander
SA&#8217;s Brazil unit, to succeed Claudio Berquo as head of its own
business there, said two people with knowledge of the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berenguer will relinquish the money-management role he has
held since March at JPMorgan&#8217;s private-equity and hedge-fund
unit, Gavea Investimentos Ltda., said the people, who asked to
not be identified because the appointment wasn&#8217;t announced.
Gavea was founded by former Brazil central banker Arminio Fraga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berenguer, who previously led Banco Santander Brasil (BSBR)&#8217;s
retail, asset-management and private banking businesses, will
become chief executive officer of a JPMorgan unit that ranks as
Brazil&#8217;s 15th-largest bank by assets, with 32 billion reais
($16.2 billion). Berquo was named to the CEO post in November
2009, overseeing the operation with about 700 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on the moves, and
there was no response to calls and e-mails to Berquo and
Berenguer. Brazilian columnists Sonia Racy, from Estado de S.
Paulo, and Lauro Jardim, from Veja, reported Berenguer&#8217;s
appointment earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berenguer, who had prior experience in investment banking
and corporate finance, took on Santander Brasil&#8217;s retail
business in March 2011 in what was supposed to be a step toward
replacing then-CEO Fabio Barbosa, people familiar with the
matter said last year. That plan was later abandoned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Grocers Association
said its board voted to opt out of a multibillion-dollar
antitrust settlement with Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) over
merchant fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association, based in Arlington, Virginia, said today
in a statement that its board made the unanimous decision this
month to drop out of the deal, which would settle a lawsuit on
behalf of retailers nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord, totaling as much as $7.25 billion, was
announced in July. Some large retailers and trade associations
have said the settlement is too generous to card companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The NGA Board carefully considered not only what is in
the best interests of the retailers and wholesalers it serves
but also all other merchants who will be adversely affected by
the proposed settlement,&#8221; NGA President and Chief Executive
Officer Peter J. Larkin said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association said it will formally object to the deal
and will urge its 1,200 member companies to opt out and object. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, based Foster City, California, and Purchase, New
York-based MasterCard agreed to settle the case to resolve the
almost eight-year-long legal battle over interchange fees, which
are charged to merchants when customers pay with credit cards.
The settlement received tentative approval from a federal judge
in Brooklyn, New York in November. A hearing on final approval
is set for Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,

&lt;p&gt;American Express Co. (AXP), the biggest
U.S. credit-card issuer by customer spending, named former
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Chief Executive Officer
Samuel J. Palmisano and former Areva (AREVA) SA chief Anne Lauvergeon to
its board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two were chosen for business expertise and leadership
experience, AmEx Chairman and CEO Kenneth I. Chenault said today
in statements from the New York-based company. The appointments
are effective March 1, AmEx said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano, 61, was CEO of IBM from 2003 to 2011 and joined
the Armonk, New York-based company in 1973. He was chairman of
IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, from
January through September 2012 and continued to advise the
company until his retirement last December. He also serves on
the board of Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), based in Irving, Texas, and
ranked as the world&#8217;s biggest refiner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauvergeon, 53, is a partner and managing director of
Efficiency Capital, an investment firm that focuses on energy,
technologies, and natural resources, according to AmEx. She
previously worked at Alcatel-Lucent, as well as Lazard Fr&#232;res 
Cie, according the statement. In 1999, Lauvergeon was named
chairman and CEO of Cogema, which was later formed into Paris-
based Areva, serving as CEO from 2001 to 2011, AmEx said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
is the largest shareholder in American Express, has praised
Palmisano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IBM&#8217;s Prominence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former IBM CEO Lou Gerstner and Palmisano &#8220;did a superb
job in moving IBM from near-bankruptcy twenty years ago to its
prominence today,&#8221; Buffett wrote in a letter to shareholders
last year explaining his bet on the computer-services company.
&#8220;Their operational accomplishments were truly extraordinary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauvergeon and Palmisano are additions to the board. AmEx
directors may not stand for re-election after age 72, according
to the company&#8217;s 2012 proxy statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AmEx&#8217;s board had 12 members last year including Care
Capital LLC founder Jan C. Leschly and Phoenix House Foundation
Inc. founder Edward D Miller, whose age was listed as 71 in the
regulatory filing. AmEx hasn&#8217;t announced retirements of Leschly
or Miller. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks may enter a &#8220;significant correction&#8221; after they trailed developed-nation shares this year, according to JPMorgan  Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fundamentals and technicals are weakening,&#8221; Adrian Mowat, the chief Asia and emerging-market strategist at JPMorgan, wrote in a report dated yesterday. He recommended options that protect against stock losses and advised selling equities that are most sensitive to market swings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) fell 1.4 percent to 1,053.14 in New York, the biggest drop in seven months, erasing its gain for the year. About 62 percent of companies in the gauge that reported earnings for the quarter ended Dec. 31 missed analysts&#8217; estimates, compared with 34 percent for the MSCI World Index (MXWO), which has climbed 4.4 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Concern that Chinese policy makers will pare back monetary stimulus is weighing on the country&#8217;s bank stocks, while South Korean exporters are getting hurt by the won&#8217;s strength and South African shares have slipped amid mining-related disputes, Mowat said. At the same time, Japanese equities are surging on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&#8217;s stimulus efforts and U.S. shares are benefiting from takeovers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Country Recommendations &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see no near-term changes to these conditions, hence we fear emerging markets may continue to underperform and be a funding source for Japan,&#8221; Mowat wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shrinking liquidity in China, heavier state intervention in key emerging-market economies and a dearth of good stock ideas are the main reasons for being bearish, according to John-Paul Smith, an emerging-markets strategist at Deutsche Bank AG in London. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am forecasting a 10 to 15 percent decline in absolute terms for emerging markets this year and more in terms of relative performance against the U.S.,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;This is the year when people finally realize that actually the sustainable rate of growth in China going forward is much lower than they currently think.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong-based Mowat&#8217;s outlook contrasts with that of Bank of America Corp., which said on Feb. 19 that investors should buy emerging-market equities and bonds as economic growth improves in the so-called BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China. Price targets for shares in the MSCI emerging- market index suggest the gauge will advance about 13 percent in the next 12 months to 1,195, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Earnings Valuation &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The measure trades for 10.5 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with a multiple of 13.7 for the MSCI World, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) climbed 10 percent in 2013 through yesterday amid optimism that a weaker yen and increased government spending will lead the country out of deflation. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 6 percent in the period as Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) and 3G Capital agreed to buy H.J. Heinz Co. for about $23 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emerging-market investors should favor &#8220;quality&#8221; companies with high return on equity, Mowat said. He has overweight recommendations on shares in Turkey, India, Mexico, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Peru, meaning positions should exceed the nations&#8217; representation in benchmark indexes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mowat predicted in November 2011 that the MSCI emerging index would reach 1,150 by the end of 2012. The gauge touched 1,085 in February 2012 and ended the year at 1,055.20. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;China, India &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index retreated 2.2 percent today, erasing its 2013 advance, after China&#8217;s government told local authorities to curb real estate speculation and the central bank drained cash from the financial system. The SP BSE India Index (SENSEX) also turned negative for the year after a 1.6 percent drop today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developing-nation shares fell today after Federal Reserve meeting minutes sparked concern the U.S. may curtail stimulus and Belle International Holdings Ltd. (1880), China&#8217;s biggest footwear retailer, lead a tumble in retailers. Hong Kong-based Belle plunged a record 17 percent to HK$15.28 after saying in a filing last night that its 2012 net income will &#8220;fall within the lower end&#8221; of analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The MSCI emerging market index gained 15 percent in 2012, compared with 13 percent in the SP benchmark, as the Fed&#8217;s increase in asset purchases and the European Central Bank&#8217;s pledge to keep the euro intact boosted investors&#8217; confidence in holding developing countries stocks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Global Stimulus &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A withdrawal of the global stimulus may lead to losses in emerging-market stocks as earnings growth has yet to show signs of recovery, according to Lewis Kaufman, a fund manager at Thornburg Investment Management, which oversees $85 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;By and large, many companies are struggling to meet earnings expectation,&#8221; Kaufman said in a telephone interview from Santa Fe, New Mexico. &#8220;There&#8217;s probably a bit of disconnection between the extent of the rally and the underlying fundamentals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kaufman said he favors stocks in Southeast Asia and the Philippines as economic growth &#8220;surprises positively.&#8221; His $213 million Thornburg Developing World Fund (THDAX) returned 14 percent over the past three years, beating 98 percent of its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Duane D.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) Director Don Keough,
who joined the soda maker in 1960 and helped oversee its
international expansion, will retire from the board this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keough, 86, and fellow longtime Coke Director Jimmy
Williams, 79, will not stand for re-election to the board in
April, the Atlanta-based company said today in a statement.
Williams, a former chairman and chief executive officer of
SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), has served as a director since 1979. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine Coca-Cola without Don and Jimmy,&#8221;
Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said in the statement.
&#8220;Many of our current Coca-Cola leaders learned this business
under Don, and I have personally benefited from his guidance,
mentorship and friendship for more than 30 years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After joining Coca-Cola by way of an acquisition, Keough
ran the company&#8217;s food division, served as chairman of its
largest bottler and of its Columbia Pictures division.
Eventually he was named chief operating officer and helped
oversee the company&#8217;s short-lived introduction of New Coke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Coke, introduced in 1985 after the company changed the
formula for its namesake drink, was met by consumer protest. The
company returned to its original recipe a few months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keough served two stints on Coca-Cola&#8217;s board, the most
recent beginning in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, will double its investment in mobile technology this year, not including acquisitions it could make in the industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty will move employees and resources to mobile technology as part of the investment, said Robert LeBlanc, senior vice president of middleware software at IBM. Rometty is prioritizing mobile as much as some of the company&#8217;s more high-profile initiatives, like cloud computing and business data analysis, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you talked to Ginni and asked her what the key growth plays are for IBM, she would tell you mobility is one of them,&#8221; LeBlanc said in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re moving some of our skill and resources into mobility as a growth play.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company said today that it will combine a set of technology tools, accumulated from 10 acquisitions since 2006, into products and services for business customers looking specifically for help with mobile computing. The branding push, called &#8220;MobileFirst,&#8221; is the company&#8217;s &#8220;stake in the ground&#8221; as its clients shift their workload to tablets and smartphones, LeBlanc said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s new offerings range from data analysis that helps businesses see how employees are using smartphones to tools for companies to create their own mobile applications. LeBlanc declined to provide specific figures for Armonk, New York-based IBM&#8217;s investment in mobile. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to its expanding internal investment, IBM continues to be on the lookout for acquisitions that could enhance its mobile services, LeBlanc said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM shares slipped less than 1 percent to $198.33 at the close in New York. The company has gained 3.5 percent so far this year, compared with a 5.3 percent increase for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Julie Hirschfeld Davis" date="Feb 21, 2013  3:33 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-21/unions-business-reach-accord-on-guest-worker-visa-needs.html"><headline>Unions, Business Reach Accord on Guest-Worker Visa Needs</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Labor leaders and the nation&#8217;s
largest business lobby called for a new visa program to let U.S.
companies hire foreign workers for jobs Americans aren&#8217;t
available to fill, signaling progress on a critical component of
immigration law revisions being debated in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, representing the nation&#8217;s
biggest organized labor federation, and U.S. Chamber of Commerce
President Thomas J. Donohue also said today that the government
should create a research bureau to crunch employment and other
data to help identify future U.S. labor shortages and ways to
address them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While their &#8220;joint statement of shared principles&#8221; fell
far short of a compromise on one of the thorniest issues in the
immigration debate, it is a public signal that business and
labor -- long at war over a so-called &#8220;guest-worker program&#8221; -
- are moving toward common ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are now in the middle -- not the end -- of this
process, and we pledge to continue to work together and with our
allies and our representatives on Capitol Hill to finalize a
solution that is in the interest of this country,&#8221; Trumka and
Donohue said in their joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hispanic Clout &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2012 elections spotlighted the growing political
influence of Hispanic voters, 71 percent support of them backed
President Barack Obama and helped him win a second term. Since
then, the White House has pressed for a measure to legalize the
11 million undocumented immigrants estimated to be living in the
U.S. A bipartisan group of senators is also working to craft
such a measure, aiming to unveil it next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White House press secretary Jay Carney welcomed the labor-
business statement when asked about it today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is yet another sign of progress&#8221; and &#8220;we are
encouraged by it,&#8221; Carney told reporters.  At the same time, he
said, &#8220;we remain focused on encouraging the Senate to develop a
comprehensive bill.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who is one of
the eight-member group working on immigration legislation,
called the agreement &#8220;a major step forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the devil will be in the details in terms of
fleshing these principles out, our staffs have had very
productive discussions with both sides this week,&#8221; Schumer said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sticking Point &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-running dispute over how the bill should address
temporary entry for low-skilled foreign workers -- including
janitors, home health care aides and carnival workers -- still
threatens to emerge as a sticking point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue helped defeat a similar immigration effort in
2007, when Obama, then a senator, voted to gut a proposed guest-
worker program and the AFL-CIO opposed the broader bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama opted against including such a program in his own
blueprint for an immigration rewrite rolled out last month, and
a legislative draft of his administration&#8217;s plan first obtained
Feb. 16 by USA Today omits it as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor leaders have said a new low-skilled visa program
could undermine protections and drive down wages for U.S. and
immigrant workers alike, while employers argue they need one to
fill vacancies for jobs Americans are unwilling or unavailable
to perform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Government Commission &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides remain divided over how to structure such a
program. Organized labor wants to put a government commission in
charge of looking at employment and other data and recommending
whether to issue additional visas, and how many. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses are opposed to leaving the decision in the hands
of such a panel, arguing that employers should be allowed to
hire foreigners after showing that they couldn&#8217;t find Americans
for the jobs they&#8217;re seeking to fill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;American workers should have a first crack at available
jobs,&#8221; the principles state, adding that business and labor
have agreed to try to improve the means by which low-skilled
workers, particularly those in &#8220;disadvantaged communities,&#8221;
can find out about job openings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire&#8217;s last witness in a
trial alleging Exxon Mobil Corp. contaminated the state&#8217;s
drinking water with the gasoline additive MTBE told jurors
studies indicated the chemical raised cancer risks in rodents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Biles, a retired Exxon Mobil toxicologist who was
ordered to be a witness for the state, said in videotaped
testimony today that several studies of MTBE on mice and rats
showed an increased risk of reproductive problems as well as
cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was some evidence of severe toxicity in some of the
studies,&#8221; Biles said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has estimated it could cost about $818 million to
test, monitor and clean up groundwater contaminated with methyl
tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE. Based on New Hampshire&#8217;s estimate
that Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil (XOM) sold 30 percent of the
state&#8217;s gasoline from 1988 to 2005, it might ask the jury for
damages of $245 million if the company is found liable. Other
oil companies sued by the state have settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state&#8217;s lawyers questioned Biles about studies by the
American Petroleum Institute showing that at mid-to-high levels
ingestion or inhalation of MTBE elevated the risk of brain
tumors, liver cancer, blood cancer and kidney cancer in mice and
rats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Findings Expected &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil lawyers today played other excerpts from
Biles&#8217;s taped deposition in which he said the toxicology
findings weren&#8217;t unexpected or cause for alarm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All toxicology studies produce effects,&#8221; Biles said.
&#8220;We&#8217;re all exposed to chemicals every day that cause risks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is scheduled to begin presenting its case on
March 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Exxon Mobil challenged state testimony by
Justine Hastings, an economist who said her methodology
determined that the company sold 30 percent of the state&#8217;s
gasoline. The company&#8217;s lawyers said she should have used
refinery data, which would have shown a market share as low as
6.9 percent. Hastings said that method can&#8217;t adequately measure
how much gasoline is sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil has argued in court that it isn&#8217;t liable for
damage because it added MTBE to gasoline to comply with federal
regulations, which pre-empt state law. Oil companies added MTBE
to make gasoline burn more thoroughly in order to reduce air
pollution, as required under the 1990 Clean Air Act. The company
argued that the state was aware of the risks of MTBE when it
agreed to participate in a federal clean-air program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MTBE Alternatives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witnesses for the state have testified that oil companies
could have used chemicals other than MTBE to increase the oxygen
content of the fuel, such as ethanol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Stack, an Exxon Mobil lawyer, said in court this
week that ethanol wasn&#8217;t a good choice as an additive because at
the time of the federal mandate it caused engine damage and
wasn&#8217;t in adequate enough supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE, which New Hampshire banned in January 2007, is highly
soluble in water and can be carried great distances from where
it leaked. It leaked from gas stations, vehicle junkyards,
underground storage tanks and pipe fittings, the state has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citgo Petroleum Corp., which was a co-defendant with Exxon
Mobil in the trial, filed a $16 million settlement agreement
with the state on Feb. 15. New Hampshire had received more than
$100 million in settlements from other companies before Citgo&#8217;s
agreement, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil
Ltd., Vitol SA and Hess Corp. settled before the trial began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire case is one of scores of lawsuits
involving MTBE filed since 2000 against oil refiners, fuel
distributors and chemical makers. MTBE lawsuits have been
consolidated in federal court in New York for pretrial evidence-
gathering and motions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a federal jury ordered Exxon Mobil to pay New York
City $104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells
in the city. Exxon Mobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-C-0550, New
Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and other lenders justifiably refused additional
loans to an &#8220;ambitious&#8221; casino development by Fontainebleau
Las Vegas LLC, as the company had breached a credit agreement
governing the revolving loans, a U.S. appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The casino company sued the lenders for $3 billion in 2009,
saying they refused to provide $800 million in funding for the
development. Fontainebleau hadn&#8217;t abided by conditions it
undertook to fulfill before the banks would increase their
revolving loans from $150 million, the appeal judges ruled
yesterday in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fontainebleau, whose corporate parent owns a hotel on 22
acres of Miami Beach, Florida, needed the money to complete a
$2.4 billion casino-hotel being built in Las Vegas. The company
and affiliates filed for bankruptcy in Miami in 2009, and
billionaire investor Carl Icahn bought the unfinished Las Vegas
project for about $150 million in 2010. The appeals court wound
up reviewing two U.S. District Court decisions from Florida on
what they termed &#8220;a contract dispute.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case presents more fallout from the failure of the
ambitious Fontainebleau development in Las Vegas,&#8221; the appeals
judges said in their ruling. &#8220;After careful review, and having
had the benefit of oral argument, we affirm both rulings by the
district court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fully Drawn&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute between Fontainebleau and the banks hinged on
the interpretation of the term &#8220;fully drawn&#8221; in the loan
documents, the judges said. When Bank of America, as agent for
the loans, said the request for funds didn&#8217;t comply with the
agreement, Fontainebleau said it did. The project collapsed
after the lenders declared a default, and the company filed the
lawsuit alleging breach of contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the contract terms &#8220;ambiguous,&#8221; the judges said
they couldn&#8217;t by law conclude that the lenders &#8220;broke their
promise to fund the borrowers,&#8221; as Fontainebleau argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvin Goldstein, a lawyer for the trustee handling the
bankruptcy, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on the ruling. Jason Jones, a lawyer for Fontainebleau
Las Vegas, said he wasn&#8217;t involved in the appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fontainebleau Las Vegas LLC v. Bank of America,
11-10468, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
(Atlanta). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds are more bullish on
equities than they have been in six years and American
International Group Inc. (AIG) replaced Apple (AAPL) Inc. as the top-held
stock, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net long exposure to stocks in hedge funds climbed to 52
percent in the fourth quarter, matching the 10-year high reached
in the first quarter of 2007, a team led by Goldman Sachs&#8217;
Amanda Sneider and David Kostin said in a report yesterday. For
the first time in three years, iPhone maker Apple was not the
most-popular stock held by firms, falling to third place as
insurer AIG became the most-held position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hedge funds notably reduced holdings of underperforming
long-time favorites Apple and gold while raising allocations to
rallying financials,&#8221; Sneider and Kostin wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds increased bets stocks will advance after
returns failed to keep pace with the rally in equities last year
as short sales limited gains. While the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index jumped 16 percent in 2012 including dividends, the average
hedge fund returned 8 percent, according to Goldman Sachs. The
average mutual fund focused on large companies returned 14
percent, the note said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple tumbled 20 percent last quarter, the worst
performance in four years, amid concern increased competition
and a lack of breakthrough products will reduce profit margins
at the world&#8217;s most-valuable company. The shares have slumped 16
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cutting Gold &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds also reduced holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust to
the lowest in at least four years, Goldman Sachs said. The
exchange-traded fund known as GLD (GLD), the biggest ETF backed by the
metal, plunged 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter as U.S.
economic concerns eased, eroding demand for the metal as an
investment hedge. The ETF has lost 5.7 percent so far in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG surged 52 percent last year as the New York-based
company finished repaying the last of its $182.3 billion bailout
by the U.S. government. The shares are up 5.3 percent this year.
Financial stocks rose the most out of 10 groups in the SP 500
last year, rallying 26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds have continued to underperform relative to the
SP 500 this year, returning 3 percent through Feb. 8, Goldman
Sachs said. The benchmark measure added 6.6 percent including
dividends in the same period. Goldman Sachs&#8217; report tracked 725
hedge funds with $1.3 trillion of equity positions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone who&#8217;s held a smartphone to
the ear or watched a movie with a laptop balanced on their knees
knows the devices get hot. Most are unaware the same battery
technology is widely used in electric cars and has made few
notable advances in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries became costly for
General Motors Co. (GM) after they caught fire in its plug-in Volt

&lt;p&gt;Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO), the Canadian
company 70 percent owned by Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), announced that
Richard M. Kruger will become chairman, president and chief
executive officer effective March 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kruger has worked at Exxon for 32 years and is currently
president of its production company, Calgary-based Imperial said
in a statement today. He replaces Bruce H. March, who will
become senior vice president of global operations for Exxon&#8217;s
chemical company after almost five years as CEO of Imperial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial Oil is Canada&#8217;s second-largest oil producer by
market value. The company owns and operates refineries, oil-
sands assets and a chain of gasoline retail stations across the
country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial on Feb. 1 raised the estimate for initial costs at
its delayed Kearl oil-sands project to C$12.9 billion ($12.7
billion) because of issues related to transporting heavy
equipment to the site in Alberta and &#8220;harsh weather&#8221; as
startup began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kruger began his career with Exxon in 1981 and has worked
for the company in Russia, Malaysia and Africa. He was vice
president of production for the Asia Pacific and Middle Eastern
region before becoming president of the production company,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benros Capital Partners LLP, a
London hedge fund founded by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
traders, is shutting down after less than two years as
shareholder Brummer  Partners AB pulled its investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brummer, a Swedish firm that owns 45 percent of Benros and
seeded it with $300 million at its founding in 2011, announced
it would redeem its investment in a statement on its website.
Daniele Benatoff, one of Benros&#8217;s founders, said in an e-mail
that the fund will be shut down, and declined further comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund &#8220;has not lived up to expectations,&#8221; Brummer said
in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benros is the second so-called event-driven fund founded by
former Goldman Sachs traders to shut in four months. Benros,
which managed $315 million as of Jan. 31, trades securities
based on corporate decisions that might trigger price movements,
such as mergers, management changes and share sales. It was
founded by Benatoff, 33, Ariel Roskis, 37, and three other
veterans of the Wall Street firm&#8217;s proprietary trading desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benros declined 5.6 percent last year, according to a
performance report obtained by Bloomberg. It dropped another 1.4
percent through the first six weeks of this year, bringing its
decline to 7 percent since inception, Brummer&#8217;s website said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average event-driven fund climbed 8.9 percent in 2012,
according to data from Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Edoma, Canosa &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edoma Partners LLP said in October that it would close down
after losing money. Former Goldman Sachs trader Pierre-Henri Flamand started the London-based event-driven fund in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brummer, based in Stockholm, is Sweden&#8217;s largest hedge-fund
manager. Its recent investments include Canosa Capital LLP, a
hedge fund being set up by two former Rubicon Fund Management
LLP executives that will bet on global macro-economic trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canosa, founded by Tim Attias and Santiago Alarco, is
likely to begin trading in the second quarter, according to a
statement from Brummer last week. Details of Brummer&#8217;s
involvement in Canosa weren&#8217;t disclosed, and Canosa officials
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob Lannero, a spokesman for Brummer, wouldn&#8217;t comment on
either Benros or Canosa. Benros&#8217;s closure was first reported by
Financial News. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY),
the U.K.&#8217;s biggest pay-television company, and Walt Disney Co. (DIS)
are starting a pay-TV channel on the broadcaster&#8217;s platform to
screen new and old Disney films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sky Movies Disney, which begins airing March 28, will have
first-run rights to the newest Disney films such as &#8220;Brave,&#8221;
&#8220;Tinker Bell: Secret of the Wings&#8221; and &#8220;Wreck-It Ralph,&#8221;
typically shown about six months after their cinema release, the
two companies said in a statement today. Older Disney films,
including titles such as &#8220;Finding Nemo,&#8221; &#8220;Cars&#8221; and &#8220;A
Bug&#8217;s Life,&#8221; will also be available on the channels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSkyB spends 2.3 billion pounds ($3.5 billion) a year on
content, which includes first-run rights from Hollywood film
studios, and has been winning new customers with exclusive
sports and entertainment broadcasts. The Isleworth, England-
based company, which is about 40 percent owned by Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News Corp. (NWSA), added 88,000 customers in the fiscal first
half ended Dec. 31 by gaining subscribers for packages that
combine TV, Internet and phone services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the deal with Disney, BSkyB also has
first-run rights to show movies from Lucasfilm and Marvel
Studios, such as &#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; and &#8220;Avengers Assemble,&#8221;
across other Sky channels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSkyB shares fell 1.2 percent to 817 pence at 11 a.m. in
London, paring their gain this year to 6.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSkyB is also exporting content as it seeks new viewers.
Modern Times Group AB (MTGA), based in Stockholm, said today it signed
a deal with BSkyB to distribute the Sky Sports News HD channel
on its Viasat satellite platforms. The service will be available
to Nordic users at the end of the month and to Baltic users
later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement also allows Modern Times to include Sky
Sports content on its Nordic and Baltic TV channels, and its
Viaplay online pay-TV service in Nordic countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO)&#8217;s newest director
nominee solidifies a trend for the 100-year-old soda maker&#8217;s
board. It&#8217;s getting younger, more female and more racially
diverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola said today that Care USA Chief Executive Officer
Helene Gayle, 57, will stand for election in April. She would be
one of three women and three blacks on a board that includes an
Hispanic and will have an average age of 66 if she is elected.
In 2007, shareholders elected a board made up of 10 men -- one
black -- and one woman, with an average age of 68. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Helene brings a global mindset and a deep understanding
of health and humanitarian issues to our Company,&#8221; Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said in a statement. &#8220;Her
expertise and insight will be invaluable as we continue to
expand our global initiatives around sustainability and women.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gayle&#8217;s nomination comes as U.S. companies continue to make
&#8220;glacial progress&#8221; in efforts to boost female representation
in corporate suites and boardrooms, according to a December
report by Catalyst, a non-profit researcher based in New York
that studies women and business. Women held 14.3 percent of
executive positions at Fortune 500 companies as of June 30 and
16.6 percent of board seats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) doesn&#8217;t
have &#8220;direct access&#8221; to information about the beneficial owner
behind transactions in an account in which the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission said suspicious trading of H.J. Heinz
Co. (HNZ) occurred, the bank told the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC on Feb. 15 sued &#8220;unknown&#8221; traders over suspicious
trading of Heinz&#8217;s options through what the regulator said was
an account at Goldman Sachs. The SEC will ask a federal judge in
Manhattan at a hearing set for today to freeze the account&#8217;s
assets until the case is resolved. The New York-based bank told
the agency the account holder is a Zurich private-wealth client,
the SEC said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman informed me that it does not have direct access
to information about the beneficial owner or owners behind any
particular transaction or position&#8221; in the account, SEC senior
counsel Megan Bergstrom wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trades at issue in the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit came a day before
Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) and 3G Capital Inc.
announced a $23 billion takeover of Pittsburgh-based Heinz, the
agency said in its complaint. Using a Zurich-based account that
involved call-option contracts, the unidentified traders&#8217;
unrealized profit was more than $1.7 million, according to the
SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has also asked Swiss authorities for assistance in
the effort to identify the traders. Swiss Financial Market
Supervisory Authority, known as Finma, will cooperate with the
SEC&#8217;s request &#8220;within the framework of our mandate,&#8221; Christina
Buergi, a spokeswoman for Finma, said in a phone interview.
Buergi said the request had been made &#8220;recently&#8221; and declined
to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Initial Conference &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff scheduled an initial
conference in the case today. Rakoff temporarily froze the
assets in the account on Feb. 15 at the SEC&#8217;s request and also
issued an order prohibiting the defendants from destroying or
disposing records of any kind related to the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC on Feb. 20 asked Rakoff to keep the assets frozen
until the case is resolved, saying there is a &#8220;serious risk
that the substantial proceeds from the defendants trading will
leave the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts in the next few days
and may never be recovered,&#8221; according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff said any traders who object to a permanent asset
freeze must appear before him today to explain why he shouldn&#8217;t
grant the SEC&#8217;s request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unidentified traders are &#8220;foreign traders and trade
through a foreign account,&#8221; the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trade Blotter &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission provided a redacted copy of a trade blotter
for the account described as &#8220;a Goldman Sachs omnibus firm
customer facilitation account,&#8221; which shows that from Sept. 1
through Feb. 13, the only trading in Heinz occurred on the day
before the takeover of the ketchup maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC described the account as &#8220;GS Bank IC Buy Open
Listed Options, GS  CO C/O Zurich Office.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Heinz takeover announcement, the traders&#8217; option
purchases have settled and can be liquidated at any time, the
SEC said. SEC staff attorney David Brown said that on Feb. 15,
he informed Goldman Sachs representatives about the agency&#8217;s
plans and also asked the bank to &#8220;use whatever means they
have&#8221; to contact the traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York said this
week that it&#8217;s also investigating the matter and is working with
the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants, using the Goldman Sachs account, invested
almost $90,000 in option positions the day before the deal was
announced, the SEC said. As a result, their position increased
to more than $1.8 million, a rise of almost 2,000 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Omnibus Account &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said that the traders had advance material
nonpublic information about the impending deal when they used an
omnibus account in Zurich to buy 2,533 out-of-the-money June
call options, which had a strike price of $65 on Feb. 13. Shares
closed that day at $60.48. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase of the options, which expire on June 22, was
highly unusual, the SEC said. On Feb. 12, only 14 were
purchased, regulators said, while on Feb. 11, no such options
were bought. Since Nov. 14, no more than 61 such contracts had
been purchased on any other single day, the commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading in the options gives the right to buy the
underlying shares and profit when the stock rises. The timing
and size of the trades were deemed highly suspicious by the SEC
because the accounts through which the traders purchased the
options had no history of trading Heinz securities in the last
six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Certain Unknown Traders in Securities of H.J. Heinz Co., 13-
cv-1080, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors reduced holdings of
emerging-market government debt to the lowest level since
October 2008 as rising U.S. Treasury yields eroded the allure of
the assets, a survey by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients surveyed also cut their investment in developing-
nation currencies by the most since May 2012, as the Japanese
yen weakened, JPMorgan analysts led by Holly Huffman in New York
wrote in a note dated today. The 189 clients in the monthly
survey, who manage a total of $1 trillion in emerging-market
assets, said they have also reduced their positions in interest-
rate markets and corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s EMBI Global Index of emerging-market dollar debt
has lost 1.98 percent since Dec. 31, the worst start of a year
since 1995, as 10-year Treasury yields jumped to a 10-month high
Feb. 14. South Korea&#8217;s won and Taiwan&#8217;s currency have lost about
2 percent this year against the dollar as the 16 percent decline
in the yen over the past six months boosted concern that Asia
will act to weaken their currencies to bolster exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Special focus in this month&#8217;s survey centered on
reactions to moves in U.S. Treasuries and the Japanese yen,&#8221;
wrote the analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 25 percent of investors said they have or will reduce
their holdings of Asian currencies, according to the survey.
Investors have deepened their &#8220;underweight&#8221; positions in
currencies, including the Indian rupee, won, Malaysian ringgit,
Philippine peso and Thai baht, the survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top lawyers for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
and Oracle Corp. (ORCL), saying software patents are important drivers
of U.S. innovation and economic growth, pressed Congress
yesterday to reject calls to limit that legal protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies including Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. have said
too many software patents are being used primarily to generate
lawsuits instead of contributing to new products and services.
Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, and Oracle say
discussions of ways to curtail litigation shouldn&#8217;t become an
excuse to limit the ability to patent software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My biggest concern, and the concern of many other
software companies, is that there&#8217;s going to be a move to
somehow reduce or diminish protection for software,&#8221; Oracle
General Counsel Dorian Daley said in an interview in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daley and her counterpart at Microsoft, Brad Smith, joined
software and manufacturing executives meeting yesterday with
lawmakers and congressional staff members to defend patents for
computer programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a patent system that has important strengths but
it also has some significant weaknesses,&#8221; Smith said in the
same interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any new legislation should be directed at ways to reduce
litigation rather than undermining software patents, said Robert
Holleyman, president of Washington-based BSA - The Software
Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One proposal Google, Microsoft and Oracle agree on is to
make the loser in a patent lawsuit pay the winner&#8217;s legal costs,
a move they say would discourage lawsuits by patent owners with
dubious claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large technology companies are united in their ire at
owners of software patents who sue dozens or even hundreds of
companies claiming to have invented aspects of technologies
including online shopping, Internet mapping and tracking
delivery vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the more than 5,600 patent-infringement lawsuits filed
in the U.S. last year, more than 12 percent were filed by just
10 companies over software, according to Bloomberg Law data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue has drawn the attention of President Barack Obama, who on Feb. 14 said patent legislation he signed in 2011
&#8220;hasn&#8217;t captured all the problems&#8221; of the patent system, such
as the litigation by patent owners derisively called &#8220;trolls.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which
specializes in patent law, is considering a case that could
determine when computer programs are eligible for legal
protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is holding meetings on
possible changes to the way it handles applications for software
programs, and is considering rules requiring more disclosure
about the &#8220;real party in interest&#8221; in patents and
applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple-Samsung Judge Says Companies Must Narrow Patent Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics Co. must narrow their
patent-infringement lawsuit case scheduled for trial in 2014, a
judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh in San Jose, California,
told lawyers from both companies yesterday that they must
&#8220;focus and streamline&#8221; their cases to 25 patent claims, or
elements of the patents at issue, and 25 accused products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koh made the request from the bench in the latest of two
related patent cases. The lawsuit was filed last year and covers
technology in newer smartphones made by both companies,
including Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S III and Apple&#8217;s iPhone 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll keep narrowing and narrowing,&#8221; Koh said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
already been litigating this thing for a year; you must know
something about what&#8217;s your best case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a filing last week, Cupertino, California-based Apple
included Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Note smartphones and tablet computer
in the case. Samsung claimed &#8220;all generations&#8221; of Apple&#8217;s
iPhone and iPads infringe at least three of its patents,
according to its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koh last month rejected Apple&#8217;s request to add additional
damages to the first patent-infringement case between the two
companies in San Jose. In that case, a jury awarded Apple $1.05
billion, finding the Suwon, South Korea-based company infringed
six of the iPhone maker&#8217;s mobile-device patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year&#8217;s case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)
Ltd., 11-cv-1846, the case scheduled for trial next year is
Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 12-cv-630, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VF&#8217;s 7 For All Mankind Loses Trademark Lawsuit at EU Top Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeans maker 7 For All Mankind lost a final bid to get the
European Union trademark rights to its name after the EU&#8217;s top
court ruled in favor of an Italian backpack manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg yesterday dismissed
an appeal by the company to get trademark rights across the 27-
nation bloc for &#8220;Seven For All Mankind.&#8221; The ruling can&#8217;t be
appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VF Corp. (VFC) unit previously won the rights to the name in
2010 when the bloc&#8217;s trademark authority in Alicante, Spain,
rejected a challenge by Italian company Seven SpA. The agency
said there was no likelihood of confusion with the Italian
company&#8217;s trademarks for the word Seven. A lower EU court later
overturned that decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU General Court in 2011 ruled that &#8220;there is a
certain overall similarity between the marks at issue&#8221; because
the presence of the word Seven in the names &#8220;is not
insignificant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That court, the region&#8217;s second-highest, &#8220;did not commit
the error of law alleged by the applicant,&#8221; the Court of
Justice ruled, dismissing all points of appeal that were raised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 For All Mankind first applied in 2005 for the EU
trademark to cover products such as jewelry, belts, suitcases
and backpacks. Representatives for VF in Greensboro, North
Carolina, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment
on the decision, or answer calls before regular office hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: C-655/11 P, Seven for all mankind v. Seven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CIAA Files Infringement Suit in Advance of Hoops Tournament &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the 101-
year-old athletic conference composed of traditionally African-
American colleges, sued multiple defendants for trademark
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based CIAA filed the suit in federal court
in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Feb. 14, less than two weeks
before its annual basketball tournament is to be held in
Charlotte beginning Feb. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple entities are making unauthorized use of the
association&#8217;s marks to trade off its fame, according to the
complaint. The conference complained of infringing Internet
domain names, party planners&#8217; and concert promoters&#8217;
unauthorized use of CIAA trademarks, and the sale of counterfeit
merchandise such as athletic gear and souvenirs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sellers of the fake merchandise move it from city to city,
using itinerant peddlers &#8220;without offices, identification,
licenses or addresses,&#8221; according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the tournament, local law enforcement officers are
dedicated to on-site safety and security and don&#8217;t have the
priority or the time to deal with counterfeiters as a criminal
matter, the CIAA said. As a result, the conference said an order
permitting seizure of unauthorized merchandise is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the conference asked for an order barring
future infringement of its marks, awards of attorney fees and
litigation costs, money damages, and the transfer of infringing
Internet domain names. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Student Facebook Page Taken Down as School Says Mark Infringed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a request from school officials, students at Sam
Houston State University took down a page on Facebook Inc. (FB)&#8217;s
social media site where students could use a Web-survey tool to
make any confession they wanted to make, the Houstonian
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kris Ruiz, marketing director at the school, said trademark
concerns prompted the request for removal of the &#8220;SHSU
Confessions&#8221; page, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University policy is to respond to apparent violations
rather than seek them out, Ruiz said, according to the
Houstonian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new page with the same function was put up on Facebook as
&#8220;Prison City Confessions,&#8221; according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Internet Brands Unit Sued Over Divorce Handbook License &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Brands Inc.&#8217;s Nolo unit was sued for copyright
infringement by a competing provider of self-help legal
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania Full Court Press Inc. claims Nolo had a
license for a limited period of time to publish and sell an
electronic edition of a book it produced. Nolo continued to sell
the product after the license expired in 2004, according to the
complaint filed Feb. 20 in federal court in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full Court Press said it lost sales and was otherwise
damaged as a result of Nolo&#8217;s conduct. The company asked the
court to order removal of its book -- &#8220;No-Fault Divorce in
Pennsylvania: A Guide to the Law, With Forms for Filing Your Own
Divorce&#8221; -- from all Nolo computers and for awards of money
damages, litigation costs and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Brands, based in El Segundo, California, didn&#8217;t
respond immediately to an e-mailed request for comment on the
suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pennsylvania Full Court Press Inc. v. Nolo

Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RIAA Says Takedown Requests Not Stopping Infringement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Recording Industry Association of America, the leader
among copyright owners requesting that Google Inc. (GOOG) take down
search results linking to allegedly infringing content, says the
company&#8217;s efforts haven&#8217;t had the desired effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a report released yesterday, Washington-based RIAA said
it analyzed the websites listed as &#8220;serial infringers&#8221; in
Google&#8217;s Copyright Transparency Report and found that they
&#8220;still managed to appear on page 1 of the search results over
98 percent of the time in the searches conducted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorized download sites such as Apple Inc.&#8217;s iTunes,
Amazon.com Inc. and eMusic only appeared in the top 10 results
for little more than half of the searches, the music-industry
trade group said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In other words, whatever Google has done to its search
algorithms to change the ranking of infringing sites, it doesn&#8217;t
appear to be working,&#8221; RIAA said. More study of Google&#8217;s
response is needed, the group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Google&#8217;s report, in the past month, RIAA was
the leading copyright owner reporting allegedly infringing
sites, listing almost 2.36 million URLs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, said that in
the last six months of 2011, it took down 97 percent of the
search results specified in takedown requests made during that
period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline weakened as
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Phillips 66 (PSX) restarted units at two Texas
refineries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The No. 3 fluid catalytic cracker at Exxon&#8217;s Baytown
refinery returned to normal operations yesterday after an upset
on Feb. 22, according to Nicholas Scinta, a company spokesman
based in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips 66&#8217;s Sweeny refinery, which began scheduled
maintenance on Jan. 7, was restarting production units including
a pipestill and sulfur recovery unit, according to two people
familiar with the operations who asked not to be identified
because the information isn&#8217;t public. Rich Johnson, a Phillips
66 spokesman, said maintenance is still under way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sweeny and Baytown refineries can process as much as
831,000 barrels a day, or 9.5 percent of capacity on the Gulf
Coast, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol on the
Gulf slipped 1.5 cents to trade at a discount of 1.5 cents a
gallon below futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:29
p.m. Conventional, 87-octane gasoline dropped 1.75 cents to 3
cents below futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refineries in the region processed 7.14 million barrels of
crude and other feedstock in the week ended Feb. 15, compared
with 7.4 million barrels in the week-earlier period, Energy
Information Administration data show. Operators used 81.8
percent of capacity, the lowest level since Sept. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Utilization Rate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Refinery utilization rates are at their lowest level
since the beginning of maintenance season some three weeks
ago,&#8221; said Tom Finlon, Jupiter, Florida-based director of
Energy Analytics Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread, or a measure of refining
profitability based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
Oklahoma, dropped 89 cents to $36.75 a barrel. The same spread
for Light Louisiana Sweet oil gained 96 cents to $15.60 a
barrel. Gulf Coast reformulated gasoline traded 1 cent above the
same fuel in the New York Harbor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refiners in New York profited $16.05 a barrel based on
Brent oil prices in Europe. That&#8217;s up 52 cents from Feb. 22.
Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline in the region dropped 0.25 cent
to 2.5 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gavea Investimentos Ltda., the hedge

investors the 1 billion reais ($507 million) it raised last
month for a high-yield credit fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gavea closed the fund because Jose de Menezes Berenguer
Neto, who had joined the firm in March as head of private
credit, is leaving to head JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Brazilian
unit, Gavea Chief Executive Officer Amaury Bier said by
telephone from Rio de Janeiro. Gavea is a unit of JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gavea won&#8217;t have another asset-backed receivables fund
investing in high-yield credit until it finds someone to replace
Berenguer, Bier said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) units

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s largest
electronic payments network, is teaming up with phonemaker
Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) to provide a financial program to enable
mobile handsets to be used like a credit or debit card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa&#8217;s PayWave application will be a standard feature on
Samsung devices equipped with near-field-communication
technology, which allows customers to pay for goods or services
by tapping their phones on a reader, the companies said in a
statement today at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The
partners will also cooperate on technology for banks to download
account information securely to Samsung phones for the payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone companies and financial institutions such as Foster
City, California-based Visa and Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard Inc. (MA) are promoting NFC applications for use in so-
called mobile wallets by encouraging the more than 70,000 people
attending the industry congress this week to pay for coffee and
badge into events with handsets carrying the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Visa-Samsung global alliance is a first of its kind
between a leading NFC handset manufacturer and payment network
that is paving the way for the implementation of large-scale
mobile payment programs,&#8221; the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies are looking for partnerships to propel growth in
the nascent NFC market, which requires cooperation among
retailers, banks, credit card companies, handset makers, mobile
phone service providers and manufacturers of point-of-sale
devices. ABI Research estimated in November that the number of
NFC-enabled devices shipped will jump to 1.95 billion in 2017
from as many 102 million predicted for 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung and Visa worked together to offer NFC-based

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is in talks
with its Tokyo landlord to cut office space as it seeks to
reduce expenses, said two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm, which rents six floors of the Mori
Tower in the Roppongi Hills office complex, is in discussions
with Mori Building Co. to vacate two levels, the people said,
asking not to be named as the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs joins investment banks including Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604) in reducing costs in Japan after companies shunned
the stock market for fundraising amid a recession that may be
ending. The plan to trim office space comes even as rents in
Tokyo decline to a record low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank plans to leave the 43rd and 44th floors,
which house its asset management unit and sports facilities, and
remain in the 45th to 48th, the people said. It will transfer
staff to other floors of the 54-story building, one of the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is part of a planning process to optimize our
space,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in a statement e-mailed to Bloomberg
News, declining to comment further. Hideki Nomura, general
manager of public relations at Mori Building, Japan&#8217;s biggest
closely held developer, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, agreed to pay as much as $349 million to
join Beach Energy Ltd. (BPT) in an Australian natural gas exploration
campaign in its first shale investment in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will acquire as much as 60 percent of a permit in
South Australia and 36 percent of a block in Queensland,
Adelaide-based Beach said today in a statement. The blocks cover
about 810,000 acres in the Cooper Basin, the outback region that
straddles the border of the two states, San Ramon, California-
based Chevron said in a separate statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement follows shale investments by ConocoPhillips (COP),
Statoil ASA, BG Group Plc and Hess Corp. in a nation estimated
by the U.S. Energy Information Administration to have the
world&#8217;s sixth-biggest potential reserves. Wilson HTM Investment
Group says the accord is the biggest shale gas deal in Australia,
which the government estimates may hold almost 400 trillion
cubic feet of resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact you&#8217;ve got a knowledgeable party coming in says
they think there&#8217;s something there,&#8221; said John Young, a
Melbourne-based analyst at Wilson HTM Investment Group. &#8220;The
resource in the Cooper is being progressively de-risked and
we&#8217;ll over time see a commercial development from this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beach rose 5.8 percent to A$1.37 at the close in Sydney,
the most in more than five months. The company had the fifth-
biggest gain on Australia&#8217;s key index, which climbed 0.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biggest Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BG, developing one of the three liquefied natural gas
ventures on the Queensland coast, reached an agreement with
Drillsearch Energy Ltd. in 2011 to fund a A$130 million ($134
million) campaign to explore for gas in the Cooper Basin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drillsearch advanced 4.2 percent to A$1.375, and Senex
Energy Ltd. (SXY), another shale explorer in the Cooper Basin, gained
7.5 percent to 64.5 cents, the most in more than six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For someone with the world to look at and opportunities
everywhere to recognize the potential of the Cooper is a huge
vote of confidence in the future of the basin,&#8221; Beach Managing
Director Reginald Nelson said today in a phone interview.
&#8220;Ultimately it will allow us to move more quickly to accelerate
appraisal and development&#8221; and will help the company get the
drilling services and equipment it needs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. company first approached Beach in early 2012,
according to Nelson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chevron Cash &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will initially pay Beach $36 million in cash and
cover $95 million in costs for 30 percent of the South Australia
permit and $59 million in cash for 18 percent of the Queensland
acreage, according to the Beach statement. The Australian
company may receive as much as $349 million over two stages that
span several years, Beach said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 60 percent of Chevron&#8217;s total potential payments
would be in cash, a positive for Beach, according to Young, the
Wilson HTM analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PetroChina Co., the country&#8217;s biggest oil and gas producer,
agreed to purchase a 29 percent stake in the Goldwyer shale
project in Western Australia&#8217;s Canning Basin from ConocoPhillips,
the Beijing-based company said Feb. 20. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) reaped the most among
the five largest oil companies drilling on U.S. deep water
leases that mistakenly omitted drilling-fee provisions,
according to a report produced by a Democratic lawmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron avoided $1.49 billion in royalties, out of $2.62
billion that the companies would have paid for the right to
produce oil and gas in federal waters, according to the report
today from Representative Edward Markey of Massachusetts using
Interior Department information. More than 100 producers
including BP Plc (BP/), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and
ConocoPhillips (COP) also benefited from the botched leases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Congress is now debating ways to avoid deep, across-the-
board cuts to defense and domestic priorities such as education,
transportation, law enforcement and environmental protection,&#8221;
according to the report. &#8220;Ending royalty-free drilling (and
other giveaways to oil and gas companies) should represent low-
hanging fruit in the search for budget savings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulf of Mexico leases at issue were signed from 1996
through 2000 under a 1995 law intended to encourage drilling by
dropping fees when oil and gas prices were low and restoring
them when prices rebounded. Because of a bureaucratic error,
leases signed in 1998 and 1999 failed to include price
thresholds that would trigger royalty payments when prices rose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, reversed earlier gains in
Mexico City trading after forecasting slower growth in its
programming unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the content division, which relies mostly on
advertising and licensing fees, will climb by a &#8220;mid-single
digit&#8221; percentage this year, Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia said today. That compares with last year&#8217;s 7.2
percent expansion to 32.9 billion pesos ($2.56 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookings in the past few months of advance ad sales for the
year, known as upfronts, rose 0.7 percent from a year earlier,
after 8.9 percent growth in 2012, Televisa said. Government
agencies that normally participate in the sales didn&#8217;t this time
because they were busy with the transition to a new presidential
administration, de Angoitia said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upfronts also caused Mexico City-based Televisa to
spend more on its TV shows to impress advertisers, cutting into
fourth-quarter profit. The content division&#8217;s operating margin
fell to 47 percent last quarter, from 49.2 percent a year
earlier, and will remain about 47 percent this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Margin was the main disappointment in the quarter,&#8221;
Andrew Campbell, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in Sao
Paulo, said in a research note published today. &#8220;We see results
as neutral for the shares.&#8221; He rates the stock outperform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa fell 0.5 percent to 67.45 pesos at the close in
Mexico City after climbing as much as 1.3 percent. The shares
have dropped 1.2 percent this year, compared with an 0.5 percent
decline for the benchmark IPC index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Profit Climbs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forecast for mid-single-digit revenue growth in the
programming business compared with the 3.9 percent average of
nine analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Some of the
analysts haven&#8217;t updated their outlook for several months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net income climbed to 3 billion pesos from
2.17 billion pesos a year earlier, Televisa said yesterday in a
statement. That topped the 2.6 billion average estimate. Sales
rose 8.2 percent to 19.8 billion pesos, just above the 19.6
billion average estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is depending more on its pay-TV businesses for
expansion as growth slows at its broadcast networks, whose
viewers increasingly turn to the Internet and to cable channels
for entertainment. Satellite subscriptions rose 5.5 percent from
the previous quarter to 5.2 million, while cable-TV accounts
grew 2 percent to 2.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcast advertising sales rose 3.6 percent from a year
earlier to 7.7 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating income climbed 3.5 percent to 5.32 billion pesos.
Net income was boosted by a gain of 687.6 million pesos from the
value of derivative instruments, compared with an increase of
70.3 million pesos a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Televisa held a conference call to discuss the fourth-
quarter results at 10 a.m. New York time. Click here for audio

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank, will eliminate as many as 19,000 jobs in mortgages and community banking through through 2014 as Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon trims expenses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lender, employing about 259,000 people at the end of December, will cut 13,000 to 15,000 jobs in its mortgage unit and 3,000 to 4,000 in community banking excluding home lending through the end of next year, the company said today in presentations on its website. Firmwide headcount will shrink by about 4,000 people this year, mainly through attrition, while some employees are redeployed to other areas, said Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 56, is focusing on expense reductions after boosting net income to records for three straight years. Mortgage profits that drove banks&#8217; earnings may fade this year as increased competition keeps the rates on new loans near all-time lows. Some firms also are cutting jobs after a settlement with U.S. regulators resolved obligations to review foreclosure documents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With credit quality stabilizing, &#8220;banks can focus on operational efficiency,&#8221; said Chris Kotowski, a New York-based bank analyst with Oppenheimer  Co. &#8220;When credit problems are mounting, banks have to throw money at their problems. When the environment stabilizes, they can worry about operating efficiency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks are making &#8220;irrational&#8221;
commercial and industrial loans as they seek higher-yielding
assets and the supply of quality borrowers is low, said JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Doug Petno. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Just in the last several months we&#8217;ve seen some
irrational behavior, in our view, in terms of structure and
price,&#8221; Petno, chief executive officer of commercial banking,
said today at an investor conference at the firm&#8217;s New York
headquarters. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of capital chasing a finite amount
of opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial and industrial loans jumped 12 percent in 2012
to $1.51 trillion, the largest increase among loan categories,
according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Petno&#8217;s unit outpaced the industry in quarter-over-quarter CI
loan growth in each period of 2012, according to his
presentation today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s fiercely competitive,&#8221; Petno said. &#8220;Any really
high-quality loan opportunity, all the usual suspects are
competing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, had $73.6
billion in CI loans as of Dec. 31, according to the
presentation. Health-care companies made up 14 percent of that
total, with state and municipal governments and consumer
products companies each accounting for 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petno said his bank&#8217;s controls will help it avoid getting
pressured into making risky loans, including quarterly meetings
that include reviewing &#8220;crazy transactions&#8221; in the industry.
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has made maintaining credit quality a
priority over growth, Petno said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll be tested and tempted, but this place really has a
proven model,&#8221; Pento said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got tremendous confidence in
our track record and our ability to hold the line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cycle for gold prices, which climbed for 12 straight years, has probably turned as the recovery in the U.S. economy gathers momentum and investment holdings collapse, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which reduced forecasts for the metal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank cut its three-month target to $1,615 an ounce from $1,825 and lowered the six- and 12-month forecasts to $1,600 and $1,550 from $1,805 and $1,800. Goldman reversed an assumption exchange-traded products holdings will expand in 2013, analysts Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a Feb. 25 report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gold has dropped 5.1 percent this year as economic data improved, equities advanced and some U.S. central bankers sought more flexibility in their stimulus program. An inevitable unwind of gold&#8217;s 12-year bull market has begun, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a Feb. 21 report. ETP holdings are poised for the biggest monthly decline since January 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The turn in the gold cycle has likely already started,&#8221; the Goldman analysts wrote in the report, after predicting an end of gold&#8217;s bull run in a Dec. 5 note. &#8220;The latest collapse in gold ETF holdings stands in sharp contrast to our assumption that ETF positions were likely driven by longer-term allocation rather than short-term trading.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gold futures for April delivery rose 0.2 percent to $1,589.40 an ounce on the Comex at 10:30 a.m. in New York. Prices are poised for a fifth monthly drop in what would be the worst run since 1997. Holdings in ETPs, also known as exchange- traded funds, fell to a five-month low of 2,536.289 metric tons yesterday and have shrunk 2.9 percent this month, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Soros Sells &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Billionaire investors George Soros and Louis Moore Bacon cut their stakes in gold ETPs last quarter, while John Paulson maintained his share, government filings showed this month. Global holdings reached a record 2,632.5161 tons on Dec. 20. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gold futures fell to $1,554.30 on Feb. 21, the lowest since June 29, after minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s January meeting showed debate over the pace of asset purchases. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is due to testify before U.S. lawmakers today and tomorrow as the central bank buys $85 billion of assets a month in a third round of so-called quantitative easing, or QE3. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our economists believe that the downside risks to their forecasts have diminished while the uncertainty about the size of QE3 is high,&#8221; the Goldman report said. &#8220;We believe that a shift has occurred over the past few months with conviction in holding gold waning quickly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Real Assets &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of the reasons for owning gold remain intact, Morgan Stanley analysts including Peter Richardson wrote in a note yesterday, citing currency debasement and rising inflation expectations. The metal may have a sharp rally as investors seek so-called real assets, Elliott Management Corp., the hedge fund founded by Paul Singer, said in a document accompanying its fourth-quarter report to investors on Jan. 28. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Russia and Kazakhstan expanded their gold reserves for a fourth straight month in January, according to International Monetary Fund data. Central banks will again be strong buyers this year after boosting purchases 17 percent to 534.6 tons last year, the most since 1964, according to the World Gold Council. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data from the U.S. showed that builders broke ground on the most single-family homes in more than four years last month, while a manufacturing index climbed to a nine-month high. The Dollar Index (DXY), a gauge against six counterparts, has risen 2.7 percent this year, reaching the highest level since August today. Gold tends to trade inversely to the currency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Europe, German business confidence rose to a 10-month high in February, adding to signs that Europe&#8217;s largest economy is improving. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki and Michael J.

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s traders in its investment bank lost money on seven days during 2012, down from 26 in 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The traders lost money on just four days last year excluding debt-valuation adjustments and the impact of a credit derivatives portfolio that was transferred from the firm&#8217;s chief investment office, which had amassed the bet and lost more than $6.2 billion on it, the bank said in an investor presentation released at its New York headquarters today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daniel Pinto, 50, the co-chief executive officer of the company&#8217;s corporate and investment bank, has been overseeing the wind-down of the CIO portfolio, which helped increase the CIB&#8217;s value-at-risk to $84 million in 2012, from $76 million in 2011. Value-at-risk, or VaR, measures the most the bank might lose on 95 percent of its trading days. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results disclosed in the presentation today reflect performance in the corporate and investment bank alone and exclude other divisions. Across the firm, including in its chief investment office, traders lost money on 39 days in the first nine months of 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Average daily revenue in the trading unit was $69 million in 2012, up from $60 million in 2011, according to the presentation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s trading business has produced enough revenue to cover its expenses and cost of capital for 11 of the past 12 quarters, with the third quarter of 2011 as the exception, according to the presentation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;London Losses &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;CEO Jamie Dimon, 56, ousted traders and managers and replaced senior managers following the so-called London Whale episode at the firm&#8217;s chief investment office. The unit, assigned to invest the bank&#8217;s idle cash until it was needed, amassed a portfolio of credit derivatives that generated the company&#8217;s biggest trading loss ever. It was transferred to the corporate and investment bank in July. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The botched bets prompted the retirement in May of Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 56, spurred lawsuits from shareholders and drew civil and criminal probes by at least three U.S. agencies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Crayton Harrison" date="Feb 26, 2013  9:57 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-26/televisa-profit-climbs-on-satellite-cable-tv-subscriber-growth.html"><headline>Televisa Profit Climbs on Satellite, Cable-TV User Growth</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TV), the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, said fourth-quarter profit
increased 36 percent as more Mexicans signed up for satellite
and cable-television services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income climbed to 3 billion pesos ($235 million) from
2.17 billion pesos a year earlier, Mexico City-based Televisa
said yesterday in a statement. Profit topped the 2.6 billion
average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 8.2
percent to 19.8 billion pesos, just above the 19.6 billion
estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is depending more on its pay-TV businesses for
expansion as growth slows at its broadcast networks, whose
viewers increasingly turn to the Internet and to cable channels
for entertainment. Satellite subscriptions rose 5.5 percent from
the previous quarter to 5.2 million, while cable-TV accounts
grew 2 percent to 2.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcast advertising sales rose 3.6 percent from the same
period a year earlier to 7.7 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating income climbed 3.5 percent to 5.32 billion pesos.
Net income was boosted by a gain of 687.6 million pesos from the
value of derivative instruments, compared with an increase of
70.3 million pesos a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa rose less than 1 percent to 68.31 pesos at 9:47
a.m. in Mexico City. The shares had fallen less than 1 percent
this year through yesterday, in line with the benchmark IPC
index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Televisa will hold a conference call to discuss fourth-
quarter results at 10 a.m. New York time. To listen, dial

&lt;p&gt;Polypore International Inc. (PPO)&#8217;s
Celgard unit filed a patent-infringement suit against Sumitomo
Chemical Co. (4005) over lithium-ion battery technology used in
electronics and electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, filed Feb. 22 in federal court in Charlotte,
North Carolina, claims Sumitomo is infringing patent 6,432,586,
which was issued in 2002 and covers a separator in high-energy
rechargeable batteries. The separators prevent short circuits
that can reduce efficiency and limit safety problems from
overheating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Chemical makes the chemicals and materials for
lithium ion batteries that use Celgard&#8217;s invention without
permission, according to the complaint. The separators are used
in batteries made by Panasonic Corp. (6752) for laptop computers,
Celgard said in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Celgard has a long history of innovation in lithium-ion
battery separators and is a world leader in this technology,&#8221;
Polypore Chief Executive Officer Robert Toth said in a
statement. &#8220;We have a responsibility to our customers,
partners, and shareholders to safeguard the investments we make
in innovation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo-based Sumitomo Chemical has filed a trademark
application to use the name &#8220;Pervio&#8221; for its separators,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polypore is seeking a court ruling that prevents the future
use of the invention, plus cash compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polypore, based in Charlotte, also makes Duralife
automotive batteries, and separators for health-care products
like hemodialysis machines and beverage filtration machines.
Weakness in the end market for electronic devices and electric
vehicles were blamed for a 4 percent drop in fourth-quarter
sales to $180.2 million, Polypore said Feb. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Celgard LLC v. Sumitomo Chemical Co., 13cv122,

&lt;p&gt;Reckitt Benckiser Faces Generic Threats After FDA Rejection [bn:WBTKR=RB/:LN]  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/) [] faces competition in
pharmaceuticals for the first time after the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approved two generic variants of its Suboxone
heroin-dependency drug, thwarting the company&#8217;s attempts to keep
rivals away from its most profitable business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said yesterday that two manufacturers have FDA
approval to produce generic Suboxone tablets in the U.S.
Competition could arrive within a month, according to Alex
Howson, an analyst at Jefferies International in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reckitt Benckiser was also hurt by the FDA&#8217;s rejection in a
Feb. 22 letter of the company&#8217;s September petition asking that
makers of similar medicines implement more safeguards. The FDA
also asked the Federal Trade Commission to look into claims by
generic drug makers of anti-competitive business practices on
Reckitt Benckiser&#8217;s part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow of competition to Suboxone has hung over the
Slough, England-based company since it lost U.S. patent
protection in 2009. The pharmaceuticals unit generated 21
percent of profit last year, and analysts yesterday reduced
their 2013 profit estimates by as much as 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reckitt Benckiser, which said it was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; by
the rejection of its petition, has said generics would eliminate
as much as 90 percent of tablet sales and up to 20 percent of
the newer film-strip version, which dissolves under the tongue
and has captured a 64 percent volume share in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the generics will come from Bridgewater, New Jersey-
based Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said in a statement
yesterday that is has received FDA approval for a generic
version of Suboxone tablets, to be available in March. The other
will be made by Actavis Inc. (ACT) of Parsippany, New Jersey, which
said in a statement it intends to begin shipping its product
immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reckitt Benckiser said it&#8217;s sticking with its decision to
stop producing Suboxone in tablet form next month as it weans
patients onto the film-strip version, which it unveiled in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sony Applies for Patent on Load Time-Based Anti-Piracy Measure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp., maker of the PlayStation video game console, is
seeking a patent on a technology aimed at detecting pirated
games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to application 20130047267, published in the
database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Feb. 21,
devices using this patented technology will be able to identify
whether a game is legitimate based on the amount of time it
takes to load into the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will detect whether the game -- or other content -- is
&#8220;illegally transferred or pirated to another, unauthorized
media type.&#8221; Sony said that despite the use of digital rights
management software and tamper-resistant hardware, pirates are
able to reverse-engineer such technology and circumvent the
protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this technology, a device will have a threshold of
load time for legitimate content. If the media doesn&#8217;t pass the
validation in terms of load time, the user would be unable to
access the content, Sony said in its application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo-based Sony filed the application in August 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube
video-sharing service blocked and then unblocked a race fan&#8217;s
video of the crash at the Feb. 23 Daytona 500 race, the

&lt;p&gt;YouTube then put the video back up, saying &#8220;Our partners

in a statement that &#8220;a small number&#8221; of its computers were
hacked in a recent cyber attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computers were attacked by &#8220;malicious software&#8221; using
techniques similar to those experienced and reported recently by
Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Facebook Inc. (FB), the Redmond, Washington-based
company said in its statement posted on the company website Feb.
22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of its customers&#8217; computers were affected in the
attack, Microsoft claims. The company is in the middle of an
investigation of the attacks and said that this type of attack
&#8220;is no surprise&#8221; to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it doesn&#8217;t make any statements about such
attacks during the initial information-gathering process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Major&#8217; German Companies Hit With Cyber Attacks, Official Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan Keller, the head of the German Interior Ministry&#8217;s
department in charge of cyber security, told the European Police
Conference that 70 percent of all major Germany companies &#8220;are
threatened or affected&#8221; by cyber attacks, Der Spiegel reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;overwhelming number&#8221; of attacks targeting German
government agencies are coming from China, mainly Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou, according to Der Spiegel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposed German legislation may contain a requirement for
companies that are targets of cyber attacks to report them to
the government, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently, &#8220;it is a question of coincidence&#8221; that the
government learns about attacks against German companies, Der
Spiegel reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Total SA (FP) are
among explorers reviewing Sri Lanka&#8217;s oil and natural gas
reserves ahead of the biggest auction of blocks planned by a
nation that imports all its crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the world&#8217;s largest oil company by value, and
Total, Europe&#8217;s third-largest, bought data related to the sale
of 13 offshore fields, Saliya Wickramasuriya, director general
at the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat, said in an
interview. Eni SpA (ENI), BP Plc (BP/) and India&#8217;s Oil  Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC)
have enquired about the bids, which are scheduled to open at a
meeting with potential investors in Houston on March 7 and end
about five months later, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve had quite a few people from Big Oil come by,&#8221;
Colombo-based Wickramasuriya said in a Feb. 25 telephone
interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had 20 companies that took our data, made
repeat visits, or expressed interest in taking discussions
further in the framework of the bid round.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global oil majors are being lured by prospects beyond the
island&#8217;s famed white-sand beaches as the nation seeks to rebuild
an economy ravaged by three decades of civil war. Sri Lanka,
where conflict ended in 2009, is looking for technology to
unlock the potential of the area neighboring India, where
companies including Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) and BP are present. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;d be good for Sri Lanka to get the big conglomerates
in the energy sector interested at the onset,&#8221; said Dushni Weerakoon, director at the Institute of Policy Studies in
Colombo. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be a signal of confidence and an enormous
economic relief as we are a heavy energy importer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crude Importer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka, which doesn&#8217;t produce any oil or gas, imports
all its crude oil requirements from nations including Saudi
Arabia and Iran. The nation has identified 13 blocks off the
northern and western coasts of Sri Lanka for the auction,
including five in the Cauvery basin and eight in the Mannar. Two
of the 13 may be withdrawn because of a lack of data,
Wickramasuriya said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon
didn&#8217;t reply to an e-mail seeking comment on the bidding. Total
spokeswoman Anastasia Zhivulina and ONGC Chairman Sudhir Vasudeva declined to comment, as did an Eni spokesman, who
couldn&#8217;t be named because of company policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BP continuously evaluates and ranks new exploration
access opportunities around the world,&#8221; spokesman Mark Salt
said in an e-mail on Feb. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR), which is producing oil at India&#8217;s largest
onshore block, discovered gas in an offshore area in Sri Lanka&#8217;s
Mannar basin last year, estimated by the government to hold 1
billion barrels of oil. That&#8217;s equal to about 18 percent of
India&#8217;s proved oil reserves, according to BP data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gauge Potential &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cairn India started drilling a new well in the area this
month, Chief Executive Office P. Elango said in a Feb. 20
interview. It needs to drill two or three more wells before it
can gauge the potential of the reserves, Wickramasuriya said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sri Lankan Cauvery basin is a geological extension of
an area in India off the coast of Tamil Nadu state,
Wickramasuriya said. Reliance announced a gas discovery in a
deepwater well in the Indian waters of the basin in July 2007.
Four years later, it announced another discovery in the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loans from China&#8217;s Export-Import Bank and companies
including China Merchants Holding International and China
Machinery Engineering Corp. are helping Sri Lanka expand its
ports, power generation, and transportation networks. Chinese
oil explorers have yet to contact Wickramasuriya or his office
for the latest auction, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now that we&#8217;re launching the bid, some companies that
have been interested internally may now start contacting us,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polypore International Inc. (PPO)&#8217;s
Celgard unit filed a patent-infringement suit against Sumitomo
Chemical Co. (4005) over lithium-ion battery technology used in
electronics and electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, filed Feb. 22 in federal court in Charlotte,
North Carolina, claims Sumitomo is infringing patent 6,432,586,
which was issued in 2002 and covers a separator in high-energy
rechargeable batteries. The separators prevent short circuits
that can reduce efficiency and limit safety problems from
overheating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Chemical makes the chemicals and materials for
lithium ion batteries that use Celgard&#8217;s invention without
permission, according to the complaint. The separators are used
in batteries made by Panasonic Corp. (6752) for laptop computers,
Celgard said in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Celgard has a long history of innovation in lithium-ion
battery separators and is a world leader in this technology,&#8221;
Polypore Chief Executive Officer Robert Toth said in a
statement. &#8220;We have a responsibility to our customers,
partners, and shareholders to safeguard the investments we make
in innovation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo-based Sumitomo Chemical has filed a trademark
application to use the name &#8220;Pervio&#8221; for its separators,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polypore is seeking a court ruling that prevents the future
use of the invention, plus cash compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polypore, based in Charlotte, also makes Duralife
automotive batteries, and separators for health-care products
like hemodialysis machines and beverage filtration machines.
Weakness in the end market for electronic devices and electric
vehicles were blamed for a 4 percent drop in fourth-quarter
sales to $180.2 million, Polypore said Feb. 20. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reckitt Benckiser Faces Generic Threats After FDA Rejection [bn:WBTKR=RB/:LN]  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/) [] faces competition in
pharmaceuticals for the first time after the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approved two generic variants of its Suboxone
heroin-dependency drug, thwarting the company&#8217;s attempts to keep
rivals away from its most profitable business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said yesterday that two manufacturers have FDA
approval to produce generic Suboxone tablets in the U.S.
Competition could arrive within a month, according to Alex
Howson, an analyst at Jefferies International in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reckitt Benckiser was also hurt by the FDA&#8217;s rejection in a
Feb. 22 letter of the company&#8217;s September petition asking that
makers of similar medicines implement more safeguards. The FDA
also asked the Federal Trade Commission to look into claims by
generic drug makers of anti-competitive business practices on
Reckitt Benckiser&#8217;s part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow of competition to Suboxone has hung over the
Slough, England-based company since it lost U.S. patent
protection in 2009. The pharmaceuticals unit generated 21
percent of profit last year, and analysts yesterday reduced
their 2013 profit estimates by as much as 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reckitt Benckiser, which said it was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; by
the rejection of its petition, has said generics would eliminate
as much as 90 percent of tablet sales and up to 20 percent of
the newer film-strip version, which dissolves under the tongue
and has captured a 64 percent volume share in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the generics will come from Bridgewater, New Jersey-
based Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said in a statement
yesterday that is has received FDA approval for a generic
version of Suboxone tablets, to be available in March. The other
will be made by Actavis Inc. (ACT) of Parsippany, New Jersey, which
said in a statement it intends to begin shipping its product
immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reckitt Benckiser said it&#8217;s sticking with its decision to
stop producing Suboxone in tablet form next month as it weans
patients onto the film-strip version, which it unveiled in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

filed applications to register &#8220;Smart Oven&#8221; as a trademark in
Australia, Appliance magazine reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrolux AB (ELUXB)&#8217;s Electrolux Australia had previously applied
to register the term in Australia, according to the magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung has also filed a U.S. application for a &#8220;Smart
Oven&#8221; trademark, Appliance Magazine reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&#8217;s LG Electronics Inc. (066570) is also coming out with a

&lt;p&gt;Following a copyright infringement claim from the National
Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube
video-sharing service blocked and then unblocked a race fan&#8217;s
video of the crash at the Feb. 23 Daytona 500 race, the
Washington Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nascar asked for the removal of the video &#8220;out of respect
for those injured,&#8221; the race company said in a statement,
according to the Post report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube then put the video back up, saying &#8220;Our partners

unless they contain content which is copyright infringing, which
is why we have reinstated the videos,&#8221; according to the Post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Says Its Computers Were Hit by Cyber Attack &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest software company, said
in a statement that &#8220;a small number&#8221; of its computers were
hacked in a recent cyber attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computers were attacked by &#8220;malicious software&#8221; using
techniques similar to those experienced and reported recently by
Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Facebook Inc. (FB), the Redmond, Washington-based
company said in its statement posted on the company website Feb.
22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of its customers&#8217; computers were affected in the
attack, Microsoft claims. The company is in the middle of an
investigation of the attacks and said that this type of attack
&#8220;is no surprise&#8221; to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it doesn&#8217;t make any statements about such
attacks during the initial information-gathering process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Major&#8217; German Companies Hit With Cyber Attacks, Official Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan Keller, the head of the German Interior Ministry&#8217;s
department in charge of cyber security, told the European Police
Conference that 70 percent of all major Germany companies &#8220;are
threatened or affected&#8221; by cyber attacks, Der Spiegel reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;overwhelming number&#8221; of attacks targeting German
government agencies are coming from China, mainly Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou, according to Der Spiegel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposed German legislation may contain a requirement for
companies that are targets of cyber attacks to report them to
the government, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently, &#8220;it is a question of coincidence&#8221; that the
government learns about attacks against German companies, Der
Spiegel reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
sell bonds with a maturity of up to 50 years in Chile, making it
the first U.S. company to sell local debt in the Latin American
country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Goldman Sachs is seeking authorization to
sell bonds worth 20 million unidades de fomento, the country&#8217;s
inflation-linked accounting unit, which is equivalent to $966
million, according to Chile&#8217;s securities regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chile now has the largest concentration in assets under
management per capita in Latin America, which has made the
country one of the most attractive new debt capital markets in
the region for foreign issuers,&#8221; Michael DuVally, a spokesman
for the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said in an e-mailed
statement today. The bank is &#8220;actively considering&#8221; opening an
office in Chile, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Felipe Larrain has relaxed restrictions to
encourage foreign companies to sell debt in Chile as he seeks to
position the country as a financial-services hub. Brazilian
lender Banco Pine SA and Mexican homebuilder Corp. GEO SAB are
the only foreign companies to sell bonds known as &#8220;huaso,&#8221;
which means cowboy in Chile, since Larrain first announced the
initiative in March 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pension funds in Chile manage assets worth 61 percent of
Chile&#8217;s gross domestic product and equal to almost 120 percent
of the nation&#8217;s capital market, according to research by Mario Castro, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York. That
compares with 18 percent of GDP in Colombia and 3.1 percent in
Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LCH.Clearnet Ltd. named David Weisbrod to head its U.S. unit as the world&#8217;s largest interest-
rate-swap clearinghouse looks to expand outside Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weisbrod spent 40 years at JPMorgan Chase  Co., LCH said
in an e-mailed statement today. His most recent role at the New
York-based bank was vice-chairman of risk management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, the clearinghouse has agreed to sell a
majority stake to London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE), applied for a
license to operate in Australia and bought International
Derivatives Clearing Group LLC from Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and
other investors. The London-based company renamed IDCG as
LCH.Clearnet LLC and has made it the base for U.S. expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ian Axe is hiring as he seeks to
expand Europe&#8217;s largest clearinghouse overseas. Led by Axe and
chairman Jacques Aigrain, LCH is introducing new over-the-
counter services, including one for foreign exchange, as
regulators seek to push more trading onto clearinghouses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LCH&#8217;s SwapClear business said clearing revenue rose 36
percent to 59.8 million euros ($78.4 million) in 2012. The
increase was down to new members, existing members moving from
the introductory to the standard tariff and the growth of client
clearing, the firm said on Feb. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to setting up a U.S. unit, Axe is forging a
strategy for Asia and Australia. LCH is in talks to sell a
holding to Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX), the operator of Southeast
Asia&#8217;s biggest stock market, according to three people familiar
with the negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorothee Blessing, who rose to
become co-head of investment banking for Germany and Austria at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in a career spanning two decades, is
leaving the U.S. investment bank and securities firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessing, 45, has decided to retire from Goldman Sachs
after &#8220;20 years of distinguished service,&#8221; according to an
internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News today. Her departure
was first reported by German publication Manager Magazin, which
said she&#8217;s leaving for personal reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment banker, who is married to Commerzbank AG (CBK)
Chief Executive Officer Martin Blessing, was named managing
director in 2001 and partner in 2005. She joined Goldman Sachs
in 1992 as a Frankfurt-based financial analyst in the corporate
finance department. Blessing left the investment bank briefly in
2004 to take up a post at Deutsche Bank AG in Frankfurt before
returning to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessing, a mother of three, comes from a banking dynasty,
following in the footsteps of her father Paul Wieandt, the
former chairman of savings bank Frankfurter Sparkasse. Her
brother Axel Wieandt has worked at Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse
AG and was CEO of Hypo Real Estate Holding AG from 2008 to 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&#8217;s a rarity in German banking, which has a dearth of
female representation in company boardrooms. Blessing is the
only female partner at Goldman Sachs in Germany. About 10
percent of the bank&#8217;s 400 partners worldwide are women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German firms have resisted proposed quotas by the European
Union to address gender imbalances in corporate leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women hold 7.2 percent of seats on German executive boards
and 13.8 percent on supervisory boards, according to an October
study by the European Commission. That compares with an EU-wide
average of 15.8 percent and 16.8 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Cornelius Rahn and Adam Ewing" date="Feb 27, 2013 10:14 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-27/microsoft-google-eye-emerging-mobile-markets-as-firefox-looms.html"><headline>Microsoft, Google Eye Emerging Mobile Markets as Firefox Looms</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google Inc. (GOOG) have
no intention of leaving wireless customers in emerging markets
to the new Firefox operating system, which phone companies said
they hope to establish as a rival platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is working to lower the specifications for its
Windows Phone operating system to allow it to run on cheaper
devices, said Greg Sullivan, senior product manager for the
platform. Google is looking at expanding payment options for
applications to make it easier for customers without bank
accounts to buy them, said Jamie Rosenberg, vice president for
the Google Play store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Payment systems is the biggest opportunity there, but
it&#8217;s also the one that can take the longest,&#8221; Rosenberg told
reporters during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. &#8220;It is
an area that we&#8217;re looking at very carefully.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Google&#8217;s Android has cemented its dominance in the
smartphone market, billions of users in lower-income countries
don&#8217;t have a web-surfing handset. With the backing of hardware
makers and network operators who want to reduce their reliance
on Android, Mozilla Corp. on Feb. 24 unveiled a new operating
system focused on the extreme low end of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a way to maintain the &#8220;cool&#8221; options available
through smartphones for lower-priced phones is the key to making
significant inroads in emerging markets, Broadcom Corp. (BRCM) Chief
Executive Officer Scott McGregor said in an interview at the
Irvine, Califonia-based company&#8217;s booth in Barcelona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cheaper Cool &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a dual trend with smartphones,&#8221; McGregor said.
&#8220;There are high-end smartphones for people who are relatively
price insensitive, they want the coolest piece of technology,
and there are also people who say &#8216;I only want to spend $100,&#8217;
so we&#8217;ve helped take what&#8217;s in the cool, high-end smartphones
and driven the price down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for smartphones continues to soar, accounting for
almost half of all mobile phone sales. Manufacturers shipped 219
million smartphones last quarter, 36 percent more than the year
earlier, led by Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. (AAPL), which
dominated half the market, according to a report last month by
IDC, the Framingham, Massachusetts-based research firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The population of the emerging markets is extremely large
and that&#8217;s an attractive factor right there,&#8221; McGregor said.
Regular mobile-phone users in those regions are &#8220;going to
replace those with smartphones so the world is mostly going to
go to smartphones. If you can bring that into the hands of
people in these markets, it&#8217;s just a huge opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Africa &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft this month said Huawei Technologies Co., which
already is a leading hardware maker in Africa, would bring the
$150 4Afrika Windows phone to seven markets initially in the
region. Nokia Oyj, the world&#8217;s second-biggest maker of mobile
phones, unveiled its 139-euro Lumia 520 this week, its cheapest
Windows phone so far, in an attempt to broaden its smartphone
range and increase volumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As other Microsoft hardware partners like Nokia and HTC
Corp. sell more Windows phones, they should be able to drop the
price of individual handsets, said spokesman Bill Cox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the things is scale as we start to sell more of
these phones,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be able to better negotiate for
parts, drive the cost down, and that just happens now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows-based phones may at some point retail for as little
as $100, said Tony Mestres, vice president for the platform&#8217;s
partner and channel marketing. While cheaper ones may lack some
features like cameras, they still stay close to the
responsiveness of their pricier peers, Sullivan said today at
the Barcelona convention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Firefox Phones &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox-based phones will cost about $100 initially,
America Movil SAB (AMXL) Chief Marketing Officer Marco Quatorze said at
the software&#8217;s presentation. LG Electronics Inc., Huawei, ZTE
Corp. and TCL Communication Technology Holdings Ltd.&#8217;s Alcatel
One Touch brand are already planning to introduce smartphones
running on it, executives said on the eve of the MWC convention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android developers are starting to program slimmed-down
versions of applications for emerging markets, Rosenberg said.
Google is already facilitating shopping for emerging-market
customers by offering Google Play gift cards and to bill
purchases directly through the phone operator, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone growth in countries like India has been subdued
partly because of cost, Android-platform founder Andy Rubin
said. Infrastructure that&#8217;s fast enough to stream videos and
other content is only now being built, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s gonna take a little while, but when it does, a
lever is going to switch,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ViiV Healthcare Ltd., a joint
venture of GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) and two other drugmakers, plans
to license pediatric versions of its HIV drug abacavir to a
patent-sharing body backed by the United Nations to improve
children&#8217;s access to treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ViiV will grant the voluntary license to the Medicines
Patent Pool for the drug in the 118 countries where 99 percent
of children with HIV live, it said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 3.4 million children have HIV worldwide, and 72
percent of those in need of treatment don&#8217;t have access to
appropriate care because of a lack of affordable medicines,
according to ViiV. ViiV and other drugmakers including Gilead
Sciences Inc. also work with generic licensing partners in
countries like India and South Africa to produce low-cost
version of HIV therapies to sell in developing countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool builds on
the existing 13 licenses granted to our generics partners,&#8221;
Chief Executive Officer Dominique Limet said in a statement.
&#8220;The overarching goal of our efforts is to improve the lives of
children living with HIV.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ViiV is Glaxo&#8217;s joint venture with New York-based Pfizer
Inc. (PFE) and Japan&#8217;s Shionogi  Co. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) won the reversal
of more than $1 billion in punitive damages over a 2006 gasoline
leak that Maryland residents claimed fouled their drinking
water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Maryland appeals court yesterday reversed the punitive
damages and returned the case to a new trial in Baltimore County
Circuit court in Towson, Maryland, for a new trial. Irving,
Texas-based Exxon Mobil had argued that the award, handed down
in 2011 to 160 homeowners and businesses as part of a $1.5
billion jury verdict, was excessive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $1.5 billion verdict in the environmental case was the
second-largest in the U.S. in 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors issued the verdict in favor of residents of the
Baltimore County community of Jacksonville for losses tied to a
37-day gasoline leak from a local station&#8217;s tank farm. The spill
sent more than 26,000 gallons of fuel into the area&#8217;s
groundwater, according to court filings. The rural community
doesn&#8217;t have a public water system and relies on wells for
drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors, who awarded $495 million in compensatory damages
along with the more than $1 billion in punitive damages, found
the company liable for fraud as part of their verdicts. The
appeals court also reversed the fraud finding, and returned it
to the lower court as part of a new trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H. Russell Smouse, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs in
the case, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call yesterday after
regular business hours seeking comment on the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The evidence showed that we acted appropriately after the
accident and the court has agreed,&#8221; Charles Engelmann, an Exxon
spokesman, said in an e-mail. &#8220;We have apologized to the
Jacksonville community and we remain ready to compensate those
who were truly damaged by this unfortunate accident. We will
continue the cleanup.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Exxon Mobile Corp. v. Albright, in the Court of
Appeals of Maryland. The lower court case is Allison v. Exxon
Mobil Corp., 03-C-07-003809, Circuit Court for Baltimore County
(Towson). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) faces opposition to
its combined chairman-chief executive officer roles as two proxy
advisers urge shareholders to vote next week in favor of
splitting the positions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass Lewis 
Co. both recommend investors back a proposal by Connecticut
Retirement Plans  Trust Funds to separate the jobs in the
future that are now held by Robert Iger. Shareholders will vote
on the non-binding proposal at the March 6 annual meeting in
Phoenix, Disney said in a January proxy filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger, CEO since 2005, was named to the added role of
chairman last year, overcoming opposition from some proxy
advisers and the California State Teachers&#8217; Retirement System,
the second-largest U.S. public pension fund. Nine years ago,
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest entertainment company, separated the
posts to improve corporate governance during a shareholder
revolt against then Chairman and CEO Michael Eisner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disney&#8217;s performance during Mr. Iger&#8217;s tenure has been
nothing short of spectacular,&#8221; the Burbank, California-based
company said in a statement yesterday, citing a 76 percent
shareholder return in the fiscal year that ended in September.
&#8220;Disney has delivered results that speak for themselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger, 62, plans to step down as CEO in March 2015 and serve
as chairman until June 2016. Disney drew support from Egan-Jones
Proxy Services, which opposes splitting the roles and backs the
company&#8217;s pay and bonus plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Board Makeup &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure to split the top job at Disney comes as more
companies embrace independent board leadership. According to the
2012 Spencer Stuart Board Index Report, 57 percent of SP 500
companies have one person in the role of chairman and CEO, down
from 75 percent in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut Retirement&#8217;s proposal for separating the roles
would &#8220;apply prospectively so as not to violate any company
contractual obligation&#8221; at the time it is adopted, according to
Disney&#8217;s proxy filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, ahead of the annual meeting, Calstrs, ISS and
Glass Lewis all say they support Connecticut Retirement&#8217;s
proposal. ISS, in a Feb. 15 report, said it backs splitting the
jobs and opposes the company&#8217;s executive compensation plan.
Glass Lewis in a report to clients on Feb. 20 recommends
separating the posts and voting against the company&#8217;s executive
bonus plan as well as its overall executive compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Splitting Roles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calstrs, which holds 5.28 million Disney shares, said on
Feb. 14 it favors splitting the chairman and CEO roles and
opposes the election of six Disney directors, including Iger.
The $161 billion fund will also vote against Disney&#8217;s executive
pay plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pension fund generated a 1.8 percent return for the
fiscal year ended June 30, below its 7.5 percent target. The
three-year return was 12 percent, the fund said in a statement
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s earnings rose 24 percent to $3.13 a share in
fiscal 2012. Over Iger&#8217;s eight years as CEO, earnings have risen
at a 15 percent average annual rate, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Disney&#8217;s profit and share price performance have been
strong, discussions over company stewardship and executive pay
should be held by shareholders, said David Lewin, a professor of
management at the University of California Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One worries about excessive power in the executive
rank,&#8221; Lewin said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Clear&#8217; Standards &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney said in a January filing that its standards for
selecting a chairman are &#8220;clear and workable,&#8221; calling any
suggestion that the process led to a poor decision on Iger
&#8220;unfounded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company made changes to Iger&#8217;s compensation based on
investor feedback, according to the filing. Ninety-two percent
of the target value of Iger&#8217;s compensation is contingent on
financial results and the stock&#8217;s performance. He received $40.2
million in total compensation last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut Retirement is responsible for managing pension
funds for about 190,000 teachers, state, and municipal
employees, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calpers, the largest U.S. pension
fund, is supporting calls for Walt Disney Co. (DIS) to split the roles
of chairman and chief executive officer after Robert Iger&#8217;s
tenure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pension fund backs the Burbank, California-based
company&#8217;s board nominees, along with its executive compensation
and bonus plans, ahead of Disney&#8217;s March 6 annual meeting in
Phoenix, according to a website statement. The fund owns 5.07
million Disney shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Calpers believes if the chairman was not the CEO, the
board may be able to exercise stronger oversight of
management,&#8221; the pension fund said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the votes, the California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement
System sided with Calstrs, the state teachers&#8217; fund, in the non-
binding poll on top management roles. It also backed Calstrs on
a proposal to give large investors more clout in director
nominations. Calpers isn&#8217;t opposing the company&#8217;s board
nominees, as the other fund has. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, which has defended its governance and cited the
company&#8217;s industry-leading returns, gained 0.2 percent to $54.59
at the close in New York. The stock has advanced 9.6 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disney&#8217;s performance during Mr. Iger&#8217;s tenure has been
nothing short of spectacular,&#8221; the company in a statement this

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, sold $2.5 billion of bonds in its first
offering in almost a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producer of Sprite and Dasani water issued $500 million
of floating-rate debt maturing in two years to yield 2 basis
points less than the three-month London interbank offered rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also sold $1.25
billion of 1.15 percent, five year-debt to yield 45 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $750 million of 2.5
percent, 10-year bonds at a relative yield of 67 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds are rated Aa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, AA-
by Standard  Poor&#8217;s and A+ by Fitch Ratings, the ratings
companies said today in separate statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds will be used to redeem all of the company&#8217;s 5
percent notes due in August, 7.375 percent securities maturing
in 2014 and 4.25 percent debentures due 2015, as well as for
general corporate purposes, the Atlanta-based beverages maker
said today in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale follows a $2.5 billion issue from PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) on
Feb. 25, in which the world&#8217;s largest snack-food maker sold
$1.25 billion of 10-year debt yielding 2.76 percent, 21 basis
points above the 2.55 percent yield on Coca-Cola&#8217;s April 2023
debt issued today, Bloomberg data show. Moody&#8217;s rates the
PepsiCo bond Aa3, the same as the Coca-Cola issue. SP grades
PepsiCo&#8217;s securities at A-, or three levels lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prior Sale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola previously sold debt in March 2012, issuing $1
billion each of two-year floaters to yield 5 basis points less
than Libor and 0.75 percent, three-year securities to yield 35
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds due in March 2015 traded at 100.8 cents on the
dollar to yield 0.36 percent, or a 12.2 basis-point spread,
yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and
Morgan Stanley managed today&#8217;s offering, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the largest technology services provider, said its
business-analytics unit will add $4 billion more in revenue than
expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company raised its goal for annual sales from analyzing
business data to $20 billion by 2015, from an earlier $16
billion, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty told investors at
a presentation today. Customers are increasingly relying on
analytics to study the flood of data coursing through their
businesses, she said. Revenue from the category in 2010, when
IBM set the first goal, was about $10 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Data will be the basis of competitive advantage for every
company, for every industry, for the next decade&#8221; Rometty said,
based on her meetings with 500 chief executives of IBM clients
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, IBM&#8217;s business-analytics revenue grew 13 percent,
the company has said. Raising its sales goal for the analytics
segment could help ease investor concerns about the company&#8217;s
growth as a whole. Total annual revenue at the Armonk, New York-
based company is up less than 1 percent since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has divested $15 billion in revenue over the past 10
years, Rometty said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we had not, we would be a much larger company,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Potentially a faster-growing company. But we would be a
way lesser-margin company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Higher Margins &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of focusing on sales, the company has emphasized
gains in earnings per share. IBM has added higher-margin
software that handles data analysis and continued its shift away
from less-profitable hardware and services contracts. IBM
expects to generate more than half of its profit from software
by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has been thinking of ways to drive better performance
from its businesses with lower margins, including some labor-
based services, legacy application services and its industry-
standard computer business, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2005, IBM has spent more than $16 billion on 35
acquisitions to boost its analytics capabilities. Tealeaf
Technology, which IBM bought in June, helps chief marketing
officers analyze customer behavior, for example. Star Analytics
Inc., which IBM said it would buy this month, integrates
business information and helps sort out what&#8217;s important,
eliminating time-consuming steps for data analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also has developed some of its own products with an
analytics focus. The technology behind Watson, the computer that
beat humans on &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; in 2011, evolved into several tools
for health-care providers assessing cancer patients. At today&#8217;s
meeting, taking place at IBM&#8217;s research lab in San Jose,
California, Watson devised some of the food for the investors&#8217;
lunch, said John Kelly, IBM&#8217;s head of research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s shares fell less than 1 percent to $200.83 at the New
York close. They have risen 4.8 percent this year, compared with
a 6.2 percent gain in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s traders lost
money on two days during the fourth quarter, down from 10 in the
prior three months, as the largest U.S. bank stabilized a wrong-
way bet on credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses occurred on 41 days in 2012, compared with 27 days
in the prior year, New York-based JPMorgan said in a securities
filing today. The firm made money on 220 out of 261 trading
days, earning more than $200 million on eight days, the bank
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, ousted traders and
managers and replaced senior managers after the firm&#8217;s chief
investment office had more than $6.2 billion in losses last year
in the so-called London Whale episode. The unit, assigned to
invest the bank&#8217;s idle cash until needed, amassed a portfolio of
credit derivatives that generated the company&#8217;s biggest trading
loss ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The errant trade caused value-at-risk, or VaR, which
measures the most the bank might lose on 95 percent of trading
days, to surge 50.5 percent to $152 million in 2012 from an
average of $101 million in the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results aren&#8217;t directly comparable because the firm
changed its model twice in 2012 in an attempt to improve
accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The botched bets prompted the retirement in May of Chief
Investment Officer Ina Drew, spurred lawsuits from shareholders
and drew civil and criminal probes by at least three U.S.
agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the second-biggest U.S. lender by
assets, said that traders lost $50 million on their worst
trading day of 2012, a year in which the firm made money 98
percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank showed a profit on 243 of the 249 trading days,
with profit exceeding $25 million during 80 percent of the
sessions, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said today
in a regulatory filing. In 2011, Bank of America showed a profit
86 percent of the time, with the largest single-day loss of $119
million and losses topping $25 million on 12 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, owner of the world&#8217;s biggest brokerage,
lost money in its trading businesses on 37 days last year, down
from 64 days in 2011 and the fewest since 2007. The bank&#8217;s
traders lost money on 10 days in the fourth quarter, up from
eight in the third quarter, the New York-based company said Feb.
26 in a filing. Morgan Stanley (MS) made more than $100 million on 23
days in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) opposed Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s bid to pull Bruno Iksil, known as the
&#8220;London Whale&#8221; trader, into an $8.6 billion fight between the
biggest U.S. bank and the defunct investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman asked a bankruptcy judge this month to let it try to
force Iksil to testify on valuations of derivatives trades in
2008 that Lehman said spurred unnecessary margin calls and
hastened its bankruptcy. Lehman also sought to be released from
a confidentiality agreement with JPMorgan so it could file
supporting documents for the request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s own employees have acknowledged Iksil wasn&#8217;t
responsible for the derivatives trades, which were unrelated to
Lehman&#8217;s lawsuit against its former lender, the bank told the
judge in a federal court filing in Manhattan yesterday. For two
years, Lehman has been &#8220;well aware&#8221; of Iksil&#8217;s lack of
involvement in JPMorgan&#8217;s relationship with Lehman, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This application, therefore, should be seen for what it
is: a blatant misuse of this court&#8217;s processes to harass
JPMorgan with unnecessary and burdensome discovery and attempt
to disparage JPMorgan with the irrelevant assertion that it did
not act &#8216;altruistically&#8217; in dealing with Lehman,&#8221; the bank
said, asking the judge to turn down Lehman&#8217;s request.
&#8220;Plaintiffs have repeatedly tried grandstanding tactics to add
color to a lawsuit that is devoid of proof.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
According to JPMorgan, a key lender to Lehman during the 2008 credit crisis, the margin on fewer than a dozen derivatives trades that Lehman wanted to query Bruno Iksil about -- out of 70,000 such trades between the bank and its client -- wasn&#8217;t related to the collateral at issue in the lawsuit.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Genel Energy Plc (GENL) are hunting for elephants in Morocco. Not the animal, rather the giant oil fields that send explorers&#8217; market values soaring when they&#8217;re discovered in the frontier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oil companies are planning as many as 10 wells in Moroccan waters through 2014, according to Citigroup Inc. That&#8217;s twice what was drilled in the past decade and represents the fastest pace opening wells since at least 2000. U.K.-based Cairn Energy Plc (CNE) is scheduled to start drilling the Foum Draa prospect in the fourth quarter. Chevron, the second-biggest publicly traded U.S. oil producer, picked up three offshore licenses last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Africa has seen a string of big discoveries in recent years, including Tullow Oil Plc&#8217;s Jubilee field in Ghana in 2007, a find that exceeds 5 percent of Chevron&#8217;s global reserves. As more prospectors study Africa, Morocco&#8217;s stability through the Arab Spring revolts and 10-year tax holiday to drillers is making the country more attractive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Morocco has seen a huge explosion of interest in the last six months,&#8221; said Laura Loppacher, a Jefferies Group Inc. analyst in London who rates Cairn a buy. &#8220;It&#8217;s an area with several plays for people to target, but it&#8217;s still frontier and risky.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leu advanced to the highest
level in a month as foreign investors bought Romania&#8217;s local
debt a day before its inclusion in JPMorgan  Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s debt
market index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency appreciated before the March 1 entry and
addition to Barclays Plc (BARC)&#8217;s bond measure from March 31. European
stocks climbed as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi
and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled they would
maintain monetary support measures, boosting appetite for
riskier assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leu&#8217;s move is linked &#8220;to some more foreign inflows
into local currency debt instruments,&#8221; Mihai Tantaru, a
bucharest-based economist at ING Bank Romania SA, wrote in a
note today. The currency&#8217;s strengthening is &#8220;coupled with
falling yields for two-year to five-year bonds on the secondary
market,&#8221; Tantaru said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leu appreciated 0.2 percent to 4.3592 per euro, its
highest closing level since Jan. 21, by 5:10 p.m. in Bucharest,
after jumping 0.4 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From March, the structural flow of real money into
Romanian bonds will begin, which will mean better balance of
payments support for currency appreciation,&#8221; Roderick Ngotho, a
London-based strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,
wrote in a note yesterday. &#8220;Long leu is a good idea for the
medium term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romania&#8217;s October 2015, January 2016 and July 2017 bonds
currently meet the criteria for index inclusion as they
demonstrate the highest degree of liquidity, according to
JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country raised 4.03 billion lei ($1.2 billion) in leu-
denominated debt in February, more than the 3.7 billion lei
planned, after raising a record 11.4 billion lei last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s plan to
sell bonds with a maturity of up to 50 years in Chile may pave
the way for more offerings from U.S. companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets is seeking
authorization to issue bonds worth 20 million unidades de
fomento, the country&#8217;s inflation-linked accounting unit, which
is equal to $966 million, according to Chile&#8217;s securities
regulator. The offering would mark the first time a U.S. company
has sold debt in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs may help spur more American borrowers to sell
bonds in Chile known as &#8220;huaso,&#8221; or cowboy, after Finance
Minister Felipe Larrain relaxed limits to encourage foreigners
to sell debt locally, according to insurer Principal Vida Chile.
While Goldman Sachs has the option to sell bonds due in 50
years, it&#8217;s more likely to issue five- to seven-year notes,
Banco de Credito  Inversiones said. A borrower would pay about
0.39 percentage point more to sell five-year bonds in unidades
de fomento than in dollars, according to Bloomberg calculations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Finance Ministry has been promoting this and it&#8217;s an
opportunity for them to diversify their funding,&#8221; Felipe Alarcon, an economist at BCI, said in a telephone interview from
Santiago. &#8220;This is the first U.S. company to issue huaso bonds
and that&#8217;s very significant and may bring others.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Actively Considering&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has 6.15 percent senior dollar bonds due in
April 2018 that yield 2.32 percent. Swapping that into Chilean
unidades de fomento would leave the borrower paying a yield of
about 3 percent plus inflation, according to Bloomberg
calculations, or 0.42 percentage point more than central bank
and government bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian lender Banco Pine SA and Mexican homebuilder
Corp. GEO SAB are the only foreign companies to sell huaso debt
since Larrain first announced the initiative in March 2011. The
U.S. bank&#8217;s bond plan shows that the policy is bearing fruit,
Larrain said yesterday, according to La Tercera newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is selling the bonds in response to the
Finance Ministry&#8217;s efforts to open the local market, Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chile now has the largest concentration in assets under
management per capita in Latin America, which has made the
country one of the most attractive new debt capital markets in
the region for foreign issuers,&#8221; DuVally said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is &#8220;actively considering&#8221; opening an office in
Chile, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Very Appropriate&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pension funds in Chile manage assets worth 61 percent of
Chile&#8217;s gross domestic product and equal to almost 120 percent
of the nation&#8217;s capital market, according to research by Mario Castro, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That compares with 18 percent of GDP in Colombia and 3.1
percent in Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile&#8217;s high savings rate and limited number of large
companies mean there is a shortage of assets available for
investment, according to Valentin Carril, who oversees $5
billion as the chief investment officer at Principal Vida Chile
in Santiago and often buys foreign bonds that he swaps back into
local currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile has the fourth-highest gross national savings rate in
South America after Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia, according to
International Monetary Fund data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Further Diversify&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs bond sale &#8220;is very appropriate for life
insurers like ourselves,&#8221; Carril said. &#8220;It&#8217;s diversification
and we don&#8217;t have to worry about currency derivatives. When the
process of opening up markets was announced, I don&#8217;t think they
really envisaged American companies coming here. It&#8217;s big news.
This is part of Chile becoming more open to the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chilean life insurers would welcome a bond due in about 30
years as it allows them to match the average duration of their
portfolios with the duration of the annuities they sell, Carril
said. The government plans to sell 30-year fixed-rate bonds for
the first time this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco Santander Chile is advising Goldman Sachs on the
transaction, according to an e-mailed statement from the
Santiago-based bank&#8217;s press office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s offering in Chile will also help the bank
&#8220;further diversify&#8221; its investor base, DuVally said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan Pincheira, an economist at Banchile Corredores de
Bolsa SA in Santiago, says that while Chile has one of the
&#8220;deepest markets for inflation-linked bonds,&#8221; companies can
get cheaper financing abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less &#8216;Attractive&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra cost of selling 10-year inflation-linked bonds in
Chile and swapping it back into dollars is about eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, according to Bloomberg
calculations that exclude the cost of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling bonds in Colombia would also be cheaper. Its
government bond yields have fallen 60 basis points this year,
making it about 1 percentage point cheaper to sell notes in
Colombian pesos and then swap to dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how attractive it may be from a yield point
of view as rates abroad are lower than local ones,&#8221; Pincheira
said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile introduced its inflation-linked accounting unit in
1967. Seventy-percent of the country&#8217;s local debt market is
denominated in unidades de fomento. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on 10-year inflation-linked government bonds fell
10 basis points in February to 2.58 percent. The yield on 10-
year fixed-rate bonds dropped four basis points to 5.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Default Swaps &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to buy Chile&#8217;s
10-year dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries widened 20 basis
points this month to 87 basis points. The spread was at a record
low 51 basis points on Jan. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting Chilean bonds against default for
five years increased one basis point to 69 basis points at 10:23
a.m. in New York. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value
in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
if the borrower fails to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso has appreciated 1.4 percent this year. It gained
0.1 percent today to 472.71 per U.S. dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile has a so-called flat yield curve compared with the
U.S., which means companies can obtain lower borrowing costs for
similar-maturity debt, according to Gonzalo Menendez, the chief
investment officer for mutual funds at Cruz del Sur
Administradora General de Fondos in Santiago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile&#8217;s 30-year inflation-linked bonds yield 2.8 percent,
nine basis points more than 20-year debt and 22 basis points
more than 10-year notes. U.S. Treasuries due in 30 years yield
3.09 percent, or 1.19 percentage points more than the 10-year
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The local long-term yield curve is very flat; this means
that they can pay a lower yield than if they went to sell at a
similar maturity in another country,&#8221; Menendez said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;Demand will come mostly from insurance
companies, to match their long-term assets with their
liabilities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s own employees have acknowledged that Iksil wasn&#8217;t

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and OMV Petrom SA (SNP)
plan to drill a second well in the Neptun block, which they are
jointly exploring in the Black Sea, as early as the end of this
year, said John Knapp, the head of Exxon&#8217;s local unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies may complete three-dimensional studies by
the middle of this year as they seek to deepen the block&#8217;s
appraisal to evaluate the resources and their commercial value,
Knapp said in an interview in Bucharest today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we drill, it will be late this year, depending on the
availability of the rigs,&#8221; Knapp said. &#8220;For a new appraisal of
the block, we need to complete the 3D seismic studies and
interpret the data and there is also additional drilling that
needs to be done.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Petrom started searching for oil and gas in the
Romanian portion of the Black Sea and conducted the first
drilling operation of the Domino-1 well in the Neptun block at
the end of 2011. OMV AG (OMV), Petrom&#8217;s majority owner, said last
February that the Domino-1 well encountered 70.7 meters of net
gas pay that resulted in a preliminary estimate of accumulation
ranging from 1.5 to 3 trillion cubic feet (42 to 84 billion
cubic meters). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Abigail Moses" date="Feb 28, 2013  5:38 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-28/morgan-stanley-joins-jpmorgan-in-recommending-swap-flatteners.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley Joins JPMorgan in Recommending Swap Flatteners</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan
Stanley are recommending investors take advantage of a record
difference between the cost of short- and long-term bond
insurance to hedge against Europe&#8217;s debt crisis reigniting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It costs 44 basis points more to insure investment-grade
corporate debt for 10 years than it does to buy five-year
protection using the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-
default swaps. The gap reached 46 basis points last week and is
up from five basis points at the start of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors can profit by buying short-dated contracts and
selling longer-end protection in a so-called curve flattening
trade, according to the New York-based banks. The difference
between near- and long-term insurance costs has been becoming
increasingly exaggerated since August, after European Central
Bank President Mario Draghi vowed to do whatever&#8217;s necessary to
protect the euro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Credit volatility and curve flatteners remain our
preferred hedges,&#8221; Andrew Sheets, the head of European credit
strategy at Morgan Stanley in London, wrote in a note. &#8220;The
greatest risk to European credit remains a return of sovereign-
led systemic risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term debt insurance typically costs more than short-
dated protection, though Draghi&#8217;s support for the European
single currency has increased the gap, or steepened the credit
curve. The spread between three- and five-year default
protection is also near the widest ever, at 42 basis points
compared with 12 basis points in September 2011, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Curves Inverted &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationships became inverted at the peak of the global
financial crisis in 2008, when it cost 31 basis points more to
insure bonds for three years than for five, and 38 basis points
more for five years than for 10. Those inverted yield curves
signalled that investors perceived default risk as imminent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a contract protecting 10 million euros ($13 million) of debt for
five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are overly comfortable with short-dated risk,&#8221;
said Saul Doctor, a strategist at JPMorgan in London.
&#8220;Flatteners at the moment are an inexpensive hedge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Andrew Harris" date="Mar 01, 2013  6:30 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-01/coca-cola-must-face-lawsuit-over-orange-juice-labeling.html"><headline>Coca-Cola Must Face Lawsuit Over Orange Juice Labeling</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, must face a consumer lawsuit challenging the
labeling of its Simply Orange, Minute Maid Premium and Minute
Maid Pure Squeezed orange juice brands, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumers allege in court filings that Coca-Cola has
marketed Simply Orange as &#8220;100 percent pure squeeze&#8221; and &#8220;not
from concentrate&#8221; since 2006, when in truth the juice is
&#8220;chemically flavored, heavily processed, designed and modified
and is not &#8220;100% pure squeezed,&#8221; &#8220;simply orange,&#8221; &#8220;pure&#8221;
or &#8220;natural.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such labeling is deceptive and violates state consumer-
protection laws, according to the consumers. The Atlanta-based
company has made misleading representations about Minute Maid
products too, for which it&#8217;s liable for breaches of contract,
according to the complaint, which combines 13 different cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Fernando J. Gaitan Jr. in Kansas City,
Missouri, today said the allegations were sufficient to overcome
defense arguments that the company&#8217;s claims were so-called
puffery or that the case was barred by federal law. Gaitan also
rejected Coca-Cola&#8217;s claim the consumers failed to show they had
been injured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs have asserted false advertising,
misrepresentation and deceptive practices claims,&#8221; he said in a
nine-page ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#8217;s media relations department didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to voice-mail and e-mail messages seeking comment on the
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Combined Complaint &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combined complaint, filed with the Kansas City court in
August, included plaintiffs from New York, New Jersey,
California, Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola asked Gaitan in September to throw the case out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs&#8217; claims must be dismissed insofar as they are
premised on promotional statements, such as the Simply Orange
and Minute Maid Pure Squeezed product names,&#8221; the company said
in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those names, it said, are &#8220;indisputably true, not capable
of misleading reasonable consumers as a matter of law or
constitute non-actionable puffery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Simply Orange Juice Marketing  Sales
Practices Litigation, 4:12-md-2361, U.S. District Court, Western
District of Missouri (Kansas City). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warburg Pincus LLC chose JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) to lead an initial public offering of Bausch  Lomb
Inc. that would raise as much as $1.5 billion, said people with
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering would give Bausch  Lomb, whose products
include contact lenses and eye-care solutions, an enterprise
value of $9 billion to $10 billion, said the people, who asked
not to be named because the information hasn&#8217;t been publicly
disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warburg, which bought Bausch  Lomb in a leveraged buyout
in 2007, would get a higher valuation for Bausch  Lomb in an
IPO than in a private sale, one of the people said. New York-
based Warburg has leaned toward taking the company public after
private bids came in at less than $9 billion, below the asking
price of at least $10 billion, people familiar with the
situation said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underwriters for Bausch  Lomb&#8217;s IPO include Bank of
America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. (C), the people said. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), which Warburg had hired to explore the private sale,
will also work on the IPO, the people said. Goldman is still
trying to find a buyer though that is less likely now than an
offering, said one of these people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Grossberg, a spokesman for Bausch  Lomb, and Ed
Trissel, a spokesman for Warburg, declined to comment.
Representatives for JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank
of America declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warburg is disposing of Bausch  Lomb as it seeks
investments for a new fund that documents obtained by Bloomberg
News show has a target of $12 billion. Warburg took Bausch 
Lomb private in a deal valued at $4.6 billion, including debt,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vision Care &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $10 billion sale would have given Warburg a more than 200
percent gain on its $1.7 billion equity investment in the 2007
buyout, people familiar with the matter said in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bausch  Lomb has three businesses: pharmaceuticals, vision
care and surgical, according to documents provided by the
company in December. Pharmaceuticals and vision each account for
about 40 percent of sales, with the rest coming from surgical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the buyout, Bausch  Lomb&#8217;s earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization have risen to just under
$700 million from about $400 million, people familiar with the
company&#8217;s financial situation have said. The company projected
2012 Ebitda of more than $700 million and double-digit revenue
growth, another person said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Hormel Foods Corp. announced in
January that it had signed a $700 million deal to acquire the
Skippy brand from Unilever NV, analysts joked about putting
peanut butter on Spam. Investors liked the combination of
foodmakers: Hormel&#8217;s stock rose 7 percent by the end of the next
day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the start of 2012, investors have applauded companies
that braved a weak global economy to grow their core business
through acquisitions. It was a bright spot in a dismal year for
mergers, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its April
issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stock price for the buyer has gone up after making
smart acquisitions,&#8221; says Steven Baronoff, chairman of global
mergers and acquisitions at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. &#8220;A
lot of companies will need to enhance growth through
acquisition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global MA volume shrank 8.7 percent to $2.2 trillion last
year, according to Bloomberg data. Chief executive officers were
skittish about tie-ups because of the European recession and
concerns that fiscal changes could slow the U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) led the 2012 Bloomberg Markets
ranking of MA advisers, earning $1.77 billion in fees. The
firm&#8217;s work on four of the largest mergers of 2012 helped it
retain its No. 1 position for the 10th straight year. Goldman
advised copper producer Xstrata Plc in its announced sale to
Glencore International Plc (GLEN) for $47 billion -- the biggest hookup
of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asian Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy companies were the most active dealmakers as firms
bought assets in advance of an expected rise in natural gas
prices. Oil exploration and production companies were the top
takeover targets by value, with $144 billion in deals. MA by
consumer goods firms also rose last year, while industrial and
financial companies cut fewer agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian companies bought more firms in the U.S. -- a trend
that&#8217;s likely to continue, says John Studzinski, head of
Blackstone Group LP (BX)&#8217;s advisory unit in New York. U.S.
acquisitions by Japanese firms totaled $74 billion, up from $44
billion in 2011. In the biggest such merger of the year,
Softbank Corp. of Tokyo agreed to pay $37.8 billion in October
for Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I see Asian companies wanting to acquire brands,
technology and other expertise in open markets,&#8221; Studzinski
says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big deals announced on Feb. 14 have given bankers hope
that 2013 will be a better year for MA. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)
and 3G Capital Inc. agreed to buy H.J. Heinz Co. for about $23
billion, and US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) will merge with American
Airlines in an $11 billion deal. Some CEOs, concerned that low
interest rates may start to rise later this year, may make
acquisitions before cheap financing disappears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Big Oil Firepower &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have the most attractive debt market in a
generation,&#8221; says Osmar Abib, co-head of Credit Suisse Group
AG&#8217;s energy investment-banking practice. He expects big oil to
forge hookups. &#8220;They have plenty of firepower,&#8221; Houston-based
Abib says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) fell the most in
more than five months after Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. cut the
company to sell from hold, saying it may have to transfer $13
billion to its U.S. unit because of new capital rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank slid as much as 6.2 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since Sept. 26, and declined 4.3 percent to 33.57
euros at the 5:45 p.m. close in Frankfurt. The stricter
requirements may hurt profit at Europe&#8217;s biggest bank by assets
and require it to ask shareholders for more money, Goldman Sachs
analysts including Jernej Omahen said in an e-mailed report from
London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Such an intragroup transfer would cause a sharp reduction
in Deutsche Bank&#8217;s non-U.S. capitalization, which could increase
pressure for an external recapitalization,&#8221; the analysts wrote.
&#8220;The proposal is also stringent on funding, as it calls for a
liquidity stress test. The impact on Deutsche Bank&#8217;s profit
could be substantial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve proposed in November ordering 23
foreign banks to adhere to stricter capital requirements to
reduce risks to the financial system. Deutsche Bank co-Chief
Executive Officer Anshu Jain said in January he wants his firm
to be &#8220;very focused on the U.S.&#8221; because of its economic
prospects and the presence the bank has built there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Step Backward&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elke Koenig, chief of German regulator Bafin, criticized
the U.S. plan yesterday. It was a &#8220;unilateral decision&#8221; and a
&#8220;step backward&#8221; for international coordination on regulation,
she said on the sidelines of a banking conference in Frankfurt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, the least capitalized of Europe&#8217;s four
biggest investment banks, has narrowed the gap with peers by
building reserves without diluting the holdings of its owners
with a share sale. Jain told reporters in January that he can&#8217;t
rule out such a sale should regulation tighten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA, the
world&#8217;s oldest bank which yesterday received a 4.1 billion-euro
($5.3 billion) government bailout, said today that it sued
Deutsche Bank and Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) over two derivatives that
soured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathryn Hanes, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank in London,
said the company had no immediate comment on the case, as did
Rob Davies, a spokesman for Nomura. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s 12-month price estimate for Deutsche Bank is 37.3

&lt;p&gt;The leu retreated from its highest
level in almost six weeks after Romania cut its monthly local-
debt sales plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency reversed an earlier gain after the Finance
Ministry said today it plans to raise 3 billion lei ($893
million) through auctions in March, below the 3.7 billion lei
target and 4 billion lei of securities sold last month. The leu,
the second-best performer among European, Middle Eastern and
African peers tracked by Bloomberg this year, has benefited from
an announcement local Romanian debt is being added to JPMorgan 
Chase  Co. (JPM) and Barclays Plc (BARC)&#8217;s bond indexes from March 1 and
March 31, respectively, according to Societe Generale SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The weaker leu move coincided with the less-than-expected
issuance plan and only one bond of the three JPMorgan bonds will
be reopened,&#8221; Esther Law, a London-based director of emerging-
markets strategy at Societe Generale, said by e-mail today.
&#8220;This may have something to with the expectation on potential
inflows&#8221; in the &#8220;near term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leu depreciated 0.2 percent to 4.3645 per euro by 6:23
p.m. in Bucharest, after earlier strengthening to its highest
level since Jan. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romania&#8217;s October 2015, January 2016 and July 2017 bonds
currently meet the criteria for index inclusion as they
demonstrate the highest degree of liquidity, according to
JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment banking, after five long, hard years of negative or anemic growth, job cuts, pay cuts and public lashings, is on the verge of a comeback. Really, it is -- if the data can be believed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All the economic statistics show that the markets are ripe for a rebound in mergers and acquisitions and equity issuance in 2013, dealmakers say. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s top investment banker is guarded in his forecast, and he isn&#8217;t alone, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its April issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More from the April 2013 issue of Bloomberg Markets:&lt;/p&gt;

SLIDESHOW: The Bloomberg 20


BLOOMBERG 20: Debt | Equities | Mergers

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I hesitate to be the one that says 2013 will be the year, because invariably it may not,&#8221; says Christian Meissner, BofA&#8217;s head of global corporate and investment banking. &#8220;But I think that we&#8217;re pretty close to it changing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The past five years haven&#8217;t been kind to investment bankers. MA deal volume fell off a cliff after peaking at $4.1 trillion in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last year, it dropped 8.7 percent to $2.2 trillion after an early resurgence fizzled along with projected growth rates in emerging economies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As 2012 proceeded, there was reason for hope. The Greek and Italian bond markets didn&#8217;t melt down like they did in 2010 and 2011. The U.S. didn&#8217;t almost default on its debt. Yet corporate chieftains continued to hoard their cash. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No Bold Deals &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Boards weren&#8217;t ready to do a lot of bold strategic deals last year,&#8221; says Michael Cavanagh, co-chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s corporate and investment bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was No. 1 in the Bloomberg 20, Bloomberg Markets&#8217; ninth annual ranking of the best-paid investment banks measured by the fees they earn. The largest U.S. lender took in $3.97 billion in fees last year, a 24.8 percent increase over 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has topped the Bloomberg 20 in four of the past five years, and last year it was the top investment bank in debt and equity fees as well as overall. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ranked No. 2, after scoring the No. 1 spot for 2011. Goldman led the ranking for MA fees, as it has every year since the Bloomberg 20 began. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan fell 39 cents to $48.53 at 9:38 a.m. in New York trading. Goldman Sachs slid $2.48 to $147.28 and Morgan Stanley (MS) declined 61 cents to $21.94. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While fees for MA and equity issuance fell for 2012, total fees rose 3.7 percent, to $50.9 billion, driven higher by a surge in the refinancing of corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A single soured 2012 deal put a chill in the market. Morgan Stanley managed the initial public offering of Facebook Inc. (FB) in May -- and faced withering criticism when the Nasdaq listing was marred by technical difficulties and the stock, by September, had fallen more than 50 percent below its $38 opening price. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Facebook shares have since rebounded to $27.25 as of Feb. 28. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Dow 14,000 &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) topped 14,000 for the first time since 2007 on Feb. 1, corporate executives remained skittish. CEOs are choosing to conserve their cash as a result, bankers say. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Much of MA and capital markets activity is based on psychology,&#8221; says Mark Eichorn, who was appointed global co-head of investment banking at Morgan Stanley with Franck Petitgas in November. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Corporations around the globe were sitting on a record $1.5 trillion in cash as of Sept. 30, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase, even though bankers say their balance sheets have never been stronger. The Federal Reserve has held benchmark interest rates near zero for more than four years and injected trillions of dollars into the U.S. economy. Markets are liquid and stable, and investors are desperate for higher-yielding assets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Measuring Risk &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you look at the statistics, in terms of the drivers of MA activities, you&#8217;d think that this would be the busiest MA market, but it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; Bank of America&#8217;s Meissner says. &#8220;Many CEOs are comfortable waiting until some of the systemic risk recedes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America Merrill Lynch fell one spot to No. 5 in the Bloomberg 20 list with $3.16 billion in fees last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett and Michael Dell aren&#8217;t waiting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dell and private-equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC agreed on Feb. 5 to take Dell Inc. private for $24.4 billion in the biggest leveraged buyout since 2007. Then on Feb. 14, Buffett announced he would partner with Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann to buy H.J. Heinz Co. in a $23 billion deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other big February transactions included the $11 billion merger of bankrupt AMR Corp., parent of carrier American Airlines, with US Airways Group Inc., and Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA)&#8217;s plan to buy U.K. cable operator Virgin Media Inc. for $23.3 billion. That would be the biggest media company deal since a $17.4 billion merger created Thomson Reuters Corp. in 2007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Deals Rise &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;That brought total announced deals through Feb. 15 to $288.2 billion, compared with $246.6 billion for the same period in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Make no mistake, we are seeing movement,&#8221; Cavanagh says. &#8220;As we speak to company directors, it is clear that much of last year&#8217;s uncertainty is gone for the moment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the February deals &#8220;represent the beginnings of a winter thawing, but they don&#8217;t mean a resurgence to pre-crisis deal levels just yet,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;David M. Solomon, co-head of investment banking at Goldman Sachs, also sees light amid the gloom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Confidence around the world is better,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Markets are up all over the world. People are moving assets out of cash and more-liquid investments into more risk investments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those bankers who did well in overall fee revenue in 2012 were leaders in debt underwriting, which accounted for 37.7 percent of the total fee pool, up from 27.7 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bond Record &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A record $3.69 trillion in corporate bonds were issued last year as companies rushed to lock in low financing rates, with borrowing costs falling to an all-time-low average of 3.24 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase dwarfed all competitors in debt underwriting with $1.51 billion in fees, up 43.8 percent from the year before. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The low cost of selling bonds helps explain the decline in stock issuance in 2012, says Paul Stefanick, co-head of Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)&#8217;s global investment banking coverage and advisory. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not that the equity markets were bad; it&#8217;s just that the debt markets were a much better alternative,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Absent a strong debt market, it would have been a gruesome year for investment bankers. Fees from equity issuance fell 3.9 percent to $14.6 billion, while MA fees dropped 15.8 percent to $17.1 billion. Fees from debt issuance surged 41 percent to $19.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;UBS Layoffs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not everyone made a killing in the debt markets. UBS AG (UBSN) announced in October that it would largely exit fixed-income trading and fire a total of 10,000 workers from that and other divisions. UBS ranked No. 9 in the Bloomberg 20, with $1.97 billion in total 2012 fee revenue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), which rose two places to No. 4, with $3.18 billion in fees, said in December it would cut 11,000 jobs and pull back from some emerging-market nations. Morgan Stanley, which fell one spot to No. 3, with $3.5 billion in fee revenue, eliminated 1,700 jobs from its investment bank in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have made it more costly to be a banker since the crisis, imposing stiff new capital requirements on certain activities that have squeezed profits. Altogether, the 13 largest investment banks in 2012 announced plans to cut $15 billion in expenses, including compensation, and $1.03 trillion in risk-weighted assets, which eat up capital, consulting firm McKinsey  Co. said in a January report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banks that aren&#8217;t producing high-enough returns may need to shrink their geographic footprint, cut back on the services they provide or reduce compensation, bankers say. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8217;Borrowed Time&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re not earning your cost of capital, you&#8217;re probably living on borrowed time,&#8221; Cavanagh says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cavanagh was tapped by CEO Jamie Dimon in July to run a newly combined corporate and investment bank with Daniel Pinto after leading JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s internal investigation into the more than $6.2 billion trading loss in a London unit of the bank&#8217;s chief investment office. Pinto, who was previously co-head of fixed-income trading, helped unwind the trade and is managing the remaining position. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The combined units allow the bank &#8220;to bring the whole firm to bear for our clients,&#8221; Cavanagh says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8217;Global Superleague&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most investment banking in the future will be done by a &#8220;global superleague&#8221; of universal banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America that provide one-stop shopping for loans, MA advice and other services for large corporations, BofA&#8217;s Meissner says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shakeout in the industry isn&#8217;t done yet, bankers say. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say that it&#8217;s rampant and having a huge impact on business now, but there&#8217;s no question that a number of players are withdrawing from certain investment-banking activities,&#8221; Goldman&#8217;s Solomon says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the short term, bankers hope the optimism behind the Heinz, Dell and other early 2013 deals carries forward -- and isn&#8217;t undermined by a new crisis, such as the failure of Congress and the White House to prevent massive budget cuts known as the sequester. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to string a couple quarters together of decent corporate earnings, no major fiscal macro crises and some of the very constructive themes that we&#8217;ve seen in the debt and equity markets to continue in order to unlock what we all believe to be pent-up demand,&#8221; Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Eichorn says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the dam breaks, bankers expect the U.S. to be a major deal destination. International acquirers buying U.S. targets accounted for $218.1 billion of volume in 2012, or about 10 percent of all global deals. That amount was up 22 percent from 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;U.S. Opportunities &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies in mature yet slow-growing economies, such as Australia, Canada, Europe and Japan, will continue to seek opportunities in the U.S., Solomon says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They want to reposition their portfolios to a developed economy with better growth trajectories, and the United States fits that bill,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Economic stability in the U.S. also makes it an attractive target for CEOs in emerging economies such as China. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have fiscal cliff issues and all the political issues and a relatively low-growth economy,&#8221; Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Stefanick says. &#8220;All of which is true. But compared to the rest of the world, we&#8217;re still the cream of the crop.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How We Crunched the Numbers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To identify the Bloomberg 20, we examined fees that investment banks collected for underwriting securities and advising on mergers and acquisitions worldwide in 2012. Not all of those commissions have been disclosed, so we extrapolated total fees from those made public in regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg collected data on the underwriting fees that banks were paid for about 60 percent of equity sales and about 20 percent of bond issues in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To calculate the dollar fee, multiply the disclosed percentage by the value of the issue awarded to the underwriter. For deals whose fees weren&#8217;t disclosed, the average disclosed fee was applied. That&#8217;s the sum of the disclosed fees for a firm divided by the total value of the issues. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Weighted Average &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For firms that disclosed less than 30 percent of their fees in either equities or debt, we applied a weighted average of issues for which fees were disclosed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Preferred stocks are included with bond issues. Because fees for preferreds tend to be higher -- the average fee in 2012 was 2.327 percent versus 0.481 percent for all other bonds -- we calculated these fees separately. Municipal and asset-backed bonds were excluded from the bond ranking, as were bonds with call periods and maturity lengths shorter than 18 months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In equities, we calculated the fees for initial public offerings and secondary offerings separately because they tend to have different fee structures. We excluded equity-linked securities. In both equities and bonds, we excluded self-led deals, which are the sale or issuance of a financial institution&#8217;s bonds or equities by its own investment bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Calculating Fees &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;MA fees are rarely disclosed and typically vary according to the size of a deal and whether a bank is advising the target, acquirer or seller. We based our ranking on the fees disclosed in about 600 MA transactions going back to 2009. We took an average of the fees for advisers to targets, acquirers and sellers for deals in five different size categories and applied those percentages to transactions for which fees weren&#8217;t disclosed. We divided the fees equally among advisers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In practice, investment-banking fees can vary from firm to firm. A bank&#8217;s position in this ranking may differ from its standing in traditional league tables, which are based on the dollar value of transactions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which generated 53 percent of revenue from sales and trading last year, recorded losses from that business on 16 days in 2012, the fewest since the bank started reporting the figure in 2004. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The days of losses, detailed in a regulatory filing from the New York-based company today, were down from 54 in 2011 and below the previous low of 19 days in 2009. Traders made more than $100 million on 41 days, down from 54 days a year earlier and the least since 2005. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it&#8217;s been redeeming hedge-fund holdings to comply with the Volcker rule and the firm outlined risks to its businesses from attempts to regulate foreign subsidiaries. Revenue from sales and trading advanced 5 percent to $18.1 billion in 2012 even as value-at-risk, a measure of how much the firm could lose from trades in a single day, was the lowest since 2005, the firm reported in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bulk of what you&#8217;re seeing is the decline in market volatilities, it&#8217;s not a reduction in risk or capital deployment,&#8221; Harvey M. Schwartz, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief financial officer, told analysts on Jan. 16. &#8220;There was no top- down directive, for example, to take less risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world&#8217;s biggest brokerage, reported Feb. 26 that it lost money in its trading business on 37 days last year, down from 64 in 2011 and the fewest since 2007. Traders in JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s investment bank lost money on seven days in 2012, down from 26 in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
renewed its bid to draw Bruno Iksil, known as the &#8220;London Whale&#8221;
trader, into an $8.6 billion fight with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defunct investment bank filed a revised request
yesterday to a federal judge in Manhattan, seeking permission to
ask for international judicial assistance to force Iksil, a
French national, to answer questions, as he is unwilling to do
so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the supporting documents for its request, Lehman
attached e-mails from JPMorgan&#8217;s collateral operations group
about a dispute over three derivatives trades in 2008, shortly
before Lehman collapsed in bankruptcy. Two of the transactions
listed Luis Buraya as the trader, together with Iksil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other documents in the case show Iksil saying, when asked
about the trades, &#8220;I do not know. This is not me,&#8221; before
referring Lehman to Buraya. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, a key lender to Lehman during the 2008 credit
crisis, said this week the derivatives margin that Lehman
currently wanted to query Iksil about -- which was resolved at
the time by returning disputed margin to Lehman -- wasn&#8217;t
related to the collateral at issue in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s inquiry concerned fewer than a dozen derivatives
trades, out of 70,000 such trades between the bank and its
client, and would add nothing to the &#8220;millions of pages of
documents and eighty depositions of current and former JPMorgan
personnel&#8221; obtained by Lehman in the past two years, JPMorgan
said in filings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Libyan Investment Authority, the
nation&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, is cooperating with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission on its probe into the fund&#8217;s
dealings with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LIA is also considering legal action against Goldman
Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, to recover losses
on its investments, the fund said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. The SEC has been investigating possible violations of
U.S. anti-corruption laws by Goldman Sachs for more than a year.
Reuters reported the LIA&#8217;s cooperation yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Nester, an SEC spokesman, and Michael DuVally, a
Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to comment when contacted by
Bloomberg News yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Muammar Qaddafi, the sovereign wealth fund had assets
of about $60 billion and turned to financial firms including
Goldman Sachs to achieve its goal of 8 percent annual returns.
The bets didn&#8217;t always work out, leading to losses of $1.75
billion on structured products bought in 2007 and 2008, $900
million of which was with Goldman Sachs, the fund&#8217;s former
chairman said in June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, lowered its estimate for potential
losses from legal claims by $100 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Reasonably possible&#8221; legal costs are as much as $3.5
billion, the New York-based firm said today in a report on the
quarter that ended Dec. 31, without giving specific reasons for
the decline. That compares with $3.6 billion three months
earlier and $3.4 billion at the end of June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks started making public estimates of possible losses
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told finance
chiefs in October 2010 that they should disclose such costs
&#8220;when there is at least a reasonable possibility&#8221; they may be
incurred, even if the risk is too low to require reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate doesn&#8217;t include potential losses from legal
matters that are at an early stage or where the firm can&#8217;t
determine the potential amount, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AudioCodes Ltd. (AUDC), the Israeli company
whose Internet calling technology is used by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), is
beating the biggest telecommunications companies on the Nasdaq
market on prospects demand for its products will boost sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of AudioCodes advanced 11 percent in February,
extending its rally in the past six months to 186 percent and
making the Lod, Israel-based company the best performer on the
Nasdaq Telecommunications Index. The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity
Index (ISRA25BN) of the largest U.S.-traded Israeli equities in New York
dropped for a third week, led by Allot Communications Ltd. and
Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AudioCodes, which supplies Internet voice call products to
Microsoft, is benefiting from plans by the world&#8217;s largest
software maker to catch up with Cisco Systems Inc. in the
Internet telephony and communications market, which Forrester
Research Inc. (FORR) predicts will reach $14.5 billion in 2015.
AudioCodes will probably report in 2013 the fastest revenue
growth in three years, according to Oppenheimer  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Microsoft people are crazy excited about it, and
there is a real opportunity here for AudioCodes to make a name
for themselves,&#8221; Andrew Uerkwitz, an analyst at Oppenheimer,
said by phone from New York on Feb. 28. &#8220;This company really
had an identity crisis, and once AudioCodes got its strategy
figured out, investors came back to it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of AudioCodes gained 0.1 percent to 15.30 shekels,
or the equivalent of $4.11, at the close in Tel Aviv today. The
benchmark TA-25 Index fell 0.4 percent to 1,216.09. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet Phones &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AudioCodes plunged to a three-year low of $1.37 in August,
as sales slumped for six consecutive quarters. The company&#8217;s
focus on Microsoft&#8217;s Lync communications system has lured back
investors that had abandoned the stock as its price tumbled 45
percent during 2011 and 2012, Uerkwitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Microsoft&#8217;s Lync program, which offers
corporate phone, video and instant messaging services, grew 35
percent in the second quarter, according to a Jan. 24 earnings
call. The Redmond, Washington-based company has about 5 million
Lync users, with revenue from the segment nearing $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of AudioCodes&#8217; Lync products, which range from
Internet handsets to call recording software, may grow as much
as 40 percent in 2013, Uerkwitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Israel-US gauge retreated 0.3 percent to
87.26 last week as the TA-25 (TA-25) index increased 0.3 percent to
1,221.47. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allot, the Hod Hasharon, Israel-based maker of products
that track wireless traffic, declined 9.9 percent to $13.09 in
the week, making it the worst performer on the Bloomberg Israel-
US gauge. The shares in Tel Aviv dropped 8.4 percent to 48.75
shekels, or $13.10, today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Stopped Spending&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procera Networks Inc. (PKT), a U.S. competitor that also helps
cable companies and mobile operators report on network traffic,
plunged 32 percent last week as its fourth-quarter earnings and
revenue missed analysts&#8217; estimates. Slumping growth at Fremont,
California-based Procera may signal a broader slowdown in the
industry, Wedbush Securities Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The customers have stopped spending temporarily,&#8221; Sanjit Singh, a New York-based analyst at Wedbush who rates Allot (ALLT)
shares neutral, said by phone on March 1. &#8220;It&#8217;s not that the
projects are going away, we just don&#8217;t know when they&#8217;re going
to land.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mellanox dropped 3.1 percent to $51.19 in its fourth
consecutive week of declines, while shares traded in Tel Aviv
slipped 0.4 percent to 191.5 shekels, or $51.39, in the week
ended Feb. 28. The stock was the worst-performing company on the
TA-25 Index in the last six months with a 59 percent plunge
through Friday. Mellanox shares gained 0.1 percent to 191.60
shekels, or $51.47, in Tel Aviv today. &lt;/p&gt;
