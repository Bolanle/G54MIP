<p>The federal judge overseeing a
settlement between International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and
U.S. regulators over alleged foreign bribes said he won''t drop
demands for reports of possible wrongdoing by the company. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, who refused to accept the
deal the company struck with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, denied IBM''s request to alter a requirement that he
be told about any future law enforcement or administrative or
probes. He agreed to narrow his insistence that IBM tell him of
accounting violations to include only those involving payments
covered by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. </p>
<p>Bear in mind, this is a company that has a history of
violating the books and records provision of the FCPA, Leon
said today during a 20-minute hearing in Washington. This is a
company that has made major payments to foreign governments in
the past. </p>
<p>Leon said in December there''s a growing awareness among
federal judges of the need for more rigorous review of corporate
settlement agreements. Even so, his extended challenge to an
agreed-upon settlement between a company and the government is a
rare occurrence. Of 34 foreign bribery settlements the SEC
reached with companies since 2010, only two others failed to win
judicial sign-off in less than three months. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is giving its wealthiest clients the chance to invest in the single-family rental market after other investments linked to the U.S. housing recovery jumped in value. </p> <p>The firm''s unit that caters to individuals and families with more than $5 million, put client money in a partnership that bought more than 5,000 single family homes to rent in Florida, Arizona, Nevada and California, said David Lyon, a managing director and investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Investors can expect returns of as much as 8 percent annually from rental income as well as part of the profits when the homes are sold, he said. </p> <p>The bank''s wealthy clients are joining a growing number of private-equity firms and individuals buying rental homes in the regions hardest hit by the U.S. housing crash. Blackstone Group LP (BX) has spent $2.7 billion, and said last month it accelerated purchases as home prices rise faster than anticipated. Even after home values in November gained by the most in six years, investors are wagering on rental properties as an alternative to housing-related stocks and mortgage debt that''s already soared. </p> <p>The traditional places people might look -- homebuilder stocks and appliance makers -- probably aren''t the best places for new investments, said John Buckingham, chief investment officer at Al Frank Asset Management in Aliso Viejo, California, which oversees about $4.5 billion. They''ve had fantastic runs. </p>

<p>Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM), UBS AG (UBSN) and Depfa Bank Plc took advantage of the city of
Milan, tricking the municipality into agreeing to a financing
deal that didn''t meet its objective of cutting borrowing costs,
wrote the judge who convicted the four banks in the fraud case. </p>
<p>The banks should have informed the municipality of the
charges related to the derivatives that were part of the
transactions, Judge Oscar Magi in Milan wrote today in
explaining the convictions he handed down in December. </p>
<p>The city, which wasn''t up to carrying out its own
analysis of the economic advantage of the financing package,
needed protection and clear information, Magi said.
Information deficiencies manifested themselves and caused a
grave asymmetry of information, he wrote. </p>
<p>The banks, whose employees involved in the case were
registered with Britain''s Financial Services Authority, violated
U.K. rules by failing to inform the city that it was a
counterparty to the lenders rather than a customer. The banks
acted as arrangers of a bond sale, or advisers to the
municipality, as well as its counterparties, the judge wrote. </p>
<p>When contacted by Bloomberg News, the banks said they
disagree with the verdict and plan to appeal, reiterating their
stance following the December ruling. Chris Hamilton, a
spokesman for the FSA in London, declined to immediately
comment. </p>
<p>Magi in December ordered that about 90 million euros ($122
million) of assets be seized from the banks, the amount of their
profit, and that they pay sanctions of 1 million euros each. He
also convicted nine bankers of fraud and suspended their
sentences. </p>
<p>The judge said Italian securities rules indicate that there
is an obligation to disclose the cost of derivatives to the
client, a duty that in this case was reinforced by the multiple
roles played by the banks. Under FSA rules, banks are required
to shield customers from conflicts of interest and failed to
inform Milan of the obvious conflict, Magi wrote. </p>
<p>The contracts, given the amounts involved, are likely to
have been vetted by the most senior managers of the banks,
according to Magi. The bankers then executed directives they
were given, he wrote. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. will introduce
computers from Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Acer Inc. (2353) and other
manufacturers in the next two months, seeking to make up for the
dearth of tablets and touch-screen devices that marred the debut
of its flagship Windows 8 software. </p>
<p>A Hewlett-Packard Envy series device, doubling as a tablet
and laptop, is available for order now at $849.99, while Acer
will sell a 10-inch tablet for $499. Asustek Computer Inc. (2357)''s
convertible tablet weighs just over 1.5 pounds and has two
batteries for 19 hours of battery life, according to Aidan
Marcuss, principal director at Windows Research. </p>
<p>Chip delays and Microsoft''s restrictions on new hardware
meant that the company''s Windows operating system, released 
on Oct. 26, was featured on a limited number of tablets. 
Windows 8 was designed to win back customers moving to
Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad and tablets with Google Inc.''s Android
software, making it critical that Microsoft''s hardware partners
offer compelling touch-screen devices. </p>
<p>I don''t have concerns about awareness, and I don''t have
concerns about interest, Tami Reller, chief financial officer
for the Windows unit, said in an interview, when asked about
Windows 8 demand. Now I feel increasingly good about mapping
that interest to having those customers find the device they
want on the shelf. </p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard Executive Vice President Todd Bradley last
month described Windows 8''s initial sales as slower than many
had expected. Microsoft now has 2,000 devices certified for use
with the new Windows, double what was available when the
operating system was released, Reller said. </p>
<h2>New Devices </h2>
<p>Another concern at the release in October was the lack of
machines with Intel Corp. (INTC)''s latest low-power chips, code-named
Clover Trail. In early December, only two Clover Trail devices
were on sale in the U.S., and only low quantities, Marcuss said. </p>
<p>The new machines, targeted at consumers, from Hewlett-
Packard, Acer and Asustek all use that chip, which provides a
longer battery life. </p>
<p>Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)''s ThinkPad Tablet 2, aimed at business
customers with 10 hours of battery life, goes on sale this month
for $699. Microsoft is also trying to get cheaper notebooks with
touch features into stores since Window 8''s new design is
focused around finger swipes and other gestures. </p>
<p>New devices that run on Windows RT, a variant of the
operating system that runs on chips with technology from ARM
Holdings Plc (ARM), won''t be released this spring, Reller said.
Microsoft is still focused on getting the five announced in
October into stores in large numbers, she said. One partner,
Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), has opted not to sell its Windows RT
tablet in the U.S., she said. </p>
<h2>Limited Selection </h2>
<p>Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) Chief Executive Officer Paul Jacobs, whose
company makes chips for Windows RT tablets, raised concerns
about the limited selection, a result of Microsoft''s
restrictions on which manufacturers could make tablet devices
for that system, he said. Jacobs said in an interview last week
that his company hasn''t been surprised by muted demand for the
new Windows, as shown by the chipmaker''s cautious forecast. </p>
<p>The fact that there were only a handful of manufacturers
that were allowed to participate, definitely in my mind held
down the competition on form factors and everything that I would
have liked to have seen, Jacobs said. </p>
<p>Jacobs said he''s confident in the long-term opportunity for
his chips in computers, and remains committed to investing in
the business. </p>
<p>Reller said more Windows 8-based tablets will probably be
sold, compared with those running Windows RT. </p>
<p>We will scale over time, but right now we''re focused on
making sure the designs that have been built do have commercial
availability and commercial success, and we''ll stay focused on
that for the short-term, said Reller, who declined to provide
updated sales numbers. </p>

<p>The biggest investment-grade bond
loss in 14 months is bolstering Bank of America Corp. (BAC)''s view
that the unprecedented bull market in the notes is over.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. disagrees. </p>
<p>With bonds of the most-creditworthy borrowers from the U.S.
to Europe and Asia losing 0.8 percent in January, Bank of
America strategist Hans Mikkelsen cut his forecast for
investment-grade debt returns last week, saying a sustained
shift away from notes will cause borrowing costs to soar. At
JPMorgan, Eric Beinstein said he''s skeptical bond losses will
deepen because the biggest debt buyers are unlikely to switch to
equities and central banks will keep supporting the market. </p>
<p>Debt strategists at the two biggest U.S. banks are coming
into conflict after a 44 percent rally since 2008 left yields at
a record-low 2.55 percent in December and the best start to a
year for stocks in two decades added $2.6 trillion to their
market value. JPMorgan anticipates more government stimulus that
bolsters credit as the International Monetary Fund lowers its
forecast for global growth. </p>
<p>Despite concerns about a potential rotation out of
credit, demand for investment-grade debt will continue to be
supported, Greg Hall, managing director in debt capital
markets at Barclays Plc in New York, wrote in an e-mail. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, won support from Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite for shale-gas exploration plans that some of the
country''s residents and lawmakers oppose. </p>
<p>Lithuania needs to find out to how far its shale-gas
reserves can go as an alternative to Russian natural gas,
spokeswoman Daiva Ulbinaite quoted the president as saying today
after a meeting with Jay Johnson, Chevron''s head of Eurasia,
Europe and Middle East exploration and production, in the
capital, Vilnius. </p>
<p>East European countries, including Poland and Ukraine, are
turning to shale gas in their efforts to lower energy costs and
their dependence on Russian supplies. Chevron in October bought
50 percent of a Lithuanian oil and gas recovery company and in
January submitted the only bid in a tender for shale-gas
exploration rights in the Baltic nation. Some landowners and
lawmakers have urged the government to halt the tender on
concern that the exploration process could contaminate ground
water. </p>
<p>We expect to be able to engage with the local
communities and assuage their concerns, Chevron''s Johnson told
reporters at the president''s office. We''re very pleased with
the chance to help create Lithuania''s energy future. </p>
<h2>Reserve Potential </h2>
<p>Lithuania, which wants to reduce it''s total dependence on
Russia''s Gazprom OAO (GAZP) for natural gas supplies, probably has
about 180 billion cubic meters of recoverable shale gas, KPMG
said in a report in May. That''s the equivalent of 60 years of
gas consumption in the country, at current usage. </p>
<p>Shale-gas reserves in Lithuania, at an estimated depth of 2
kilometers (1.2 miles), are twice as close to the surface as in
neighboring Poland, so should be easier and cheaper to extract,
KPMG said, citing geological studies. </p>
<p>Chevron will assist LL Investicijos UAB, the Lithuanian
company it half owns, with well design and seismic exploration. </p>
<p>Our first step is the assessment of what the resource
potential is, Johnson said. At that point we report to the
government and we work with the government to determine any
future progress. </p>
<p>Chevron recently opened an office in Lithuania, he said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President Gary Cohn said he''s bullish on China even after his firm last week sold a $1 billion stake in Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation''s largest bank. </p> <p>You can absolutely still make money off Chinese banks, Cohn, 52, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television''s Susan Li in Hong Kong yesterday, without naming specific banks. We are very positive, optimistic, but cautious, about where China''s going. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs''s sale of the stake followed an almost 50 percent advance in ICBC stock from its 2012 low. Investing in local lenders in China has reaped bigger profits for foreign banks than operating their own franchises in the world''s second- largest banking market. BNP Paribas SA in December said it plans to increase investments in Bank of Nanjing Co. </p> <p>The Wall Street firm sold part of an investment first made in January 2006 when Goldman Sachs and client funds it manages agreed to invest $2.58 billion in Beijing-based ICBC. The U.S. bank and the funds have since offloaded ICBC shares at least five times, data compiled by Bloomberg show, and the New York- based firm has recorded more than $3.1 billion of gains on its proprietary holding, according to company filings. </p> <p>In the latest transaction, Goldman sold 1.35 billion shares at HK$5.77 each, 3 percent lower than the Chinese lender''s HK$5.95 closing price in Hong Kong on Jan. 28. It continues to hold more than $1 billion of ICBC stock, Cohn said. </p> <h2>Very Happy'' </h2> <p>We will continue to be invested in China, he said. It''s been an important strategic relationship with them for a long period of time and we''re very happy being shareholders of ICBC. </p> <p>Global financial firms including Temasek Holdings Pte, Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. invested a combined $33 billion in Chinese banks from 2001 to 2009, according to data compiled by the China Banking Regulatory Commission. Profits at the biggest local lenders, which are controlled by the government, have since defied the global economic slowdown and risen to a record. </p> <p>Earnings at ICBC, the world''s biggest lender by market value, probably gained 10 percent to 229.7 billion yuan ($36.8 billion) last year, according to the average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. That would mark its seventh year of record profit since becoming publicly traded in 2006. </p> <p>Although shares of Hong Kong-listed Chinese lenders have rallied since mid-September as the U.S. announced a third round of quantitative easing, they continue to trade at close to record-low valuations on concern that non-performing loans will rise. ICBC is trading at about 6.7 times its estimated earnings for 2013, compared with 11.2 for Goldman Sachs and 9.1 for JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p> <p>Chinese banks are set to report fourth-quarter results next month and first-quarter earnings in April. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Michael J.

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is using a $2 billion loan to help finance Dell Inc. (DELL)''s $24.4 billion buyout to bolster one of the largest makers of computers using Windows software and fend off competition from Google Inc. and Apple Inc. </p> <p>Steve Ballmer, Microsoft''s chief executive officer, discussed the loan with Dell founder and CEO Michael Dell, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. Microsoft opted for a loan rather than an equity investment to avoid rankling other personal-computer makers that use Windows, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the matter isn''t public. </p> <p>Dell is going private as it seeks leeway to cut jobs and adopt strategy shifts needed to court high-margin customers spending billions on data centers. Microsoft, which counts on Dell to sell PCs and servers with its software, has a vested interest in boosting Dell''s competitiveness without jeopardizing relationships with other partners such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) </p> <p>Microsoft is taking a more neutral stance, not giving Dell a favored nation status among their PC partners, Jeffrey Fidacaro, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt  Co., said in an interview. I was anticipating that they would get a preferred share or something structured, as opposed to a $2 billion loan. That gives them less of a presence and influence on the management after the deal. </p> <h2>PC Ecosystem'' </h2> <p>Microsoft''s investment helps to support the long term success of the entire PC ecosystem, the company said in a statement. Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment beyond the statement. </p> <p>Microsoft won''t be involved in day-to-day operations, Dell Chief Financial Officer Brian Gladden said in an interview. </p> <p>Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) advised Microsoft on the transaction, one of the people said. </p> <p>Taking a stake in Dell would have amplified a rift with PC makers that developed after Microsoft pushed into the hardware market in October with its first machine, a tablet called Surface, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc. The loan may be a less worrisome alternative, he said. </p> <p>It''s likely to be somewhat more palatable under those terms, he said. There will still be some uneasiness until the full details of the relationship become clear in practice not just terms on paper. </p> <h2>Similar Path </h2> <p>Microsoft went down a similar path in 2011, when it announced a partnership agreement with handset manufacturer and Windows Phone licensee Nokia Oyj. (NOK1V) Still, Microsoft maintains a close relationship with other Windows Phone sellers, including HTC Corp. (2498) </p> <p>With the loan to Dell, Microsoft adds to a lengthening list of strategic investments in technology companies. The software maker has a stake in Facebook Inc. and invested $300 million in a Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS) subsidiary to focus on e-readers. It also invested $5 billion in 1999 into what was then ATT Corp. </p> <p>Microsoft invested $150 million in then-foundering Apple in 1997. The investment contributed to the very survival of Apple and helped put the company on the long path toward becoming the world''s most valuable technology company. </p> <p>Hewlett-Packard seized on Dell''s buyout as an opportunity to seek new business, saying in a statement that its competitor faces a tough road ahead. </p> <p>Leveraged buyouts tend to leave existing customers and innovation at the curb, Hewlett-Packard said. We believe Dell''s customers will now be eager to explore alternatives, and HP plans to take full advantage of that opportunity. </p> <p>Dell''s shares gained 1.1 percent to $13.42 at the close in New York, while Hewlett-Packard advanced 2.7 percent to $16.61 and Microsoft was little changed at $27.50. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Lisa Lerer and James Rowley" date="Feb 05, 2013  4:13 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-05/goldman-s-blankfein-yahoo-s-mayer-in-obama-immigration-session.html"><headline>Goldman''s Blankfein to Join Obama Immigration Meeting</headline><body><![CDATA[

was added to the European management committee in 2006. </p>
<p>In each of his roles at the firm, Jim has served our
clients by formulating views on global economic and market
themes and helping them to be positioned for the most
significant investment opportunities, Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn wrote in the
statement. </p>
<p>O''Neill said in an e-mail he hadn''t decided what he''ll do
when he leaves Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Tim O''Neill and Eric Lane will continue to co-head the
asset-management division, and there are no plans to replace
O''Neill as chairman, Andrea Raphael, a Goldman Sachs
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The position was created for him
when he joined the unit, she said. </p>
<p>O''Neill developed the BRICs theory following the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, after becoming Goldman Sachs''s sole chief
economist, to reflect the waning influence of the U.S. on the
world''s economy. In the years afterward, it was central to
Goldman Sachs''s economic outlook. </p>
<h2>Manchester Fan </h2>
<p>He is a frequent commentator for media outlets, appearing
on Bloomberg Television and CNBC. An Englishman who is the son
of a postman and graduated from Sheffield University, he has
also worked for Bank of America Corp. </p>
<p>Before joining Goldman Sachs, O''Neill was head of global
research for Swiss Bank Corp., a firm he joined in 1988,
according to his biography. That company bought S.G. Warburg 
Co., the advisory firm founded by Siegmund Warburg, in 1995,
before joining with Union Bank of Switzerland to form UBS AG in
a deal completed in 1998. </p>
<p>A lifelong fan of Manchester United, the most successful
soccer club in the U.K., O''Neill once sat on its board and later
was part of a group considering making a takeover bid. </p>
<p>O''Neill recently published a book entitled The Growth
Map: Economic Opportunity in the BRICs and Beyond. It updated
and expanded his theory that the BRIC nations would join the
U.S. and Japan as the world''s biggest economies by 2050. </p>
<h2>Extremely Overvalued'' </h2>
<p>So popular has the BRIC term become that its leaders now
meet for annual summits alongside South Africa. O''Neill remained
a defender of the theory even as the economies slowed and the
membership of Russia was questioned by some because of
governance concerns. </p>
<p>In his current role, O''Neill publishes a regular report to
clients, combining views on the global economic outlook with
details of his travels and commentary on Manchester United''s
performances. </p>
<p>His most recent report, released Jan. 25, cited
considerable evidence that economies are improving around
the world and suggested the yen is extremely overvalued. </p>
<p>He told Bloomberg Television in October that he didn''t
apply to replace Mervyn King as the next governor of the Bank of
England, saying he didn''t think it was appropriate. </p>

<p>A senior Republican lobbyist at
Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. is leaving the bank for a job with Rio
Tinto Group, the world''s second biggest mining company. </p>
<p>Todd Malan, 46, will be vice president of external affairs
for the U.S. and South America at the mining company. He will
handle regulatory and legislative issues, and work with
institutions like the World Bank and the International Finance

<p>Malan joined Goldman Sachs in 2008 as the bank, long known
as a breeding ground for Treasury secretaries and top White
House aides, became a symbol of Wall Street greed during the
subprime loan meltdown. He was part of a new lobbying team
brought in to deal with the fallout from the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Along with running Goldman Sachs''s Political Action
Committee, Malan lobbied on the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that
overhauled U.S. financial regulation. He also worked on the
bank''s defense of subprime loan investigations by the Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and the Securities and

2010 for $550 million. </p>
<p>At London-based Rio, one of Malan''s first tasks will be
helping the company in Washington as it seeks to protect an
estimated $14 billion investment in a Mongolian copper mine that

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (G) has been
hired by the Russian government to burnish the nation''s image
overseas and attract more institutional investors. </p>
<p>The bank has signed a three-year agreement with the Economy
Ministry and the Russian Direct Investment Fund to advise on
issues such as communicating government decisions and setting up
meetings with investors, according to Sergei Arsenyev, Goldman
Sachs''s managing director of investment banking in Moscow. </p>
<p>The pool of investors that Russia talks to is the
dedicated emerging-markets base, and it''s been difficult for
them to break out to a wider investor pool and a global base,
Arsenyev, 41, who handles the bank''s Kremlin relations, said in
a telephone interview. We think valuations in Russia remain
very attractive, and there are many interesting opportunities
for investors on the public and private side. </p>
<p>President Vladimir Putin last year ordered the government
to improve Russia''s standing in the World Bank''s Doing Business
rating to 20th by 2018. It climbed eight positions to 112 in the
latest study in October. While that''s better than emerging-
market competitors India and Brazil, Russia remains the worst
among major economies in graft, Transparency International said
in December in its annual Corruption Perceptions Index. </p>
<p>We don''t know how to communicate with investors, Deputy
Economy Minister Sergei Belyakov told reporters last week. </p>
<h2>Privatization Push </h2>
<p>The world''s largest energy exporter plans to raise a record
$10 billion from asset sales this year, First Deputy Prime
Minister Igor Shuvalov said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television last month. While corruption continues to be an
issue, it''s less so for foreign investors who have already
committed to Russia, Shuvalov said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is one of 23 foreign and domestic banks
selected to advise Russia on its 1 trillion-ruble ($33 billion)
privatization program. Last year it helped advise OAO Sberbank,
Russia''s largest lender, on a $5.2 billion equity sale. </p>
<p>The agreement with the Kremlin is similar to a corporate
broking arrangement, which every FTSE 100 company has, said
Arsenyev, who switched to investment banking a year ago after 17
years in research. It''s to make sure the market message is
crystallized. Our work is strictly limited to the investor base
and making sure the government is meeting the right people. </p>
<h2>Promoting Moscow </h2>
<p>British companies typically hire corporate brokers to serve
as a liaison with investors and to help them comply with stock
market rules. The assignments, compensated with a nominal fee or
sometimes unpaid, can lead to more lucrative business such as
managing share deals and advising on mergers and acquisitions. </p>
<p>The deal also includes advising Russia on its bid to
transform Moscow into an international financial center and to
attract more capital, Arsenyev said. Moscow ranked 64th on the
Global Financial Centers Index in September, a survey compiled
by Z/Yen Group, a London-based consulting firm. </p>
<p>The world''s premier financial centers have succeeded
because  of good rule of law, Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs
chief executive officer, said at last month''s World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland. </p>
<p>You want to go into a place that''s fair, where if you
make an investment you can recover your investment, he said at
a panel discussion. You can go into the U.K. and sue the U.K.
government and have a reasonable chance that a court will decide
that fairly. There are other places where I think people
implicitly know they can''t. </p>
<h2>Goldman''s Struggles </h2>
<p>Blankfein, 58, who is a member of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev''s advisory committee for turning Moscow into a
financial center, has struggled to build a business in Russia.
The New York-based bank scaled back operations in Moscow soon
after opening an office in 1994 amid a worldwide retrenchment.
It returned in 1998, managing Russia''s sale of bonds a month
before the country defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt.
That prompted it to withdraw almost entirely before ramping up
again in 2006. </p>
<p>Since the default, the bank has been overlooked by Russia
for three sovereign bond deals in 2010 and 2011 and $7 billion
in euro bonds last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Russia could borrow as much as $7 billion this year,
according to the budget. The government is prepared to wait for
companies to meet their borrowing needs to avoid crowding the
market, Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said in a Dec.
24 interview. </p>
<h2>Private Equity </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs, along with BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and Singapore-
based Templeton Asset Management Ltd. signed an accord with the
Russia''s sovereign private-equity fund in June to invest in
Russian companies preparing for initial public offerings. The
fund is led by Kirill Dmitriev, a former Goldman Sachs banker. </p>
<p>The U.S. securities firm is led in Moscow by Paolo Zannoni,
who took over last year from co-heads Chris Barter and Jean Raby. Barter left the firm to set up a private-equity group,
while Raby returned to France with Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Zannoni, who had been chairman of Italian investment
banking, previously worked in the former Soviet Union for Fiat
SpA. He had been sent to Moscow in the early 1990s by then
chairman Giovanni Agnelli to buy Russian carmaker OAO AvtoVAZ,
which was supposed to be privatized. </p>
<p>The Moscow Exchange''s valuations trail the biggest emerging
markets, while Russian issuers prefer to sell equities in
London. Russia''s benchmark Micex Index (INDEXCF) has gained 4.5 percent
this year, beating the MSCI''s Emerging Markets Index''s 1.1
percent advance. </p>
<p>Andrey Kostin, chairman of VTB Group, Russia''s second-
biggest bank, said on Nov. 15 that the country was undervalued
because of its image of corruption and lack of necessity to
comply with law. </p>
<p>Companies on the Micex Index have an average valuation of
5.9 times estimated earnings, compared with 16.6 for India''s BSE
Sensex Index (SENSEX), 19.9 for Brazil''s Bovespa (IBOV) and 13.4 for China''s
Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP), data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. turned
negative on Turkish bank stocks, saying it''s concerned that
central bank tightening will hurt earnings while rising U.S.
Treasury yields lure funds away from the country. </p>
<p>Turkish bank earnings will probably peak this quarter and
then decline sequentially, Goldman Sachs analysts Dmitry Trembovolsky and Alexey Butylin said in an e-mailed report dated
yesterday. </p>
<p>Yapi  Kredi Bankasi AS (YKBNK), part-owned by Italy''s UniCredit
SpA (UCG), is most vulnerable to a retreat in its share price, the
analysts said. The Turkish bank stock index has gained 42
percent in the past 12 months, outperforming the 7.8 percent
gain by the MSCI Emerging Markets Financials Index (MXEF0FN) over the same
period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yapi  Kredi
shares surged 93 percent last year. </p>
<p>The governor of the nation''s central bank, Erdem Basci, has
said he''ll limit loan growth to 15 percent this year as he
attempts to reduce the import-driven current-account deficit. </p>
<p>The bear case for Turkish banks concentrates on three
points: risks to earnings, sizable outperformance over the past
12 months and rising U.S. yields, Goldman Sachs (GS) said. As
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields have moved to 2 percent, the key
bull argument on fund flows has weakened. Repatriation of flows
into the U.S. has potential to threaten Turkish macro stability,
and could ultimately result in a much more hawkish Turkish
central-bank response. </p>
<p>The value of foreign investors'' holdings of Turkish stocks
and bonds fell by more than $1 billion in the week to Jan. 25,
according to data published by the central bank on Jan. 31.
Foreign investors purchased $5.9 billion in Turkish stocks and
$17.3 billion in Turkish bonds in the year to Jan. 25, according
to the data. </p>

<p>Visa Inc., the world''s biggest payments network, posted a fiscal first-quarter profit that beat analysts'' estimates as consumer card purchases accelerated. </p> <p>Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 advanced 26 percent to $1.29 billion, or $1.93 a share, from $1.03 billion, or $1.49, a year earlier, the Foster City, California-based company said today in a statement. That beat the $1.79 average estimate of 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Results include significant continued investments in our core business, accelerating international expansion and the deployment of next-generation payment solutions, Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf, who succeeded Joseph W. Saunders in November, said in the statement. </p> <p>Scharf, 47, inherited a goal of deriving more than half of Visa''s revenue from outside the U.S. by 2015. A long-term global consumer shift to electronic payments, particularly in the Asia- Pacific region, may help. Purchases there are projected to generate 42 percent, or $9.03 trillion, of worldwide card spending at merchants in 2016, up from 36 percent at the end of 2011, the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter, said in its latest issue. </p> <h2>Cash Flow </h2> <p>Visa said it would generate about $6 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2013, fueled by tax benefits related to a settlement of a lawsuit over credit-card swipe fees, or interchange. Guidance on taxes from California officials led Visa''s tax rate to fall to 28 percent in the quarter and boosted results by 11 cents a share, the company said. </p>

<p>ExxonMobil Corp. told a jury that the
number of New Hampshire wells contaminated with a gasoline
additive is less than one-fifteenth as many as the state has
contended in its trial seeking damages from the oil company. </p>
<p>David Lender, a lawyer for ExxonMobil, cross-examined a
witness who is a state expert on oil spills today in Concord.
New Hampshire has said that as many as 5,590 wells may have more
than 13 parts of the additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or
MTBE, per billion parts of water, a level the state has
determined makes it unfit for drinking. </p>
<p>We know and you know that the state has only found 349
wells with contamination above 13 parts per billion in 30 years,
isn''t that right? Lender said to the state''s witness, Gary
Lynn, a manager of its petroleum mediation section. </p>
<p>Every fifth or sixth well has detectable levels of MTBE
in it, Lynn replied. How much more widespread can it be? </p>
<p>New Hampshire might be seeking more than $200 million from
ExxonMobil, the last defendant on trial in the $816 million
state-court lawsuit filed in 2003. The number of wells found to
be contaminated with MTBE is one factor in determining damages
if ExxonMobil is found liable. The trial began Jan. 14. </p>
<h2>Oil Refiners </h2>
<p>This is one of scores of cases involving MTBE filed since
2000 against oil refiners, fuel distributors and chemical
makers. </p>
<p>Lynn, questioned yesterday by the state, testified that
MTBE still shows up in wells six years after it was banned. He
said the chemical moves through water quickly and unpredictably. </p>
<p>It''s widespread in drinking water wells, and it shows up
frequently in places that we don''t expect it, Lynn said,
mentioning a daycare center''s water supply. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil, based in Irving, Texas, has argued in court
that it isn''t liable for damage because it added MTBE to
gasoline to comply with federal regulations that pre-empt state
law. Oil companies added MTBE to make gasoline burn more
thoroughly in order to reduce air pollution, as required under
the 1990 Clean Air Act. </p>
<p>Kent Colburn, who once worked for New Hampshire''s
Department of Environmental Services, testified Jan. 28 that the
state wouldn''t have participated in a federal clean-air program
called Reformulated Gasoline, or RFG, if Exxon had warned of the
the additive''s risks. </p>
<h2>RFG Program </h2>
<p>ExxonMobil said in court that the state was aware of MTBE''s
risks when it opted into the RFG program in 1991 because there
had been studies of the additive for several years. </p>
<p>The additive was banned in New Hampshire as of January
2007. </p>
<p>MTBE, which is highly soluble in water and thus can be
carried great distances from where it leaked, is a toxic
chemical that does not belong in the state''s drinking water,
Jessica Grant, an attorney for New Hampshire, said in opening
remarks to the jury. It leaked from gas stations, vehicle
junkyards, underground storage tanks and pipe fittings, the
state said. </p>
<p>Lender raised questions today about who was responsible for
the leaks that put MTBE into the groundwater. He cited a state
DES memo that said serious violations by the owners of a
junkyard in Chester had resulted in contaminating the water. </p>
<h2>All the Things'' </h2>
<p>If the owners had done all the things they were supposed
to do, we wouldn''t have had MTBE in the groundwater, right?
Lender asked Lynn during cross-examination. </p>
<p>Even if you do everything you''re supposed to do, there''s
a potential for MTBE to get into the groundwater, Lynn
replied. </p>
<p>The number of contaminated wells is one element in the
determination of monetary damages if ExxonMobil is found liable.
The state is also seeking damages from the companies based on
their market share of gasoline sales in New Hampshire during the
period covered by the lawsuit. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil''s share was about 30 percent, the state said.
Based on an estimated cost of $816 million to test for, monitor
and clean up the groundwater, New Hampshire could be seeking
about $245 million from the company. </p>
<h2>Citgo Petroleum </h2>
<p>On Jan. 15, New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver
agreed to dismiss Citgo Petroleum Corp., the other defendant,
from the trial while the company and the state work to complete
a settlement. Citgo is the Houston-based unit of Petroleos de
Venezuela SA, the country''s state-owned oil company. </p>
<p>Citgo''s market share ranged from 3.1 percent to 8.7
percent, New Hampshire said. Based on those figures, the state
could be seeking $25 million to $71 million from Citgo. If an
accord isn''t reached by Feb. 15 and no extension is approved,
Citgo would be reinstated to the trial. </p>
<p>Besides ExxonMobil and Citgo, New Hampshire also sued Shell
Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips, Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA
and Hess Corp. All settled before the trial began except
ExxonMobil and Citgo. </p>
<p>New Hampshire has received more than $100 million in
settlements from defendants so far, according to court papers. </p>
<p>MTBE lawsuits have also been consolidated in federal court
in New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and motions. In
2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York City
$104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells in
the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. </p>
<p>New Hampshire''s lawyers said last week they hoped to
conclude their case by Feb. 21. ExxonMobil would then begin
presenting its case. </p>
<p>The case is New Hampshire v. Hess Corp., 03-C-0550, New
Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). </p>

<p>Human Rights Foundation, headed by
Chairman Garry Kasparov, demanded that Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
end a consulting agreement with the Russian government led by
President Vladimir Putin. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s deal with Putin ranks among the worst
examples ever of a company seeking to bolster its profits by
laundering the financial reputation of a country led by a
corruptly elected despot, Kasparov, the former chess champion
and leader of Russia''s Solidarity opposition group, said in a
statement. By doing business with Putin, Goldman Sachs is
acting as an enemy of free enterprise and economic freedom. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, signed a three-year agreement with Russia''s Economy
Ministry and the Russian Direct Investment Fund to help set up
meetings with investors and better communicate government
decisions, according to Sergei Arsenyev, the company''s managing
director of investment banking in Moscow. Blankfein, 58, is also
a member of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev''s advisory committee
on turning Moscow into a financial center. </p>
<p>It is in the long-term interest of Russia and its people
to attract foreign investment, Michael DuVally, a spokesman
for New York-based Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mail. That is
why we are pleased to play a role helping to make Russia more
open to foreign investors. </p>
<h2>Asset Sales </h2>
<p>The world''s largest energy exporter plans to raise a record
$10 billion from asset sales this year, First Deputy Prime
Minister Igor Shuvalov said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television last month. While corruption remains a concern, it''s
less so for foreign investors who have already committed to
Russia, Shuvalov said. </p>
<p>Led by Putin, 60, Russia ranked 133 out of 176 countries
and territories in Transparency International''s 2012 corruption
perceptions index, tied with Iran, Kazakhstan and Honduras. The
U.S. Congress imposed a visa ban and asset freeze in December on
Russian officials allegedly linked to the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky and other human-rights abuses. Russia responded with a
law that bans U.S. adoptions of Russian children. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
conducted a review of its business standards and practices and
released a set of recommendations in January 2011 to ensure the
standards treat clients fairly and contribute to overall
financial stability and economic opportunity. </p>
<p>Human Rights Foundation, based in New York, was founded in
2005 to raise awareness about the vulnerability of freedom
around the world, according to its website. </p>
<p>It''s appalling that Goldman Sachs sees nothing wrong with
defending a regime that has made a farce of the legal system,
ignored property rights and murdered and imprisoned brave men
and women who have sought to promote economic freedom,
Kasparov said in the statement. </p>

<p>James Gorman, chairman and chief executive officer of Morgan Stanley (MS), will have less time to boost the bank''s stock price if he wants to reap big profits from his annual bonus. </p> <p>Options awarded to Gorman and five other top executives for 2012 will expire in five years, Morgan Stanley disclosed in regulatory filings last month. About 75 percent of executive options granted by companies in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index have 10-year terms, according to Aaron Boyd, director of research at Equilar Inc., a compensation data firm based in Redwood City, California. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley, the biggest financial brokerage, also split from Wall Street by awarding most top executives their year-end bonuses in the form of options rather than restricted stock. The bank needed to take the step after charges tied to the valuation of company debt wiped out most of the firm''s pretax income, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the information isn''t public. The shorter-dated options present greater risks and potential rewards than restricted stock, depending on how successful Gorman is in turning Morgan Stanley around. </p> <p>In order for the option grant to have meaningful value, you have to get the stock price up, said Brian Foley, a New York-based compensation consultant. If you look at their trading history, it just hasn''t happened. </p> <p>Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined to comment on the awards. When the bank last gave options to top executives for 2010, the securities were exercisable for seven years instead of five. </p> <h2>Share Performance </h2> <p>During the five years ended Feb. 1, Morgan Stanley shares fell 51 percent while the U.S. benchmark Standard  Poor''s 500 Index rose almost 14 percent, a gap that reflects the toll that the 2008 financial crisis took on bank stocks. Morgan Stanley gained 55 percent since the start of last year. </p> <p>From an executive''s perspective, restricted shares are a less risky form of compensation because they retain some value even if a company''s stock price drops, according to Foley. Options entitle the holder to purchase shares at a set price in the future, so they become worthless if the stock falls below that level and fails to recover during the exercise period. Restricted stock vests at market value once conditions are met. </p> <p>Many of the nation''s largest banks have avoided awarding options since the recession and stock-market decline late in the prior decade. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last issued options for 2007 and Bank of America Corp. last did so for 2008, according to their annual proxy statements. Wells Fargo  Co. executives, who haven''t gotten any new option packages since 2008, have received so-called reload grants that automatically replace exercised options under terms of the older awards. </p> <h2>JPMorgan, Citigroup </h2> <p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), in issuing option-like awards to CEO James Dimon and other top executives for 2011, used the 10-year term favored by most SP 500 companies, according to last year''s proxy. Vikram Pandit, the former CEO of Citigroup Inc., received 10-year options as a retention award for 2011, while some of the company''s other executives, including ex-President John Havens, got options with a six-year life, the firm''s filings show. </p> <p>Usually the CEO or CFO will hold the option as long as they can, said Alan Nadel, managing director at Strategic Apex Group LLC, a New York-based management-consulting firm. Many senior executives understand the opportunity for the long-term appreciation and wish to benefit from that as best as they can. </p> <h2>Accounting Expense </h2> <p>Morgan Stanley favored restricted-stock awards over options for most of the last decade. Since fiscal 2002, the firm awarded options to executives only in 2005 and 2011, and both times the grants were accompanied by larger restricted-stock payouts. </p> <p>Things changed last year when the firm recorded $4.4 billion of expenses tied to an accounting rule requiring companies to value outstanding debt at the end of each quarter. The debt-valuation adjustment increases in cost as the company''s financial health improves and its bonds rise in value based on the theory that it would cost more to buy back outstanding debt. </p> <p>The adjustment left Morgan Stanley with pretax income of $515 million for 2012. Under a compensation plan approved by shareholders in 2001, before the accounting requirement existed, Morgan Stanley capped the amount of performance-related compensation that can be paid out to any top executive at 0.5 percent of pretax income. </p> <h2>Internal Caps </h2> <p>By tying cash and stock bonuses to an executive''s performance, Morgan Stanley can get a tax deduction for the entire amount of the award. Otherwise, the portion of a bonus to the CEO or another highly paid officer exceeding $1 million isn''t tax deductible under a provision of the Internal Revenue Code known as Section 162(m). Stock options are considered performance-based and thus are fully deductible. </p> <p>Similarly, Morgan Stanley''s 0.5 percent cap on performance-related compensation applies to cash and restricted stock bonuses but not options, according to the firm''s proxy statements. The latest option awards allowed Morgan Stanley to provide both cash and equity-based bonuses to top officers without running afoul of its own internal restrictions. </p> <p>Gorman got a deferred cash bonus of $2.6 million last year, the maximum amount he could receive under the performance-related plan. He also earned options enabling him to buy 484,827 shares at $22.98 each until January 2018, according to documents the company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p> <h2>Fair Value </h2> <p>Morgan Stanley, which closed yesterday at $23.40 in New York trading, awarded such options on 2.3 million shares to six executives altogether. They include Gregory Fleming and Colm Kelleher, who head the bank''s wealth-management and institutional-securities units, respectively. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley estimated that the fair value of Gorman''s most recent option package equaled $2.6 million, compared to $3.5 million for the grant he received in 2011. The total value of his 2012 pay package was $9.75 million, down about 7 percent from the year before. </p> <p>Gorman and the others will gain the right to exercise their options through January 2016, with one-third of each grant vesting annually during the next three years. That means they will only have two years from the vesting point to exercise the final third of their grants. </p> <h2>Shorter Play'' </h2> <p>U.S. accounting rules require employers to record compensation expense equaling the fair value of options awarded to employees, a figure Morgan Stanley and many other companies calculate using a formula devised by Myron Scholes and Robert Merton. The key factors in determining such expense under the so-called Black-Scholes model are current interest rates, the volatility of a company''s shares and the number of years the holder has to exercise the options. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley''s option grants to the six executives had a total fair-market value of $12.6 million, or $5.41 a share, equaling 24 percent of the price at which the options can be exercised, according to the filings. In early 2011, the company issued executives options for 2010 on 1.3 million shares that expired in seven years and had a fair value of $11 million, or $8.24 a share. That equaled 27 percent of the $30.01 exercise price, filings show. </p> <p>Using five versus seven will lower the Black-Scholes cost so you can deliver a play on more shares without driving the price up, said Foley, the compensation consultant. But the individual is going to have a shorter play. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki and Jeffrey McCracken" date="Feb 06, 2013  9:13 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-06/jpmorgan-said-to-cut-investment-bank-pay-3-asset-managers-gain.html"><headline>JPMorgan Said to Cut Trader Pay, Asset Managers Get Raise</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. paid investment
bankers and traders about 3 percent less in 2012 as shaky
economies in the U.S. and Europe put a damper on deals, said two
people with knowledge of the firm''s compensation. </p>
<p>Portfolio managers and other executives in asset management
received an average 6 percent increase in salary and bonuses,
according to two other people briefed on pay at New York-based
JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender by assets. </p>
<p>Senior investment bankers and traders had braced for
steeper reductions exceeding 10 percent, one person said, after
global deals slid 13 percent to $2.67 trillion in 2012. Net
income at JPMorgan''s investment bank for the first nine months
of 2012, before it was merged with the corporate bank and
treasury services divisions, dropped 15 percent to $5.2 billion. </p>
<p>The cuts pale next to those inflicted on JPMorgan Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and on some peers at rival banks.
Dimon''s pay was halved after the bank suffered its worst-ever
trading loss in the so-called London Whale episode. Top
employees at UBS AG, Switzerland''s biggest lender, will take a 7
percent reduction in their bonus pool and get paid with bonds
whose value could be wiped out. </p>
<p>Senior executives at JPMorgan bore a heavier share of bonus
cuts in the investment bank to insulate junior and mid-level
staff from harsher reductions, said one of the people, who
requested anonymity because pay discussions are private. Joe Evangelisti, a company spokesman, said the firm had no comment.
JPMorgan paid the approximately 26,000 employees in its
investment bank an average of $314,980 for the 12 months ended
Sept. 30, the most recent data available. </p>

<p>Joseph Kasper, 49, a managing director in the company''s
trading division, and investment banker Miguel Espinosa also
left the New York-based bank, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the exits aren''t public. Mark Lake, a
Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The bank said it was eliminating 1,700 jobs last month as
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 54, pursues $1.6 billion
of annual savings during the next two years. Morgan Stanley cut
about 4,500 jobs in 2012. </p>
<p>Whayne, 47, advised on deals including Time Warner Cable

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s industry-leading profit
margins and disposal of non-drug businesses still haven''t closed
the valuation gap with rival drugmakers. No wonder its chief
executive officer is contemplating a full breakup. </p>
<p>CEO Ian Read said last week that he may consider separating
Pfizer''s branded medicines from its generic products businesses
as part of his strategy to slim down the world''s largest
drugmaker. Despite already divesting animal health and infant
nutrition units from one of the most profitable pharmaceutical
companies, Read still is faced with a stock that trades for a
lower price relative to earnings than almost 80 percent of
similar-sized peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Splitting New York-based Pfizer in half may help investors
better gauge the true value of its two businesses, which Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. estimates to be about $35 billion more than its
market capitalization of $201 billion. A breakup would follow
similar moves by companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,
which fetches a valuation that''s two-thirds higher than Pfizer''s
as a pure-play drugmaker after having spun off baby formula
maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. four years ago. </p>
<p>If you''re on Pfizer''s board of directors, you''re
scratching your head and thinking, Why is this happening? We''re
a great operator,'' Peter Sorrentino, a senior fund manager at
Huntington Asset Advisors Inc. in Cincinnati, said in a
telephone interview. Investors play it cautious and put less
of a premium on businesses when there are too many things to
understand and analyze. Pulling them apart, you can probably do
the shareholders better. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s biggest
software maker, said it disrupted a cybercrime operation known
as the Bamital botnet that took control of hundreds of thousands
of personal computers by infecting them with malicious software. </p>
<p>Microsoft worked with Symantec Corp., the world''s biggest
antivirus-software maker, to seize Bamital data and evidence
yesterday at Web-hosting facilities in Weehawken, New Jersey,
and Manassas, Virginia. Microsoft had filed a lawsuit in federal
court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Jan. 31. </p>
<p>The malware hijacked browsers and redirected them to search
websites of Bamital''s choosing, according to the complaint.
Microsoft and Symantec yesterday directed users to tools
designed to help clean affected computers. The number of
affected computers ranges between 250,000 and 1 million, Richard
Boscovich, assistant general counsel, said in an interview. </p>
<p>The malware exposed computers to a huge range of security
vulnerabilities such as identity theft, said Boscovich, of
Microsoft''s Digital Crimes Unit. It also potentially took them
to other malware. </p>
<p>Bamital''s actions also took millions of dollars away from
the search engines of advertisers, Boscovich said. Through the
litigation, filed against John Does 1-18, Controlling a
Computer Botnet Thereby Injuring Microsoft and Its Customers,
Microsoft seeks control over the Bamital botnet, disgorgement of
profits, and unspecified compensatory damages and legal costs. </p>
<h2>Eastern European'' </h2>
<p>We definitely believe that it''s of Eastern European
origin, and the people behind the botnet are more likely either
Russian or Ukranian, Boscovich said. </p>
<p>Microsoft said that in one instance, company investigators
found that Bamital rerouted a search for Nickelodeon'' to a
website that distributed malware, including spyware that is
designed to track the activities of the computer owner. </p>
<p>Since 2010, Bamital has attacked 8.2 million to 8.3 million
computers, Boscovich said. Symantec has estimated that 1.2
million to 1.4 million computers were actively infected with the
malware since 2011. The current number of infected computers
won''t be known for at least 24 hours, Boscovich said. </p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed under several civil laws, including
the Lanham Act and the Computer Fraud  Abuse Act. Boscovich
said he doesn''t know of a criminal investigation. </p>
<p>The case is Microsoft v. John Does 1-18, 13-cv-00139, U.S.

<p>Visa Inc., the world''s biggest
payments network, posted a fiscal first-quarter profit that beat
analysts'' estimates as consumer card spending accelerated. </p>
<p>Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 advanced 26
percent to $1.29 billion, or $1.93 a share, from $1.03 billion,
or $1.49, a year earlier, the Foster City, California-based
company said yesterday in a statement. That beat the $1.79
average estimate of 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Results include significant continued investments in our
core business, accelerating international expansion and the
deployment of next-generation payment solutions, Chief
Executive Officer Charlie Scharf, who succeeded Joseph W. Saunders in November, said in the statement. </p>
<p>Scharf, 47, inherited a goal of deriving more than half of
Visa''s revenue from outside the U.S. by 2015. A global consumer
shift to electronic payments, particularly in the Asia-Pacific
region, may help. Purchases there are projected to generate 42
percent, or $9.03 trillion, of worldwide card spending at
merchants in 2016, up from 36 percent at the end of 2011, the
Nilson Report, an industry newsletter, said in its latest issue. </p>
<p>Visa slipped 1.9 percent to $157.82 at 1:53 p.m. in New
York after Timothy Willi, an analyst at Wells Fargo  Co.,
downgraded the shares to market perform from outperform. The
stock, which climbed almost 50 percent in the past year, doesn''t
provide enough upside potential, he wrote. </p>
<h2>Price Targets </h2>
<p>Still, Willi joined at least 10 other analysts, including
JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s Tien-tsin Huang and Craig Maurer at CLSA
Ltd., in raising their price targets for Visa this week. The
stock is now projected to reach $172.26 within the next 12
months, up from $165.91 at the end of last week, according to
the average of 32 analysts'' predictions in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>Spending on Visa debit and credit cards in the Asia-Pacific
region, the firm''s second-biggest market after the U.S., climbed
about 13 percent, the company said. Purchases surged almost 37
percent in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa, while
spending in Central and South America and the Caribbean rose
about 22 percent. </p>
<p>China is an interesting opportunity for Visa, Scharf
said in a conference call with analysts after results were
announced. Payments in the country are dominated by Shanghai-
based China UnionPay, which surpassed MasterCard Inc. in the
first half of last year to become the world''s second-biggest
payments network by customer spending. </p>
<h2>Good Partner'' </h2>
<p>We''re there, we make money there, and we''ve got some
great partners there, Scharf said of China. It''s important
for us to be a good partner to people within the country to
bring the benefits of Visa to China. And in my conversations
with people from China, they want us there. They think we can
add value not just because of the brand but because of what our
network is versus maybe what China UnionPay is today. </p>
<p>Visa said it would generate about $6 billion in free cash
flow in fiscal 2013, fueled by tax benefits related to a
settlement of a lawsuit over credit-card swipe fees, or
interchange. Guidance on taxes from California officials led
Visa''s tax rate to fall to 28 percent in the quarter and boosted
results by 11 cents a share, the company said. </p>
<h2>Processed Transactions </h2>
<p>Operating revenue rose 12 percent to $2.85 billion from a
year earlier, beating the $2.82 billion estimate of analysts in
the Bloomberg survey. Worldwide spending on Visa payment cards
climbed to $1.08 trillion, an 8.7 percent increase when adjusted
for currency fluctuations. Total processed transactions
increased 4 percent to 14.2 billion. </p>
<p>Purchases on debit cards climbed 3.6 percent in the last
three months of 2012 after a 0.2 percent decline in the
preceding quarter. Credit-card spending surged 12 percent in the
most recent period, up from 9.7 percent growth in the fiscal
fourth quarter, the company said. </p>
<p>Visa''s lead in the U.S. debit-card market continued to
erode as Dodd-Frank Act rules helped competitors gain share.
Spending on Visa debit cards in the U.S. slid 3.6 percent in the
fiscal first quarter even as volume in the rest of the world
surged 29 percent, adjusted for currency changes. </p>
<p>MasterCard, led by CEO Ajay Banga, 53, said last week that
fourth-quarter profit increased 18 percent, excluding litigation
charges. On Feb. 5, the Purchase, New York-based company doubled
its quarterly dividend to 60 cents a share and approved a stock
repurchase program of as much as $2 billion. In October, Visa
announced it was boosting its quarterly payout by 50 percent to
33 cents a share, and yesterday the company said it may buy back
as much as $2.9 billion in stock. </p>
<p>Saunders, 67, who led Visa through a 2008 initial public
offering that raised $19.7 billion, the most in U.S. history, is
retiring and will step down as non-executive chairman at the end
of March, Visa said in a statement last week. He will be
succeeded by Robert W. Matschullat, a former chairman of Clorox
Co., where he''s currently lead director. He also has been a
director at Visa since 2007 and Walt Disney Co. since 2002. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. will run a U.S.
advertising campaign urging consumers to drop Google Inc.''s
Gmail in favor of its own online e-mail services, stepping up
their rivalry for Internet users. </p>
<p>Television, print and online spots starting today will
feature the word Scroogled! in the colors of Google''s logo,
criticizing the operator of the world''s most popular search
engine of scanning the text of e-mail messages in order to
tailor ads to users. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, unveiled
Outlook.com in July to eventually replace its free online e-mail
service Hotmail. The company, whose Bing search engine competes
with Google''s is trying to gain more customers in the U.S.,
where Hotmail had less than half as many users as Gmail or Yahoo
Inc.''s online e-mail service, according to November data from
ComScore Inc. </p>
<p>The ad campaign includes messages such as Think Google
respects your privacy? Think again, and Google goes through
every word of every Gmail that''s sent or received to sell ads.
Microsoft says its online services don''t scan e-mails for
targeted ads. </p>
<p>Chris Gaither, a spokesman for Google, said no humans read
e-mail or account information in order to show ads or related
information. </p>
<p>Advertising keeps Google and many of the websites and
services Google offers free of charge, Gaither wrote in an e-
mail. We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive
and relevant. </p>
<h2>Online Petition </h2>
<p>Besides poking fun at Google with the first such nationwide
campaign from Microsoft targeting Gmail, Microsoft will also ask
users to sign a petition calling on the search engine to stop
scanning e-mail. </p>
<p>The campaign follows a Don''t Get Scroogled effort
targeting Google''s shopping services during the holidays, and
Microsoft''s Gmail Man video, in which a fictitious mailman reads
aloud from the letters he delivers and confronts a worker about
a medical condition in her office. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. overrode an
independent analysis of home loan portfolios by buying and
selling defective loans to create a sanitized version of the
pool, which was then securitized and sold, a court was told. </p>
<p>FSA Asset Management LLC, which bought the residential
mortgage-backed securities that later collapsed in value, and
its parent Franco-Belgian bank Dexia SA filed hundreds of e-
mails and transcripts of employee interviews in federal court in
Manhattan on Feb. 4, urging a judge not to throw out their
lawsuit over the collateralized securities. </p>
<p>JPMorgan received reports from independent mortgage loan
underwriters showing that 20 percent to 80 percent of the loans
in samples used for testing didn''t meet the underwriting
guidelines, including fraudulent home appraisals or missing
documentation, FSA Asset Management, or FSAM, said in the
filing. </p>
<p>Rather than disclose these known defects to FSAM,
defendants bought and sold massive quantities of defective
loans, FSAM said. Defendants secretly overrode the
independent loan underwriters'' determinations, creating a final,
sanitized version. </p>
<p>FSAM failed to expressly assign fraud claims related to the
securities to Dexia, so the bank isn''t allowed to sue under New
York law, JPMorgan said in a Jan. 21 filing, urging the judge to
throw out the lawsuit without a trial. </p>
<p>FSAM also can''t sue because it had recovered the full
purchase price of the securities it bought so it suffered no
harm, JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs purchased more than $1.6 billion of
residential mortgage-backed securities in 51 offerings between
2005 and 2007, according to an amended statement of claim filed
in New York State court in May. The purchases were made from
JPMorgan and two banks the New York-based lender acquired during
the 2007 credit crisis, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. </p>
<p>Defendants rehash the well-worn don''t blame us, blame
the financial crisis'' defense, which numerous courts have
rejected, Dexia said. </p>
<p>The case is Dexia SA v. Bear Stearns  Co. 12-cv-04761.

<p>Brian Kuritzky took in the view for
only a few seconds after racing up midtown Manhattan''s tallest
building. The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. associate then returned
to the lobby to run the 1,576 steps a second time. </p>
<p>Kuritzky raised $20,000 last night for the Multiple Myeloma
Research Foundation by twice climbing the 1,050 feet (320 meters)
from lobby to observation deck at the 36th annual Empire State
Building Run-Up. It''s the second consecutive year Kuritzky was
one of the event''s highest fundraisers after collecting $85,000
in donations in 2012. </p>
<p>Fundraising gets harder and harder, and to try and keep
it consistent you have to do something different and more
creative, Kuritzky, 26, said in an interview between trips.
Running twice is a way to get more people talking and garner a
little more interest. </p>
<p>The race, which began with 14 finishers in 1978, had 738
entrants ranging in age from 21 to 70 and representing 18
countries including Japan, Israel and Papua New Guinea.
Organized by the New York Road Runners, the event raised about
$600,000 for MMRF and other charities. </p>
<p>Mark Bourne won the men''s invitational with a time of 10
minutes, 12 seconds. Suzy Walsham won the elite women''s heat,
her fourth title, in 12:05. Both winners are from Australia. </p>
<p>Kuritzky, whose mother died of breast cancer when he was 15,
has run the New York City Marathon and a 140.6-mile (226-
kilometer) Ironman-distance triathlon to raise money for cancer
research, and last year competed in the RBC Decathlon, where he
was the top fundraiser with more than $90,000 in pledges. He
called last night''s double run the most intense race he''s done. </p>
<h2>Second Run </h2>
<p>After completing his first trip, he lay down for 10 minutes.
After about an hour, he returned to the starting line for a
second time. </p>
<p>My lower back hurts and my lungs feel like they are
popping out of my chest, he said after finishing the second
run. </p>
<p>Kuritzky, who played soccer for Cornell University in 2005-
07, said his original goal of running twice in a total of 28
minutes was determined after friends and colleagues thought his
initial estimate of a half hour was too generous. He ran the
first heat in 13:19, and the MMRF said that while it did not
have his exact time on the second run, he did come in under his
goal. </p>
<p>The event was invitation-only prior to 2011, when MMRF
became the title sponsor and benefiting charity thanks in part
to a $50,000 donation from SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio
manager Nick Tiller. The roughly 125 runners in the MMRF group
last night raised about $500,000, according to the foundation,
bringing their three-year total to $1.4 million. </p>
<h2>Top Team </h2>
<p>The MMRF''s top fundraising team was PricewaterhouseCoopers,
at $23,500, according to the foundation. The highest individual
fundraisers were Mary Weidner and Bill West at $45,700, followed
by Touche Howard, who raised $30,000 by running the course while
wearing 50 pounds of firefighting gear. </p>
<p>Bourne, a 29-year-old ecologist for the Australian
government in Canberra, said he typically races mountain running
and cross-country events. He said he took the lead around the
60th floor and took in the nighttime Manhattan skyline before
crossing the finish line. </p>
<p>It was a great feeling, knowing I was in the lead by a
comfortable margin and could look out over the edge and enjoy
the view for a second, he said in an interview. </p>
<p>Walsham, 39, who won the event from 2007-09 and placed
second last year, said each year she learns that limits can be
pushed a little bit further. Runners pull themselves up along
the handrails to spread the work between their arms and legs. </p>
<h2>Course Records </h2>
<p>Normally I''m sitting on the ground thinking, ''What am I
doing this for?'' she said after the race. This is the best
I''ve felt in years. </p>
<p>The course record of 9:33 was set by Paul Crake of
Australia in 2003, according to the NYRR, which also organizes
the New York City Marathon. The women''s record of 11:23 was set
in 2006 by Andrea Mayr of Austria. </p>
<p>Kuritzky won the MMRF group in 2011, and last year raced in
the invitational heat, where Goldman Sachs colleagues and
friends pledged $10,000 for every elite runner he passed. He
said last night that he had no idea what he might do in 2014. </p>
<p>It''s an ongoing battle to figure out what''s next without

<p>Oil deliveries from Chevron Corp.
fields in Indonesia''s Riau province are likely to return to
normal today after delays caused by a pipeline leak, according
to the country''s energy regulator. </p>
<p>The Feb. 5 breach on the 76-kilometer (47 miles) line
disrupted deliveries of oil from the Bangko area to the Dumai
terminal, Gde Pradnyana, deputy of operations at SKK Migas said
in e-mailed statement. Production at Chevron''s fields has not
been affected and output is being stored in tanks amid repairs
to the pipe, he said. </p>
<p>PT Chevron Pacific Indonesia produced 327,692 barrels of
oil a day as of Jan. 27, representing about 40 percent of
Indonesia''s oil output, according to data from the regulator. </p>
<p>Chevron Pacific Indonesia''s response team has contained the
leak and begun clean-up work, Alexander Yelland, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. We are
working to minimize any impact to production he said. The
cause of the incident is currently being investigated. </p>
<p>The pipeline delivers output from the Duri field in the
Rokan oil block, Yelland said. </p>
<p>Indonesia is trying to stem a decline in maturing fields
amid a lack of new discoveries. Oil output may shrink to 830,000
barrels a day this year, the lowest since 1969 when Indonesia
produced 742,000 barrels, according to data from SKK Migas on
Feb.1. That would also be less than the government''s sales
target of 900,000 barrels a day in the 2013 state budget. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, reclaimed the No. 1 title by market value
as the impact of last year''s wrong-way bet on derivatives fades
and investors wager on an investment-banking rebound. </p>
<p>JPMorgan shares rose 1.6 percent this week, valuing the
bank at $184.9 billion through yesterday. That eclipsed the
$184.2 billion for Wells Fargo  Co., which slipped to No. 2 on
Feb. 5 after being the most valuable since Oct. 28, 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The recovery shows JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has blunted fallout from last year''s trading loss, which
wiped out as much as $51 billion in shareholder value. Wells
Fargo, led by CEO John Stumpf, 59, has seen the rise of its
shares slow amid investor concerns that weaker mortgage lending
and shrinking margins will crimp profit. </p>
<p>Capital-market firms like JPMorgan have been burdened
quite heavily by the financial debacle, more so than regional or
national banks like Wells Fargo, said Gerard Cassidy, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets. As they continue to throw the
baggage overboard, all of these legacy issues that have been
hampering profit are going away. Owning the riskier names is
more attractive today in this economy. </p>
<p>Investors should bypass regional lenders for universal
banks such as New York-based JPMorgan because the larger firms
have lower price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios and the
Federal Reserve''s bond purchases will encourage trading and hurt
lending spreads, David Konrad, a KBW Inc. analyst, said in his
2013 outlook. </p>
<h2>Below Book'' </h2>
<p>JPMorgan has gained 11 percent this year, outpacing Wells
Fargo''s 2.3 percent advance and the 7.3 percent climb for the
24-company KBW Bank Index. JPMorgan trades at 0.95 times book
value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, compared with 1.27
for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo. </p>
<p>If you are less worried about risk you will start to bid
up these shares, which are trading at below book, said
Jennifer Thompson, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC. That''s
where you will focus in terms of relative upside. </p>
<p>JPMorgan lost more than $6.2 billion in the first nine
months of last year from trades on credit derivatives made at
its chief investment office in London. The trader who amassed
the position came to be known as the London Whale because the
bets were big enough to move the market. </p>
<h2>Dimon''s Tempest'' </h2>
<p>The bank first disclosed losses from the wagers in May,
almost a month after Dimon dismissed initial news reports on the
wagers as a tempest in a teapot. Dimon, 56, whose pay was
cut 50 percent this year to $11.5 million, said last month that
the company is almost done booking losses from the trades. </p>
<p>JPMorgan sustained a black eye, as did Jamie Dimon,
Cassidy said. Now the market has given its verdict: the London
Whale was a trading problem that was blown out of proportion and
now it''s been put back into perspective. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG analysts led by Matt O''Connor upgraded
JPMorgan to buy from hold on Jan. 25, citing a 30 percent
underperformance in the shares compared with global banks since
early August. JPMorgan, which posted a third straight year of
record profit with $21.3 billion for 2012, may see annual
operating expenses drop as much as $5 billion as costs to
service mortgages fall, the analysts said in a note to clients. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo''s mortgage revenue, which helped the lender
report record profit of $18.9 billion last year, may decline 18
percent this year to $10 billion from 2012 once loan repurchases
are discounted, Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities
LLP, wrote in a Jan. 29 research note. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp.
turned its Watson computer into a virtual assistant to cancer
doctors, showing how it''s converting the high-powered machine
into a revenue generator. </p>
<p>IBM worked with health insurer WellPoint Inc. and New
York''s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to adapt the
computer, which beat humans in Jeopardy! in 2011, into three
commercial products. Watson will answer medical questions from
doctors, researchers, medical centers and insurance carriers,
the world''s largest computer-services company said today at an
event in New York. </p>
<p>This is a major milestone in IBM''s commercialization of
Watson, said Manoj Saxena, IBM''s general manager for Watson
solutions. We have significant plans this year for scaling
Watson. </p>
<p>The health-care products will contribute toward IBM''s goal
of generating $16 billion in revenue from business analytics by
2015. By the end of 2013, 1,600 providers and 50 percent of
nurses in the system of WellPoint, the second-largest U.S.
health insurer, will be using a Watson product for recommending
whether medical procedures should be approved, IBM said. </p>
<p>Health care faces a challenge of too much information,
not enough time, said Lori Beer, the executive vice president
for information technology at WellPoint. Medical literature is
doubling every five years. How do we keep up with that? </p>
<h2>More Accuracy </h2>
<p>WellPoint, based in Indianapolis, plans to make money by
helping doctors make more accurate treatment decisions, reducing
the time it has to spend pre-authorizing procedures and selling
the product to other insurers, she said in an interview. Neither
company provided revenue forecasts for Watson services. </p>
<p>In 2012, Watson became 240 percent faster and 75 percent
smaller so it can run on a single server, IBM said today. The
Armonk, New York-based company now can install a Watson machine
on-site for a business or remotely via cloud computing to a
personal computer, tablet or smartphone. </p>
<p>Later this year, IBM will announce products for the finance
industry similar to Watson''s health-care applications, Saxena
said. </p>

<p>ExxonMobil Corp. lost its bid for a
mistrial in a lawsuit by New Hampshire claiming it contaminated
the state''s water supply with a gasoline additive. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil moved for the mistrial, claiming that a state
witness''s remark in front of the jury violated the judge''s
previous order to not talk about two funds for cleaning up
contaminated sites. New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter
Fauver ruled before the trial began that no mention could be
made of the funds because the jurors might believe the state
didn''t need any more money for the cleanup. </p>
<p>A mistrial is not warranted, Fauver said in his ruling
yesterday. Irreparable prejudice has not resulted from trial
testimony to date. </p>
<p>Gary Beckett, a hydrogeologist, testified Feb. 6 that cost
is a factor in monitoring groundwater contamination by the
additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE. </p>
<p>There''s not enough money to find everything out about a
site, he said. </p>
<p>Fauver sent the jury home on Feb. 7 so that the two sides
could argue the issue before him. The trial began on Jan. 14. </p>
<p>The New Hampshire funds have received $213 million from the
oil companies since 1989 through a 1.5 cents-a-gallon fee on all
oil products imported into in the state. The funds have $4
million left in them, the state has said. </p>
<h2>Hands Tied'' </h2>
<p>Now we''re in a situation, hands tied behind our back,
where we can''t say that the state does have resources for
remediation, ExxonMobil lawyer James Quinn told the judge Feb.
6. Quinn asked Fauver to reconsider his ruling. </p>
<p>Fauver said he wouldn''t reverse his opinion. </p>
<p>Defendant''s argument that the state received money from
collateral sources, so its damages figure should be reduced,
remains inappropriate, and defendants will not be entitled to
present it to the jury, Fauver said in the ruling. </p>
<p>New Hampshire might be seeking more than $200 million from
ExxonMobil, the last defendant on trial in the $816 million
lawsuit filed in 2003. This is one of scores of cases involving
MTBE filed since 2000 against oil refiners, fuel distributors
and chemical makers. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil, based in Irving, Texas, has argued in court
that it isn''t liable because it added MTBE to gasoline to comply
with federal regulations, which pre-empt state law. Oil
companies added MTBE to make gasoline burn more thoroughly in
order to reduce air pollution, as required under the 1990 Clean
Air Act. </p>
<h2>Additive Banned </h2>
<p>New Hampshire banned the additive as of January 2007. </p>
<p>MTBE, which is highly soluble in water and thus can be
carried great distances from where it leaks, is a toxic
chemical that does not belong in the state''s drinking water,
Jessica Grant, a lawyer for the state, said in opening remarks
to the jury. It leaked from gas stations, vehicle junkyards,
underground storage tanks and pipe fittings, the state said. </p>
<p>The state is seeking monetary damages in part based on
ExxonMobil''s market share of gasoline sales in New Hampshire
during the period covered by the lawsuit. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil''s share was about 30 percent, the state said.
Based on an estimated cost of $816 million to test for, monitor
and clean up the groundwater, New Hampshire could be seeking
about $245 million from the company. </p>
<h2>Citgo Dismissed </h2>
<p>On Jan. 15, Fauver agreed to dismiss Citgo Petroleum Corp.,
the other defendant, from this trial while the company and the
state work to complete a settlement. Citgo is the Houston-based
unit of Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the country''s state-owned oil
company. If an accord isn''t reached by Feb. 15 and no extension
is approved, Citgo would be reinstated to the trial. </p>
<p>Besides ExxonMobil and Citgo, New Hampshire also sued Shell
Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips, Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA
and Hess Corp. All settled before the trial began except
ExxonMobil and Citgo. </p>
<p>New Hampshire has received more than $100 million in
settlements from defendants so far, according to court papers. </p>
<p>MTBE lawsuits have also been consolidated in federal court
in New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and motions. In
2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York City
$104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells in
the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. </p>
<p>New Hampshire''s lawyers said last week they hoped to
conclude their case by Feb. 21. ExxonMobil would then begin
presenting its case. </p>
<p>The case is New Hampshire v. Hess Corp., 03-C-0550, New
Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
world''s top-ranked mergers and acquisitions adviser this year,
named Gregg Lemkau to help lead that business worldwide and put
Gilberto Pozzi in Lemkau''s prior role running MA in Europe. </p>
<p>Lemkau, a 43-year-old U.S. citizen who lives in London,
will be global co-head with Gene Sykes, 55, who lives in Los
Angeles, according to a memo to employees today. A spokeswoman
for New York-based Goldman Sachs confirmed the promotions. </p>
<p>Investment banks are looking for a rebound in takeovers
after global MA rose to the highest level in four years during
the last quarter of 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The surge softened the impact of a 9 percent decline
for the full year. About $220 billion in transactions have been
announced so far this year. </p>
<p>Lemkau was co-head of Goldman Sachs''s global technology,
media and telecom group and has advised on transactions
including the $8.5 billion sale of Skype to Microsoft Corp. and
the $16.5 billion sale of Medimmune LLC to AstraZeneca Plc. He
will work closely with Michael Carr, who runs MA in the
Americas, as well as with Sykes, according to the memo. </p>
<p>The Financial Times reported Lemkau''s move earlier today. </p>
<p>Lemkau''s promotion is part of a shift in management toward
younger executives who were promoted to partner after the firm
went public in 1999 and ceased to be a true partnership. Among
the 30 current members of the management committee, 15 became
partners before the IPO. The memo didn''t say Lemkau would be
joining the management committee. </p>
<h2>Partnership Class </h2>
<p>Lemkau was promoted to partner in October 2002, and was
part of the same 78-member partnership class that included
William C. Dudley, now the president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York; Carsten Kengeter, who later became head of UBS AG''s
investment bank; and Harvey M. Schwartz, who became Goldman
Sachs''s chief financial officer late last month. </p>
<p>Pozzi, a 47-year-old Italian who has been co-head of
Goldman Sachs''s global consumer retail group since 2010, will
continue to be responsible for some clients in that sector while
overseeing deals throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa,
the firm said in a separate memo. Pozzi joined Goldman Sachs in
London in 1995 and was promoted to partner in 2008. </p>
<p>Pozzi''s deals have included Unilever NV''s acquisition of
Russia''s Kalina consumer group and Mittal''s takeover of Arcelor. </p>
<p>Francois-Xavier FX de Mallmann, 42, will succeed Pozzi
as co-head of Goldman''s global consumer retail group alongside
Kathy Elsesser. De Mallman, who is based in London and has
French and Swiss citizenship, will also remain responsible for
investment-banking services in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, a role he''s held since January 2012. De Mallmann joined
Goldman Sachs in 1993 and has been a partner since 2004. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecast
precious metals and livestock will lead a 1.1 percent gain in
commodities in 12 months, saying it will wait for physical
markets to confirm recovery before raising individual estimates. </p>
<p>The advance in the Standard  Poor''s GSCI Enhanced
Commodity Index will include a 2 percent gain in energy, with
precious metals to climb 5 percent and livestock to advance 4.5
percent, the bank said in a report e-mailed today and dated
yesterday. Agriculture will be down 3.5 percent and industrial
metals will fall 1 percent. </p>
<p>Renewed optimism has been mostly based on momentum and
forward-looking survey data and far less on hard data and
physical markets, which remain lackluster, analysts led by New
York-based Jeffrey Currie wrote in the report. We are
maintaining our price targets and recommendations and will wait
for hard data and physical markets to confirm the optimism
before raising estimates. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI Enhanced gauge is up 3.8 percent since the
start of the year after declining 0.1 percent in 2012, the worst
performance since 2008. Brent crude oil has gained 6.1 percent
this year in London, and cotton jumped 9.7 percent, while nickel
is 6.6 percent higher in London. </p>
<p>The bank lowered its outlook for commodities to neutral
last month while forecasting a 5 percent return in a year. </p>
<p>Manufacturing in the U.S. reached a nine-month high in
January and expanded for a fourth month in China, while services
industries also gained, reports showed this month. The Institute
for Supply Management''s employment gauge jumped to the highest
since February 2006, according to a Feb. 5 report. </p>
<h2>Chinese Housing </h2>
<p>Goldman recommended buying copper to capture the Chinese
housing completion cycle and a long position in the Brent GSCI
Index to benefit from the backwardation required by low crude
inventories. Goldman said copper will trade at $9,000 a metric
ton in six months and Brent crude will be at $110 a barrel. </p>
<p>Brent oil traded near a nine-month high amid worsening
tensions around Iran''s nuclear program. Brent for March
settlement was at $117.84 a barrel, down 0.9 percent, by 2:41
p.m. on the London-based ICE Futures Europe. Copper for three-
month delivery slid 1.3 percent to $8,187.50 a ton in London, up
3.2 percent since the start of the year. </p>
<p>So-called backwardation, signaling tight supplies, means
that investors can get positive returns from rolling their
positions from nearby to longer-dated contracts, Goldman said.
High roll yields are available in Brent and soybeans, while
investors may also get them in copper later this year, the bank
said in a separate report dated Feb. 8. Positive returns are
possible even if prices are stable or falling, Goldman said. </p>
<p>Going forward, we expect the roll yield to contribute a
larger share of the return from commodity investments than was
the case in the years when long-dated prices were rising
structurally, the bank wrote. This would be in line with the
experience from the 1990s when we last saw stable long-dated
commodity prices. </p>

<p>A groundwater expert has vacillated
on how much work must be done on New Hampshire sites
contaminated with a gasoline additive, an ExxonMobil Corp.
lawyer said in a trial to determine whether the company is
liable for damages. </p>
<p>Gary Beckett, a state witness who is a hydrogeologist,
testified yesterday that 228 sites in the state require
additional monitoring because of contamination by the additive
methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, at a cost of $85,000 each.
He said 85 of those sites need even more extensive work. </p>
<p>Your opinions have changed a bit over the course of the
case, right? David Lender, a lawyer for ExxonMobil, asked
Beckett today during cross-examination in court in Concord. Had
Beckett relied on the state''s standard for MTBE in drinking
water of 13 parts per billion, fewer sites would require
additional testing, Lender said. </p>
<p>If that had been the only criteria, yes, Beckett said.
I''ve expanded the criteria to be more robust and more
encompassing of all the site information. </p>
<p>New Hampshire might be seeking more than $200 million from
ExxonMobil, the last defendant on trial in the $816 million
lawsuit filed in 2003. The number of wells found to be
contaminated with MTBE is one factor in determining damages if
ExxonMobil is found liable. </p>
<p>The state has received $213 million from oil companies for
two MTBE cleanup funds since 1989 through a 1.5 cents-a-gallon
fee on all gasoline imported into the state. The funds have
$4 million left in them, the state has said. </p>
<h2>Federal Law </h2>
<p>ExxonMobil, based in Irving, Texas, has argued in court
that it isn''t liable for damage because it added MTBE to
gasoline to comply with federal regulations, which pre-empt
state law. Oil companies added MTBE to make gasoline burn more
thoroughly in order to reduce air pollution, as required under
the 1990 Clean Air Act. </p>
<p>The state was aware of MTBE''s risks when it opted into a
clean-air program in 1991 because the additive already had been
studied for several years, ExxonMobil said in court. </p>
<p>New Hampshire banned the additive as of January 2007. </p>
<p>State witness Gary Lynn, a manager of the state Department
of Environmental Services'' petroleum mediation section,
testified that MTBE still shows up in wells six years after it
was banned. </p>
<p>MTBE, which is highly soluble in water and thus can be
carried great distances from where it leaked, is a toxic
chemical that does not belong in the state''s drinking water,
Jessica Grant, a lawyer for the state, said in opening remarks
to the jury. It leaked from gas stations, vehicle junkyards,
underground storage tanks and pipe fittings, the state said. </p>
<h2>Monetary Damages </h2>
<p>Besides the number of contaminated wells, the state is
seeking monetary damages based on ExxonMobil''s market share of
gasoline sales in New Hampshire during the period covered by the
lawsuit. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil''s share was about 30 percent, the state said.
Based on an estimated cost of $816 million to test for, monitor
and clean up the groundwater, New Hampshire could be seeking
about $245 million from the company. </p>
<p>On Jan. 15, New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver
agreed to dismiss Citgo Petroleum Corp., the other defendant,
from this trial while the company and the state work to complete
a settlement. Citgo is the Houston-based unit of Petroleos de
Venezuela SA, that country''s state-owned oil company. If an
accord isn''t reached by Feb. 15 and no extension is approved,
Citgo would be reinstated to the trial. </p>
<h2>Companies Settle </h2>
<p>Besides ExxonMobil and Citgo, New Hampshire also sued Shell
Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips, Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA
and Hess Corp. All settled before the trial began except
ExxonMobil and Citgo. </p>
<p>New Hampshire has received more than $100 million in
settlements from defendants so far, according to court papers. </p>
<p>The case is one of scores involving MTBE that have been
filed since 2000 against oil refiners, fuel distributors and
chemical makers. MTBE lawsuits have been consolidated in federal
court in New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and motions. </p>
<p>In 2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York
City $104.7 million after finding the company liable for
polluting wells in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. </p>
<p>The New Hampshire trial began Jan. 14. The state said it
may rest its case Feb. 21. </p>
<p>The case is New Hampshire v. Hess Corp., 03-C-0550, New
Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz said the banking industry''s
average return on equity will rise above 12 percent as some
firms shrink or exit businesses. </p>
<p>I think the industry will migrate to higher returns
because it will have to, Schwartz, 48, said today at the
Credit Suisse Financial Services Forum in Miami. It might be a
question of excess capacity coming out over a long period of
time, he said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, made
a 10.7 percent return on average common shareholders'' equity
last year, up from 3.7 percent in 2011. Schwartz, who last month
called the 2012 figure not particularly aspirational, said
today that the New York-based company doesn''t yet have
sufficient information to provide investors with a ROE target. </p>
<p>More than half of the audience members at the conference
said in a poll that they expected average return on equity for
the industry to settle at around 12 percent, according to Howard Chen, a Credit Suisse Group AG analyst at the event. Schwartz,
who replaced David A. Viniar, 57, as CFO at the end of January,
said he''d be surprised if that consensus view proved accurate
over the long run. </p>
<p>More banks will exit capital-intensive businesses like
fixed-income trading because they''re under pressure from
shareholders to boost returns, Schwartz said. </p>
<p>If you''re not in a leading position in one of those
businesses, it''s difficult to stay committed, he said. It''s
just a question of who executes better and who gets that
share. </p>
<h2>Mortgage Size </h2>
<p>In his presentation, Schwartz detailed Goldman Sachs''s
decision to stick with its mortgage business even after an
initial regulatory proposal in December 2011 threatened to
increase the capital requirement by 260 percent. Instead, the
firm waited, which he said paid off when regulators released a
new set of rules that raised the capital requirement by 170
percent instead. </p>
<p>The decision was driven in part by the importance of the
mortgage business, which has been a part of the company for
almost 30 years, Schwartz said. </p>
<p>To scrap that and then potentially have to rebuild it?
Schwartz said. Mortgages remain a critical asset class for our
clients and obviously an important business for the firm. </p>
<p>The firm has in the past de-emphasized the size and
importance of its mortgage-underwriting business, an area that
came under legal and regulatory scrutiny after the financial
crisis. Viniar said on an Oct. 19, 2010, conference call that
mortgages have always been the smallest of the firm''s fixed-
income, currency, and commodity businesses. </p>
<h2>Really Tiny'' </h2>
<p>We are really tiny in the market, Viniar told analysts
at the time. We were an underwriter, we did it. We are a
player in the market. But we''re just not one of the leading
players. </p>
<p>The unit employed 40 percent fewer employees in 2012 than
in 2008 and made 14 percent less revenue and 22 percent less in
pretax earnings, according to a slide that accompanied
Schwartz''s presentation. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs rose 1 percent to $153.76 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading at 11:03 a.m., the highest since
April 2011, amid optimism that bank profits will rise. The
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index climbed 6.4 percent this year
through yesterday, and the KBW Bank Index advanced 7.5 percent. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., the
world''s biggest payment networks, won dismissal of a price-
fixing lawsuit brought by a group representing operators of
automated teller machines. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington today
also threw out two related suits, ruling that all the plaintiffs
failed to show the companies conspired to restrict independent
ATM operators from charging varying prices for customers using
alternative networks such as STAR, Shazam Inc. or TransFund. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs have not set forth sufficient facts to support
their claim that there was a horizontal conspiracy, Jackson
wrote in her 39-page opinion. Notably absent from each of the
complaints are facts showing the existence of an agreement, the
essential element of any conspiracy. </p>
<p>The dismissal of the suit leaves ATM operators grappling
with the same alleged anti-competitive landscape that they
claimed prevents them from attracting customers by offering a
discount by making a transaction over less expensive networks. </p>
<p>The allegations in the lead case were made by the National
ATM Council Inc., a trade group based in Jacksonville, Florida,
and 13 operators of ATMs in nine states. The group sought to
represent the 350 non-bank ATM operators nationwide and asked
for triple damages. </p>
<p>The ATM operators claim that the overwhelming majority
of so-called PIN debit cards used for ATM transactions are
branded by Visa or MasterCard. Under a uniform agreement, the
operators can''t charge less for transactions over a network that
competes with Visa and MasterCard, according to the complaint. </p>
<h2>Network Access </h2>
<p>In order to accept one of these cards, an ATM operator must
have access to the Visa and MasterCard networks. Independent or
non-bank operators must be sponsored by a financial institution
that is a member of the Visa and MasterCard networks. </p>
<p>What is missing is any discussion of what the ATM
operator''s costs are, and whether they change if the operator
uses a Visa or MasterCard network or an alternative network,
Jackson said. Those facts are fundamental, and without them,
there is no basis for the conclusions that the access fees are
inflated or supra-competitive. </p>
<p>The judge said a critical problem in all three
complaints is that the plaintiffs do not make clear who pays
whom in these transactions. </p>
<h2>No Facts'' </h2>
<p>There are no facts in the complaints that support a
conclusion that prices would be lower if the restrictions at
issue were lifted, Jackson said. </p>
<p>James Issokson, a spokesman for MasterCard, based in
Purchase, New York, said in an e-mail that the company was
pleased with the ruling. Will Valentine, a spokesman for Foster
City, California-based Visa, declined to comment. </p>
<p>A lawyer for the ATM group, Daniel Small of Cohen Millstein
Sellers  Toll Pllc in Washington, didn''t immediately respond to
a phone message. </p>
<p>The lead case is National ATM Council v. Visa Inc., 11-
cv-1803, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). </p>

<p>Pharmaceutical stocks, which have
soared in the past year to valuations not seen since 2001, are
poised to extend their rally as investors grow more confident
the industry has weathered a decade-long shortage of new drugs. </p>
<p>Large pharmaceutical stocks such as Sanofi, Novartis AG and
Pfizer Inc. are still cheaper relative to next year''s estimated
earnings than are market benchmarks such as the U.S.''s Standard
 Poor''s 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>A fundamental change in the way pharmaceutical companies
are positioned leaves room for shares to erase that gap and rise
another 20 percent in two years, said Ori Hershkovitz, a partner
at Sphera Funds Management Ltd., a health-care hedge fund in Tel
Aviv. Companies have become more diversified -- in geography and
products -- and have built stronger pipelines of experimental
drugs even as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved 39
new drugs last year. That''s the most since 2000, according to
Bloomberg Industries data. </p>
<p>It''s not a simple comeback, Hershkovitz, who owns
Pfizer and Sanofi shares, said in a telephone interview. It''s
of historical magnitude because they''re changing the business
model. It''s not pharmaceuticals as we knew it. It''s new
companies. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut about two
dozen U.S. equities traders and sales staff after that unit''s

<p>Some senior employees voluntarily left after their bonuses
shrank more than those of their fixed-income counterparts amid a

people, who asked not to be identified because the decisions

<p>The fixed-income unit generated $15.4 billion in revenue
last year, up 4 percent from 2011, while revenue from the
equities division, run by Tim Throsby, slipped 1.8 percent to
$4.4 billion. </p>
<p>About three managing directors and 18 executive directors,

<p>Morgan Stanley, the bank with the
most debt maturing in 2013 of the top 10 U.S. structured note
issuers, led monthly sales for the first time in more than a
year. </p>
<p>The bank issued $498.8 million of the securities in January
in 51 offerings, more than twice its monthly average of $238.4
million in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan
Stanley was last No. 1 in the U.S. in August 2011, when it sold
$1.1 billion of notes. </p>
<p>The bank fell to eighth-largest structured note issuer last
year when its five-year credit default swaps averaged 309.2
basis points after being on top in 2010 when the measure of risk
was 180.6, Bloomberg data show. While the current level of 149.2
basis points is close to an almost two-year low, it''s still
higher than that of any other U.S. bank that issues the
securities, forcing the company to pay more for funds and create
more attractive terms on debt. </p>
<p>That means the bank can be more creative with
structuring notes to get investor attention, said John Tessar,
senior vice president at JVB Financial Group LLC in Boca Raton,
Florida. </p>
<p>Banks create the investments by packaging their own debt
with derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors
while earning fees and raising money. </p>
<h2>Moody''s Rating </h2>
<p>Moody''s Investors Service rates Morgan Stanley, which has
$26.1 billion of debt maturing this year, as Baa1 with a
negative outlook. Wells Fargo  Co., which has the lowest credit
risk among U.S issuers as indicated by the level of its default
swaps, is graded A2, or two levels higher. </p>
<p>Credit swaps typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and fall as it improves. They pay the buyer face
value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>
<p>Lauren Onis, a spokeswoman for the New York-based bank,
declined to comment on the company''s issuance. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s largest offering last month was $110
million of 15-year, auto-callable step-up notes tied to the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. The securities, sold Jan. 15, start
out yielding 7 percent annually, then rise to 8 percent after
five years and end at 12 percent so long as the stock benchmark
doesn''t fall below 70 percent of its initial value, according to
a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Investors can lose their entire investment. The bank
distributed the notes for a 3.5 percent commission. </p>
<p>Outside the U.S., Morgan Stanley sold the most notes in
five years. The bank has raised $194.1 million in 2013, the most
for any similar period since 2008, according to Bloomberg data
that exclude securities where amount of principal returned can
vary. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, which borrowed the
most from the Federal Reserve in the 2008 financial crisis, now
has one of the highest liquidity-reserve levels among the
biggest banks to defend against another funding freeze. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley estimates its liquidity coverage ratio is
more than 125 percent, based on the New York-based company''s
interpretation of rules set to take effect in 2015, Treasurer
David Russo said today on a conference call with fixed-income
investors. That tops Citigroup Inc.''s 118 percent, UBS AG''s 113
percent and Deutsche Bank AG''s roughly 95 percent. </p>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision''s liquidity
coverage ratio, scheduled to be phased in starting in two years,
requires banks to hold enough high-quality liquid assets --
predominantly cash and government debt -- to survive 30 days of
stress. The Basel group last month expanded the types of assets
that can be counted as liquid. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley borrowed $107.3 billion, the most of any
bank, from the Federal Reserve in September 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg News in 2011. Morgan Stanley''s
borrowing peaked after hedge funds pulled $128.1 billion from
the firm in two weeks, documents released by the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission show. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, who took her role at
the start of 2010, has attempted to improve the firm''s ability
to handle a crisis by relying on longer-term secured loans,
holding more liquid assets and reducing its reliance on prime-
brokerage clients for funding. Porat is being considered for the
role of deputy Treasury secretary, people familiar with the
matter said last month. </p>
<p>Barclays Plc said this week that its LCR estimate was 126
percent, up from 103 percent before the Basel group''s revised
rules. JPMorgan Chase  Co. said it would be in compliance with
the rule, which will eventually require firms to have a ratio of
at least 100 percent, by the end of 2013. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said it is well-positioned for the rule, without providing
figures. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. SA,
the world''s second-largest bottler of the soft drink, gained
in Athens trading after the company increased its sales volume
in emerging markets. </p>
<p>Greece''s largest company by market value said revenue
climbed 5 percent in the fourth quarter to 1.6 billion euros
($2.1 billion) on volume growth in countries including Russia,
Nigeria and Poland. Coca-Cola HBC maintained volume for the full
year, compared to a 1 percent decline in 2011, it said today in
a statement. </p>
<p>An 8 percent boost in volume in emerging markets in the
fourth quarter, as well as a 5 percent decline in cases of
drinks sent to established markets, were a positive
surprise, Mike Gibbs, an analyst at JP Morgan Cazenove with an
overweight recommendation on the shares, said today in a note.
We think that the worst of the margin pain is now behind. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola HBC is shifting its primary listing to London
from the Greek stock exchange in an effort to reduce exposure to
Europe''s sovereign-debt crisis and improve access to
international investors. The change is expected to be completed
early in the second quarter of 2013, Chief Executive Officer
Dimitris Lois said. </p>
<p>The shares rose as much as 3.2 percent to 19.97 euros and
were up 2.7 percent at 3:57 p.m. in Athens, taking the 12-month
gain to 37 percent. </p>
<p>Revenue growth outpaced volume gains for the sixth
consecutive quarter, Coca-Cola HBC said. We gained or
maintained volume share in sparkling beverages in 21 out of 28
markets, the company said. </p>
<h2>Wider Loss </h2>
<p>Even so, the successes came as the bottler posted a wider-
than-expected fourth-quarter loss and forecast that currency-
neutral revenue per case will grow at a slower pace this year. </p>
<p>The fourth-quarter loss widened to 45.8 million euros
compared with a deficit of 11.6 million euros a year earlier.
The average of five analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg
was for a loss of 26 million euros. </p>
<p>Higher input costs, unfavorable currency swings and higher
operating expenses weighed on 2012 profit, which fell 28 percent
to 190.4 million euros, the company said. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola HBC said it is targeting free cash flow of 1.3
billion euros for the period ending Dec. 31, 2015. Annual net
capital expenditure is expected to range from 5.5 percent to 6.5
percent of net sales in the period, it said. </p>
<p>We expect challenging conditions to persist across most
markets, CEO Lois said in a phone interview. While we don''t
really see any signs of stabilization in Greece, Italy and
Ireland, we are positive about Russia and Nigeria, he said. </p>
<p>The company expects to incur costs of 50 million euros in
2013 tied mainly to infrastructure and distribution, Chief
Financial Officer Michalis Imellos said by phone. On an
annualized basis, these will yield savings of about 30 million
euros from 2014, he said. </p>
<p>Currency-neutral input costs per case will rise at a low
single-digit pace, led by sugar, resin and aluminum, though the
rate will be slower than in 2012 and 2011, Imellos said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., grappling with
Wall Street''s worst year for stock-trading since 2008, cut pay
at the equities unit about 4 percent and pushed out about three
dozen employees, people with knowledge of the moves said. </p>
<p>About two dozen U.S. traders and sales staff were fired,
and some senior employees left voluntarily as the unit aligned
pay more closely with revenue, said the people, asking to not be
identified because the measures aren''t public. The bank also
dismissed equity analysts last week, three people said, with one
saying about a dozen were affected. Industrywide equities-
trading revenue fell 5 percent last year, the third straight
annual drop, according to analytics firm Coalition Ltd. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has pared equities jobs each year since 2008,
former and current executives said. Equities-trading chief Tim Throsby has been reviewing the unit since around March, these
people said. Assisted by Marc Badrichani and Jason Sippel, he
found that pay for equities traders and sales staff was too high
compared with revenue, the people said. </p>
<p>The unit posted a 1.8 percent drop in revenue to $4.4
billion last year, compared with a 4 percent gain in fixed-
income trading revenue to $15.4 billion. About three managing
directors and 18 executive directors were cut, including Andrew Crofton and Julian Plant, current and former executives said.
Kevin Smart, a vice president, also left, two people said. </p>
<h2>Stock Gain </h2>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
company, said she couldn''t comment on the departures. Plant
declined to comment, while Crofton and Smart didn''t respond to
messages. The bank''s stock gained 12 percent this year through
yesterday and declined 31 cents to $48.91 at 12:52 p.m. in New
York. </p>
<p>JPMorgan eliminated teams of equity analysts in New York
and San Francisco around Feb. 6, including Dane Mott who covered
accounting, Chris Blansett, who covered semiconductors, Scott Levine, who covered engineering and environmental services and
Matthew Heimermann, who covered insurers, according to two
people familiar with the cuts. The analysts didn''t return calls
for comment. </p>
<p>Equities trading was hardest-hit by job cuts in 2012, with
the top 10 investment banks eliminating 2,700 front-office
workers, or about 14 percent, according to data released
yesterday by Coalition. Equities-trading revenue at the 10 banks
was $33 billion, the lowest since 2008, Coalition said. </p>
<h2>Cash Equities </h2>
<p>Cash equities, the trading of common shares on public
exchanges, produced $10 billion in revenue at the 10 largest
investment banks, down 40 percent from 2008 as firms grappled
with plunging volume, the data show. </p>
<p>Equities account for about a quarter of total trading and
investment-banking revenue. They include commissions and gains
from buying and selling stocks, futures, options and other
equity derivatives, as well as fees and interest income from
providing services and lending to hedge funds. </p>
<p>Throsby and other executives prepared staff in the Americas
for reductions and lower pay with a conference call on Jan. 17,
the day after the bank reported a record $21.3 billion in net
income for 2012. Headcount, executives said, would be coming
down, according to two people on the call. The bank would
probably replace more highly paid senior executives with less-
costly junior traders and sales staff, they said. </p>
<p>Pay in the broader investment bank, which includes
dealmakers and fixed-income traders, fell by about 3 percent in
2012, people briefed on the compensation said this month. </p>
<p>Throsby, who joined JPMorgan from Citadel Investment Group
LLC almost three years ago, was promoted in September from
running derivatives trading and sales to head all equities
trading. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, ousted top
managers and shuffled others around after traders in the chief
investment office lost more than $6.2 billion on a bad
derivatives bet in the first three quarters of last year. </p>

<p>Morgan Keegan  Co. was ordered to
buy back some auction-rate securities and pay $110,500 in a case
in which it was accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission of misleading customers about the risks of the
investments. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Duffey Jr. in Atlanta ruled
yesterday that some of the company''s brokers negligently made
misrepresentations and omitted important information when
selling the securities. The judge said the brokerage didn''t act
fraudulently, ruling against the SEC on part of its case. </p>
<p>Brokers apparently were lulled into describing it too
broadly and neglected in their discussions with the customers
discussed in this order to discuss the practical and technical
requirements of an auction and the consequences of an auction
failure, the judge said in his order, referring to the
auction-rate securities market. </p>
<p>As a result, the evidence in this case was that the
Morgan Keegan brokers discussed in this order neglected to fully
inform investors of the ARS risk when marketing the ARS product,
to include informing them of the risk of auction failures, the
concomitant loss of liquidity, and varying interest rates,
Duffey said. </p>
<p>The opinion followed a non-jury trial held in November in
which the SEC tried to show that the company, now owned by
Raymond James Financial Inc., told clients that the more than $2
billion in securities it sold had zero risk, even as the
market was collapsing in late 2007 and 2008. </p>
<h2>Voluntary Buyback </h2>
<p>The trial was held after a federal appeals court reversed a
previous order in which Duffey dismissed the suit. </p>
<p>Before the SEC filed its lawsuit, Morgan Keegan voluntarily
bought back about $2 billion in auction-rate securities from
customers, it said in court filings. Duffey ordered that the
company buy back some securities from some affected customers. </p>
<p>Jana Strange, a spokeswoman for St. Petersburg, Florida-
based Raymond James, didn''t immediately return a call yesterday
after regular business hours seeking comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Morgan
Keegan  Company Inc., 1:09-cv-01965, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management says
Macau casino bonds that have rallied for 16 months are likely to
withstand any crackdown aimed at cleaning up the industry. </p>
<p>Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd.''s 8.5 percent dollar notes
due December 2020 rose every week this year for a 5.9 percent
return, with the yield touching a record-low 6.84 percent on Feb.
14, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield on Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd.''s 4.625 percent yuan securities reached
3.48 percent yesterday, the least since they were sold in
December 2010. Casino stocks plunged the most since July after
the Times of London reported on Feb. 5 that a crackdown on
triad-linked junket operators was imminent. </p>
<p>Previous cooling and policy measures have generally been
positive to the long-term health of the market, Salman Niaz, a
bond-fund manager in Singapore at Goldman Sachs Asset, said in a
Feb. 15 e-mail interview. Given the high free-cash flow
generated by the operators and the limited leverage, the credit
profile is unlikely to deteriorate materially in the near
term. </p>
<p>Record-low borrowing costs will help tycoons fund more than
$16 billion of expansion plans in the world''s biggest gambling
hub. Melco Chief Executive Officer Lawrence Ho, son of the
city''s former gaming monopoly holder Stanley Ho, said this month
he hadn''t heard of any crackdown and that his casinos were jam
packed over last week''s Chinese New Year holiday. Billionaire
Lui Che Woo''s Galaxy also had 100 percent occupancy. </p>
<h2>Adelson, Wynn </h2>
<p>Asian casino notes rose every month since September 2011 to
a record on Jan. 31, according to an index compiled by Credit
Suisse Group AG, and outpaced U.S. counterparts in January by
the most since May. </p>
<p>The former Portuguese colony ended Stanley Ho''s 40-year
monopoly on gambling in 2002, and by the end of last year it
played host to 35 casinos, according to government statistics.
The Hong Kong units of companies controlled by Sheldon Adelson
and Steve Wynn currently have plans to invest $6.6 billion on
new gaming tables and hotel rooms in the city. </p>
<p>Casino revenue in Macau rose 13 percent to $38 billion in
2012, according to data published by the Gaming Inspection and
Coordination Bureau, compared with $6.2 billion of takings on
the Las Vegas strip. CLSA Ltd. forecasts annual revenue in the
former colony will reach $100 billion by 2020. </p>
<h2>Substantial Expansion'' </h2>
<p>The Macau businesses are highly cash generative and
there''s a substantial expansion in tables et cetera underway,
Edmund Harriss, London-based investment director at Guinness
Atkinson Asset Management, said in a Feb. 14 interview.
Crackdowns are part and parcel of the industry. As a
bondholder, I see the businesses as attractive. </p>
<p>Guinness manages $436 million of assets and owns Galaxy''s
yuan-denominated notes, Harriss said. Goldman Sachs Asset
Management oversees $854 billion globally, including emerging-
market debt funds that hold Melco''s Chinese-currency bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>As middlemen and moneylenders, junket operators help bring
high-rollers to Macau, who account for 70 percent of casino
revenue. China will clamp down on the operators after the Lunar
New Year, the Times reported. Police detained people from at
least three of the biggest junket companies in December, the
Wall Street Journal reported in December. </p>
<p>We haven''t heard anything like that, Melco CEO Lawrence
Ho said on a conference call on Feb. 6. We continue to be very
positive. This year is definitely going to be better than last
year. Galaxy, Sands China Ltd., and MGM China Holdings Ltd.
all declined to comment when contacted earlier this month. </p>
<h2>Headline Risks'' </h2>
<p>Macau''s government will strengthen its licensing system for
junket operators and work with law enforcement to tackle
gambling-related crimes, Francis Tam, secretary for economy and
finance, said on Feb. 7. </p>
<p>While crackdowns have resulted in headline risks, these
have only moderately restrained the fundamental story, Kevin McSweeney, a Toronto-based fixed-income manager at CI
Investments Inc., which manages $74 billion of assets including
casino bonds, said in an e-mail today. Macau is an ever-
growing hub. While equities are subject to growth risk, cash
flow at these levels of gaming supply is excellent and pricing
power should provide a tailwind. </p>
<p>China''s new leadership led by incoming president Xi Jinping
takes over in March, after pledging to cut lavish spending and
fight corruption. A crackdown on Macau junket operators can''t be
ruled out, Lantis Li, a Hong Kong-based gaming analyst at
Capital Securities Corp., said in an interview yesterday. </p>
<h2>Visitors Surge </h2>
<p>Macau received 994,192 visitors during the Golden Week
holiday from Feb. 10 through Feb. 16, with mainland Chinese
accounting for two-thirds of them, according to data published
by the tourist office on its website. The total represents a 21
percent jump from same holiday in January last year. </p>
<p>The trends on the ground are very strong, certainly with
the mass market, said Grant Govertsen, a Macau-based analyst
at Union Gaming. Visitations and gaming levels are robust.
Revenue will climb to as much as $44 billion this year, he said
in a Feb. 15 interview. </p>
<p>The cost of insuring Chinese sovereign bonds against non-
payment using five-year credit-default swaps dropped four basis
points this month to 65 in New York yesterday, according to data
provider CMA. It touched 72 basis points on Feb. 4, the highest
since October. The contracts pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities should a borrower fail to
adhere to its debt agreements. </p>
<h2>New Resorts </h2>
<p>The yuan was little changed at 6.2424 per dollar as of
12:14 p.m. in Shanghai, according to China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.02
percent to 6.3265, after gaining 0.11 percent last week while
the onshore market was shut for the Lunar New Year. </p>
<p>The yield on the government''s 10-year bonds was 3.60
percent yesterday, compared with 3.61 percent on Jan. 31. The
yield has climbed 25 basis points in the past six months as
growth in the world''s second-largest economy accelerated. </p>
<p>Wynn Macau Ltd. plans to invest $4 billion in a new resort
in Macau, which will add as many as 500 gaming tables, the
company said in June last year. MGM China Holdings will spend
$2.6 billion on its second casino resort in the gambling hub,
according to an October statement. </p>
<p>Galaxy is allocating $2.1 billion to add 500 tables by 2015,
it said in April. A new round of expansion could start by early
2014 on Macau''s Cotai strip, costing as much as HK$50 billion
($6.4 billion), spokeswoman Yoko Ku said in an interview in
December. </p>
<h2>Casino Stocks </h2>
<p>The Bloomberg Industries Macau (China) Index of six gaming
stocks dropped 6.7 percent in the two days through Feb. 7. It
made up most of that decline by Feb. 15 before falling 3.8
percent so far this week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Galaxy''s stocks dropped 5.2 percent today, snapping a
three-day gain since trading resumed in Hong Kong after the
Lunar New Year. Melco shares declined 1.9 percent, following a
6.9 percent advance in the previous three days. </p>
<p>The recent noise about possible regulatory changes may
reduce growth expectations, which has affected the share prices
but has less impact on credit, Goldman''s Niaz said. Further
efforts to improve controls, transparency and fair practices
would be long-term positive for the market, he said. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd., Australia''s
largest soft-drink bottler, posted full-year profit that missed
analyst estimates after taking A$146 million ($150 million) of
writedowns on its packaged food business. </p>
<p>Net income fell 22 percent to A$460 million in 2012, the
Sydney-based Coke bottler said in a statement today. That
compares with the A$558 million average of nine analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profit before one-time charges
rose to the top of the company''s forecast of a four percent to
five percent growth rate. </p>
<p>Imports of cheaper overseas produce and a 20 percent fall
in the price of fresh fruit forced a writedown at its SPC
Ardmona foods business, whose products include tinned tomatoes
and Goulburn Valley fruit in syrup, the company said. The
previous year''s profit included a A$60 million one-time gain
related to the sale of its beer venture to SABMiller Plc. </p>
<p>The high Australian dollar continues to have an impact on
SPC, reducing its product''s competitiveness versus imports,
Mark Christensen, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in Sydney, wrote
in a Feb. 5 note to clients. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Amatil shares rose 1.7 percent to A$13.86 at
10:36 a.m. in Sydney. The stock has gained 17 percent in the
past year, trailing the 20 percent rise in the benchmark SP/ASX
200 index. The Coke bottler is 29 percent owned by the Coca-Cola
Co., the world''s biggest soft-drink maker, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Restructuring Charges </h2>
<p>The one-time items included a A$48 million writedown of
goodwill in the SPC Ardmona business and A$98 million in
restructuring charges as it cut the value of inventory to more
realistic selling prices. </p>
<p>Our business is in the best shape ever, Terry Davis,
managing director, told an investor briefing in Sydney. Coca-
Cola Amatil''s level of profit margin, which was 21 percent in
its Australian drinks business during the year, are still seen
as the benchmark performance levels across the global Coke
system, he said, referring to the group of companies that
bottle Coca-Cola''s concentrates. </p>
<p>Total revenue increased 6.3 percent to A$5.18 billion
during the period, while cost of goods sold -- the amount spent
on cans, bottles, soft-drink concentrate and other product
inputs -- was little changed at 56 percent of trading revenue. </p>
<p>Earnings before interest and tax in Australia rose 3.3
percent to A$627 million as the company increased sales volumes
in the face of discounting by Asahi Group Holdings Inc., the
Australian bottler of Pepsi and Schweppes. </p>
<h2>Indonesian Growth </h2>
<p>Indonesia and Papua New Guinea posted a 17 percent rise in
Ebit to A$103 million, with volumes up 10 percent on the back of
strong performances from Minute Maid Pulpy juice, the company
said. </p>
<p>Sales from the unit would exceed A$1 billion during the
year, Davis said, and it would take up about A$200 million of
the A$420 million the company plans to spend on capital projects
this year. </p>
<p>Ebit from New Zealand and Fiji fell 12 percent to A$70
million as New Zealand experienced a cool, wet summer and local
retailers reduced stock levels. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley and JPMorgan Chase  Co. were chosen to compete to
handle the government''s sale of a stake in OAO Alrosa, the
world''s largest diamond miner by output, the Russian Economy
Ministry said in a statement on its website. </p>
<p>The government plans to sell 7 percent of Alrosa, according
to a Feb. 5 statement by the nation''s property-management
agency. Alrosa, 51 percent owned by the Russian government,
accounts for one-quarter of global diamond production byvalue,
according to its website. </p>
<p>Russia is reviving efforts to reduce the government''s role
in the economy after Rosneft, Russia''s largest oil company,
agreed in October to take over TNK-BP, owned equally by London-
based BP Plc and a group of billionaires, for $54.8 billion in
the third-biggest petroleum acquisition. Russia raised 159.3
billion rubles ($5.3 billion) through the sale in August of 7.6
percent in OAO Sberbank, the nation''s largest lender. Other
companies earmarked for privatization this year include lender
VTB Group, shipper OAO Sovcomflot and Russian Railways. </p>
<p>The government wants to raise 260 billion rubles to 270
billion rubles from no fewer than eight asset sales in 2013, up
from an estimated 223 billion rubles this year, Economy Minister
Andrei Belousov said in televised remarks at a Cabinet meeting
in October. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are among 23
foreign and domestic banks selected to advise on a 1 trillion-
ruble, three-year asset sale program. The three banks, along
with Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG, helped advise on last
year''s Sberbank asset sale. Separately, New York-based Goldman
Sachs said this month it had been hired by the Kremlin to help
improve Russia''s image and attract more institutional investors. </p>
<p>Alrosa, based in Mimy, Russia, and traded on the over-the-
counter market in Moscow, advanced 1.1 percent to 31.88 rubles.
The stock has gained 6.3 percent this year. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. unfairly changed its U.K. pension plan in an effort to
reduce an 890 million-pound ($1.4 billion) deficit, according to
a lawsuit by workers who claim a breach of trust. </p>
<p>The 2009 changes, known within IBM as Project Waltz,
reduced retirement benefits for about 4,500 workers, lawyers for
some of the employees said in court documents setting out their
claim. In 2008, the pension plan went from a surplus to a
deficit as a result of stock market declines, IBM said in its
court papers from the trial. </p>
<p>What IBM did not do, contrary to what it is accused of,
is either break any promises'' or renege on any assurances,''
the information technology company said. </p>
<p>IBM''s pension plans had a deficit of about $10.4 billion at
the end of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company altered the plans to make them more affordable and less
volatile, it said in the U.K. trial documents. The employees
argue in their court filings the pension losses were a result of
investing in equities, the risks of which IBM had knowingly
and willingly embraced. A trial on the group''s claim started
today. </p>
<p>According to the workers'' lawsuit, Project Waltz closed to
most employees the company''s defined benefit plan, which
delivers set payments during retirement; changed early
retirement terms; and stopped plan members benefitting from pay
increases. </p>
<p>IBM said its pension trustee refused to enact the Project
Waltz changes until a court ruled on their legality. </p>
<h2>Perhaps Unsurprisingly'' </h2>
<p>The changes proved to be, perhaps unsurprisingly,
unpopular with many of the affected members, the company said.
Its U.K. business was uncompetitive and the Armonk, New
York-based company set a goal to increase profit margins there
to 34 percent by the end of 2012. </p>
<p>David Young, a lawyer for the employees taking part in the
trial, declined to comment. IBM''s U.K. spokesman Ken Saunders
didn''t immediately respond to e-mails and phone calls seeking
comment. </p>
<p>The case is: IBM United Kingdom Holdings Ltd., IBM United

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., the world''s
largest energy company by market value, said new shale projects
in the U.S. and heavy-oil developments in Canada helped swell
crude and natural gas reserves last year. </p>
<p>Exxon added reserves equivalent to 1.8 billion barrels in
2012, raising its year-end total to 25.2 billion, the Irving,
Texas-based company said in statement today. The additions were
enough to replace 115 percent of total output and 174 percent of
its crude and liquids production. </p>
<p>The company returns to having more than half of its
reserves in liquids, instead of gas. At the end of 2012, the
company''s reserves were comprised of 51 percent liquids, such as
crude, and 49 percent gas, according to the statement, a
reversal of 2011''s percentages. </p>
<p>Three-fourths of the new reserves resulted from discoveries
and re-evaluations of existing fields in the Woodford shale in
Oklahoma, the Bakken formation in North Dakota, and the Cold
Lake and Hebron developments in Canada, according to the
statement. </p>
<p>Exxon rose 1.1 cents to $89.32 at the close in New York.

<p>Oil companies didn''t have to add
MTBE to gasoline to meet federal pollution standards, two
witnesses told a New Hampshire jury that will weigh whether
ExxonMobil Corp. is liable for contaminating the state''s
drinking water with the chemical. </p>
<p>Duane Bordvick, who worked as an executive at oil refiner
Tosco Corp., said in videotaped testimony played today in state
court in Concord that his company made MTBE-free gasoline in
California that met U.S. Clean Air Act requirements as early as
1999. Bruce Burke, an oil refinery expert, testified that there
were alternatives to adding the chemical, methyl tertiary butyl
ether. </p>
<p>Refiners could have used ethanol instead of MTBE back in
the ''80s when decisions were being made, Burke, a senior vice
president of consulting for Nexant Inc., told the jury today. </p>
<p>New Hampshire might seek more than $200 million from
ExxonMobil, the last defendant on trial in a lawsuit filed in
2003. ExxonMobil has argued that it isn''t liable for damages
because it used MTBE to comply with federal regulations, which
pre-empt state law. MTBE was used to make gasoline burn more
thoroughly to reduce air pollution, as required under the 1990
Clean Air Act. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil has said in court that ethanol wasn''t a good
choice because there wasn''t enough of it when the government
required an additive. The Irving, Texas-based company has also
argued that New Hampshire was aware of the risks of MTBE when it
agreed to participate in a federal clean-air program. </p>
<h2>Highly Soluble </h2>
<p>MTBE is highly soluble in water and can be carried great
distances from where it is leaked. It leaked from gas stations,
junkyards, underground storage tanks and pipe fittings,
according to the state, which banned the additive as of January
2007. Bordvick said Tosco made MTBE-free gasoline because of
evidence that the additive could harm groundwater. </p>
<p>We wanted to demonstrate that, should regulations change
to allow everyone to do this, it could be done, Bordvick said.
There were significant monies to be spent, but it was
doable. Tosco is now a unit of ConocoPhillips Co. </p>
<p>New Hampshire has said that it could cost about
$818 million to test, monitor and clean its groundwater. It''s
seeking damages based on the number of contaminated wells and on
ExxonMobil''s market share of gasoline sold in the state during
the period covered by the lawsuit. Based on an estimate that the
company''s share was about 30 percent, New Hampshire could ask
the jury for an award of $245 million. </p>
<h2>Cleanup Funds </h2>
<p>The state has received $213 million from oil companies for
two cleanup funds since 1989 through a 1.5 cent-a-gallon fee on
all gasoline imported into in the state. The funds have
$4 million left, the state said in court. </p>
<p>Citgo Petroleum Corp., the other remaining defendant in the
New Hampshire case when trial began, filed a $16 million
settlement agreement with the state on Feb. 15. </p>
<p>Besides ExxonMobil and Citgo, New Hampshire also sued Shell
Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips, Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA
and Hess Corp. All settled before the trial began except
ExxonMobil and Citgo. </p>
<p>The state received more than $100 million in settlements
from defendants before Citgo settled, according to court papers. </p>
<p>New Hampshire''s suit is one of scores of cases involving
MTBE filed since 2000 against oil refiners, fuel distributors
and chemical makers. MTBE lawsuits have been consolidated in
federal court in New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and
motions. </p>
<p>In 2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York
City $104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells
in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. </p>
<p>The New Hampshire trial began Jan. 14. The state said it
expects to rest Feb. 21. ExxonMobil would then present its case. </p>
<p>The case is New Hampshire v. Hess Corp., 03-C-0550, New
Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp.''s Skype unit, which
includes Lync software for corporate instant messaging and
Internet calling, is approaching $2 billion in annual sales. </p>
<p>The division is getting close to the size of Microsoft''s
SharePoint business, which focuses on tools that help employees
collaborate, according to Giovanni Mezgec, a general manager in
the Skype division. SharePoint will bring in more than $2
billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, Microsoft said
in November. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has 5 million
users for Lync, its Internet-calling product for companies.
That''s up from 3 million 14 months ago, Mezgec said. Microsoft
wants to sell more Lync software to corporations to catch up
with Cisco Systems Inc. in the market for Internet telephony and
communications, which Forrester Research Inc. predicts will be
worth $14.5 billion in 2015. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, paid $8.5
billion to buy Skype in 2011 to add the most popular Web-calling
service, targeted at consumers. Skype had about $800 million in
sales when Microsoft acquired the company. </p>
<p>Of the 100 largest companies, by Fortune magazine''s
ranking, 90 are Lync customers, Mezgec said. </p>
<p>By June, Lync users will be able to connect to Skype for
telephony, instant messaging, and to see whether contacts are
online, according to a blog post by Skype President Tony Bates,
who is speaking today at a Lync conference in San Diego. </p>
<p>Mobile versions of Lync for Microsoft''s Windows Phone and
Apple Inc.''s iOS will be available early next month. An
application for Google Inc.''s Android smartphones is planned for
a month later, Bates said. </p>

<p>General Mills Inc., the maker of
Cheerios cereal, said profit would rise at a high single-digit
percentage rate in fiscal 2014 and reiterated its earnings
forecast for this year. </p>
<p>We see stronger growth in our future, Chief Executive
Officer Ken Powell said in a statement today. Analysts project
an increase of 8 percent to $2.90 per share, according to the
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>In the fiscal year ending in May 2014, General Mills also
plans to return more cash to investors through share
repurchasing and dividend growth, Chief Financial Officer Don Mulligan said in the statement. Net sales from international
operations are expected to exceed $5 billion in fiscal 2013,
General Mills said. </p>
<p>General Mills, the owner of Yoplait yogurt and Pillsbury
cookie dough, rose 0.9 percent to $44.99 at 8:19 a.m. in New

<p>Microsoft Corp. said its free
Outlook.com Web-based e-mail service has gained 60 million
active users in its first six months, with a third of those
switching from Google Inc.''s Gmail. </p>
<p>Microsoft had expected it to take a year to reach that
level of usage and it took Gmail two years to get there,
Dharmesh Mehta, a senior director for Outlook.com, said in an
interview. A third of active users are Gmail customers now using
Outlook.com as their primary free e-mail account, he said. </p>
<p>While free e-mail isn''t a huge money-maker -- Mehta said
Outlook.com carries about 60 percent fewer advertisements than
Microsoft''s previous Hotmail product -- the Redmond, Washington-
based company considers it critical to gaining and retaining
consumers. Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, has
been losing users of its Windows operating system to smartphones
and tablets such as Apple Inc.''s iPad. </p>
<p>Outlook.com, accessed mainly via Web browsers, shares the
brand name with Microsoft''s e-mail, contacts and calendar
program, part of the Office suite of software installed on
personal computers running Windows. </p>
<p>The software has been in preview since July 31. Microsoft
is releasing the final version today, with features mostly
unchanged. Outlook.com works on Windows-based machines, as well
as Apple''s. There''s also an application for devices running
Google''s Android mobile-operating system. </p>
<p>To promote the service, Microsoft is beginning what Mehta
says is the biggest-ever advertising campaign for an e-mail
product, spending tens of millions of dollars on U.S.
television, online, print and bus ads to market Outlook.com. The
company will also run TV ads in Europe in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>Microsoft will also begin moving customers to Outlook.com
from its Hotmail service, Mehta said. Microsoft will initially
encourage Hotmail users to switch before moving them permanently
by the end of the first half. While Hotmail users can keep their
old e-mail addresses, they will use the new Outlook.com
interface, Microsoft said. </p>

<p>ExxonMobil Corp. challenged New
Hampshire''s assertion that it sold about 30 percent of the
gasoline containing an additive that contaminated the state''s
drinking water, a jury was told. </p>
<p>Justine Hastings, an economics professor at Brown
University, testified for the state today in New Hampshire that
she used tax records and company reports to the government to
determine how much gasoline ExxonMobil sold there from 1988 to
2005. The state expects to use market share information in
seeking damages if the company is found liable. </p>
<p>New Hampshire said it could cost about $818 million to
test, monitor and clean up its groundwater. Based on its market
share estimate of 30 percent for ExxonMobil, it might ask the
jury for an award of $245 million. </p>
<p>Cross-examining Hastings, ExxonMobil lawyer Deborah Barnard
said she should have used refinery data for the market share
estimate instead of the methods she used. Barnard reminded her
that when questioned by lawyers before the trial she had said
refinery information was a possible method of calculation. </p>
<p>Hastings said in court she provided a refinery-data
estimate of 6.9 percent for the jury to look at, then rejected
that figure because it didn''t accurately represent market share. </p>
<p>Gasoline is co-mingled, and it can''t be traced from a
refinery to an endpoint, Hastings said. If you tried to
measure how many molecules come from a refinery to an endpoint,
there''s no data to base that measurement on. </p>
<h2>Federal Regulations </h2>
<p>ExxonMobil has argued in court that it isn''t liable for
damage because it added methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, to
gasoline to comply with federal regulations, which pre-empt
state law. Oil companies added MTBE to make gasoline burn more
thoroughly in order to reduce air pollution, as required under
the 1990 Clean Air Act. </p>
<p>In testimony for the state yesterday, Duane Bordvick, who
worked at oil refiner Tosco Corp., said his company made MTBE-
free gasoline in California that met Clean Air Act requirements
as early as 1999. Tosco is now a unit of ConocoPhillips (COP) Co. </p>
<p>Bruce Burke, an oil refinery expert, testified that ethanol
could have been used in place of MTBE. </p>
<p>Refiners could have used ethanol instead of MTBE back in
the 80s when decisions were being made, Burke, a senior vice
president of consulting for Nexant Inc., said. </p>
<h2>Engine Damage </h2>
<p>ExxonMobil lawyer William Stack said ethanol wasn''t a good
choice as a gasoline additive because at that time it wasn''t in
adequate enough supply and also because it caused damage to
engines. </p>
<p>The company has also argued that the state was aware of the
risks of MTBE when it agreed to participate in a federal clean-
air program. </p>
<p>MTBE, which New Hampshire banned as of January 2007,
is highly soluble in water and can be carried great distances
from where it leaked. It leaked from gas stations, vehicle
junkyards, underground storage tanks and pipe fittings, the
state said. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil is the last defendant in the state''s case. Citgo
Petroleum Corp. filed a $16 million settlement agreement with
the state on Feb. 15. </p>
<p>New Hampshire had received more than $100 million in
settlements from defendants before Citgo settled, according to
court papers. </p>
<h2>Suits Consolidated </h2>
<p>Besides ExxonMobil and Citgo, New Hampshire also sued Shell
Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips, Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA
and Hess Corp. All settled before the trial began except
ExxonMobil and Citgo. </p>
<p>This is one of scores of cases involving MTBE filed since
2000 against oil refiners, fuel distributors and chemical
makers. MTBE lawsuits have been consolidated in federal court in
New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and motions. </p>
<p>In 2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York
City $104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells
in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. </p>
<p>The New Hampshire trial began Jan. 14. The state said it
expects to rest its case tomorrow. ExxonMobil would then present
its case. </p>
<p>The case is New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-C-0550, New
Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s Bear Stearns
unit asked a federal judge to throw out a regulator''s lawsuit
that claims it used misleading documents to sell $3.6 billion in
mortgage-backed securities to credit unions that later failed. </p>
<p>Bear Stearns, in papers filed yesterday with the U.S. court
in Kansas City, Kansas, contends that the National Credit Union
Administration board is unfairly blaming the bank because the
credit unions took widely known risks that eventually
backfired. </p>
<p>Despite warnings from the offering documents, the news
media and even the board itself, the credit unions made the
informed decision to plunge the majority of their assets into
residential mortgage-backed securities at the height of the
housing bubble, Bear Stearns said in court papers. </p>
<p>Ignoring its own assessment of what actually happened,
the board now seeks to blame defendants for the credit union''s
losses, the company argued. </p>
<p>NCUA, an Alexandria, Virginia-based independent federal
agency, is responsible for recovering losses to minimize the
costs to its industry-paid stabilization fund. </p>
<p>John Fairbanks, an NCUA spokesman, declined to comment on
the Bear Stearns filing, saying the agency doesn''t comment on
pending litigation. </p>
<h2>Regulator''s Suit </h2>
<p>The agency sued the JPMorgan Chase unit in December, acting
as liquidator of the U.S. Central Federal Credit Union and the
Western Corporate Federal Credit Union, each of which were
placed into conservatorship in 2009 and into involuntary
liquidation a year later, as well as the Southwest Corporate
Federal Credit Union and Members United Corporate Federal Credit
Union, which were placed in conservatorship, then liquidation,
in 2010. </p>
<p>Bear Stearns''s offering documents said originators of the
underlying mortgages had adhered to underwriting guidelines that
had, in reality, been systematically abandoned, making the
investments riskier than represented, NCUA said in its
complaint. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) acquired Bear Stearns in 2008. The
regulator separately sued the New York-based bank as successor
in interest to Washington Mutual Bank and has eight other cases
pending against defendants including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
and investment banking units of Barclays Plc (BARC) and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. </p>
<p>Barclays Capital Inc. in November asked the court to
dismiss the claims it faced, claiming they were filed too late.
RBS Securities Inc. is appealing an adverse ruling last year by
a federal judge in Topeka, Kansas. </p>
<p>Bear Stearns, arguing a federal appeals court ruling in the
RBS case could address issues in the suit it faces, asked U.S.
District Judge J. Thomas Marten to consider suspending the case
until the Denver-based court rules. </p>
<p>The case is National Credit Union Administration Board v.
Bear Stearns  Co., 12-cv-2781, U.S. District Court, District of
Kansas (Kansas City). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. is seeking to
sell securities tied to new U.S. home loans without government
backing in its first offering since the financial crisis that
the debt helped trigger. </p>
<p>The deal may close this month, according to a person
familiar with the discussions. Servicers of the underlying loans
may include the New York-based lender, First Republic Bank and
Johnson Bank, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because terms aren''t set. </p>
<p>The market for so-called non-agency mortgage securities is
reviving as the Federal Reserve''s $85 billion a month of bond
purchases help push investors to seek potentially higher
returns. As deals accelerate, Pacific Investment Management Co.
is questioning the prices paid. At the same time, a weakening of
contract clauses that offer protection to investors if the loans
don''t match their promised quality is stoking debate, said Kroll
Bond Rating Agency analyst Glenn Costello. </p>
<p>There''s a pretty heavy dialogue going on right now
between all participants in the market about what makes sense,
Costello, who is based in New York, said last week in a
telephone interview. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the bank''s potential transaction. </p>
<h2>Redwood Offerings </h2>
<p>Redwood Trust Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG, the only
non-agency issuers since the market collapsed in 2008, have also
been working on deals this month. Redwood created $1.1 billion
of the debt in January, after issuance tied to new loans totaled
$3.5 billion in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with less than $1 billion in all of 2010 and 2011. </p>
<p>The bonds have been backed by so-called prime jumbo loans,
which are larger than allowed in government-supported programs.
For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans with the lowest costs for
borrowers using 20 percent down payments, limits range from
$417,000 to $625,500 in high-cost areas. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is telling investors its deal''s terms may allow
some of the so-called representations and warranties about the
mortgages from originators or itself to expire after 36 months
to 60 months, the person said. Such contract clauses, which can
be used to force loan repurchases, have led to billions of
dollars of costs for banks on debt made during the housing boom. </p>
<p>After Credit Suisse included so-called sunsets of 36 months
on certain buyback promises in a November deal, Standard 
Poor''s, the only grader to rate the bonds, said in a statement
that the move didn''t affect its view of the debt''s risks. The
ratings firm cited the exceptionally high credit quality of
the loans and that all of them had been reviewed by third-party
firms before being packaged into the securities. </p>
<h2>Skeptical View </h2>
<p>Rivals including Fitch Ratings, which publicly called SP''s
grades too high, are taking a more skeptical view. Changes such
as sunset provisions and clauses that void loan-quality
warranties if borrowers default after events such as job losses
or illness generally should require greater so-called credit
enhancement, said Rui Pereira, a managing director at Fitch. </p>
<p>Credit enhancement can include some bonds taking losses
before others, cash reserves or payments from the underlying
assets that exceed coupons on the securities created. </p>
<p>Less investor-friendly provisions are something we need
to take into account, Pereira said last week in a telephone
interview. </p>
<h2>Gold Standard'' </h2>
<p>Issuers are seeking to move past a framework for
representations and warranties provided by Redwood that
represented a gold standard, Kathryn Kelbaugh, a senior
analyst at Moody''s Investors Service, said last month during a
panel discussion at a securitization conference in Las Vegas. </p>
<p>In Redwood''s latest deal, it may sell a top-rated class as
large as $561.2 million with a 2.5 percent coupon at about 102
cents on the dollar, a person familiar with that offering said
today, asking not to be named because terms aren''t set. </p>
<p>That compares with current prices of about 99 cents on the
dollar for Fannie Mae-guaranteed 2.5 percent securities,
according to Bloomberg data. Bonds issued in recent months by
Redwood have been insanely expensive by comparison with
Fannie Mae debt, Pimco''s Scott Simon said in an interview
yesterday. </p>
<p>I can''t believe someone would pay anywhere near where
they have sold them, said Simon, the mortgage-bond head at
Newport Beach, California-based Pimco, manager of the world''s
largest mutual fund. </p>
<p>The higher prices being discussed may signal bond buyers
are gambling that the larger loans will remain outstanding for
shorter periods if mortgage rates continue to rise, and also
suggest that investors are looking past the potentially greater
default risks of Redwood''s securities. </p>
<h2>Moving Costs </h2>
<p>Wealthier homeowners may find it relatively easy to absorb
the costs of moving amid higher borrowing costs, said David Land, a mortgage-bond manager at Advantus Capital Management
Inc., who said he''s not investing in the deal because he sees
too many of the loans as having risky features. By paying
premiums more than face value, bondholders would also risk being
damaged by homeowner refinancing if rates drop. </p>

<p>The biggest U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup Inc. are lending the smallest portion of their deposits in five years as cash floods in from savers and a slow economy damps demand from borrowers. </p> <p>The average loan-to-deposit ratio for the top eight commercial banks fell to 84 percent in the fourth quarter from 87 percent a year earlier and 101 percent in 2007, according to data compiled by Credit Suisse Group AG. Lending as a proportion of deposits dropped at five of the banks and was unchanged at two, the data show. </p> <p>Consumers and companies are reluctant to take on risk until they see more signs that business is improving, even as the Federal Reserve maintains near-record low interest rates designed to fuel growth. Putting more of the unused money to work could boost profit and help turn around the U.S. economy, whose 0.1 percent annualized drop in the fourth quarter was its worst showing since 2009. </p> <p>You''ve got to see sustainable economic activity before lending picks up, said Paul Miller, an analyst who follows the industry at FBR Capital Markets Corp. Until then, banks will be stuck with idle cash, Miller said. There''s no place for them to put it. </p> <p>Bankers are also holding back as regulators and investors pressure them to curtail risks that fueled the 2008 global credit crisis. They''re facing a barrage of new federal rules and capital requirements that require them to hold more funds in reserve and evaluate borrowers more stringently, amid concern that loans made at current rates may turn into losers when more normal levels return. </p>

<p>New Hampshire''s last witness in a
trial alleging Exxon Mobil Corp. contaminated the state''s
drinking water with the gasoline additive MTBE told jurors
studies indicated the chemical raised cancer risks in rodents. </p>
<p>Robert Biles, a retired Exxon Mobil toxicologist who was
ordered to be a witness for the state, said in videotaped
testimony today that several studies of MTBE on mice and rats
showed an increased risk of reproductive problems as well as
cancer. </p>
<p>There was some evidence of severe toxicity in some of the
studies, Biles said. </p>
<p>The state has estimated it could cost about $818 million to
test, monitor and clean up groundwater contaminated with methyl
tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE. Based on New Hampshire''s estimate
that Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil (XOM) sold 30 percent of the
state''s gasoline from 1988 to 2005, it might ask the jury for
damages of $245 million if the company is found liable. Other
oil companies sued by the state have settled. </p>
<p>The state''s lawyers questioned Biles about studies by the
American Petroleum Institute showing that at mid-to-high levels
ingestion or inhalation of MTBE elevated the risk of brain
tumors, liver cancer, blood cancer and kidney cancer in mice and
rats. </p>
<h2>Findings Expected </h2>
<p>Exxon Mobil lawyers today played other excerpts from
Biles''s taped deposition in which he said the toxicology
findings weren''t unexpected or cause for alarm. </p>
<p>All toxicology studies produce effects, Biles said.
We''re all exposed to chemicals every day that cause risks. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil is scheduled to begin presenting its case on
March 4. </p>
<p>Yesterday, Exxon Mobil challenged state testimony by
Justine Hastings, an economist who said her methodology
determined that the company sold 30 percent of the state''s
gasoline. The company''s lawyers said she should have used
refinery data, which would have shown a market share as low as
6.9 percent. Hastings said that method can''t adequately measure
how much gasoline is sold. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil has argued in court that it isn''t liable for
damage because it added MTBE to gasoline to comply with federal
regulations, which pre-empt state law. Oil companies added MTBE
to make gasoline burn more thoroughly in order to reduce air
pollution, as required under the 1990 Clean Air Act. The company
argued that the state was aware of the risks of MTBE when it
agreed to participate in a federal clean-air program. </p>
<h2>MTBE Alternatives </h2>
<p>Witnesses for the state have testified that oil companies
could have used chemicals other than MTBE to increase the oxygen
content of the fuel, such as ethanol. </p>
<p>William Stack, an Exxon Mobil lawyer, said in court this
week that ethanol wasn''t a good choice as an additive because at
the time of the federal mandate it caused engine damage and
wasn''t in adequate enough supply. </p>
<p>MTBE, which New Hampshire banned in January 2007, is highly
soluble in water and can be carried great distances from where
it leaked. It leaked from gas stations, vehicle junkyards,
underground storage tanks and pipe fittings, the state has said. </p>
<p>Citgo Petroleum Corp., which was a co-defendant with Exxon
Mobil in the trial, filed a $16 million settlement agreement
with the state on Feb. 15. New Hampshire had received more than
$100 million in settlements from other companies before Citgo''s
agreement, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Shell Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil
Ltd., Vitol SA and Hess Corp. settled before the trial began. </p>
<p>The New Hampshire case is one of scores of lawsuits
involving MTBE filed since 2000 against oil refiners, fuel
distributors and chemical makers. MTBE lawsuits have been
consolidated in federal court in New York for pretrial evidence-
gathering and motions. </p>
<p>In 2009, a federal jury ordered Exxon Mobil to pay New York
City $104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells
in the city. Exxon Mobil has appealed. </p>

<p>Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and other lenders justifiably refused additional
loans to an ambitious casino development by Fontainebleau
Las Vegas LLC, as the company had breached a credit agreement
governing the revolving loans, a U.S. appeals court said. </p>
<p>The casino company sued the lenders for $3 billion in 2009,
saying they refused to provide $800 million in funding for the
development. Fontainebleau hadn''t abided by conditions it
undertook to fulfill before the banks would increase their
revolving loans from $150 million, the appeal judges ruled
yesterday in Atlanta. </p>
<p>Fontainebleau, whose corporate parent owns a hotel on 22
acres of Miami Beach, Florida, needed the money to complete a
$2.4 billion casino-hotel being built in Las Vegas. The company
and affiliates filed for bankruptcy in Miami in 2009, and
billionaire investor Carl Icahn bought the unfinished Las Vegas
project for about $150 million in 2010. The appeals court wound
up reviewing two U.S. District Court decisions from Florida on
what they termed a contract dispute. </p>
<p>This case presents more fallout from the failure of the
ambitious Fontainebleau development in Las Vegas, the appeals
judges said in their ruling. After careful review, and having
had the benefit of oral argument, we affirm both rulings by the
district court. </p>
<h2>Fully Drawn'' </h2>
<p>The dispute between Fontainebleau and the banks hinged on
the interpretation of the term fully drawn in the loan
documents, the judges said. When Bank of America, as agent for
the loans, said the request for funds didn''t comply with the
agreement, Fontainebleau said it did. The project collapsed
after the lenders declared a default, and the company filed the
lawsuit alleging breach of contract. </p>
<p>Finding the contract terms ambiguous, the judges said
they couldn''t by law conclude that the lenders broke their
promise to fund the borrowers, as Fontainebleau argued. </p>
<p>Alvin Goldstein, a lawyer for the trustee handling the
bankruptcy, didn''t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on the ruling. Jason Jones, a lawyer for Fontainebleau
Las Vegas, said he wasn''t involved in the appeal. </p>
<p>The case is Fontainebleau Las Vegas LLC v. Bank of America,
11-10468, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
(Atlanta). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) doesn''t
have direct access to information about the beneficial owner
behind transactions in an account in which the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission said suspicious trading of H.J. Heinz
Co. (HNZ) occurred, the bank told the regulator. </p>
<p>The SEC on Feb. 15 sued unknown traders over suspicious
trading of Heinz''s options through what the regulator said was
an account at Goldman Sachs. The SEC will ask a federal judge in
Manhattan at a hearing set for today to freeze the account''s
assets until the case is resolved. The New York-based bank told
the agency the account holder is a Zurich private-wealth client,
the SEC said in a court filing. </p>
<p>Goldman informed me that it does not have direct access
to information about the beneficial owner or owners behind any
particular transaction or position in the account, SEC senior
counsel Megan Bergstrom wrote. </p>
<p>The trades at issue in the SEC''s lawsuit came a day before
Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) and 3G Capital Inc.
announced a $23 billion takeover of Pittsburgh-based Heinz, the
agency said in its complaint. Using a Zurich-based account that
involved call-option contracts, the unidentified traders''
unrealized profit was more than $1.7 million, according to the
SEC. </p>
<p>The SEC has also asked Swiss authorities for assistance in
the effort to identify the traders. Swiss Financial Market
Supervisory Authority, known as Finma, will cooperate with the
SEC''s request within the framework of our mandate, Christina
Buergi, a spokeswoman for Finma, said in a phone interview.
Buergi said the request had been made recently and declined
to comment further. </p>
<h2>Initial Conference </h2>
<p>U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff scheduled an initial
conference in the case today. Rakoff temporarily froze the
assets in the account on Feb. 15 at the SEC''s request and also
issued an order prohibiting the defendants from destroying or
disposing records of any kind related to the transaction. </p>
<p>The SEC on Feb. 20 asked Rakoff to keep the assets frozen
until the case is resolved, saying there is a serious risk
that the substantial proceeds from the defendants trading will
leave the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts in the next few days
and may never be recovered, according to a court filing. </p>
<p>Rakoff said any traders who object to a permanent asset
freeze must appear before him today to explain why he shouldn''t
grant the SEC''s request. </p>
<p>The unidentified traders are foreign traders and trade
through a foreign account, the SEC said. </p>
<h2>Trade Blotter </h2>
<p>The commission provided a redacted copy of a trade blotter
for the account described as a Goldman Sachs omnibus firm
customer facilitation account, which shows that from Sept. 1
through Feb. 13, the only trading in Heinz occurred on the day
before the takeover of the ketchup maker. </p>
<p>The SEC described the account as GS Bank IC Buy Open
Listed Options, GS  CO C/O Zurich Office. </p>
<p>Since the Heinz takeover announcement, the traders'' option
purchases have settled and can be liquidated at any time, the
SEC said. SEC staff attorney David Brown said that on Feb. 15,
he informed Goldman Sachs representatives about the agency''s
plans and also asked the bank to use whatever means they
have to contact the traders. </p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York said this
week that it''s also investigating the matter and is working with
the SEC. </p>
<p>The defendants, using the Goldman Sachs account, invested
almost $90,000 in option positions the day before the deal was
announced, the SEC said. As a result, their position increased
to more than $1.8 million, a rise of almost 2,000 percent. </p>
<h2>Omnibus Account </h2>
<p>The SEC said that the traders had advance material
nonpublic information about the impending deal when they used an
omnibus account in Zurich to buy 2,533 out-of-the-money June
call options, which had a strike price of $65 on Feb. 13. Shares
closed that day at $60.48. </p>
<p>The purchase of the options, which expire on June 22, was
highly unusual, the SEC said. On Feb. 12, only 14 were
purchased, regulators said, while on Feb. 11, no such options
were bought. Since Nov. 14, no more than 61 such contracts had
been purchased on any other single day, the commission said. </p>
<p>Trading in the options gives the right to buy the
underlying shares and profit when the stock rises. The timing
and size of the trades were deemed highly suspicious by the SEC
because the accounts through which the traders purchased the
options had no history of trading Heinz securities in the last
six months. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Certain Unknown Traders in Securities of H.J. Heinz Co., 13-
cv-1080, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Investors reduced holdings of
emerging-market government debt to the lowest level since
October 2008 as rising U.S. Treasury yields eroded the allure of
the assets, a survey by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) shows. </p>
<p>Clients surveyed also cut their investment in developing-
nation currencies by the most since May 2012, as the Japanese
yen weakened, JPMorgan analysts led by Holly Huffman in New York
wrote in a note dated today. The 189 clients in the monthly
survey, who manage a total of $1 trillion in emerging-market
assets, said they have also reduced their positions in interest-
rate markets and corporate debt. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s EMBI Global Index of emerging-market dollar debt
has lost 1.98 percent since Dec. 31, the worst start of a year
since 1995, as 10-year Treasury yields jumped to a 10-month high
Feb. 14. South Korea''s won and Taiwan''s currency have lost about
2 percent this year against the dollar as the 16 percent decline
in the yen over the past six months boosted concern that Asia
will act to weaken their currencies to bolster exports. </p>
<p>Special focus in this month''s survey centered on
reactions to moves in U.S. Treasuries and the Japanese yen,
wrote the analysts. </p>
<p>About 25 percent of investors said they have or will reduce
their holdings of Asian currencies, according to the survey.
Investors have deepened their underweight positions in
currencies, including the Indian rupee, won, Malaysian ringgit,
Philippine peso and Thai baht, the survey showed. </p>

<p>The top lawyers for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
and Oracle Corp. (ORCL), saying software patents are important drivers
of U.S. innovation and economic growth, pressed Congress
yesterday to reject calls to limit that legal protection. </p>
<p>Companies including Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. have said
too many software patents are being used primarily to generate
lawsuits instead of contributing to new products and services.
Microsoft, the world''s biggest software maker, and Oracle say
discussions of ways to curtail litigation shouldn''t become an
excuse to limit the ability to patent software. </p>
<p>My biggest concern, and the concern of many other
software companies, is that there''s going to be a move to
somehow reduce or diminish protection for software, Oracle
General Counsel Dorian Daley said in an interview in Washington. </p>
<p>Daley and her counterpart at Microsoft, Brad Smith, joined
software and manufacturing executives meeting yesterday with
lawmakers and congressional staff members to defend patents for
computer programs. </p>
<p>We have a patent system that has important strengths but
it also has some significant weaknesses, Smith said in the
same interview. </p>
<p>Any new legislation should be directed at ways to reduce
litigation rather than undermining software patents, said Robert
Holleyman, president of Washington-based BSA - The Software
Alliance. </p>
<p>One proposal Google, Microsoft and Oracle agree on is to
make the loser in a patent lawsuit pay the winner''s legal costs,
a move they say would discourage lawsuits by patent owners with
dubious claims. </p>
<p>Large technology companies are united in their ire at
owners of software patents who sue dozens or even hundreds of
companies claiming to have invented aspects of technologies
including online shopping, Internet mapping and tracking
delivery vehicles. </p>
<p>Of the more than 5,600 patent-infringement lawsuits filed
in the U.S. last year, more than 12 percent were filed by just
10 companies over software, according to Bloomberg Law data. </p>
<p>The issue has drawn the attention of President Barack Obama, who on Feb. 14 said patent legislation he signed in 2011
hasn''t captured all the problems of the patent system, such
as the litigation by patent owners derisively called trolls. </p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which
specializes in patent law, is considering a case that could
determine when computer programs are eligible for legal
protection. </p>
<p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is holding meetings on
possible changes to the way it handles applications for software
programs, and is considering rules requiring more disclosure
about the real party in interest in patents and
applications. </p>
<h2>Apple-Samsung Judge Says Companies Must Narrow Patent Suit </h2>
<p>Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics Co. must narrow their
patent-infringement lawsuit case scheduled for trial in 2014, a
judge ruled. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh in San Jose, California,
told lawyers from both companies yesterday that they must
focus and streamline their cases to 25 patent claims, or
elements of the patents at issue, and 25 accused products. </p>
<p>Koh made the request from the bench in the latest of two
related patent cases. The lawsuit was filed last year and covers
technology in newer smartphones made by both companies,
including Samsung''s Galaxy S III and Apple''s iPhone 5. </p>
<p>We''ll keep narrowing and narrowing, Koh said. You''ve
already been litigating this thing for a year; you must know
something about what''s your best case. </p>
<p>In a filing last week, Cupertino, California-based Apple
included Samsung''s Galaxy Note smartphones and tablet computer
in the case. Samsung claimed all generations of Apple''s
iPhone and iPads infringe at least three of its patents,
according to its filing. </p>
<p>Koh last month rejected Apple''s request to add additional
damages to the first patent-infringement case between the two
companies in San Jose. In that case, a jury awarded Apple $1.05
billion, finding the Suwon, South Korea-based company infringed
six of the iPhone maker''s mobile-device patents. </p>
<p>Last year''s case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)
Ltd., 11-cv-1846, the case scheduled for trial next year is
Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 12-cv-630, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). </p>

<h2>Trademark </h2>
<h2>VF''s 7 For All Mankind Loses Trademark Lawsuit at EU Top Court </h2>
<p>Jeans maker 7 For All Mankind lost a final bid to get the
European Union trademark rights to its name after the EU''s top
court ruled in favor of an Italian backpack manufacturer. </p>
<p>The EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg yesterday dismissed
an appeal by the company to get trademark rights across the 27-
nation bloc for Seven For All Mankind. The ruling can''t be
appealed. </p>
<p>The VF Corp. (VFC) unit previously won the rights to the name in
2010 when the bloc''s trademark authority in Alicante, Spain,
rejected a challenge by Italian company Seven SpA. The agency
said there was no likelihood of confusion with the Italian
company''s trademarks for the word Seven. A lower EU court later
overturned that decision. </p>
<p>The EU General Court in 2011 ruled that there is a
certain overall similarity between the marks at issue because
the presence of the word Seven in the names is not
insignificant. </p>
<p>That court, the region''s second-highest, did not commit
the error of law alleged by the applicant, the Court of
Justice ruled, dismissing all points of appeal that were raised. </p>
<p>7 For All Mankind first applied in 2005 for the EU
trademark to cover products such as jewelry, belts, suitcases
and backpacks. Representatives for VF in Greensboro, North
Carolina, didn''t immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment
on the decision, or answer calls before regular office hours. </p>
<p>The case is: C-655/11 P, Seven for all mankind v. Seven. </p>
<h2>CIAA Files Infringement Suit in Advance of Hoops Tournament </h2>
<p>The Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the 101-
year-old athletic conference composed of traditionally African-
American colleges, sued multiple defendants for trademark
infringement. </p>
<p>The Washington-based CIAA filed the suit in federal court
in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Feb. 14, less than two weeks
before its annual basketball tournament is to be held in
Charlotte beginning Feb. 25. </p>
<p>Multiple entities are making unauthorized use of the
association''s marks to trade off its fame, according to the
complaint. The conference complained of infringing Internet
domain names, party planners'' and concert promoters''
unauthorized use of CIAA trademarks, and the sale of counterfeit
merchandise such as athletic gear and souvenirs. </p>
<p>Sellers of the fake merchandise move it from city to city,
using itinerant peddlers without offices, identification,
licenses or addresses, according to court papers. </p>
<p>During the tournament, local law enforcement officers are
dedicated to on-site safety and security and don''t have the
priority or the time to deal with counterfeiters as a criminal
matter, the CIAA said. As a result, the conference said an order
permitting seizure of unauthorized merchandise is needed. </p>
<p>Additionally, the conference asked for an order barring
future infringement of its marks, awards of attorney fees and
litigation costs, money damages, and the transfer of infringing
Internet domain names. </p>
<p>The case is Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association V.
Allure Life Entertainment Group LLC, 3:13-cv-98, U.S. District
Court, Western District of North Carolina (Charlotte). </p>
<h2>Student Facebook Page Taken Down as School Says Mark Infringed </h2>
<p>Following a request from school officials, students at Sam
Houston State University took down a page on Facebook Inc. (FB)''s
social media site where students could use a Web-survey tool to
make any confession they wanted to make, the Houstonian
newspaper reported. </p>
<p>Kris Ruiz, marketing director at the school, said trademark
concerns prompted the request for removal of the SHSU
Confessions page, according to the newspaper. </p>
<p>University policy is to respond to apparent violations
rather than seek them out, Ruiz said, according to the
Houstonian. </p>
<p>A new page with the same function was put up on Facebook as
Prison City Confessions, according to the newspaper. </p>

<h2>Internet Brands Unit Sued Over Divorce Handbook License </h2>
<p>Internet Brands Inc.''s Nolo unit was sued for copyright
infringement by a competing provider of self-help legal
information. </p>
<p>Pennsylvania Full Court Press Inc. claims Nolo had a
license for a limited period of time to publish and sell an
electronic edition of a book it produced. Nolo continued to sell
the product after the license expired in 2004, according to the
complaint filed Feb. 20 in federal court in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>Full Court Press said it lost sales and was otherwise
damaged as a result of Nolo''s conduct. The company asked the
court to order removal of its book -- No-Fault Divorce in
Pennsylvania: A Guide to the Law, With Forms for Filing Your Own
Divorce -- from all Nolo computers and for awards of money
damages, litigation costs and attorney fees. </p>
<p>Internet Brands, based in El Segundo, California, didn''t
respond immediately to an e-mailed request for comment on the
suit. </p>

<h2>RIAA Says Takedown Requests Not Stopping Infringement </h2>
<p>The Recording Industry Association of America, the leader
among copyright owners requesting that Google Inc. (GOOG) take down
search results linking to allegedly infringing content, says the
company''s efforts haven''t had the desired effect. </p>
<p>In a report released yesterday, Washington-based RIAA said
it analyzed the websites listed as serial infringers in
Google''s Copyright Transparency Report and found that they
still managed to appear on page 1 of the search results over
98 percent of the time in the searches conducted. </p>
<p>Authorized download sites such as Apple Inc.''s iTunes,
Amazon.com Inc. and eMusic only appeared in the top 10 results
for little more than half of the searches, the music-industry
trade group said in the report. </p>
<p>In other words, whatever Google has done to its search
algorithms to change the ranking of infringing sites, it doesn''t
appear to be working, RIAA said. More study of Google''s
response is needed, the group said. </p>
<p>According to Google''s report, in the past month, RIAA was
the leading copyright owner reporting allegedly infringing
sites, listing almost 2.36 million URLs. </p>
<p>Google, based in Mountain View, California, said that in
the last six months of 2011, it took down 97 percent of the
search results specified in takedown requests made during that
period. </p>

<p>Jacques Chappuis, head of Morgan
Stanley (MS)''s fund-of-funds business, Alternative Investment
Partners, will leave the firm in May to join Carlyle Group LP. (CG) </p>
<p>Chappuis, 43, will run the re-branded Solutions business at
Carlyle, the second-largest U.S. private-equity firm, according
to a statement today from the Washington-based company. Arthur Lev will replace Chappuis as head of Morgan Stanley''s AIP,
according to a memo sent to the bank''s employees. </p>
<p>Carlyle is seeking to have Chappuis expand the fund-of-
funds business in the same way Michael Mitch Petrick, 51,
who joined from Morgan Stanley in 2010, has built Carlyle''s
Global Markets Strategies segment, which manages hedge-fund and
structured-credit investments. The fund-of-funds unit started in
2011 with the acquisition of a 60 percent stake in AlpInvest
Partners BV, a Dutch money manager and Europe''s largest investor
in private-equity funds at the time. </p>
<p>Jacques has an extraordinary track record of innovation
in the development and delivery of products and services that
meet and anticipate investor needs, Carlyle co-CEO David M. Rubenstein, 63, said in an e-mailed statement. We are
delighted that he will bring his experience and energy to take
our solutions business to a new level of success. </p>
<h2>Citigroup Alumnus </h2>
<p>Carlyle bought the AlpInvest stake as part of its broader
effort to diversify beyond leveraged buyouts, which produce
volatile earnings and delivered lower returns following the U.S.
financial crisis. Chappuis will be charged with creating new
offerings for Carlyle''s limited partners, including customized
accounts, fund-of-funds investments, portfolio advice and risk
management, Carlyle said in the statement. </p>
<p>Demand for investment product customization and
specialization increases by the day, Chappuis said. </p>
<p>Carlyle''s fund-of-funds business has $44 billion of assets
under management, according to the firm''s most recent earnings
report. It produced 2.6 percent -- or $18 million -- of the
company''s $688 million in distributable earnings last year.
Global market strategies, which has been the fastest-growing
division for Carlyle, earned $168 million in 2012. </p>
<p>Chappuis joined Morgan Stanley in 2006, after working at
Citigroup Inc. and Boston Consulting Group Inc. He served as
head of alternative investments for Morgan Stanley''s retail
brokerage division before heading AIP. </p>
<h2>No Reason'' </h2>
<p>Lev, 51, will take on leadership of AIP in addition to his
role leading the long-only asset-management business, according
to the memo from Greg Fleming, 49, who oversees the New York-
based bank''s asset-management division. Matt Burkhard, a Morgan
Stanley spokesman, confirmed the contents of the memo, a copy of
which was obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 54,
said soon after he took over in 2010 that there''s no reason
the firm couldn''t have the world''s largest fund-of-funds
business. AIP has about $29 billion of assets under management
and advisement, a 53 percent increase over the last three years,
according to the memo. Blackstone Group LP (BX)''s Alternative Asset
Management, which has $46 billion in assets under management,
calls itself the world''s biggest. </p>
<p>AIP manages portfolios of hedge funds, private-equity and
real-estate funds, helping investors spread their money across
holdings. Mustafa Jama leads AIP''s hedge-fund group, while
Thomas Dorr heads private-equity investments and David Boyle and
Paul Vosper run the real estate group. Rui De Figueiredo leads
AIP''s portfolio solutions group. </p>
<p>Lev previously held roles as chief strategy officer of
Morgan Stanley''s traditional asset-management unit and general
counsel of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. He left Morgan
Stanley in 2002 to join Greenwich, Connecticut-based FrontPoint
Partners LLC, returning in 2006 when the bank bought the hedge
fund. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V), the world''s largest
electronic payments network, is teaming up with phonemaker
Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) to provide a financial program to enable
mobile handsets to be used like a credit or debit card. </p>
<p>Visa''s PayWave application will be a standard feature on
Samsung devices equipped with near-field-communication
technology, which allows customers to pay for goods or services
by tapping their phones on a reader, the companies said in a
statement today at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The
partners will also cooperate on technology for banks to download
account information securely to Samsung phones for the payments. </p>
<p>Phone companies and financial institutions such as Foster
City, California-based Visa and Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard Inc. (MA) are promoting NFC applications for use in so-
called mobile wallets by encouraging the more than 70,000 people
attending the industry congress this week to pay for coffee and
badge into events with handsets carrying the feature. </p>
<p>The Visa-Samsung global alliance is a first of its kind
between a leading NFC handset manufacturer and payment network
that is paving the way for the implementation of large-scale
mobile payment programs, the companies said. </p>
<p>Companies are looking for partnerships to propel growth in
the nascent NFC market, which requires cooperation among
retailers, banks, credit card companies, handset makers, mobile
phone service providers and manufacturers of point-of-sale
devices. ABI Research estimated in November that the number of
NFC-enabled devices shipped will jump to 1.95 billion in 2017
from as many 102 million predicted for 2012. </p>
<p>Samsung and Visa worked together to offer NFC-based
payments at the London Olympics last year, giving athletes
phones equipped with the feature and installing more than
140,000 payment terminals across the U.K. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is in talks
with its Tokyo landlord to cut office space as it seeks to
reduce expenses, said two people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>The Wall Street firm, which rents six floors of the Mori
Tower in the Roppongi Hills office complex, is in discussions
with Mori Building Co. to vacate two levels, the people said,
asking not to be named as the talks are private. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs joins investment banks including Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604) in reducing costs in Japan after companies shunned
the stock market for fundraising amid a recession that may be
ending. The plan to trim office space comes even as rents in
Tokyo decline to a record low. </p>
<p>The U.S. bank plans to leave the 43rd and 44th floors,
which house its asset management unit and sports facilities, and
remain in the 45th to 48th, the people said. It will transfer
staff to other floors of the 54-story building, one of the
people said. </p>
<p>This is part of a planning process to optimize our
space, Goldman Sachs said in a statement e-mailed to Bloomberg
News, declining to comment further. Hideki Nomura, general
manager of public relations at Mori Building, Japan''s biggest

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, agreed to pay as much as $349 million to
join Beach Energy Ltd. (BPT) in an Australian natural gas exploration
campaign in its first shale investment in the country. </p>
<p>Chevron will acquire as much as 60 percent of a permit in
South Australia and 36 percent of a block in Queensland,
Adelaide-based Beach said today in a statement. The blocks cover
about 810,000 acres in the Cooper Basin, the outback region that
straddles the border of the two states, San Ramon, California-
based Chevron said in a separate statement. </p>
<p>The agreement follows shale investments by ConocoPhillips (COP),
Statoil ASA, BG Group Plc and Hess Corp. in a nation estimated
by the U.S. Energy Information Administration to have the
world''s sixth-biggest potential reserves. Wilson HTM Investment
Group says the accord is the biggest shale gas deal in Australia,
which the government estimates may hold almost 400 trillion
cubic feet of resources. </p>
<p>The fact you''ve got a knowledgeable party coming in says
they think there''s something there, said John Young, a
Melbourne-based analyst at Wilson HTM Investment Group. The
resource in the Cooper is being progressively de-risked and
we''ll over time see a commercial development from this. </p>
<p>Beach rose 5.8 percent to A$1.37 at the close in Sydney,
the most in more than five months. The company had the fifth-
biggest gain on Australia''s key index, which climbed 0.8 percent. </p>
<h2>Biggest Deal </h2>
<p>BG, developing one of the three liquefied natural gas
ventures on the Queensland coast, reached an agreement with
Drillsearch Energy Ltd. in 2011 to fund a A$130 million ($134
million) campaign to explore for gas in the Cooper Basin. </p>
<p>Drillsearch advanced 4.2 percent to A$1.375, and Senex
Energy Ltd. (SXY), another shale explorer in the Cooper Basin, gained
7.5 percent to 64.5 cents, the most in more than six months. </p>
<p>For someone with the world to look at and opportunities
everywhere to recognize the potential of the Cooper is a huge
vote of confidence in the future of the basin, Beach Managing
Director Reginald Nelson said today in a phone interview.
Ultimately it will allow us to move more quickly to accelerate
appraisal and development and will help the company get the
drilling services and equipment it needs, he said. </p>
<p>The U.S. company first approached Beach in early 2012,
according to Nelson. </p>
<h2>Chevron Cash </h2>
<p>Chevron will initially pay Beach $36 million in cash and
cover $95 million in costs for 30 percent of the South Australia
permit and $59 million in cash for 18 percent of the Queensland
acreage, according to the Beach statement. The Australian
company may receive as much as $349 million over two stages that
span several years, Beach said. </p>
<p>About 60 percent of Chevron''s total potential payments
would be in cash, a positive for Beach, according to Young, the
Wilson HTM analyst. </p>
<p>PetroChina Co., the country''s biggest oil and gas producer,
agreed to purchase a 29 percent stake in the Goldwyer shale
project in Western Australia''s Canning Basin from ConocoPhillips,
the Beijing-based company said Feb. 20. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) reaped the most among
the five largest oil companies drilling on U.S. deep water
leases that mistakenly omitted drilling-fee provisions,
according to a report produced by a Democratic lawmaker. </p>
<p>Chevron avoided $1.49 billion in royalties, out of $2.62
billion that the companies would have paid for the right to
produce oil and gas in federal waters, according to the report
today from Representative Edward Markey of Massachusetts using
Interior Department information. More than 100 producers
including BP Plc (BP/), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and
ConocoPhillips (COP) also benefited from the botched leases. </p>
<p>Congress is now debating ways to avoid deep, across-the-
board cuts to defense and domestic priorities such as education,
transportation, law enforcement and environmental protection,
according to the report. Ending royalty-free drilling (and
other giveaways to oil and gas companies) should represent low-
hanging fruit in the search for budget savings. </p>
<p>The Gulf of Mexico leases at issue were signed from 1996
through 2000 under a 1995 law intended to encourage drilling by
dropping fees when oil and gas prices were low and restoring
them when prices rebounded. Because of a bureaucratic error,
leases signed in 1998 and 1999 failed to include price
thresholds that would trigger royalty payments when prices rose. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s

days last year, down from 64 days in 2011 and the fewest since
2007. </p>
<p>The bank''s traders lost money on 10 days in the fourth
quarter, up from eight in the third quarter, the New York-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. Morgan Stanley made
more than $100 million on 23 days in 2012. </p>
<p>Trading revenue at the 10 largest global investment banks
rose 13 percent last year, according to data from industry
analytics firm Coalition Ltd., as concerns about Europe''s
sovereign-debt crisis faded and the U.S. economy grew. Still,
Morgan Stanley''s trading revenue dropped 10 percent as clients
shied away from dealing with the firm during the second quarter
amid a debt-ratings downgrade from Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<p>In January, Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 54,

next two years and reduce the amount of capital used by the
fixed-income trading business as he seeks to double return on

<p>Banks are making irrational
commercial and industrial loans as they seek higher-yielding
assets and the supply of quality borrowers is low, said JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)''s Doug Petno. </p>
<p>Just in the last several months we''ve seen some
irrational behavior, in our view, in terms of structure and
price, Petno, chief executive officer of commercial banking,
said today at an investor conference at the firm''s New York
headquarters. There''s a lot of capital chasing a finite amount
of opportunities. </p>
<p>Commercial and industrial loans jumped 12 percent in 2012
to $1.51 trillion, the largest increase among loan categories,
according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Petno''s unit outpaced the industry in quarter-over-quarter CI
loan growth in each period of 2012, according to his
presentation today. </p>
<p>It''s fiercely competitive, Petno said. Any really
high-quality loan opportunity, all the usual suspects are
competing. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, had $73.6
billion in CI loans as of Dec. 31, according to the
presentation. Health-care companies made up 14 percent of that
total, with state and municipal governments and consumer
products companies each accounting for 9 percent. </p>
<p>Petno said his bank''s controls will help it avoid getting
pressured into making risky loans, including quarterly meetings
that include reviewing crazy transactions in the industry.
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has made maintaining credit quality a
priority over growth, Petno said. </p>
<p>We''ll be tested and tempted, but this place really has a
proven model, Pento said. We''ve got tremendous confidence in
our track record and our ability to hold the line. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s traders in its investment bank lost money on seven days during 2012, down from 26 in 2011. </p> <p>The traders lost money on just four days last year excluding debt-valuation adjustments and the impact of a credit derivatives portfolio that was transferred from the firm''s chief investment office, which had amassed the bet and lost more than $6.2 billion on it, the bank said in an investor presentation released at its New York headquarters today. </p> <p>Daniel Pinto, 50, the co-chief executive officer of the company''s corporate and investment bank, has been overseeing the wind-down of the CIO portfolio, which helped increase the CIB''s value-at-risk to $84 million in 2012, from $76 million in 2011. Value-at-risk, or VaR, measures the most the bank might lose on 95 percent of its trading days. </p> <p>The results disclosed in the presentation today reflect performance in the corporate and investment bank alone and exclude other divisions. Across the firm, including in its chief investment office, traders lost money on 39 days in the first nine months of 2012. </p> <p>Average daily revenue in the trading unit was $69 million in 2012, up from $60 million in 2011, according to the presentation. </p> <p>JPMorgan''s trading business has produced enough revenue to cover its expenses and cost of capital for 11 of the past 12 quarters, with the third quarter of 2011 as the exception, according to the presentation. </p> <h2>London Losses </h2> <p>CEO Jamie Dimon, 56, ousted traders and managers and replaced senior managers following the so-called London Whale episode at the firm''s chief investment office. The unit, assigned to invest the bank''s idle cash until it was needed, amassed a portfolio of credit derivatives that generated the company''s biggest trading loss ever. It was transferred to the corporate and investment bank in July. </p> <p>The botched bets prompted the retirement in May of Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 56, spurred lawsuits from shareholders and drew civil and criminal probes by at least three U.S. agencies. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Rakteem Katakey and Anusha Ondaatjie" date="Feb 26, 2013  1:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-26/exxon-total-study-sri-lanka-oil-reserves-ahead-of-biggest-sale.html"><headline>Exxon, Total Study Sri Lanka Oil Reserves Ahead of Biggest Sale</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Total SA (FP) are
among explorers reviewing Sri Lanka''s oil and natural gas
reserves ahead of the biggest auction of blocks planned by a
nation that imports all its crude. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil, the world''s largest oil company by value, and
Total, Europe''s third-largest, bought data related to the sale
of 13 offshore fields, Saliya Wickramasuriya, director general
at the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat, said in an
interview. Eni SpA (ENI), BP Plc (BP/) and India''s Oil  Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC)
have enquired about the bids, which are scheduled to open at a
meeting with potential investors in Houston on March 7 and end
about five months later, he said. </p>
<p>We''ve had quite a few people from Big Oil come by,
Colombo-based Wickramasuriya said in a Feb. 25 telephone
interview. We''ve had 20 companies that took our data, made
repeat visits, or expressed interest in taking discussions
further in the framework of the bid round. </p>
<p>Global oil majors are being lured by prospects beyond the
island''s famed white-sand beaches as the nation seeks to rebuild
an economy ravaged by three decades of civil war. Sri Lanka,
where conflict ended in 2009, is looking for technology to
unlock the potential of the area neighboring India, where
companies including Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) and BP are present. </p>
<p>It''d be good for Sri Lanka to get the big conglomerates
in the energy sector interested at the onset, said Dushni Weerakoon, director at the Institute of Policy Studies in
Colombo. It''ll be a signal of confidence and an enormous
economic relief as we are a heavy energy importer. </p>
<h2>Crude Importer </h2>
<p>Sri Lanka, which doesn''t produce any oil or gas, imports
all its crude oil requirements from nations including Saudi
Arabia and Iran. The nation has identified 13 blocks off the
northern and western coasts of Sri Lanka for the auction,
including five in the Cauvery basin and eight in the Mannar. Two
of the 13 may be withdrawn because of a lack of data,
Wickramasuriya said. </p>
<p>Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon
didn''t reply to an e-mail seeking comment on the bidding. Total
spokeswoman Anastasia Zhivulina and ONGC Chairman Sudhir Vasudeva declined to comment, as did an Eni spokesman, who
couldn''t be named because of company policy. </p>
<p>BP continuously evaluates and ranks new exploration
access opportunities around the world, spokesman Mark Salt
said in an e-mail on Feb. 25. </p>
<p>Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR), which is producing oil at India''s largest
onshore block, discovered gas in an offshore area in Sri Lanka''s
Mannar basin last year, estimated by the government to hold 1
billion barrels of oil. That''s equal to about 18 percent of
India''s proved oil reserves, according to BP data. </p>
<h2>Gauge Potential </h2>
<p>Cairn India started drilling a new well in the area this
month, Chief Executive Office P. Elango said in a Feb. 20
interview. It needs to drill two or three more wells before it
can gauge the potential of the reserves, Wickramasuriya said. </p>
<p>The Sri Lankan Cauvery basin is a geological extension of
an area in India off the coast of Tamil Nadu state,
Wickramasuriya said. Reliance announced a gas discovery in a
deepwater well in the Indian waters of the basin in July 2007.
Four years later, it announced another discovery in the area. </p>
<p>Loans from China''s Export-Import Bank and companies
including China Merchants Holding International and China
Machinery Engineering Corp. are helping Sri Lanka expand its
ports, power generation, and transportation networks. Chinese
oil explorers have yet to contact Wickramasuriya or his office
for the latest auction, he said. </p>
<p>Now that we''re launching the bid, some companies that
have been interested internally may now start contacting us,
he said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
sell bonds with a maturity of up to 50 years in Chile, making it
the first U.S. company to sell local debt in the Latin American
country. </p>
<p>New York-based Goldman Sachs is seeking authorization to
sell bonds worth 20 million unidades de fomento, the country''s
inflation-linked accounting unit, which is equivalent to $966
million, according to Chile''s securities regulator. </p>
<p>Chile now has the largest concentration in assets under
management per capita in Latin America, which has made the
country one of the most attractive new debt capital markets in
the region for foreign issuers, Michael DuVally, a spokesman
for the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said in an e-mailed
statement today. The bank is actively considering opening an
office in Chile, he said. </p>
<p>Finance Minister Felipe Larrain has relaxed restrictions to
encourage foreign companies to sell debt in Chile as he seeks to
position the country as a financial-services hub. Brazilian
lender Banco Pine SA and Mexican homebuilder Corp. GEO SAB are
the only foreign companies to sell bonds known as huaso,
which means cowboy in Chile, since Larrain first announced the
initiative in March 2011. </p>
<p>Pension funds in Chile manage assets worth 61 percent of
Chile''s gross domestic product and equal to almost 120 percent
of the nation''s capital market, according to research by Mario Castro, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York. That
compares with 18 percent of GDP in Colombia and 3.1 percent in
Mexico. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google Inc. (GOOG) have
no intention of leaving wireless customers in emerging markets
to the new Firefox operating system, which phone companies said
they hope to establish as a rival platform. </p>
<p>Microsoft is working to lower the specifications for its
Windows Phone operating system to allow it to run on cheaper
devices, said Greg Sullivan, senior product manager for the
platform. Google is looking at expanding payment options for
applications to make it easier for customers without bank
accounts to buy them, said Jamie Rosenberg, vice president for
the Google Play store. </p>
<p>Payment systems is the biggest opportunity there, but
it''s also the one that can take the longest, Rosenberg told
reporters during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It is
an area that we''re looking at very carefully. </p>
<p>While Google''s Android has cemented its dominance in the
smartphone market, billions of users in lower-income countries
don''t have a web-surfing handset. With the backing of hardware
makers and network operators who want to reduce their reliance
on Android, Mozilla Corp. on Feb. 24 unveiled a new operating
system focused on the extreme low end of the market. </p>
<p>Finding a way to maintain the cool options available
through smartphones for lower-priced phones is the key to making
significant inroads in emerging markets, Broadcom Corp. (BRCM) Chief
Executive Officer Scott McGregor said in an interview at the
Irvine, Califonia-based company''s booth in Barcelona. </p>
<h2>Cheaper Cool </h2>
<p>There is a dual trend with smartphones, McGregor said.
There are high-end smartphones for people who are relatively
price insensitive, they want the coolest piece of technology,
and there are also people who say I only want to spend $100,''
so we''ve helped take what''s in the cool, high-end smartphones
and driven the price down. </p>
<p>Demand for smartphones continues to soar, accounting for
almost half of all mobile phone sales. Manufacturers shipped 219
million smartphones last quarter, 36 percent more than the year
earlier, led by Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. (AAPL), which
dominated half the market, according to a report last month by
IDC, the Framingham, Massachusetts-based research firm. </p>
<p>The population of the emerging markets is extremely large
and that''s an attractive factor right there, McGregor said.
Regular mobile-phone users in those regions are going to
replace those with smartphones so the world is mostly going to
go to smartphones. If you can bring that into the hands of
people in these markets, it''s just a huge opportunity. </p>
<h2>Africa </h2>
<p>Microsoft this month said Huawei Technologies Co., which
already is a leading hardware maker in Africa, would bring the
$150 4Afrika Windows phone to seven markets initially in the
region. Nokia Oyj, the world''s second-biggest maker of mobile
phones, unveiled its 139-euro Lumia 520 this week, its cheapest
Windows phone so far, in an attempt to broaden its smartphone
range and increase volumes. </p>
<p>As other Microsoft hardware partners like Nokia and HTC
Corp. sell more Windows phones, they should be able to drop the
price of individual handsets, said spokesman Bill Cox. </p>
<p>One of the things is scale as we start to sell more of
these phones, he said. We''ll be able to better negotiate for
parts, drive the cost down, and that just happens now. </p>
<p>Windows-based phones may at some point retail for as little
as $100, said Tony Mestres, vice president for the platform''s
partner and channel marketing. While cheaper ones may lack some
features like cameras, they still stay close to the
responsiveness of their pricier peers, Sullivan said today at
the Barcelona convention. </p>
<h2>Firefox Phones </h2>
<p>Firefox-based phones will cost about $100 initially,
America Movil SAB (AMXL) Chief Marketing Officer Marco Quatorze said at
the software''s presentation. LG Electronics Inc., Huawei, ZTE
Corp. and TCL Communication Technology Holdings Ltd.''s Alcatel
One Touch brand are already planning to introduce smartphones
running on it, executives said on the eve of the MWC convention. </p>
<p>Android developers are starting to program slimmed-down
versions of applications for emerging markets, Rosenberg said.
Google is already facilitating shopping for emerging-market
customers by offering Google Play gift cards and to bill
purchases directly through the phone operator, he added. </p>
<p>Smartphone growth in countries like India has been subdued
partly because of cost, Android-platform founder Andy Rubin
said. Infrastructure that''s fast enough to stream videos and
other content is only now being built, he said. </p>
<p>That''s gonna take a little while, but when it does, a
lever is going to switch, he said. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) won the reversal
of more than $1 billion in punitive damages over a 2006 gasoline
leak that Maryland residents claimed fouled their drinking
water. </p>
<p>A Maryland appeals court yesterday reversed the punitive
damages and returned the case to a new trial in Baltimore County
Circuit court in Towson, Maryland, for a new trial. Irving,
Texas-based Exxon Mobil had argued that the award, handed down
in 2011 to 160 homeowners and businesses as part of a $1.5
billion jury verdict, was excessive. </p>
<p>The $1.5 billion verdict in the environmental case was the
second-largest in the U.S. in 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Jurors issued the verdict in favor of residents of the
Baltimore County community of Jacksonville for losses tied to a
37-day gasoline leak from a local station''s tank farm. The spill

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) faces opposition to
its combined chairman-chief executive officer roles as two proxy
advisers urge shareholders to vote next week in favor of
splitting the positions. </p>
<p>Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass Lewis 
Co. both recommend investors back a proposal by Connecticut
Retirement Plans  Trust Funds to separate the jobs in the
future that are now held by Robert Iger. Shareholders will vote
on the non-binding proposal at the March 6 annual meeting in
Phoenix, Disney said in a January proxy filing. </p>
<p>Iger, CEO since 2005, was named to the added role of
chairman last year, overcoming opposition from some proxy
advisers and the California State Teachers'' Retirement System,
the second-largest U.S. public pension fund. Nine years ago,
Disney, the world''s biggest entertainment company, separated the
posts to improve corporate governance during a shareholder
revolt against then Chairman and CEO Michael Eisner. </p>
<p>Disney''s performance during Mr. Iger''s tenure has been
nothing short of spectacular, the Burbank, California-based
company said in a statement yesterday, citing a 76 percent
shareholder return in the fiscal year that ended in September.
Disney has delivered results that speak for themselves. </p>
<p>Iger, 62, plans to step down as CEO in March 2015 and serve
as chairman until June 2016. Disney drew support from Egan-Jones
Proxy Services, which opposes splitting the roles and backs the
company''s pay and bonus plans. </p>
<h2>Board Makeup </h2>
<p>The pressure to split the top job at Disney comes as more
companies embrace independent board leadership. According to the
2012 Spencer Stuart Board Index Report, 57 percent of SP 500
companies have one person in the role of chairman and CEO, down
from 75 percent in 2002. </p>
<p>Connecticut Retirement''s proposal for separating the roles
would apply prospectively so as not to violate any company
contractual obligation at the time it is adopted, according to
Disney''s proxy filing. </p>
<p>This year, ahead of the annual meeting, Calstrs, ISS and
Glass Lewis all say they support Connecticut Retirement''s
proposal. ISS, in a Feb. 15 report, said it backs splitting the
jobs and opposes the company''s executive compensation plan.
Glass Lewis in a report to clients on Feb. 20 recommends
separating the posts and voting against the company''s executive
bonus plan as well as its overall executive compensation. </p>
<h2>Splitting Roles </h2>
<p>Calstrs, which holds 5.28 million Disney shares, said on
Feb. 14 it favors splitting the chairman and CEO roles and
opposes the election of six Disney directors, including Iger.
The $161 billion fund will also vote against Disney''s executive
pay plan. </p>
<p>The pension fund generated a 1.8 percent return for the
fiscal year ended June 30, below its 7.5 percent target. The
three-year return was 12 percent, the fund said in a statement
last year. </p>
<p>Disney''s earnings rose 24 percent to $3.13 a share in
fiscal 2012. Over Iger''s eight years as CEO, earnings have risen
at a 15 percent average annual rate, the company said. </p>
<p>While Disney''s profit and share price performance have been
strong, discussions over company stewardship and executive pay
should be held by shareholders, said David Lewin, a professor of
management at the University of California Los Angeles. </p>
<p>One worries about excessive power in the executive
rank, Lewin said in a telephone interview. </p>
<h2>Clear'' Standards </h2>
<p>Disney said in a January filing that its standards for
selecting a chairman are clear and workable, calling any
suggestion that the process led to a poor decision on Iger
unfounded. </p>
<p>The company made changes to Iger''s compensation based on
investor feedback, according to the filing. Ninety-two percent
of the target value of Iger''s compensation is contingent on
financial results and the stock''s performance. He received $40.2
million in total compensation last year. </p>
<p>Connecticut Retirement is responsible for managing pension
funds for about 190,000 teachers, state, and municipal
employees, according to its website. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, sold $2.5 billion of bonds in its first
offering in almost a year. </p>
<p>The producer of Sprite and Dasani water issued $500 million
of floating-rate debt maturing in two years to yield 2 basis
points less than the three-month London interbank offered rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also sold $1.25
billion of 1.15 percent, five year-debt to yield 45 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $750 million of 2.5
percent, 10-year bonds at a relative yield of 67 basis points. </p>
<p>The bonds are rated Aa3 by Moody''s Investors Service, AA-
by Standard  Poor''s and A+ by Fitch Ratings, the ratings
companies said today in separate statements. </p>
<p>Proceeds will be used to redeem all of the company''s 5
percent notes due in August, 7.375 percent securities maturing
in 2014 and 4.25 percent debentures due 2015, as well as for
general corporate purposes, the Atlanta-based beverages maker
said today in a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>The sale follows a $2.5 billion issue from PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) on
Feb. 25, in which the world''s largest snack-food maker sold
$1.25 billion of 10-year debt yielding 2.76 percent, 21 basis
points above the 2.55 percent yield on Coca-Cola''s April 2023
debt issued today, Bloomberg data show. Moody''s rates the
PepsiCo bond Aa3, the same as the Coca-Cola issue. SP grades
PepsiCo''s securities at A-, or three levels lower. </p>
<h2>Prior Sale </h2>
<p>Coca-Cola previously sold debt in March 2012, issuing $1

data show. </p>
<p>The bonds due in March 2015 traded at 100.8 cents on the
dollar to yield 0.36 percent, or a 12.2 basis-point spread,
yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the largest technology services provider, said its
business-analytics unit will add $4 billion more in revenue than
expected. </p>
<p>The company raised its goal for annual sales from analyzing
business data to $20 billion by 2015, from an earlier $16
billion, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty told investors at
a presentation today. Customers are increasingly relying on
analytics to study the flood of data coursing through their
businesses, she said. Revenue from the category in 2010, when
IBM set the first goal, was about $10 billion. </p>
<p>Data will be the basis of competitive advantage for every
company, for every industry, for the next decade Rometty said,
based on her meetings with 500 chief executives of IBM clients
last year. </p>
<p>In 2012, IBM''s business-analytics revenue grew 13 percent,
the company has said. Raising its sales goal for the analytics
segment could help ease investor concerns about the company''s
growth as a whole. Total annual revenue at the Armonk, New York-
based company is up less than 1 percent since 2008. </p>
<p>IBM has divested $15 billion in revenue over the past 10
years, Rometty said. </p>
<p>If we had not, we would be a much larger company, she
said. Potentially a faster-growing company. But we would be a
way lesser-margin company. </p>
<h2>Higher Margins </h2>
<p>Instead of focusing on sales, the company has emphasized
gains in earnings per share. IBM has added higher-margin
software that handles data analysis and continued its shift away
from less-profitable hardware and services contracts. IBM
expects to generate more than half of its profit from software
by 2015. </p>
<p>IBM has been thinking of ways to drive better performance
from its businesses with lower margins, including some labor-
based services, legacy application services and its industry-
standard computer business, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said. </p>
<p>Since 2005, IBM has spent more than $16 billion on 35
acquisitions to boost its analytics capabilities. Tealeaf
Technology, which IBM bought in June, helps chief marketing
officers analyze customer behavior, for example. Star Analytics
Inc., which IBM said it would buy this month, integrates
business information and helps sort out what''s important,
eliminating time-consuming steps for data analysis. </p>
<p>IBM also has developed some of its own products with an
analytics focus. The technology behind Watson, the computer that
beat humans on Jeopardy! in 2011, evolved into several tools
for health-care providers assessing cancer patients. At today''s
meeting, taking place at IBM''s research lab in San Jose,
California, Watson devised some of the food for the investors''
lunch, said John Kelly, IBM''s head of research. </p>
<p>IBM''s shares fell less than 1 percent to $200.83 at the New
York close. They have risen 4.8 percent this year, compared with
a 6.2 percent gain in the Standard  Poor''s 500 index. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s traders lost
money on two days during the fourth quarter, down from 10 in the
prior three months, as the largest U.S. bank stabilized a wrong-
way bet on credit derivatives. </p>
<p>Losses occurred on 41 days in 2012, compared with 27 days
in the prior year, New York-based JPMorgan said in a securities
filing today. The firm made money on 220 out of 261 trading
days, earning more than $200 million on eight days, the bank
said. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, ousted traders and
managers and replaced senior managers after the firm''s chief
investment office had more than $6.2 billion in losses last year
in the so-called London Whale episode. The unit, assigned to
invest the bank''s idle cash until needed, amassed a portfolio of
credit derivatives that generated the company''s biggest trading
loss ever. </p>
<p>The errant trade caused value-at-risk, or VaR, which
measures the most the bank might lose on 95 percent of trading
days, to surge 50.5 percent to $152 million in 2012 from an
average of $101 million in the same period last year. </p>
<p>The results aren''t directly comparable because the firm
changed its model twice in 2012 in an attempt to improve
accuracy. </p>
<h2>Morgan Stanley </h2>
<p>The botched bets prompted the retirement in May of Chief
Investment Officer Ina Drew, spurred lawsuits from shareholders
and drew civil and criminal probes by at least three U.S.
agencies. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the second-biggest U.S. lender by
assets, said that traders lost $50 million on their worst
trading day of 2012, a year in which the firm made money 98
percent of the time. </p>
<p>The bank showed a profit on 243 of the 249 trading days,
with profit exceeding $25 million during 80 percent of the
sessions, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said today
in a regulatory filing. In 2011, Bank of America showed a profit
86 percent of the time, with the largest single-day loss of $119
million and losses topping $25 million on 12 days. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s biggest brokerage,
lost money in its trading businesses on 37 days last year, down
from 64 days in 2011 and the fewest since 2007. The bank''s
traders lost money on 10 days in the fourth quarter, up from
eight in the third quarter, the New York-based company said Feb.
26 in a filing. Morgan Stanley (MS) made more than $100 million on 23
days in 2012. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) opposed Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.''s bid to pull Bruno Iksil, known as the
London Whale trader, into an $8.6 billion fight between the
biggest U.S. bank and the defunct investment bank. </p>
<p>Lehman asked a bankruptcy judge this month to let it try to
force Iksil to testify on valuations of derivatives trades in
2008 that Lehman said spurred unnecessary margin calls and
hastened its bankruptcy. Lehman also sought to be released from
a confidentiality agreement with JPMorgan so it could file
supporting documents for the request. </p>
<p>Lehman''s own employees have acknowledged Iksil wasn''t
responsible for the derivatives trades, which were unrelated to
Lehman''s lawsuit against its former lender, the bank told the
judge in a federal court filing in Manhattan yesterday. For two
years, Lehman has been well aware of Iksil''s lack of
involvement in JPMorgan''s relationship with Lehman, it said. </p>
<p>This application, therefore, should be seen for what it
is: a blatant misuse of this court''s processes to harass
JPMorgan with unnecessary and burdensome discovery and attempt
to disparage JPMorgan with the irrelevant assertion that it did
not act altruistically'' in dealing with Lehman, the bank
said, asking the judge to turn down Lehman''s request.
Plaintiffs have repeatedly tried grandstanding tactics to add
color to a lawsuit that is devoid of proof. </p>

<p>
According to JPMorgan, a key lender to Lehman during the 2008 credit crisis, the margin on fewer than a dozen derivatives trades that Lehman wanted to query Bruno Iksil about -- out of 70,000 such trades between the bank and its client -- wasn''t related to the collateral at issue in the lawsuit.

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the top equity

capital markets unit. </p>
<p>Simkowitz, who had been chairman of the unit, will run the
group with current head Raj Dhanda, according to an internal
memo from investment banking co-chiefs Franck Petitgas and Mark Eichorn. Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for the New York-

<p>Morgan Stanley generated $2.56 billion in revenue from debt
and equity underwriting last year, as it ranked first among
equity offerings and initial public offerings. Revenue climbed 3
percent from 2011, the smallest increase among the five largest

issuance soared to a record. </p>
<p>Simkowitz, 47, has worked on equity underwriting deals

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s plan to
sell bonds with a maturity of up to 50 years in Chile may pave
the way for more offerings from U.S. companies. </p>
<p>The fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets is seeking
authorization to issue bonds worth 20 million unidades de
fomento, the country''s inflation-linked accounting unit, which
is equal to $966 million, according to Chile''s securities
regulator. The offering would mark the first time a U.S. company
has sold debt in the country. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs may help spur more American borrowers to sell
bonds in Chile known as huaso, or cowboy, after Finance
Minister Felipe Larrain relaxed limits to encourage foreigners
to sell debt locally, according to insurer Principal Vida Chile.
While Goldman Sachs has the option to sell bonds due in 50
years, it''s more likely to issue five- to seven-year notes,
Banco de Credito  Inversiones said. A borrower would pay about
0.39 percentage point more to sell five-year bonds in unidades
de fomento than in dollars, according to Bloomberg calculations. </p>
<p>The Finance Ministry has been promoting this and it''s an
opportunity for them to diversify their funding, Felipe Alarcon, an economist at BCI, said in a telephone interview from
Santiago. This is the first U.S. company to issue huaso bonds
and that''s very significant and may bring others. </p>
<h2>Actively Considering'' </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs has 6.15 percent senior dollar bonds due in
April 2018 that yield 2.32 percent. Swapping that into Chilean
unidades de fomento would leave the borrower paying a yield of
about 3 percent plus inflation, according to Bloomberg
calculations, or 0.42 percentage point more than central bank
and government bonds. </p>
<p>Brazilian lender Banco Pine SA and Mexican homebuilder
Corp. GEO SAB are the only foreign companies to sell huaso debt
since Larrain first announced the initiative in March 2011. The
U.S. bank''s bond plan shows that the policy is bearing fruit,
Larrain said yesterday, according to La Tercera newspaper. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is selling the bonds in response to the
Finance Ministry''s efforts to open the local market, Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Chile now has the largest concentration in assets under
management per capita in Latin America, which has made the
country one of the most attractive new debt capital markets in
the region for foreign issuers, DuVally said. </p>
<p>The bank is actively considering opening an office in
Chile, he said. </p>
<h2>Very Appropriate'' </h2>
<p>Pension funds in Chile manage assets worth 61 percent of
Chile''s gross domestic product and equal to almost 120 percent
of the nation''s capital market, according to research by Mario Castro, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York. </p>
<p>That compares with 18 percent of GDP in Colombia and 3.1
percent in Mexico. </p>
<p>Chile''s high savings rate and limited number of large
companies mean there is a shortage of assets available for
investment, according to Valentin Carril, who oversees $5
billion as the chief investment officer at Principal Vida Chile
in Santiago and often buys foreign bonds that he swaps back into
local currency. </p>
<p>Chile has the fourth-highest gross national savings rate in
South America after Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia, according to
International Monetary Fund data. </p>
<h2>Further Diversify'' </h2>
<p>The Goldman Sachs bond sale is very appropriate for life
insurers like ourselves, Carril said. It''s diversification
and we don''t have to worry about currency derivatives. When the
process of opening up markets was announced, I don''t think they
really envisaged American companies coming here. It''s big news.
This is part of Chile becoming more open to the world. </p>
<p>Chilean life insurers would welcome a bond due in about 30
years as it allows them to match the average duration of their
portfolios with the duration of the annuities they sell, Carril
said. The government plans to sell 30-year fixed-rate bonds for
the first time this year. </p>
<p>Banco Santander Chile is advising Goldman Sachs on the
transaction, according to an e-mailed statement from the
Santiago-based bank''s press office. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s offering in Chile will also help the bank
further diversify its investor base, DuVally said. </p>
<p>Nathan Pincheira, an economist at Banchile Corredores de
Bolsa SA in Santiago, says that while Chile has one of the
deepest markets for inflation-linked bonds, companies can
get cheaper financing abroad. </p>
<h2>Less Attractive'' </h2>
<p>The extra cost of selling 10-year inflation-linked bonds in
Chile and swapping it back into dollars is about eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, according to Bloomberg
calculations that exclude the cost of the transaction. </p>
<p>Selling bonds in Colombia would also be cheaper. Its
government bond yields have fallen 60 basis points this year,
making it about 1 percentage point cheaper to sell notes in
Colombian pesos and then swap to dollars. </p>
<p>I don''t know how attractive it may be from a yield point
of view as rates abroad are lower than local ones, Pincheira
said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Chile introduced its inflation-linked accounting unit in
1967. Seventy-percent of the country''s local debt market is
denominated in unidades de fomento. </p>
<p>The yield on 10-year inflation-linked government bonds fell
10 basis points in February to 2.58 percent. The yield on 10-
year fixed-rate bonds dropped four basis points to 5.6 percent. </p>
<h2>Default Swaps </h2>
<p>The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to buy Chile''s
10-year dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries widened 20 basis
points this month to 87 basis points. The spread was at a record
low 51 basis points on Jan. 25. </p>
<p>The cost of protecting Chilean bonds against default for
five years increased one basis point to 69 basis points at 10:23
a.m. in New York. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value
in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
if the borrower fails to adhere to its debt agreements. </p>
<p>The peso has appreciated 1.4 percent this year. It gained
0.1 percent today to 472.71 per U.S. dollar. </p>
<p>Chile has a so-called flat yield curve compared with the
U.S., which means companies can obtain lower borrowing costs for
similar-maturity debt, according to Gonzalo Menendez, the chief
investment officer for mutual funds at Cruz del Sur
Administradora General de Fondos in Santiago. </p>
<p>Chile''s 30-year inflation-linked bonds yield 2.8 percent,
nine basis points more than 20-year debt and 22 basis points
more than 10-year notes. U.S. Treasuries due in 30 years yield
3.09 percent, or 1.19 percentage points more than the 10-year
securities. </p>
<p>The local long-term yield curve is very flat; this means
that they can pay a lower yield than if they went to sell at a
similar maturity in another country, Menendez said in a
telephone interview. Demand will come mostly from insurance
companies, to match their long-term assets with their
liabilities. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and OMV Petrom SA (SNP)
plan to drill a second well in the Neptun block, which they are
jointly exploring in the Black Sea, as early as the end of this
year, said John Knapp, the head of Exxon''s local unit. </p>
<p>The two companies may complete three-dimensional studies by
the middle of this year as they seek to deepen the block''s
appraisal to evaluate the resources and their commercial value,
Knapp said in an interview in Bucharest today. </p>
<p>If we drill, it will be late this year, depending on the
availability of the rigs, Knapp said. For a new appraisal of
the block, we need to complete the 3D seismic studies and
interpret the data and there is also additional drilling that
needs to be done. </p>
<p>Exxon and Petrom started searching for oil and gas in the

gas pay that resulted in a preliminary estimate of accumulation
ranging from 1.5 to 3 trillion cubic feet (42 to 84 billion
cubic meters). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)''s head of Middle East
equity sales and trading, Fahmi Alghussein, left to join Dubai-
based HK Advisory Services Ltd. after the Wall Street firm
shifted equity jobs from the U.A.E. to Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>Alghussein, who worked at New York-based Morgan Stanley for
more than five years, confirmed his departure by phone today and
said he left the bank two weeks ago to seek a new challenge. A
Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
followed Credit Suisse AG earlier this year in shifting its
Middle East and North Africa equities business to Riyadh from
Dubai, according to a banker familiar with the matter. Equity
trading in Saudi Arabia is surging and dwarfs the Dubai market,
where about 50 brokerages have closed after the emirate''s 2008
stock and real-estate crash. </p>
<p>Alghussein said HK Advisory was established in 2008 by Ali Husseini, a former managing director at Egyptian investment bank
EFG-Hermes Holding SAE, and Walid Kamhawi, who worked at
Blackstone Group LP, the world''s biggest private-equity firm. HK
Advisory specializes in capital raising, restructuring and
mergers and acquisitions in the Middle East, Africa and Russia. </p>
<p>Alghussein worked at Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc
before joining Morgan Stanley in June 2007. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley plans to eliminate about 1,600 jobs from its
investment bank and support staff in coming weeks, according to
a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Morgan Stanley
reduced staff by about 4,200 people in the first nine months of
last year through job cuts and unit sales, after saying in
December 2011 it would trim 1,600 jobs. </p>
<p>Shares valued at about 7.6 billion riyals ($2 billion) were
traded daily on average in Saudi Arabia last year, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. That compares with $52.5 million traded in
Dubai and $61.3 million in Qatar. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan
Stanley are recommending investors take advantage of a record
difference between the cost of short- and long-term bond
insurance to hedge against Europe''s debt crisis reigniting. </p>
<p>It costs 44 basis points more to insure investment-grade
corporate debt for 10 years than it does to buy five-year
protection using the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-
default swaps. The gap reached 46 basis points last week and is
up from five basis points at the start of 2012. </p>
<p>Investors can profit by buying short-dated contracts and
selling longer-end protection in a so-called curve flattening
trade, according to the New York-based banks. The difference
between near- and long-term insurance costs has been becoming
increasingly exaggerated since August, after European Central
Bank President Mario Draghi vowed to do whatever''s necessary to
protect the euro. </p>
<p>Credit volatility and curve flatteners remain our
preferred hedges, Andrew Sheets, the head of European credit
strategy at Morgan Stanley in London, wrote in a note. The
greatest risk to European credit remains a return of sovereign-
led systemic risk. </p>
<p>Long-term debt insurance typically costs more than short-
dated protection, though Draghi''s support for the European
single currency has increased the gap, or steepened the credit
curve. The spread between three- and five-year default
protection is also near the widest ever, at 42 basis points
compared with 12 basis points in September 2011, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. </p>
<h2>Curves Inverted </h2>
<p>The relationships became inverted at the peak of the global
financial crisis in 2008, when it cost 31 basis points more to
insure bonds for three years than for five, and 38 basis points
more for five years than for 10. Those inverted yield curves
signalled that investors perceived default risk as imminent. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a contract protecting 10 million euros ($13 million) of debt for
five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. </p>
<p>People are overly comfortable with short-dated risk,
said Saul Doctor, a strategist at JPMorgan in London.
Flatteners at the moment are an inexpensive hedge. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, must face a consumer lawsuit challenging the
labeling of its Simply Orange, Minute Maid Premium and Minute
Maid Pure Squeezed orange juice brands, a judge said. </p>
<p>The consumers allege in court filings that Coca-Cola has
marketed Simply Orange as 100 percent pure squeeze and not
from concentrate since 2006, when in truth the juice is
chemically flavored, heavily processed, designed and modified
and is not 100% pure squeezed, simply orange, pure
or natural. </p>
<p>Such labeling is deceptive and violates state consumer-
protection laws, according to the consumers. The Atlanta-based
company has made misleading representations about Minute Maid
products too, for which it''s liable for breaches of contract,
according to the complaint, which combines 13 different cases. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Fernando J. Gaitan Jr. in Kansas City,
Missouri, today said the allegations were sufficient to overcome
defense arguments that the company''s claims were so-called
puffery or that the case was barred by federal law. Gaitan also
rejected Coca-Cola''s claim the consumers failed to show they had
been injured. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs have asserted false advertising,
misrepresentation and deceptive practices claims, he said in a
nine-page ruling. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola''s media relations department didn''t immediately
respond to voice-mail and e-mail messages seeking comment on the
ruling. </p>
<h2>Combined Complaint </h2>
<p>The combined complaint, filed with the Kansas City court in
August, included plaintiffs from New York, New Jersey,
California, Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Alabama. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola asked Gaitan in September to throw the case out. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs'' claims must be dismissed insofar as they are
premised on promotional statements, such as the Simply Orange
and Minute Maid Pure Squeezed product names, the company said
in a filing. </p>
<p>Those names, it said, are indisputably true, not capable
of misleading reasonable consumers as a matter of law or
constitute non-actionable puffery. </p>
<p>The case is In re Simply Orange Juice Marketing  Sales
Practices Litigation, 4:12-md-2361, U.S. District Court, Western
District of Missouri (Kansas City). </p>

<p>When Hormel Foods Corp. announced in
January that it had signed a $700 million deal to acquire the
Skippy brand from Unilever NV, analysts joked about putting
peanut butter on Spam. Investors liked the combination of
foodmakers: Hormel''s stock rose 7 percent by the end of the next
day. </p>
<p>Since the start of 2012, investors have applauded companies
that braved a weak global economy to grow their core business
through acquisitions. It was a bright spot in a dismal year for
mergers, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its April
issue. </p>
<p>The stock price for the buyer has gone up after making
smart acquisitions, says Steven Baronoff, chairman of global
mergers and acquisitions at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. A
lot of companies will need to enhance growth through
acquisition. </p>
<p>Global MA volume shrank 8.7 percent to $2.2 trillion last
year, according to Bloomberg data. Chief executive officers were
skittish about tie-ups because of the European recession and
concerns that fiscal changes could slow the U.S. economy. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) led the 2012 Bloomberg Markets
ranking of MA advisers, earning $1.77 billion in fees. The
firm''s work on four of the largest mergers of 2012 helped it
retain its No. 1 position for the 10th straight year. Goldman
advised copper producer Xstrata Plc in its announced sale to
Glencore International Plc (GLEN) for $47 billion -- the biggest hookup
of last year. </p>
<h2>Asian Deals </h2>
<p>Energy companies were the most active dealmakers as firms
bought assets in advance of an expected rise in natural gas
prices. Oil exploration and production companies were the top
takeover targets by value, with $144 billion in deals. MA by
consumer goods firms also rose last year, while industrial and
financial companies cut fewer agreements. </p>
<p>Asian companies bought more firms in the U.S. -- a trend
that''s likely to continue, says John Studzinski, head of
Blackstone Group LP (BX)''s advisory unit in New York. U.S.
acquisitions by Japanese firms totaled $74 billion, up from $44
billion in 2011. In the biggest such merger of the year,
Softbank Corp. of Tokyo agreed to pay $37.8 billion in October
for Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) </p>
<p>I see Asian companies wanting to acquire brands,
technology and other expertise in open markets, Studzinski
says. </p>
<p>The big deals announced on Feb. 14 have given bankers hope
that 2013 will be a better year for MA. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)
and 3G Capital Inc. agreed to buy H.J. Heinz Co. for about $23
billion, and US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) will merge with American
Airlines in an $11 billion deal. Some CEOs, concerned that low
interest rates may start to rise later this year, may make
acquisitions before cheap financing disappears. </p>
<h2>Big Oil Firepower </h2>
<p>You have the most attractive debt market in a
generation, says Osmar Abib, co-head of Credit Suisse Group
AG''s energy investment-banking practice. He expects big oil to
forge hookups. They have plenty of firepower, Houston-based
Abib says. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley bought a cargo of
North Sea Forties crude. Russian Urals blend gained for a second
day in the Mediterranean after Total SA purchased a shipment. </p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell Plc booked the first tanker in more than
one month to haul Forties grade to South Korea as refinery
maintenance in the Asian nation nears end, according to a
shipbroker report. </p>
<h2>North Sea </h2>
<p>Phibro, a unit of Occidental Petroleum Corp., sold Forties
crude for a second day, a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed. The cargo,
for loading from March 19 to March 21, changed hands at a
premium of 70 cents a barrel to BFOE grades for delivery in May.
Three shipments traded yesterday at 20 cents and 25 cents more
than the Dated Brent benchmark. </p>
<p>Mercuria Energy Trading SA wasn''t able to buy a consignment
for loading March 26 to March 30 at Dated Brent plus 20 cents a
barrel, the survey showed. The trader purchased two cargoes
yesterday at a 25 cent premium. </p>
<p>Shell booked the very large crude carrier Al Salmi to load
270,000 metric tons of the blend on Mar. 15 from Hound Point in
the U.K., an e-mailed report from Norwegian shipbroker PF Bassoe
AS today showed. The rate for the booking was not disclosed. The
terminal handles Forties exports. Total SA last booked a VLCC on
Jan. 24 to load crude in February. </p>
<p>Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was unchanged at 12 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Brent for April settlement traded at $110.34 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $112.23 in the previous session. The May
contract was at $109.33, a discount of $1.01 to April. </p>
<h2>Mediterranean/Urals </h2>
<p>Total bought the Urals cargo from Vitol Group in the
Mediterranean at a smaller discount, the survey of Platts
showed. The 80,000-ton consignment traded at $2.35 a barrel less
than Dated Brent for delivery to Augusta, Italy. That compares
with a deal at minus $2.90 yesterday. Differentials widened to a
22-month low of $3.40 on Feb. 27. </p>
<p>In northwest Europe, Total bid without success to buy
100,000 tons at minus $2.50 a barrel for delivery to Rotterdam,
the survey showed. </p>
<p>The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
expanded 2 cents a barrel to $2.88, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That''s the widest since April 16. In northwest Europe, the
discount was at $2.90 a barrel, compared with $2.88 in the
previous session. That''s the biggest discount since April 18. </p>
<h2>West Africa </h2>
<p>Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend rose 10 cents to $2.40 a

<p>Investment banking, after five long, hard years of negative or anemic growth, job cuts, pay cuts and public lashings, is on the verge of a comeback. Really, it is -- if the data can be believed. </p> <p>All the economic statistics show that the markets are ripe for a rebound in mergers and acquisitions and equity issuance in 2013, dealmakers say. </p> <p>Yet Bank of America Corp.''s top investment banker is guarded in his forecast, and he isn''t alone, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its April issue. </p> <p>More from the April 2013 issue of Bloomberg Markets:</p>

SLIDESHOW: The Bloomberg 20


BLOOMBERG 20: Debt | Equities | Mergers

<p>I hesitate to be the one that says 2013 will be the year, because invariably it may not, says Christian Meissner, BofA''s head of global corporate and investment banking. But I think that we''re pretty close to it changing. </p> <p>The past five years haven''t been kind to investment bankers. MA deal volume fell off a cliff after peaking at $4.1 trillion in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last year, it dropped 8.7 percent to $2.2 trillion after an early resurgence fizzled along with projected growth rates in emerging economies. </p> <p>As 2012 proceeded, there was reason for hope. The Greek and Italian bond markets didn''t melt down like they did in 2010 and 2011. The U.S. didn''t almost default on its debt. Yet corporate chieftains continued to hoard their cash. </p> <h2>No Bold Deals </h2> <p>Boards weren''t ready to do a lot of bold strategic deals last year, says Michael Cavanagh, co-chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s corporate and investment bank. </p> <p>JPMorgan was No. 1 in the Bloomberg 20, Bloomberg Markets'' ninth annual ranking of the best-paid investment banks measured by the fees they earn. The largest U.S. lender took in $3.97 billion in fees last year, a 24.8 percent increase over 2011. </p> <p>JPMorgan has topped the Bloomberg 20 in four of the past five years, and last year it was the top investment bank in debt and equity fees as well as overall. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ranked No. 2, after scoring the No. 1 spot for 2011. Goldman led the ranking for MA fees, as it has every year since the Bloomberg 20 began. </p> <p>JPMorgan fell 39 cents to $48.53 at 9:38 a.m. in New York trading. Goldman Sachs slid $2.48 to $147.28 and Morgan Stanley (MS) declined 61 cents to $21.94. </p> <p>While fees for MA and equity issuance fell for 2012, total fees rose 3.7 percent, to $50.9 billion, driven higher by a surge in the refinancing of corporate debt. </p> <p>A single soured 2012 deal put a chill in the market. Morgan Stanley managed the initial public offering of Facebook Inc. (FB) in May -- and faced withering criticism when the Nasdaq listing was marred by technical difficulties and the stock, by September, had fallen more than 50 percent below its $38 opening price. </p> <p>Facebook shares have since rebounded to $27.25 as of Feb. 28. </p> <h2>Dow 14,000 </h2> <p>Even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) topped 14,000 for the first time since 2007 on Feb. 1, corporate executives remained skittish. CEOs are choosing to conserve their cash as a result, bankers say. </p> <p>Much of MA and capital markets activity is based on psychology, says Mark Eichorn, who was appointed global co-head of investment banking at Morgan Stanley with Franck Petitgas in November. </p> <p>Corporations around the globe were sitting on a record $1.5 trillion in cash as of Sept. 30, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase, even though bankers say their balance sheets have never been stronger. The Federal Reserve has held benchmark interest rates near zero for more than four years and injected trillions of dollars into the U.S. economy. Markets are liquid and stable, and investors are desperate for higher-yielding assets. </p> <h2>Measuring Risk </h2> <p>If you look at the statistics, in terms of the drivers of MA activities, you''d think that this would be the busiest MA market, but it isn''t, Bank of America''s Meissner says. Many CEOs are comfortable waiting until some of the systemic risk recedes. </p> <p>Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America Merrill Lynch fell one spot to No. 5 in the Bloomberg 20 list with $3.16 billion in fees last year. </p> <p>Warren Buffett and Michael Dell aren''t waiting. </p> <p>Dell and private-equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC agreed on Feb. 5 to take Dell Inc. private for $24.4 billion in the biggest leveraged buyout since 2007. Then on Feb. 14, Buffett announced he would partner with Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann to buy H.J. Heinz Co. in a $23 billion deal. </p> <p>Other big February transactions included the $11 billion merger of bankrupt AMR Corp., parent of carrier American Airlines, with US Airways Group Inc., and Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA)''s plan to buy U.K. cable operator Virgin Media Inc. for $23.3 billion. That would be the biggest media company deal since a $17.4 billion merger created Thomson Reuters Corp. in 2007. </p> <h2>Deals Rise </h2> <p>That brought total announced deals through Feb. 15 to $288.2 billion, compared with $246.6 billion for the same period in 2012. </p> <p>Make no mistake, we are seeing movement, Cavanagh says. As we speak to company directors, it is clear that much of last year''s uncertainty is gone for the moment. </p> <p>However, the February deals represent the beginnings of a winter thawing, but they don''t mean a resurgence to pre-crisis deal levels just yet, he says. </p> <p>David M. Solomon, co-head of investment banking at Goldman Sachs, also sees light amid the gloom. </p> <p>Confidence around the world is better, he says. Markets are up all over the world. People are moving assets out of cash and more-liquid investments into more risk investments. </p> <p>Those bankers who did well in overall fee revenue in 2012 were leaders in debt underwriting, which accounted for 37.7 percent of the total fee pool, up from 27.7 percent in 2011. </p> <h2>Bond Record </h2> <p>A record $3.69 trillion in corporate bonds were issued last year as companies rushed to lock in low financing rates, with borrowing costs falling to an all-time-low average of 3.24 percent. </p> <p>JPMorgan Chase dwarfed all competitors in debt underwriting with $1.51 billion in fees, up 43.8 percent from the year before. </p> <p>The low cost of selling bonds helps explain the decline in stock issuance in 2012, says Paul Stefanick, co-head of Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)''s global investment banking coverage and advisory. </p> <p>It''s not that the equity markets were bad; it''s just that the debt markets were a much better alternative, he says. </p> <p>Absent a strong debt market, it would have been a gruesome year for investment bankers. Fees from equity issuance fell 3.9 percent to $14.6 billion, while MA fees dropped 15.8 percent to $17.1 billion. Fees from debt issuance surged 41 percent to $19.2 billion. </p> <h2>UBS Layoffs </h2> <p>Not everyone made a killing in the debt markets. UBS AG (UBSN) announced in October that it would largely exit fixed-income trading and fire a total of 10,000 workers from that and other divisions. UBS ranked No. 9 in the Bloomberg 20, with $1.97 billion in total 2012 fee revenue. </p> <p>Citigroup Inc. (C), which rose two places to No. 4, with $3.18 billion in fees, said in December it would cut 11,000 jobs and pull back from some emerging-market nations. Morgan Stanley, which fell one spot to No. 3, with $3.5 billion in fee revenue, eliminated 1,700 jobs from its investment bank in January. </p> <p>Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have made it more costly to be a banker since the crisis, imposing stiff new capital requirements on certain activities that have squeezed profits. Altogether, the 13 largest investment banks in 2012 announced plans to cut $15 billion in expenses, including compensation, and $1.03 trillion in risk-weighted assets, which eat up capital, consulting firm McKinsey  Co. said in a January report. </p> <p>Banks that aren''t producing high-enough returns may need to shrink their geographic footprint, cut back on the services they provide or reduce compensation, bankers say. </p> <h2>''Borrowed Time'' </h2> <p>If you''re not earning your cost of capital, you''re probably living on borrowed time, Cavanagh says. </p> <p>Cavanagh was tapped by CEO Jamie Dimon in July to run a newly combined corporate and investment bank with Daniel Pinto after leading JPMorgan Chase''s internal investigation into the more than $6.2 billion trading loss in a London unit of the bank''s chief investment office. Pinto, who was previously co-head of fixed-income trading, helped unwind the trade and is managing the remaining position. </p> <p>The combined units allow the bank to bring the whole firm to bear for our clients, Cavanagh says. </p> <h2>''Global Superleague'' </h2> <p>Most investment banking in the future will be done by a global superleague of universal banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America that provide one-stop shopping for loans, MA advice and other services for large corporations, BofA''s Meissner says. </p> <p>The shakeout in the industry isn''t done yet, bankers say. </p> <p>I wouldn''t say that it''s rampant and having a huge impact on business now, but there''s no question that a number of players are withdrawing from certain investment-banking activities, Goldman''s Solomon says. </p> <p>For the short term, bankers hope the optimism behind the Heinz, Dell and other early 2013 deals carries forward -- and isn''t undermined by a new crisis, such as the failure of Congress and the White House to prevent massive budget cuts known as the sequester. </p> <p>We need to string a couple quarters together of decent corporate earnings, no major fiscal macro crises and some of the very constructive themes that we''ve seen in the debt and equity markets to continue in order to unlock what we all believe to be pent-up demand, Morgan Stanley''s Eichorn says. </p> <p>When the dam breaks, bankers expect the U.S. to be a major deal destination. International acquirers buying U.S. targets accounted for $218.1 billion of volume in 2012, or about 10 percent of all global deals. That amount was up 22 percent from 2011. </p> <h2>U.S. Opportunities </h2> <p>Companies in mature yet slow-growing economies, such as Australia, Canada, Europe and Japan, will continue to seek opportunities in the U.S., Solomon says. </p> <p>They want to reposition their portfolios to a developed economy with better growth trajectories, and the United States fits that bill, he says. </p> <p>Economic stability in the U.S. also makes it an attractive target for CEOs in emerging economies such as China. </p> <p>We have fiscal cliff issues and all the political issues and a relatively low-growth economy, Deutsche Bank''s Stefanick says. All of which is true. But compared to the rest of the world, we''re still the cream of the crop. </p> <h2>How We Crunched the Numbers </h2> <p>To identify the Bloomberg 20, we examined fees that investment banks collected for underwriting securities and advising on mergers and acquisitions worldwide in 2012. Not all of those commissions have been disclosed, so we extrapolated total fees from those made public in regulatory filings. </p> <p>Bloomberg collected data on the underwriting fees that banks were paid for about 60 percent of equity sales and about 20 percent of bond issues in 2012. </p> <p>To calculate the dollar fee, multiply the disclosed percentage by the value of the issue awarded to the underwriter. For deals whose fees weren''t disclosed, the average disclosed fee was applied. That''s the sum of the disclosed fees for a firm divided by the total value of the issues. </p> <h2>Weighted Average </h2> <p>For firms that disclosed less than 30 percent of their fees in either equities or debt, we applied a weighted average of issues for which fees were disclosed. </p> <p>Preferred stocks are included with bond issues. Because fees for preferreds tend to be higher -- the average fee in 2012 was 2.327 percent versus 0.481 percent for all other bonds -- we calculated these fees separately. Municipal and asset-backed bonds were excluded from the bond ranking, as were bonds with call periods and maturity lengths shorter than 18 months. </p> <p>In equities, we calculated the fees for initial public offerings and secondary offerings separately because they tend to have different fee structures. We excluded equity-linked securities. In both equities and bonds, we excluded self-led deals, which are the sale or issuance of a financial institution''s bonds or equities by its own investment bank. </p> <h2>Calculating Fees </h2> <p>MA fees are rarely disclosed and typically vary according to the size of a deal and whether a bank is advising the target, acquirer or seller. We based our ranking on the fees disclosed in about 600 MA transactions going back to 2009. We took an average of the fees for advisers to targets, acquirers and sellers for deals in five different size categories and applied those percentages to transactions for which fees weren''t disclosed. We divided the fees equally among advisers. </p> <p>In practice, investment-banking fees can vary from firm to firm. A bank''s position in this ranking may differ from its standing in traditional league tables, which are based on the dollar value of transactions. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Michael J.

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which generated 53 percent of revenue from sales and trading last year, recorded losses from that business on 16 days in 2012, the fewest since the bank started reporting the figure in 2004. </p> <p>The days of losses, detailed in a regulatory filing from the New York-based company today, were down from 54 in 2011 and below the previous low of 19 days in 2009. Traders made more than $100 million on 41 days, down from 54 days a year earlier and the least since 2005. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs said it''s been redeeming hedge-fund holdings to comply with the Volcker rule and the firm outlined risks to its businesses from attempts to regulate foreign subsidiaries. Revenue from sales and trading advanced 5 percent to $18.1 billion in 2012 even as value-at-risk, a measure of how much the firm could lose from trades in a single day, was the lowest since 2005, the firm reported in January. </p> <p>The bulk of what you''re seeing is the decline in market volatilities, it''s not a reduction in risk or capital deployment, Harvey M. Schwartz, Goldman Sachs''s chief financial officer, told analysts on Jan. 16. There was no top- down directive, for example, to take less risk. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s biggest brokerage, reported Feb. 26 that it lost money in its trading business on 37 days last year, down from 64 in 2011 and the fewest since 2007. Traders in JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s investment bank lost money on seven days in 2012, down from 26 in 2011. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, lowered its estimate for potential
losses from legal claims by $100 million. </p>
<p>Reasonably possible legal costs are as much as $3.5
billion, the New York-based firm said today in a report on the
quarter that ended Dec. 31, without giving specific reasons for
the decline. That compares with $3.6 billion three months
earlier and $3.4 billion at the end of June. </p>
<p>Banks started making public estimates of possible losses
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told finance
chiefs in October 2010 that they should disclose such costs
when there is at least a reasonable possibility they may be
incurred, even if the risk is too low to require reserves. </p>
<p>The estimate doesn''t include potential losses from legal
matters that are at an early stage or where the firm can''t
determine the potential amount, according to the filing. </p>

<p>Norway''s Kommunalbanken AS, Morgan
Stanley (MS) and Credit Agricole SA (ACA) are helping fuel a surge in sales
of so-called digital coupon structured notes linked to
currencies, stocks or interest rates. </p>
<p>Banks sold $1 billion of the notes this year, up from
$209.2 million in the same period of 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Kommunalbanken, a state-owned Norwegian
municipal lender, was the biggest issuer of the securities,
raising $184.5 million. </p>
<p>Digital coupons, also known as all-or-nothing interest
payments because they''re payable only if certain conditions are
met, are popular with investors because they can boost returns.
That''s because when market volatility is low, options embedded
in certain structured notes are cheaper. The Chicago Board
Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX (VIX), fell to its lowest
intra-day level since April 2007 last month at 12.08. </p>
<p>Digital coupons offer a simple way to enhance yield,
said Kevin Woodruff, global product head of structured notes at
Morgan Stanley in London. The sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets
is the second-biggest issuer of the securities this year with
sales of $71.7 million, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Credit Agricole comes third with $43.8 million of sales,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Paris-based bank
raised $18.5 million from selling 10-year securities on Feb. 15
that pay 6 percent so long as one dollar costs 6.45 Chinese yuan
or less and 79 Japanese yen or more, Bloomberg data show. If
either criterion isn''t met, no coupon will be paid. </p>
<p>Charline Coue, a Paris-based spokeswoman at Credit
Agricole, declined to comment on the notes. </p>
<p>Structured notes package debt with derivatives to offer
customized bets to investors while earning fees and raising
money. </p>
