&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was
subpoenaed by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission after
panel members said the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history engaged in a document &#8220;dump&#8221; to hinder a probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sent more than a billion pages of documents,
FCIC Vice Chairman Bill Thomas said on a conference call with
reporters today. Not all of the information is what the panel
requested, and Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t cooperate with requests to
interview Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, Chief
Operating Officer Gary Cohn and Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, FCIC Chairman Phil Angelides said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We did not ask them to pull up a dump truck to our
offices and dump a bunch of rubbish,&#8221; said Angelides, 56, who
previously served as California&#8217;s treasurer. &#8220;This has been a
very deliberate effort over time to run out the clock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCIC, which Congress appointed last year to investigate
the causes of the worst economic slump since the Great
Depression, issued the subpoena June 4. The request adds to
government scrutiny of New York-based Goldman Sachs, as
regulators and lawmakers examine how it packaged mortgages into
securities that fueled investor losses when the housing market
collapsed in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is being
&#8220;legitimately scrutinized&#8221; by regulators who sued the firm for
fraud based on conduct that many in the industry consider to be
common practice, according to a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history
has suffered the worst reputational decline among its largest
competitors, according to the global quarterly poll of 1,001
investors and analysts who are Bloomberg subscribers. Eighty-
three percent of respondents said Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stature
diminished in the past six months; the next closest were UBS AG,
with 27 percent, and Citigroup Inc., at 26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This disaster didn&#8217;t occur by mistake,&#8221; said respondent
Dane Fulmer, who has traded fixed-income financial instruments
for 39 years and runs Dane Fulmer Investments in Fort Smith,
Arkansas. &#8220;If it was an honest mistake, then it far, far
surpasses what the law would consider negligent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was sued April 16 by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which said the New York-based company
failed to inform investors about the role hedge fund Paulson 
Co. played in both helping to select contracts underlying a
mortgage-linked investment and betting against it. Goldman Sachs
has said it did nothing wrong and is fighting the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked for their opinion of the SEC fraud suit, 61 percent
of respondents replied that the firm &#8220;is being legitimately
scrutinized,&#8221; while 29 percent answered that the company &#8220;is
being unfairly vilified.&#8221; The remainder were undecided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the poll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Views of Goldman Sachs and its outlook were more negative
outside the U.S., where 69 percent of respondents found the SEC
suit to be reasonable, compared with 48 percent of people polled
in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common Practice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About three-quarters of the people in all regions who said
they thought the SEC&#8217;s case was justifiable also said the
alleged behavior is common practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Complex transactions that may appear to some to be
malicious likely occur at every large investment house on the
Street,&#8221; said respondent Eric McCarthy, an analyst at a U.S.
hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leverage derived from packaging subprime mortgage debt into
collateralized debt obligations and related derivatives, such as
the transaction at the center of the SEC&#8217;s suit against Goldman
Sachs, magnified losses in the mortgage market and contributed
to the near-collapse of the financial system in 2008. The crisis
led to an unprecedented taxpayer-funded bailout of banks,
including Goldman Sachs, which repaid its $10 billion capital
injection, with interest, last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients Second &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gala Prada, a fund manager at Fiatc Mutua de Seguros y
Reaseguros in Barcelona, an insurer with 1 billion euros ($1.2
billion) in assets, agreed that Goldman&#8217;s conduct wasn&#8217;t
unusual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investment banks, not only Goldman, first do their own
proper account trades and only then advise their clients to do
whatever is in their best interest, and I mean in the investment
bank&#8217;s interest,&#8221; Prada said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlook for Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock and management was
more optimistic in the U.S., where more than half of those
polled said Lloyd Blankfein would remain chairman, compared with
36 percent of non-U.S. respondents who said so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re a Goldman shareholder or a Goldman employee, by
and large you have been well served by the management team
relative to the environment and relative to the competition,&#8221;
said Brenden Smith, founder and principal of San Francisco-based
Cypress Capital Management LP and a former Goldman Sachs
employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$13.4 Billion Profit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman set a profit record for a stand-alone U.S.
securities firm in 2007, when it earned $11.6 billion. In 2009,
after converting to a bank holding company, the firm topped its
previous record with $13.4 billion in profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-quarters of respondents said they believe that
Goldman Sachs will settle the charges, with a plurality of 40
percent saying the issue would then dissipate, compared with 34
percent who said the damage to the firm would be lasting. About
34 percent of non-U.S. respondents said they thought the bad
publicity would blow over after the firm settles the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a real break between perceptions inside the U.S.
and outside the U.S.,&#8221; said J. Ann Selzer, president of Des
Moines, Iowa-based Selzer  Co., which conducted the survey.
&#8220;If you just look at the U.S. customers, they see these current
troubles as temporary and predict the firm will exit standing
tall.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein&#8217;s Future &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quarterly Bloomberg Global Poll of investors, traders
and analysts in six continents was conducted June 2-3. It is
based on interviews with a random sample of 1,001 Bloomberg
subscribers, representing decision makers in markets, finance
and economics. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus
3.1 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 36 percent of non-U.S. respondents said they expect
Blankfein to remain as chairman, half of those polled said they
didn&#8217;t expect any major changes to the firm&#8217;s leadership as a
result of the lawsuit. A bigger proportion of U.S. subscribers,
59 percent, didn&#8217;t expect major changes, compared with 44
percent of people outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Blankfein was viewed unfavorably by 56 percent of
poll respondents, second only to BP Plc CEO Tony Hayward&#8217;s 65
percent among a list of 10 public figures that included
President Barack Obama, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s stock, which ended New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday at $138.68, has fallen 25 percent
since the suit was filed, and 41 percent of the people surveyed
said they are &#8220;generally bullish&#8221; on the shares. Forty percent
said they&#8217;re &#8220;generally bearish.&#8221; Fifty-four percent of U.S.
investors were bullish, compared with 28 percent in Europe and
43 percent in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Money Machine&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m bullish on it, I actually bought it,&#8221; said
respondent Carey Chapman, treasurer of the Asheboro, North
Carolina-based bank CommunityOne, part of FNB United Corp.
&#8220;They&#8217;re just a money machine, they know how to make money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the criticism is politically motivated, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Obama administration is trying to build a case
against Wall Street to push the financial legislation,&#8221; Chapman
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallout Modest &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a panel
appointed by Congress to investigate the causes of the economic
slump, said it subpoenaed Goldman Sachs after the firm didn&#8217;t
follow its requests, deliberately producing so many documents
that investigators cannot quickly sort them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman said it is &#8220;committed to providing the FCIC with
the information they have requested.&#8221; That inquiry is separate
from the SEC&#8217;s case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain&#8217;s Prada said the fallout from the SEC lawsuit against
Goldman Sachs would be modest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the end of the day, it&#8217;s going to be business as
usual,&#8221; Prada said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. will pay $715 million
for the rights to distribute some Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.
brands, in a new agreement prompted by the acquisition of its
largest bottler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cash payment will allow Coca-Cola to sell brands
including Dr Pepper and Canada Dry in some regions of the U.S.
and Canada for 20 years, the Atlanta-based company said today in
a statement. Dr Pepper also takes back the distribution of some
brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Pepper renegotiated its distribution contracts with
Coca-Cola, the world&#8217;s largest soda maker, and PepsiCo Inc.
after both companies agreed to buy bottlers. PepsiCo paid $900
million this year to distribute some Dr Pepper drinks. The Coca-
Cola payment announced today is close to an estimate by Carlos Laboy, an analyst at Credit Suisse in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The terms and cash amount are in-line with the previous
deal with PepsiCo, however we believe some investors expected a
higher payment to come from Coke,&#8221; Laboy said today in a note.
He has a &#8220;neutral&#8221; recommendation on Dr Pepper stock and
doesn&#8217;t rate Coca-Cola. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Pepper, based in Plano, Texas, fell 64 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $35.85 at 4:04 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Coca-Cola dropped 47 cents to $50.80. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola agreed to buy Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.&#8217;s North
American bottling unit in February. The distribution deal will
replace those between Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola Enterprises when
the acquisition closes later this year, Coca-Cola said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freestyle Fountain &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payment is lower than the $900 million estimated by
Kaumil Gajrawala, an analyst with UBS AG in New York. The
difference will be made up largely by Coca-Cola&#8217;s agreement to
give Dr Pepper access to fountain drink accounts and put Dr
Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper on its new Freestyle fountain,
Gajrawala said today in a note. He recommends buying Dr Pepper
and Coca-Cola shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Pepper, in a statement, valued the Freestyle access at
$115 million to $135 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Freestyle, a touch screen-controlled drink dispenser
that expands offerings to more than 100, will be available in at
least 500 U.S. outlets this summer, Coca-Cola said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Pepper said it will take back distribution of Squirt,
Canada Dry, Schweppes and Cactus Cooler sold by Coca-Cola
Enterprises in certain U.S. territories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement imposes new performance conditions on Coca-
Cola, Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said on a call with
reporters, declining to provide further details. Fayard also
declined to say whether the new agreement includes a change-in-
control clause that would trigger a renegotiation should Coca-
Cola spin off the bottling operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola bottlers distribute about 42 percent of the Dr
Pepper brand&#8217;s volume while PepsiCo distributes 39 percent,
Fayard said, citing statistics by industry newsletter Beverage
Digest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick Walujo, a former investment
banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has emerged as Indonesia&#8217;s
busiest dealmaker since teaming up with U.S. buyout firm TPG
almost four years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TPG passed over other candidates when it began scouting for
a partner in the nation in 2005. The 34-year-old&#8217;s Northstar
Pacific Partners shared TPG&#8217;s plan to invest in plain vanilla
equity of resources firms and companies set to benefit from
growing consumption in Southeast Asia&#8217;s largest economy, said
Ashish Shastry, TPG&#8217;s head for the region in Singapore. Other
private-equity firms seemed to focus on more complex mezzanine
debt or structured deals, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Indonesia seemed to us to be an interesting emerging
market for investment, and Patrick and his colleagues seemed to
be the best there,&#8221; said David Bonderman, founding partner of
the Fort Worth, Texas-based private-equity firm with $45 billion
of capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyout firms including Washington-based Carlyle Group and
the U.K.&#8217;s CVC Capital Partners Ltd. are venturing into the
world&#8217;s most populous Muslim nation, where private-equity
investments could increase fivefold to as much as $3 billion
this year, from $570 million in 2009, according to estimates by
the Centre for Asia Private Equity Research Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission has submitted a subpoena to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
according to a spokesman for the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subpoena requests documents and e-mails from Goldman
Sachs, FCIC spokesman Tucker Warren said today in an interview.
The subpoena was sent because Goldman Sachs hasn&#8217;t complied with
requests for documents, Warren said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. is marketing
$716.3 million of bonds backed by commercial mortgages,
according to a person familiar with the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction, which is the second of newly issued
commercial-mortgage backed bonds to be sold this year, consists
of 36 loans on 96 properties, said the person, who declined to
be identified because terms aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of commercial-mortgage backed securities halted in
2008 as credit markets froze, choking off funding to property
borrowers. Even with government aid, only $3.04 billion of the
debt was issued last year, compared with $11.2 billion in 2008
and a record $232.4 billion in 2007, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC sold $309.7
million of the bonds in April. During the boom, sales grew as
large as $7.6 billion, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plunging property values have made it difficult for
borrowers to secure enough financing to retire maturing debt,
with prices down 42 percent from October 2007 peaks, according
to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. A record 7.02 percent of borrowers
are behind on payments, versus 1.87 percent a year ago,
according to Moody&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s offering consists of loans equal to 61.5 percent
of the value of the properties on average, the person said. In
2007, borrowers were able to take out loans equaling about 69.1
percent of a property&#8217;s value, according to Jefferies Group Inc.
data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads to Treasuries &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current ratio &#8220;doesn&#8217;t seem all that much lower, but
the difference is today&#8217;s valuations,&#8221; said Lisa Pendergast, an
analyst at Jefferies in Stamford, Connecticut. &#8220;Property values
are no longer being driven by overly optimistic expectations on
cash flow and cheap and plentiful sources of capital.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-rated commercial-mortgage backed securities yield about
3.09 percentage points more than Treasuries, compared with 8.03
percentage points over the benchmark a year ago, according to
Barclays PLC data. Lower spreads mean banks can offer more
attractive financing to borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest top-rated portion of the RBS offering priced to
yield 0.9 percentage points more than the benchmark swap rate as
tighter underwriting standards give investors more confidence in
the mortgages being bundled into securities being sold now
compared with those written in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should hold on to their
bets that the pound will decline against the dollar even after
the currency advanced against its major counterparts in recent
weeks, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound will fall after it failed to break above a key
resistance level of $1.48, wrote JPMorgan currency technical
analyst Niall O&#8217;Connor. The bank has forecast sterling will drop
to $1.35 by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to hold on to short positions looking for a
break to new lows,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor wrote in an e-mailed note received
today. &#8220;We continue to view the advance in the pound/dollar
from the May low as a corrective phase within a medium-term
downtrend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound has risen 2.52 percent in a month, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The currency,
which gained 0.6 percent against the dollar in the past two
weeks, traded at $1.4510 as of 1:25 p.m. in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound&#8217;s advance against the Swiss franc may also
reverse after it failed to rise above the 1.71-franc &#8220;medium-
term range highs,&#8221; the bank said. The British currency has
posted three straight weeks of gains against the franc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The overbought and diverging momentum studies suggest a
reversal is due,&#8221; wrote O&#8217;Connor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound rose to 1.6865 franc from 1.6801 franc on June 4.
It has gained 2.8 percent against the Swiss currency in the past
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Resistance levels are where sell
orders may be clustered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Plc isn&#8217;t paging Dr. Chakrabarty,
even with the company&#8217;s Gulf of Mexico oil spill now the biggest
in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Ananda Chakrabarty is the named inventor on a
patent for an organism engineered to consume spilled oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His patent 4,259,444, which was issued in March 1981, was
the subject of intense debate about the patentability of
bioengineered organisms. The dispute went all the way to the
U.S. Supreme Court, with the high court deciding in June 1980
that living, man-made organisms fell within the bounds of patent
law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organism was invented after Chakrabarty, then a staff
microbiologist at General Electric Co.&#8217;s corporate research and
development center, was given the task of figuring out a way to
convert cow manure to cattle feed. He segued into research on an
engineered organism with an appetite for crude oil, and in 1971,
GE filed an application to patent the organism and the process
by which it was made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the patent was finally issued, GE asked the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency for guidelines on the release of
genetically organized organisms in an open environment,
Chakrabarty said in an e-mail. There were no guidelines, he
said, and GE was told it would be released &#8220;at its own risk
(and peril).&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chakrabarty said one problem was how to control the
organism in an oil spill area, to keep it from giving pathogens
in the area of the spill the ability to consume oil and
proliferate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a difficult question to address in absence of
any practical field demonstration and risk assessment,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, GE never licensed the technology, the patent
expired and &#8220;the bug never saw the light of day,&#8221; according to
Chakrabarty, who is today a professor at the University of
Illinois College of Medicine&#8217;s Department of Microbiology and
Immunology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chakrabarty is the named inventor on 12 issued U.S.
patents, according to the database of the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. Most deal with prevention of, or treatments
for, HIV infection, malaria and cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has done research on what are known as biosurfactants
that are microbial products rather than live organisms. They can
be used for oil sludge cleanup and recovery he said, and unlike
the chemicals such as Corexit presently being used in the gulf,
they are biodegradable and non-toxic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are covered by his patent 5,013,654, which was issued
in 1991, and have successfully been lab tested at the U.S.
Army&#8217;s Aberdeen Proving Ground on rocks coated with oil from the
1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, Chakrabarty said in his e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inventor retains an interest in patent law. He filed a
friend-of-the-court brief in the pending Supreme Court case
dealing with the patentability of business methods. He supported
the patent eligibility of the Bilski application for a patent
for a method of hedging weather-related risks when buying and
selling energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chakrabarty also recently wrote a paper on patent law
published in Landes Bioscience, &#8220;Bioengineered bugs, drugs and
contentious issues in patenting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pending high court case is Bilski v. Kappos, 09-964,
U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Says No Settlement Reached With Cubist Over Cubicin &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. said it hasn&#8217;t reached
a settlement with Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc. in their dispute
over patents on the antibiotic Cubicin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cubist, which claims Teva is infringing its patents for
Cubicin, jumped as much as 9.2 percent in New York trading June
4 after a judge&#8217;s cancellation of a hearing on the dispute
prompted investor speculation that the companies had reached an
agreement. The cancellation is &#8220;not an indication of a
settlement,&#8221; said Denise Bradley, a Teva spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cubicin is Cubist&#8217;s only drug, and the company had sued to
block Teva from selling a lower-cost copy until U.S. patents
expire in 2016 and 2019. A federal court hearing in Delaware
scheduled for June 9 to determine the definition of terms in
Cubist patents was canceled June 4 by U.S. District Judge
Gregory M. Sleet, who said in his order he would rule &#8220;in due
course.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A favorable decision for Cubist &#8220;would set a positive
tone&#8221; and increase the likelihood of settlement with Teva,
Jason Kantor, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets Corp. in San
Francisco, said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. sales of Cubicin were $524 million in 2009, or about
93 percent of Lexington, Massachusetts-based Cubist&#8217;s revenue.
The intravenous antibiotic is used to treat skin infections
caused by drug-resistant microorganisms. A trial in the case is
scheduled for April 2011, according to Cubist&#8217;s annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Teva Parenteral
Medicines Inc., 09cv189, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Gets Patent on Distortable Fonts for Education &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the largest software company in the world,
received a patent on a method of distorting text based on the
meaning of the displayed word, or a pictogram of the displayed
word. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond-based software giant calls these process
&#8220;fonts with feelings,&#8221; in patent 7,730,403, which was issued
June 1. The technology can be used to &#8220;improve the
instructional nature of fonts,&#8221; according to the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While computer fonts are &#8220;optimized for use by knowledge
workers,&#8221; they fail to engage children and help them understand
the words, letters, and numbers they represent, Microsoft said
in its patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft applied for the patent in March 2006. No outside
counsel is listed on the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patently Obvious Inventions Patented in Russian as Troll Defense &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russians are patenting such obvious inventions as sticks
for lollipops, according to an article written by Baker 
McKenzie&#8217;s Eugene Arievich, and reported on the PatLit patent
litigation blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arievich wrote that fear of patent trolls is driving the
push to patent low-tech inventions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Foreign companies must take patent searches seriously, as
things that no one would think of patenting elsewhere in the
world may need this form of legal protection in Russia,&#8221; he
said in his article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason patent trolls are such a fearful threat in
Russia is that under Russian law, they can pursue criminal
proceedings against the target company&#8217;s management, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently Russian courts have held that as long as the
patent or other form of IP protection remains in force, &#8220;a
rights holder may uphold its rights by any lawful means,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rowling Considering e-Book Publication for Harry Potter Books &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.K. Rowling, whose Harry Potter books are published in the
U.K. by Bloomsbury Publishing Group and in the U.S. by
Scholastic Corp., is considering e-book releases of her work,
the Bookseller.com reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Rowling had previously opposed e-book publication
for fear of piracy, she is &#8220;considering all the options and
opportunities that this evolving space provides,&#8221; her literary
agent told the Bookseller.com &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Charkin of Bloomsbury declined to disclose to the
Bookseller.com whether his company was discussing e-book
publication with Rowling and her agent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomsbury will be republishing all the Harry Potter books
with new jacket designs in November, the Bookseller reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual Game Piece Theft Results in Finnish Police Investigation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police in Finland are investigating 400 cases of theft of
virtual items from players of Sulake Corporation Oy&#8217;s virtual
world game Habbo Hotel, the BBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habbo Hotel members contacted the police, the BBC said,
claiming virtual belongings worth as much as 1000 euros ($1,200)
had been stolen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police have searched homes in five cities in Finland,
according to the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virtual items are stolen through the use of fake web
pages to capture usernames and passwords in what&#8217;s known as
&#8220;phishing,&#8221; the BBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rush Warns Rand Paul Against Using Band&#8217;s Music in Campaign &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counsel for Rush, a Canadian rock band, has sent a cease
and desist letter to Rand Paul, complaining the U.S. Senate
candidate in Kentucky is using its music without permission,
Associated Press reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, a Republican candidate and the son of U.S.
Representative Ron Paul, is accused of using one Rush song at a
rally in Kentucky and another in a video, according to AP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse Benton, Paul&#8217;s campaign manager, said the dispute is
a non-issue, according to AP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Farmer, the Toronto lawyer representing Rush, said
the dispute with Paul is not political, AP reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logo Reportedly Chosen for FIFA&#8217;s 2014 World Cup Competition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Brazilian sports Web site has published an image of what
it says will be the logo for FIFA&#8217;s 2014 World Cup competition
in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F&#233;d&#233;ration Internationale de Football Association,
soccer&#8217;s governing body, named Brazil the host nation for the
2014 matches in October 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logo is yellow, green and red, and features an abstract
image of upraised hands that form a soccer ball held aloft. The
World Cup Brazil 2014 blog reported that the logo was chosen by
six judges, including model Gisele B&#252;ndchen and Oscar Niemeyer,
the architect who designed the city of Brasilia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIFA vigorously protects its trademarks. South Africa&#8217;s
Independent online Web site reported that in the two weeks
before June 3, counterfeit goods worth 70 million South African
rand ($8.9 million) were seized at border stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of the South Africa Clothing and Textile Workers
Union told the Independent that counterfeit imports have cost
South Africa&#8217;s textile and clothing industry more than 14,000
jobs in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile Pepper, Cheese, Italian Garlic Get Origin Protection &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three European food items have newly received geographic-
indication protection from the European Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimento de Padron, a Spanish pepper, was entered into the
register of protected designations or origin and geographical
indications May 20. According to the ChileFoundry Web site,
these peppers are unusual in having a variable degree of heat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canestrato de Moliterno, a type of pecorino cheese, was
registered May 21. This cheese is made from the milk of sheep
and goats that are pasture-raised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aglio di voghiera was also listed May 21. This is an
Italian garlic grown in the Po river valley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic Arts Sued Over &#8216;Active&#8217; in Fitness Product Names &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic Arts Inc., publisher of the &#8220;Rock Band,&#8221;
&#8220;SimCity&#8221; and &#8220;Madden NFL&#8221; computer games, was sued for
trademark infringement by The Active Network Inc., a San Diego-
based fitness marketing company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active Network claims the game publisher&#8217;s EA Sports Active
and WE Sports Active More Workouts&#8221; for Nintendo Co.&#8217;s Wii game
platform infringe its &#8220;Active&#8221; trademarks. The San Diego
company has three registered trademarks containing the word
&#8220;active,&#8221; and has used the active.com domain name since 1999,
according to the complaint filed May 28 in federal court in San
Diego. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic Arts has a proposed product to be sold as &#8220;EA
Sports Active 2.0&#8221; that will duplicate many of the functions of
Active Network&#8217;s online products, the San Diego company claims.
The use of &#8220;active&#8221; in the game company&#8217;s product name is
likely to confuse consumers, Active Networks said in its
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to bar the Redwood Shores, California-
based company from any use of the word &#8220;active&#8221; with its
online personal fitness programs and services. The company also
requests money damages and seizure and forfeiture of all
allegedly infringing products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active Networks asked for attorney fees and money damages
and asked that the damages be tripled because of the game
company&#8217;s &#8220;willful and wanton infringement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew D. Murphey of San Francisco&#8217;s Gordon  Rees LLP
represents The Active Network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is The Active Network Inc. v. Electronic Arts
Inc., 3:10-cv-01158-BEN-WVG, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of California (San Diego). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwabe Firm Hires IP Specialist Heuser from Kolisch Hartwell &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwabe Williamson  Wyatt hired Peter E. Heuser for its IP
practice, the Portland-based firm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heuser, who previously practiced at Portland&#8217;s Kolisch
Hartwell PC, is a litigator. He&#8217;s represented both plaintiffs

application work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering
from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, and a law degree from the
University of Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. warned that
&#8220;premature&#8221; changes to oil-drilling rules may harm growth in
the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We caution anyone from trying to jump to conclusions and
introducing regulations without fully understanding what
happened,&#8221; Andrew Swiger, senior vice president of the company,
said at the Asia Oil and Gas Conference in Kuala Lumpur today.
&#8220;The industry has drilled thousands of wells in all manner of
operating environments, whether it&#8217;s deepwater or onshore, all
around the world, without incident.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An explosion sank Transocean Ltd.&#8217;s $365 million Deepwater
Horizon rig, which had almost completed a well 5,000 feet below
the surface southeast of New Orleans, for BP Plc, resulting in
the biggest oil spill in U.S. history. A Pennsylvania natural
gas well &#8220;blowout&#8221; last week led to concern that tighter
restrictions on offshore drilling following BP Gulf of Mexico
spill will spread onshore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration replaced the Minerals Management
Service, faulted for lax regulation of offshore drilling before
the BP spill, with three offices to oversee leases, drilling
safety and fee collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to guard against premature changes to regulations
that may not turn out to be the right thing,&#8221; Swiger said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was attacked
by the state-controlled China Youth Daily as a &#8220;black hand&#8221;
that plays &#8220;tricks carefully designed to gamble with Chinese
enterprises,&#8221; the Financial Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese newspaper&#8217;s article, which alleged that Goldman
may have &#8220;created even bigger losses for Chinese companies and
investors than it did with its fraudulent actions in the U.S.,&#8221;
was distributed through the Xinhua News and People&#8217;s Daily
websites, the FT said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Youth Daily said Goldman has made an excessive amount
of money from underwriting initial public offerings, arranging
transactions and making its own private-equity investments,
according to the FT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. investment bank was also criticized for devising
and selling oil-hedging contracts to Chinese state companies,
which consequently suffered losses when oil prices fell, the FT
added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, plans to sell $1.15 billion of convertible
senior notes due in 2013 and will use the proceeds to repay
short-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may grant underwriters an option to buy an
additional $100 million of the notes, the Redmond, Washington-
based company said today in a statement. The debt received
ratings of Aaa from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and AAA from
Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proceeds will let Microsoft retire some of its
commercial paper. As of March 31, it had $2.25 billion of short-
term debt outstanding, according to a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The notes give Microsoft
more stability with debt at a fixed rate, compared with the more
volatile interest of short-term paper. Convertible notes allow
investors to exchange debt into common stock at a pre-
established rate under specified conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commercial paper market in the last few years has
done some backflips no one would have expected, at times
freezing or seizing up entirely,&#8221; said Michael Holland, who
oversees more than $4 billion, including Microsoft shares, as
chairman of Holland  Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s action indicates the company believes the
convertible market is an attractive place to sell now. &#8220;If I
owned some convertibles now, I&#8217;d be looking to sell them,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft issued $3.75 billion of 5-, 10- and 30-year debt
in May 2009 as it tapped the corporate bond market for the first
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s $2 billion of 2.95 percent notes maturing in
2014 traded at 103.936 cents on the dollar to yield 1.916
percent at 11:01 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 18 cents to $25.11 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lojas Renner SA, Brazil&#8217;s biggest
publicly traded clothing retailer, rose to a one-month high
after a report showed the country&#8217;s economy grew more than
expected and JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised its rating on the
stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s economy grew at the fastest annual rate since 1995
in the first quarter, expanding 9 percent from a year earlier,
the national statistics agency said today in Rio de Janeiro.
Economists had forecast an increase of 8.5 percent, according to
the median of 41 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renner&#8217;s earnings growth will accelerate as the company
expands with smaller stores, JPMorgan analysts Andrea Teixeira
and Joao Mamede wrote in a note to clients today. JPMorgan
boosted Renner to &#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; and increased
its year-end share-price forecast 19 percent to 50 reais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renner rose 1.5 percent in Sao Paulo trading to 44.37
reais, the highest closing price since May 3. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, erasing earlier
losses, after the euro advanced on speculation a central bank
intervened in currency markets and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the economic recovery is intact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. climbed 2.7 percent as oil increased 1.1
percent in New York. Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc. gained
4.6 percent, leading commodity companies to the biggest rally in
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, as gold futures reached a
record of $1,254.50 an ounce. Amazon.com Inc. lost 2.1 percent,
dropping below its 200-day average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A major bank intervening to support the euro would be a
signal of confidence and looked at a positive surprise, which
could cause shorts to cover their positions,&#8221; said Frederic Dickson, the Lake Oswego, Oregon-based chief market strategist
at D.A. Davidson  Co., which oversees about $25 billion. &#8220;Given
today&#8217;s market sensitivity, any news report that focuses on the
euro is going to trigger an immediate trading reaction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 0.4 percent to 1,055.14 at 12:52 p.m. in
New York after falling as much as 0.8 percent. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average advanced 67.04 points, or 0.7 percent, to
9,883.53. The euro gained 0.5 percent against the dollar after a
weakening in the Swiss franc fueled speculation the central bank
sold it to safeguard the economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 closed at a seven-month low yesterday after
losing 14 percent since April 23. The benchmark index for U.S.
equities had surged 80 percent since sinking to the weakest
level in 12 years on March 9, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil climbed as crude oil advanced above $72 a
barrel. Freeport-McMoRan gained $2.68 to $61.34 as gold rose to
a record on demand for a haven from financial turmoil in Europe.
The company&#8217;s rating was raised to &#8220;overweight&#8221; from
&#8220;neutral&#8221; at HSBC by equity analyst Jordi Dominguez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold futures for August delivery rose $6.10, or 0.5
percent, to $1,246.90 on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the
price surpassed the previous all-time high of $1,249.70 set on
May 14. Gold has gained 13 percent this year as investors lost
confidence in currencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity companies advanced 1.8 percent for the biggest
increase in the SP 500. Newmont Mining Corp., the largest U.S.
gold producer, gained 3.2 percent to $56.90 for the third-
biggest rally in the benchmark index for American equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald&#8217;s Corp. gained 1.2 percent after global revenue
climbed more than some analysts estimated last month. Sales at
stores open at least 13 months increased 4.8 percent, the
world&#8217;s largest restaurant company said today in a statement.
Analysts projected global sales would advance 4.5 percent, the
median of four estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corning Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corning Inc. had the biggest gain in the SP 500, advancing
5 percent to $16.80. The world&#8217;s biggest maker of glass for
flat-panel televisions was raised to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8220;market
perform&#8221; at Sanford C. Bernstein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. led chipmakers lower after UBS AG said industry
sales growth will slow in coming months because of the debt
crisis in Europe. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, tracking
21 stocks, declined 1.4 percent to 331.27 as of 12:47 p.m. in
New York. Intel, the world&#8217;s largest chipmaker, fell 1.4 percent
to $19.98 for the second-biggest loss in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Prolonged weakness in Europe could lead to slower bookings
and risks of inventory build,&#8221; Uche Orji, a New York-based
analyst with UBS, wrote in a note to clients as he initiated
coverage of the industry. &#8220;After four quarters of above trend
growth, we expect the semi sector to regress to normalized
trends. We are cautious near term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com lost 1.8 percent to $119.76, after earlier
dropping below its 200-day average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovery Intact &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernanke helped alleviate concern about the pace of the
economic recovery that following slower-than-estimated jobs
growth in the U.S. last month. Confidence among U.S. small
businesses rose in May to the highest level in 20 months as
executives planned to add to inventories, a private survey
showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. lost 5.2 percent to $56.14
after BusinessInsider.com said the company&#8217;s Ocean Saratoga rig
may be leaking oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Before the report,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its rating on Diamond shares to
&#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamond spokesman Les Van Dyke referred questions on the
report to Taylor Energy, the petroleum explorer that leased the
Ocean Saratoga. Taylor Energy officials couldn&#8217;t immediately be
reached for comment. BusinessInsider.com said a pilot who flew
over the area confirmed an oil plume originating from the rig.
The U.S. Coast Guard is looking into reports of a new oil leak,
Lt. Commander Chris O&#8217;Neil said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc&#8217;s U.S. shares sank 5 percent to $34.94. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Formidable&#8217; Challenge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European stocks fell after Fitch Ratings warned that the
scale of the U.K.&#8217;s fiscal challenge is &#8220;formidable&#8221; and the
U.K. needs to accelerate plans to reduce its budget deficit,
fueling concern that the sovereign debt crisis that started in
Greece is spreading. The statement came one day after Prime
Minister David Cameron told Britons to expect years of spending
cuts, while the European Union pledged tougher sanctions on
governments that break deficit rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A credit rating downgrade for the U.K. is &#8220;coming,&#8221;
Dennis Gartman, an economist and editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter, said in an interview today on
Bloomberg Radio. &lt;/p&gt;

unions, EFE reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morales was re-elected yesterday for another two-year term

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. will give states $250
million in grants over five years to strengthen their ability to
review premiums, starting with $51 million this year, said
Kathleen Sebelius, the federal health secretary, in a statement
yesterday. The program, announced by the White House yesterday,
expands funding for states to scrutinize &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; rate
increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers led by UnitedHealth Group Inc. and WellPoint Inc.
risk losing access to as many as 24 million customers a year
under the plan. UnitedHealth, WellPoint and Aetna Inc., the
largest U.S. insurers, urged regulators in letters delivered
last month to limit the new rate-review plans or risk driving
insurers out of some markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with more state funding, the health overhaul passed
by Congress in March allows states to bar plans from the online
insurance exchanges where the U.S. estimates 24 million people
will buy coverage by 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States will have to strike a balance between protecting
consumers and ensuring the solvency of health plans, said Sandy
Praeger, the Kansas insurance commissioner and past president of
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in Kansas
City, Missouri. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Euro-Area Ministers Seal Rescue-Fund Deal to Stem Debt Crisis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European finance ministers put the finishing touches on a
rescue fund being backed by 440 billion euros ($526 billion) in
national guarantees, seeking to halt the spread of Greece&#8217;s debt
crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Financial Stability Facility would sell bonds
backed by the guarantees and use the money it raises to make
loans to euro-area nations in need, the finance ministers
decided today in Luxembourg. The new mechanism would sell debt
for lending only after an aid request is made by a country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministers aim for ratings companies to assign a AAA
rating to the facility, whose bonds would be eligible for
European Central Bank refinancing operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund, being created for three years, is the main part
of a 750 billion-euro aid package that European Union finance
ministers hammered out a month ago to combat a sovereign debt
crisis. Another 60 billion euros will come from the European
Commission  and 250 billion euros from the International
Monetary Fund. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rome Plans Hotel Tax as Credit Rating Under Siege &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome is considering a hotel tax on the 9 million visitors
to the Eternal City each year, a revenue-raising measure that
may hurt tourism in the Italian capital and put further pressure
on its credit rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi&#8217;s government proposed the
levy. Italy authorized the initiative in its budget-cutting
plan, prompting Standard  Poor&#8217;s on May 27 to change the
outlook on Rome to negative. The ratings company said the
government was scaling back its commitment to bolster the city&#8217;s
finances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernabo Bocca, president of hotel trade association
Federalberghi, called the tax &#8220;utterly stupid&#8221; in an
interview. Berlusconi said the decision &#8220;will only be taken
after a long discussion&#8221; with the trade association. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FCIC Subpoenas Goldman Sachs, Seeking Documents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most profitable firm in Wall
Street history, was subpoenaed by the Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission, a U.S. panel investigating the financial crisis,
after allegedly failing to hand over documents in a &#8220;timely
manner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request for information shows the FCIC is turning
attention to Goldman Sachs after investigating credit-rating
companies and banks such as Citigroup Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos.
The company has already drawn scrutiny from regulators and
lawmakers for packaging mortgages into securities that triggered
losses for investors when the housing market collapsed in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in an e-mailed statement that it is
committed to providing the FCIC with the requested information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was sued April 16 by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission in claims related to a collateralized debt
obligation. The firm has said the suit is &#8220;unfounded in law and
fact.&#8221; Federal prosecutors in New York are also investigating
transactions by Goldman Sachs, people familiar with the matter
said April 29. The firm hasn&#8217;t been accused of criminal
misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ Misses Deadline for Lawmakers&#8217; Document Request &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson failed to meet yesterday&#8217;s deadline to
provide U.S. House lawmakers with documents on the company&#8217;s
2008 recall of defective Motrin tablets from stores, a House
committee aide said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers, who asked JJ to submit the documents by 4 p.m.
New York time, hadn&#8217;t received any records as of 6:15 p.m.,
Jenny Rosenberg, a spokeswoman for the House Oversight and
Government Reform Committee, said in an e-mail. Rosenberg said
further action will be taken if necessary &#8220;to ensure
cooperation with the committee&#8217;s investigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel began investigating JJ after the company on
April 30 recalled 40 types of children&#8217;s medicines. Lawmakers
learned during their inquiry that JJ in 2008 removed Motrin
from the market without regulators&#8217; knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ produced the records for the committee, Bonnie Jacobs,
a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Approves 5 Brokerages for Margin Trading, China News Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s securities regulator has approved five brokerages
to trial margin trading, the China News Service reported, citing
an unidentified official from the body &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The China Securities Regulatory Commission also plans to
lower the entry requirements for brokerages to take part in
margin trading trials, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, China&#8217;s government has revised its regulations
for financial institutions to report their international
payments, according to a statement today by the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Deserves Regulatory Probe in Bloomberg Poll &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is being &#8220;legitimately
scrutinized&#8221; by regulators who sued the firm for fraud based on
conduct that many in the industry consider to be common
practice, according to a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history
has suffered the worst decline in reputation among its largest
competitors, according to the global quarterly poll of 1,001
investors and analysts who are Bloomberg subscribers. Eighty-
three percent of respondents said Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stature
diminished in the past six months; the next closest were UBS AG,
with 27 percent, and Citigroup Inc., at 26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was sued April 16 by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which said the New York-based company
failed to inform investors about the role hedge fund Paulson 
Co. played in both helping to select contracts underlying a
mortgage-linked investment and betting against it. Goldman Sachs
has said it did nothing wrong and is fighting the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the poll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more, click here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Bloomberg&#8217;s Jon Erlichman and Erik Schatzker
reported about the survey concerning Goldman Sachs, as well as a
separate poll that showed the U.S. has supplanted China and
Brazil as the most attractive market for investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jyske Reported to Police by FSA for Not Reporting Transactions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jyske Bank A/S was reported to the police by the Danish FSA
for failing to report transactions in listed securities, the
Danish agency said today on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA also reported Skaelskoer Bank, Etrade Bank and
BankInvest to the police for similar offenses. BankInvest said a
computer error was to blame for the missing transaction reports
over five months in 2009 and that it risked a fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at the other three companies were not immediately
available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evonik Sued by Vion Over Cartel for Feed Additive &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evonik Industries AG was sued in London by Vion NV, a Dutch
meat processor, over claims that one of its units charged too
much for a chicken-feed additive during a 13-year price-fixing
cartel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vion and its U.K. producers sued Evonik on May 21, claiming
they were overcharged as a result of the scheme to set price
targets and share sales data from 1986 to 1999, according to
filings at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union in 2002 fined Evonik 118 million euros
($141 million) for fixing the price of methionine, an amino acid
added to most animal feed and to all chicken feed. The market
for the additive, also used to improve cow fertility, was worth
about 260 million euros a year in Europe when the cartel
operated, according to the EU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit involved in the case, Dusseldorf-based Evonik
Degussa GmbH, postponed a hearing scheduled for today at the
tribunal in London while it seeks to add Sanofi-Aventis SA as a
co-defendant in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aventis SA, now part of Paris-based Sanofi-Aventis, and
another unit were also part of the cartel. Aventis won immunity
from fines in the case by revealing the cartel to authorities
and cooperating with the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geoffroy Bessaud, a Sanofi-Aventis spokesman, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catriona Munro, Vion&#8217;s lawyer with the firm Maclay Murray 
Spens LLP in Glasgow, declined to say how much money her client
is seeking. The case was filed by U.K. companies including
Grampian Country Food Group Ltd. that were acquired by Vion,
Munro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s Sued in Frankfurt Court Over Lehman Ratings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s Financial Services LLC, a unit of McGraw-
Hill Cos., was sued in a Frankfurt court over its ratings of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. before the bank&#8217;s collapse in
2008, a lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A German pensioner who owned Lehman certificates is
seeking compensation for 30,000 euros ($35,790) lost when the
investment bank filed bankruptcy, his lawyer Jens-Peter Gieschen
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The suit was filed June
3, he said, declining to identify the plaintiff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meinrad Woesthoff, the spokesman for the Frankfurt court,
said he wasn&#8217;t immediately able to confirm the suit, which
claims the A+ rating for Lehman in May 2008 on which the
investor relied was misleading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doris Keicher, a spokeswoman for SP in Frankfurt, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating companies have come under fire for their alleged
failure to foresee the financial crisis and for granting top
rankings to mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Standard  Poor&#8217;s withdrew its ratings on 2,427
interest-only slices of U.S. residential mortgage-backed
securities issued from 1991 to 2010, citing changes to its
methodology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suspended grades involved pieces of 831 transactions,
New York-based SP said yesterday in a statement. Nine of the
rankings were under review for downgrades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court Gives First Jail Terms for 1984 Bhopal Disaster &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Indian court sentenced seven former senior employees of
Union Carbide Corp.&#8217;s local unit to two years each in jail for
causing death by negligence, after the first ever convictions
related to the deadly 1984 leak of toxic gas in Bhopal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those given prison terms include the former chairman of
Union Carbide India Ltd., Keshub Mahindra, one of eight charged
with causing death by negligence, the Press Trust of India news
agency reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Carbide said yesterday that the plant was owned and
operated by Union Carbide India Ltd. and the Indian courts have
no jurisdiction over the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An explosion at the Union Carbide pesticide plant on Dec.
3, 1984, released methyl isocyanate gas into the streets of
Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh state in central India.
After the explosion, 7,000 perished within days, and another
15,000 later died from exposure to the gas, according to a study
by human rights group Amnesty International. Union Carbide
estimated that 3,800 people were killed by the leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical Co., which acquired Union Carbide in 1999,
said it settled all liabilities relating to Bohpal in 1989. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BASF Sued By Petroleos Mexicanos Over Oil Trade Claim &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petroleos Mexicanos, the state-owned oil company, sued
companies including BASF SE&#8217;s U.S. unit over allegations tied to
the illegal trade of oil products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s attorney general and federal police have been
investigating fuel theft for the past three years. As of August
2009, Petroleas Mexicanos, or Pemex, as the Mexico City-based
company is known, had filed 1,587 police reports over fuel
thefts, and none of the cases have led to a conviction in
Mexico, according to Reforma newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pemex Exploracion Y Produccion v. BASF Corp.,
10-01997, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas
(Houston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr Judge Names Receiver, Bars Payments to Clients &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein in Manhattan yesterday
appointed attorney Aurora Cassirer to take temporary control of
Starr Investment Advisors LLC and Starr  Co. Stein barred
Cassirer from making payments to Starr&#8217;s clients, meaning
&#8220;clients can&#8217;t get their money,&#8221; the judge said at a hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are money-management firms of jailed
financial adviser Kenneth Ira Starr, 66, who was arrested and
charged May 27 with fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Starr and
his wife, Diane Passage, winning a court order freezing Starr-
related bank accounts and now having the firm, which catered to
celebrities, controlled by a receiver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil suit is SEC v. Starr, 1:10-cv-04270, and the
criminal case is U.S. v. Starr, 1:10-mj-01135, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axel Springer Asks Court to Overturn Veto of ProSieben Takeover &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axel Springer AG, Europe&#8217;s largest newspaper publisher,
asked a German top court to overturn the veto of its 2005 bid
for broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG, arguing the merger
won&#8217;t curb competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axel Springer&#8217;s position in print advertising via its
tabloid Bild Zeitung wouldn&#8217;t increase ProSieben&#8217;s dominance in
television, Dirk Schroder, a lawyer for the publisher, told the
Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe today. A merger would
instead help ProSieben challenge Bertelsmann AG&#8217;s RTL group than
decrease competition, Schroeder said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axel Springer has said that it may reconsider a bid for
the company if it prevails in the suit. The transaction was
abandoned in 2006 after the Federal Cartel Office said it would
harm competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is BGH, KVR 4/09. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel Seeks to Show at Trial That SocGen Knew of His Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial of Jerome Kerviel, beginning more than two years
after Societe Generale SA accused him of losing 4.9 billion
euros ($5.8 billion) on unauthorized market bets, may turn on
whether the trader can show the bank knew what he was doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale initiated the probe by filing a criminal
complaint; the company seeks to recoup its losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel is charged with abuse of trust, faking documents and
computer hacking. The Paris trial, which started yesterday, has
resulted in more foreign press accreditation requests to the
court than at any time in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel, 33, who has said he is innocent of the charges,
claimed the bank knew of his activities. He became a popular
figure in France as stories of his small-town upbringing and
education outside the elite French &#8220;Grandes Ecoles&#8221; system
contrasted his background with that of the bank&#8217;s leaders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney Says World Financial System Is More Stable &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said the global
financial system has become more stable, and the risks to the
Canadian and world economies have shifted more toward how fast
governments narrow budget deficits and business investment
accelerates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney, 45, met with his Group of 20 colleagues in South
Korea last weekend to discuss rules to prevent another credit
crunch, and when governments should pare back deficits after
last year&#8217;s global recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC&#8217;s Bair Says U.S. Needs &#8216;Better Balance&#8217; in Housing Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair said
the U.S. needs &#8220;better balance&#8221; in its housing policy, with
affordable rental housing playing a more prominent role for
people who cannot afford to own homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bair&#8217;s remarks were prepared for a Housing Association of
Non-Profit Developers meeting in Tysons Corner, Virginia
yesterday. Under current law, &#8220;taxpayer subsidies for
homeowners are about three times the size of all rental
subsidies and tax incentives combined,&#8221; Bair said. Ownership
subsidies should not be pursued &#8220;to excess&#8221; when there are
other &#8220;equally worthy&#8221; solutions to help people meet housing
needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Crisis Requires G-20 Action, Sanio Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent events, including the European sovereign-debt
crisis, require an &#8220;immediate&#8221; regulatory response on a global
level from the Group of 20 nations, said Jochen Sanio, head of
BaFin, Germany&#8217;s financial regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanio, who said the regulatory system &#8220;failed miserably,&#8221;
made the remarks before participants today at the Conference of
Montreal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will probably only be &#8220;a matter of months&#8221; before
&#8220;creative&#8221; traders find a way of circumventing the short-
selling ban introduced by Germany. Therefore other measures are
needed to halt &#8220;excessive&#8221; speculation, Sanio said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BKK Partners Pty, the advisory firm
whose partners include former Australian treasurer Peter Costello, plans to start investment funds to bet on growth at
home in industries such as resources and agriculture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds might buy stakes in private and listed companies
and are at an &#8220;embryonic stage,&#8221; said Chief Executive Officer
Andrew Stuart, a former banker with Goldman Sachs Australia Ltd.
BKK plans to hire a team and identify investments, which may
also include infrastructure projects, over the next six months
before raising money for the funds, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will be themed investments,&#8221; Stuart, 43, said in an
interview yesterday at BKK&#8217;s Sydney offices. &#8220;There are a
number of sectors where we believe there is going to be greater-
than-average growth in the Australian economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm aims to attract overseas cash for the funds,
buoyed by International Monetary Fund estimates that Australia
will grow faster than the world&#8217;s developed economies in the
next two years. As the funds business takes shape, BKK will add
a &#8220;significant&#8221; number of workers in the next 12 months, said
Stuart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BKK&#8217;s main business will continue to be selling corporate
advice, he said. That division competes with independent
boutiques such as Lazard LLC and Rothschild. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re reasonably well advanced on the agricultural side
in terms of what we want to do,&#8221; BKK Chairman Alastair Walton,
52, said in the same interview. &#8220;Hopefully we&#8217;ll be making an
announcement in the next few weeks about a key hire,&#8221; he said,
declining to name the candidate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign Bids &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuart and Walton, former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs
JBWere in Australia, declined to say how much the funds might
raise or comment on the size of the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As BKK considers courting overseas investors for its funds,
foreign companies are bidding for Australian assets to secure
supplies of soft and hard commodities. Bright Food Group Co.,
Shanghai&#8217;s biggest food company, in April bid A$1.75 billion
($1.4 billion) for the sugar unit of CSR Ltd. The previous month,
Royal Dutch Shell Plc and PetroChina Co. offered A$3.5 billion
for coal-seam gas producer Arrow Energy Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of BKK&#8217;s six partners, including Jeremy Mead, who
joined this month from Lazard, are former Goldman Sachs managing
directors. Costello, Australian treasurer from 1996 to 2007,
joined BKK in November. The firm has a workforce of 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling advice on mergers and acquisitions in Australia has
got tougher since Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in May announced
plans for a 40 percent tax on so-called super profits of
resource companies, Walton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a lot of transactions and interest in resources
going on, but there&#8217;s literally a freezing up due to the
governments mining tax,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal, which mining companies are campaigning
against, has made it harder to value assets because it&#8217;s not
clear when or how the plan will be implemented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s to stop the government levying taxes on some other
sector of the economy it deems to be deriving supernormal
profits?&#8221; Stuart said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian hedge fund Basis Capital
sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for $1 billion in a Manhattan
court, claiming it was forced into insolvency after buying
mortgage-linked securities that the New York-based firm created
and one of its executives termed &#8220;one shi**y deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit by Basis Capital&#8217;s Basis Yield Alpha Fund was
filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court over Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
sale of the &#8220;now notorious Timberwolf collateralized debt
obligation,&#8221; Basis said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman was pressuring investors to take the risk of
toxic securities off its books with knowingly false sales
pitches,&#8221; Eric Lewis, the lawyer for Basis Capital, said in the
statement. &#8220;Goldman should be called to account.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs on April 16, alleging fraud tied to a CDO known as Abacus
2007-AC1. Later that month, U.S. Senate lawmakers released
internal Goldman Sachs e-mails in which Thomas K. Montag, former
head of sales and trading in the Americas at Goldman Sachs,
called the Timberwolf Ltd. CDO &#8220;one shi**y deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its securities-fraud complaint, Basis said that this e-
mail was sent in the same week that it was closing its deal with
Goldman Sachs to purchase exposure to Timberwolf through credit
default swaps. The company asked for more than $1 billion in
compensatory and punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Misguided Attempt&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lawsuit is a misguided attempt by Basis, a hedge fund
that was one of the world&#8217;s most experienced CDO investors, to
shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs,&#8221; the investment
bank said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis, which invested $78 million in Timberwolf, said in
its complaint that Goldman Sachs falsely claimed in June 2007
that the market for securities such as Timberwolf had stabilized
and that the investment was a &#8220;good entry point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All of these representations were knowingly false,&#8221;
Basis said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 2 1/2 weeks of its investment in the Timberwolf CDO,
Goldman Sachs began &#8220;to make significant margin calls&#8221; on
Basis and forced the firm into insolvency, Basis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timberwolf held pieces of other CDOs, according to a
statement from the U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations in April. Timberwolf also included optimistic
side-bets on the performance of CDOs, derivatives in which the
firm took the opposite pessimistic side in &#8220;many&#8221; cases, the
panel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator&#8217;s Comments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDO was among the securities that Goldman Sachs sold to
clients after deciding the New York-based firm needed to reduce
its mortgage holdings, said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan
Democrat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs denied it cheated Basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the time of the Timberwolf transaction, Basis
specifically stated that it would not place any reliance on
Goldman Sachs, and this decision formed part of the agreement
Basis signed,&#8221; the bank said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis made its investment at market levels that &#8220;were
substantially below the face value of the securities and
consistent with where other investors were purchasing the same
Timberwolf securities during the same time,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lost several hundred millions of dollars of
its money from its exposure to Timberwolf, according to its
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yield Alpha Fund, formerly Basis Capital&#8217;s second
biggest, filed for bankruptcy protection in the Cayman Islands
in August 2007 after banks cut the value of its investments in
collateralized debt obligations, triggering margin calls the
fund was unable to meet. That came a month after investors in
two Bear Stearns Cos. hedge funds were told there was no value
left, wiping out the $1.6 billion initially invested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Basis Yield v. Goldman Sachs, 1:10-cv-04537,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, raised $1.15 billion of interest-free financing
from its first sale of convertible bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senior notes, which don&#8217;t pay a coupon and will be
redeemed at face value, can be handed over for shares when
Microsoft stock rises to about $33.40, a 33 percent increase
from June 8, according to a statement. The bonds, which Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft may redeem in cash, stock or both,
can&#8217;t be converted until March 2013 except in &#8220;certain
circumstances,&#8221; and they mature in June that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is the only issuer of convertible bonds with a
top rating from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s,
allowing it to benefit from investors seeking to boost the
average credit rankings of their funds. Convertible bonds are
typically sold by companies that are unrated or graded below
BBB-, the lowest investment grade, by SP and Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Really, with the zero coupon this didn&#8217;t look that
attractive to us,&#8221; said Anja Eijking, who manages the
equivalent of about $2 billion in global equity-linked
securities at FC Netherlands BV in Amsterdam and didn&#8217;t order
the bonds. &#8220;You&#8217;d need a strong view on the stock appreciating.
Basically, this is cheap financing for the issuer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. will carry Walt Disney
Co.&#8217;s ESPN 3-D channel on its pay-television service, allowing
customers to watch World Cup soccer matches in 3-D starting this
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The channel will be available to ATT TV subscribers who
purchase a 3-D technology package for an extra $10 a month, the
companies said. ESPN 3-D will debut June 11 with the first FIFA
World Cup match featuring South Africa against Mexico, and will
show 25 games throughout the tournament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to ATT, ESPN 3-D has deals with Comcast Corp.,
the largest U.S. cable provider, and DirecTV, the largest U.S.
satellite-TV operator, to broadcast the channel. The network is
available to Comcast and DirecTV high-definition customers for
no additional fee. DirecTV has provided its customers with a
download to make its set-top boxes compatible for 3-D coverage,
while Comcast requires that customers upgrade to a HD-DVR box
with more bandwidth at no extra cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content distributors, programmers and set makers are racing
to increase 3-D offerings after last year&#8217;s 3-D epic &#8220;Avatar&#8221;
became the highest-grossing movie of all time. This month,
DirecTV plans to start three dedicated 3-D channels, sponsored
by Panasonic Corp. Sony Corp. has teamed with Discovery
Communications and IMAX for a 3-D channel to air next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, few people can watch anything in 3-D at home today.
About 2.5 million U.S. homes will have 3-D capable television
sets this year, according to U.K.-based research firm
FutureSource Consulting, though that figure is projected to
climb to 60 million by 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World Cup Spotlight &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s not that many 3-D TVs out there at all, so it&#8217;ll
be interesting to see how pay-TV operators deal with the
emerging format,&#8221; said Derek Baine, an analyst at cable-TV
researcher SNL Kagan. &#8220;Everybody is going to be watching how
ESPN executes the World Cup coverage -- all eyes are on them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN is confident about the quality of its 3-D programming
and distribution, David Preschlack, an executive vice president,
said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re bullish on distribution moving forward,&#8221; said
Preschlack. &#8220;To bet against 3-D is to bet against technology,
and that&#8217;s not a bet that has been won over time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preschlack compared 3-D to where high-definition was five
years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;3-D is very much the preeminent technological innovation
in the industry and provides a better, differentiated fan
experience,&#8221; said Preschlack. &#8220;Our goal is to serve sports
fans the best we can and we&#8217;re executing on that mission with
the launch of ESPN 3-D.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X-Games, Home Run Derby &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT began selling its U-verse TV service in 2006 and had
2.3 million subscribers at the end of March. The Dallas-based
company budgeted $7 billion from 2004 to 2008 to upgrade its
network to compete with cable companies such as Comcast, which
offers packages of TV, telephone and Internet service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN 3-D won&#8217;t be on the dial 24 hours a day, like ESPN
Classic or ESPN2. It will only be on air for scheduled events
like the World Cup, the X-Games, college football&#8217;s ACC
Championship and college basketball&#8217;s Big East Tournament. The
day after the World Cup ends, on July 12, ESPN 3-D will be
airing Major League Baseball&#8217;s Home Run Derby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish Network Corp. and Time Warner Cable Inc., the third-
and fourth-largest U.S. pay-TV providers, have yet to make a
deal with ESPN 3-D. Cable operators Cox Communications Inc. and
Cablevision Systems Corp. haven&#8217;t yet signed on either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable spokeswoman Maureen Huff said the company
has had conversations with ESPN 3-D, as has Cox, according to
spokesman David Grabert. Satellite operator Dish has also spoken
with the content provider, said spokeswoman Francie Bauer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT fell 7 cents to $24.90 at 4:02 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock has lost 11 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liechtenstein is luring wealthy
Britons by offering them the chance to &#8220;come clean&#8221; on unpaid
taxes, while lawmakers in neighboring Switzerland attempt to
block the handover of suspected tax evaders to U.S. authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British citizens with accounts in Liechtenstein who
disclose assets to the U.K. face penalties of as little as 25
percent of the usual amount, said Olivier de Perregaux, chief
financial officer of LGT Group, the principality&#8217;s biggest bank.
U.K. tax authorities expect to net revenue of 1 billion pounds
($1.46 billion) from the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liechtenstein has held talks with the U.S., France, Germany
and Italy about similar arrangements as Crown Prince Alois, who
surveys his Alpine realm from a 12th-century castle in the
capital Vaduz, sees growing interest in the deal. Swiss banks,
seeking to retain the biggest share of the world&#8217;s offshore
wealth, are proposing a tax that would allow them to keep their
clients&#8217; identities secret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A number of Swiss banks are completely in denial,&#8221; said
Philip Marcovici, a lawyer who helped draft the Liechtenstein
accord. &#8220;A younger generation may think of Switzerland as the
place where my grandmother used to hide her money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland&#8217;s lower house rejected a settlement this week
that would require the government to hand over data on as many
as 4,450 UBS AG clients to U.S. tax officials. The decision
opens the door for further talks between both parliamentary
chambers. A final vote is scheduled for June 18. Failure to back
the treaty may result in the U.S. pursuing charges against
Zurich-based UBS, the country&#8217;s largest bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Zumwinkel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liechtenstein started to unwind secrecy after data stolen
from LGT, the bank owned by the royal family, was used by
Germany to prosecute tax evaders in 2008. Former Deutsche Post
AG CEO Klaus Zumwinkel was convicted of tax evasion and received
a two-year suspended prison sentence plus a penalty of 1 million
euros ($1.2 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Client assets in Liechtenstein fell 30 percent in 2008 as
financial markets slumped, the biggest decline since the
nation&#8217;s banking association began keeping records 13 years
earlier. The drop spurred authorities to devise a plan to rescue
a financial-services industry that accounts for one-third of the
economy and employs almost 2,000 people out of a population of
35,600 German speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Only after the Zumwinkel case was it possible to say that
we have a problem and that we need a quick solution,&#8221; said
Michael Lauber, chairman of Liechtenstein&#8217;s financial regulator.
&#8220;It has been like day and night.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;More Innovative&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the agreement, which Liechtenstein says exceeds
standards set by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, British clients have until the end of March 2015 to
make a voluntary disclosure or their accounts in the
principality will be shut. Penalties for the past decade will be
capped at 10 percent of taxes evaded and may be as high as 30
percent for tax years following April 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While one in 20 of the principality&#8217;s existing clients are
British, the deal is open to any U.K. taxpayer who opens an
account in Liechtenstein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Liechtenstein has to be more innovative and forward-
looking than other financial centers,&#8221; said Katja Gey, who
helped negotiate the deal for the Liechtenstein government. &#8220;We
have made offers along these lines to Germany, the U.S., France
and Italy, though we haven&#8217;t yet had official negotiations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers in Liechtenstein have reported asset gains
since the accord was signed last August, said de Perregaux of
LGT. Investment funds reported a 41 percent increase in assets
under management to 37.3 billion Swiss francs ($33 billion) last
year and assets at the principality&#8217;s banks climbed 3.5 percent
to 125.1 billion francs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promoted as Model &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The innovative approach has certainly helped our
international reputation,&#8221; said de Perregaux, adding that
inflows from British clients are helping counter withdrawals
from clients in Germany. &#8220;Liechtenstein is now promoted as a
model.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liechtenstein, whose financial industry helps to generate
the world&#8217;s highest per capita income, is using roadshows to
promote the agreement in the U.K., said Alois, 41, who trained
at the British Army&#8217;s Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it takes another few months to
achieve full speed,&#8221; Alois said in a May 27 interview from
Vaduz. &#8220;We have clients who inherited this problem and want to
come clean.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. expects voluntary disclosures to accelerate as
Liechtenstein banks demand evidence of tax compliance, according
to an e-mailed statement from the HM Revenue  Customs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Favorable Terms &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The long-term benefit to HMRC is improved U.K. tax
compliance for Liechtenstein investors and increased tax
receipts from those wishing to benefit from the favorable
disclosure terms,&#8221; the tax authority said in the statement,
without providing figures for revenue collected during the past
nine months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The costs of hiring a U.K. accountant to undertake book-
keeping for back taxes means the arrangement makes most sense
for &#8220;wealthy clients,&#8221; said Clemens Laternser, managing
director of the Liechtenstein Association of Professional
Trustees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There could be problems in the end, if clients don&#8217;t want
to disclose or can&#8217;t give proof that they are tax compliant,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You probably need to get rid of clients who you
worked with for 10 or 20 years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Liechtenstein &#8220;had no choice,&#8221; it has gained a head
start on Switzerland, according to Adolf Real, chairman of the
principality&#8217;s bankers association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland agreed March 13, 2009, a day after
Liechtenstein, to cooperate with countries investigating tax
evasion to avoid being blacklisted as a tax haven by the OECD.
The decision came a month after the U.S. sued UBS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unrealistic Approach &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Switzerland lost maybe two years in this discussion,&#8221;
Real said. &#8220;They have a way to go because they&#8217;ve not come up
with any ideas that would put Switzerland in advance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland&#8217;s private bankers association, which represents
Pictet  Cie, Lombard Odier  Cie and Wegelin  Co., says
Liechtenstein&#8217;s deal with the U.K. is an &#8220;isolated bilateral
act&#8221; and isn&#8217;t a model for others to follow. &#8220;It&#8217;s
unrealistic for banks to demand proof&#8221; that a client has paid
taxes back home, the association said in its annual report
published last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss banks, which manage about 27 percent of the world&#8217;s
privately held offshore wealth, have proposed a withholding tax
where client identities would remain secret. The lack of
transparency doesn&#8217;t meet OECD standards, HMRC said in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Big Picture&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax on interest, dividends, capital gains and
investment income could raise &#8220;billions per year&#8221; for foreign
governments, according to the Swiss Bankers Association, which
counts UBS, Credit Suisse Group AG and Julius Baer Group Ltd.
among its members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Liechtenstein&#8217;s solution sets an example, Switzerland
probably can&#8217;t go &#8220;the same way,&#8221; said Urs Roth, president of
the association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you look at the big picture, yes, it is a model for
Switzerland because this is a point in time when you go for tax
compliant wealth,&#8221; Roth said during a May 26 interview in
Vaduz. &#8220;Countries will find different ways.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks are under way with Germany over the withholding tax,
Swiss Economy Minister Doris Leuthard said last week, adding
that the reaction of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble
was &#8220;fairly positive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a risk that the Swiss banks are left behind, said
Marcovici, who is also CEO of the Zurich-based training arm of
law firm Baker  McKenzie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Switzerland seems to be failing miserably at leading the
world on what is a global issue, not a Swiss issue,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Swiss banks have this false impression that somehow after the
financial crisis governments will forget about this. That&#8217;s
nonsense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. is shuttering five
ESPN Zone restaurants, saying the economics of the business
became too challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations in Baltimore, Chicago, Las Vegas, New York and
Washington will close June 16, ESPN said today in an e-mailed
statement. The cable sports network is controlled by Burbank,
California-based Disney, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN Zone is a sports-themed restaurant chain started 12
years ago by Disney. It will stay open in Los Angeles and
Anaheim, California, where the restaurants are run by Anschutz
Entertainment Group and Zone Enterprises, ESPN said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a very difficult decision to make&#8221; Rick
Alessandri, senior vice president at the cable sports network,
said in an interview. &#8220;But it was the right decision to make.&#8221;
It comes as Disney is opening a new retail store in New York&#8217;s
Times Square. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each restaurant was split into three sections, according to
Disney regulatory filings: a &#8220;studio grill&#8221; for dining, a
&#8220;screening room&#8221; for watching ESPN sports coverage and a
&#8220;sports arena&#8221; for playing interactive games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurants averaged about 30,000 square feet, large by
industry standards, Alessandri said. The 50,000-square-foot
location in Times Square was the biggest, and the restaurant in
Baltimore was the chain&#8217;s first, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN wouldn&#8217;t release revenue or other financial
information about the chain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, gained 22 cents
to $33.37 at 2:12 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Before today, the shares had climbed 2.8 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc hired William Ringo, a
former Pfizer Inc. strategy chief and Eli Lilly  Co. executive,
as a senior adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ringo, 64, will introduce bankers at Barclays Capital, the
London-based lender&#8217;s investment-banking unit, to his industry
contacts and help sharpen bankers&#8217; pitches to life-sciences
companies, he said in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a terrific opportunity,&#8221; said Ringo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ringo spent 28 years at Lilly, where he ran various
divisions of the Indianapolis-based drugmaker. Later, he was
chief executive officer of Abgenix Inc. and sold the
biotechnology company to Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen
Inc. in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ringo joined Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, in 2008
to run business development, strategy and innovation. He helped
the New York-based company buy Wyeth for $68 billion and created
a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline to combat HIV before
leaving Pfizer in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ringo said he heard a lot of proposals from investment
bankers at his Pfizer job and that many sounded the same --
laundry lists of potential partnership or acquisition targets.
He said he&#8217;ll use his background to help Barclays bankers stand
out from competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bill&#8217;s hands-on experience enables us to offer clients a
unique perspective,&#8221; said Richard Landgarten, co-head of
Barclays&#8217; health-care business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health-Care Reforms &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank was the sixth-biggest adviser on health-care
mergers in the last 12 months, counseling Abbott Laboratories on
its purchase of Solvay SA&#8217;s drug unit for 4.5 billion euros
($5.4 billion) and Warner Chilcott Plc on the acquisition of
Procter  Gamble Co.&#8217;s pharmaceuticals unit for $3.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays expects changes in the health-care industry to
drive more deals this year, said Landgarten&#8217;s co-head, Patrick McMullan, including the U.S. health-care reform legislation and
the expiration of patents covering some of the pharmaceuticals
industry&#8217;s biggest-selling drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the pharmaceutical sector, in particular, the business
model&#8217;s got to change,&#8221; McMullan said. &#8220;Bill&#8217;s going to help
us think through some of those things.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays&#8217; other senior advisers include Jeb Bush, the
former governor of Florida. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA, Telefonica SA and
Megacable Holdings SAB bid 884 million pesos ($69.1 million) for
the right to use fiber-optic cables that stretch across Mexico,
presenting a threat to Carlos Slim&#8217;s Telefonos de Mexico SAB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three companies, bidding jointly as the sole qualified
participant in the auction, placed the minimum bid required, the
Communications and Transportation Ministry said today on its
website. The companies said last month they plan to spend an
additional 1.3 billion pesos to prepare the fiber for use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mexican government designed the auction to boost
competition against Telmex, the country&#8217;s biggest phone company.
The winning bidders will be able to use the fiber to route long-
distance voice and Internet traffic across the country instead
of paying Telmex, the only provider of such services in some
parts of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiber lines are owned by the state-controlled power
company, Comision Federal de Electricidad. The communications
ministry is scheduled today to officially declare the auction
winner after reviewing the group&#8217;s bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megacable, Telefonica and Televisa will each control one-
third of the network&#8217;s capacity and will compete with each
other, offering routing services to other telecommunications
providers, Megacable Chief Executive Officer Enrique Yamuni said
last month in a news conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megacable, based in Guadalajara, Mexico, is the country&#8217;s
largest cable carrier. Madrid-based Telefonica is Mexico&#8217;s
second-largest mobile-phone company and has a stake in fixed-
line carrier Grupo de Telecomunicaciones Mexicanas SA, which
competes with Telmex. Mexico City-based Televisa, the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, controls three Mexican
cable operators that sell phone and Internet service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. agreed to set up
an investment banking joint venture in China with First Capital
Securities Co., paving the way for the U.S. bank to manage
domestic share sales in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shenzhen-based First Capital and JPMorgan signed the
agreement today following a memorandum of understanding in March,
the New York-based company said in a press release today. The
venture, to be 33 percent owned by JPMorgan, requires regulatory
approval, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the world&#8217;s biggest manager of equity sales this
year, aims to close the gap with rivals in China including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG after having lagged behind
in forming ventures. Tying up with a local firm is a
prerequisite for arranging share sales in China, the world&#8217;s
biggest market for initial public offerings in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG last year won approval to form a venture
with Shanxi Securities Co. Credit Suisse Group AG cleared the
hurdle in 2008. CSLA Asia-Pacific Markets&#8217;s securities venture
also won approval to offer brokerage services that year, after
operating in the country for about five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Capital, established a decade ago, offers corporate
finance, fixed income, merger-and-acquisition, securities
brokerage and asset management services. It has branches in 12
Chinese cities, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest IPO Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies raised 209 billion yuan ($31 billion) in IPOs in
Shanghai and Shenzhen last year, making China the world&#8217;s
biggest market for first-time stock sales even after the
securities regulator blocked offerings in the first half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spent four years in failed talks with Bohai
Securities Co. and Liaoning Securities Co., Asia-Pacific Chief
Executive Officer Gaby Abdelnour said in a March 2 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank now has asset management and futures and options
ventures and operates a locally incorporated bank in China. It
must wait five-years to qualify for a brokerage license under
rules set by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Capital was ranked 33rd among underwriters in China
last year after it arranged 6.76 billion yuan in stock and bond
sales, according to the Securities Association of China. The
ranking made the firm eligible to form a partnership with a
foreign bank, under the nation&#8217;s securities laws. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Pfizer
Inc. ended a trial of an experimental blood thinner after a
panel found &#8220;clear evidence&#8221; the drug, apixaban,  helped
reduce stroke risk in patients with irregular heart beats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The independent review panel deemed apixaban more effective
than aspirin in preventing strokes and embolism in patients with
atrial fibrillation who can&#8217;t take blood thinners such as
warfarin, the companies said in a joint statement today. The
study, dubbed Averroes, was stopped early, after the interim
review, and covered 5,600 patients in 36 countries, the
companies said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood thinner is among five drugs for which Bristol-
Myers is seeking Food and Drug Administration approval by 2012,
the company said in March. Johnson  Johnson, Bayer AG and
Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH sell similar medicines in Europe to
prevent blood clots and are waiting for clearance in the U.S.
The companies are vying for a global market that may reach $20
billion by 2012, according to Datamonitor, a London-based
research company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Averroes study was conducted by the Population Health
Research Institute of McMaster University and Hamilton Health
Sciences, based in Hamilton, Ontario. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institute will announce the findings and publish them
once the analysis is complete, the Bristol-Myers and Pfizer
said. Both companies are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President
Gary Cohn said he sees no signs of a resolution to the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud claims against the
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no indications of anything at this point,&#8221; Cohn
told reporters at a conference in Montreal today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn&#8217;s comments follow news that the SEC is probing a
second Goldman Sachs collateralized debt obligation in addition
to the Abacus transaction at the center of the SEC&#8217;s suit. Asked
about the new investigation, Cohn, 49, told reporters: &#8220;I read
it in the newspaper this morning, like you did.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock fell as much as 4 percent today to
its lowest in more than a year after a person familiar with the
matter said the SEC is looking into the firm&#8217;s 2006 sale of a
CDO called Hudson Mezzanine. While the inquiries may not lead to
any action, the news came less than a week after the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission subpoenaed New York-based Goldman
Sachs for information and an Australian hedge fund sued the
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares fell $3.03, or 2.2 percent, at $133.77 as of
4:25 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after
dropping as low as $131.30. The last time the shares closed
below $132 was on May 13, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has fallen for six straight days, the longest
losing streak since October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telefonica SA, Grupo Televisa SA and
Megacable Holdings SAB won the rights to use the Mexican
government&#8217;s fiber-optic lines, creating more competition
against billionaire Carlos Slim&#8217;s Telefonos de Mexico SAB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three companies bid 884 million pesos ($69.4 million)
for cables that can push voice and Internet traffic across the
country, the Communications and Transportation Ministry said on
its website. The companies plan to spend an additional 1.3
billion pesos to prepare the fiber for use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lines will allow each company to transport its
customers&#8217; traffic and to offer routing services to other
communications providers instead of paying Telmex, the country&#8217;s
biggest phone carrier. With the fiber lines, the companies can
boost their Internet speeds, Televisa Executive Vice President
Alfonso de Angoitia told reporters today in Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies will offer &#8220;very competitive&#8221; terms for
other communications operators that want to use the fiber to
transport phone calls, data and video, said Francisco Gil Diaz,
executive president for Mexico and Central America at
Telefonica. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now there will be competition,&#8221; Gil Diaz said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
something that we&#8217;ve very much lacked in this country.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiber lines are owned by the state-controlled power
company, Comision Federal de Electricidad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. fell to the
lowest in more than a year in New York trading after reports
that the Securities and Exchange Commission is probing the
firm&#8217;s $2 billion Hudson Mezzanine collateralized debt
obligation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell $4.87, or 3.6 percent, to $131.93 at
12:58 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. That&#8217;s
the lowest since May 13, 2009. The stock, which has slid 22
percent this year, was the only company in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Financial Index to decline today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hudson deal, sold in 2006, is the target of a probe by
the SEC, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, the
second investigation into a CDO sold by the New York-based firm.
The inquiry may not lead to any additional actions against
Goldman Sachs, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the investigation isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment, as did SEC spokesman John Nester. The Financial Times
reported the probe yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares have fallen 28 percent since the SEC
filed a fraud lawsuit against the firm on April 16 related to
its 2007 sale of a CDO called Abacus. The firm called the suit
unfounded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. are seeking to unload as much as $5 billion in
debt left over from the 2007 buyout of Hilton Worldwide,
according to people familiar with the negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks may package into securities a $3 billion piece of
a mortgage taken out by Blackstone Group LP to finance its
acquisition of the hotel chain in 2007, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the discussions are private.
The banks are marketing more than $2 billion in mezzanine debt
to precede the bond offering, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are attempting to clear their books of borrowings
tied to the Hilton buyout as Wall Street tries to revive the
market for commercial mortgage-backed securities. Less than $1
billion of the debt has been sold this year, compared with
$232.4 billion in 2007 when sales peaked, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A lack of new issues and excess cash to
invest should translate to strong demand, said Sam Chandan of
Real Capital Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Significant equity has been raised with an eye toward
distressed commercial real estate,&#8221; said Chandan, chief
economist at the New York-based research firm. &#8220;That capital
has grown frustrated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danielle Robinson, a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, and Michael DuVally, a spokesman
for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$26 Billion Purchase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone, the world&#8217;s largest private-equity firm, bought
Hilton in July 2007 near the top of the real estate market for
about $26 billion, including assumed debt. Blackstone announced
the deal just weeks before credit markets collapsed, freezing
the private-equity industry for more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction was financed with $20.6 billion of mortgage
and mezzanine debt and about $5.7 billion of equity from New
York-based Blackstone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve also holds Hilton debt among assets
assumed from the collapse of Bear Stearns Cos. The investment
management arm of General Electric Co. owns a $1.3 billion
portion of the mortgage, according to the people familiar with
the debt-sale negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell Wilkerson, a spokesman for GE Capital, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hilton in April completed a deal to reduce debt by almost
$4 billion and extend its maturity to November 2015. The company
bought back and retired $1.8 billion of debt and converted $2.1
billion of junior mezzanine debt to preferred equity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone, KKR  Co. and Apollo Global Management LLC have
undertaken debt-for-equity swaps or other restructuring efforts
at companies they bought during the record $1.6 trillion buyout
boom that stretched from 2005 to 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Paulson&#8217;s Paulson  Co. last week agreed to exchange
debt to acquire a 9.9 percent equity stake in Harrah&#8217;s
Entertainment Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest casino company. Apollo
and TPG Capital agreed to buy Harrah&#8217;s in 2006 for $27.2
billion, including assumed debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale SA disputed
assertions by former trader Jerome Kerviel that his desk&#8217;s
proximity to co-workers and supervisors meant they knew he was
exceeding his group&#8217;s trading limits and faking hedges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Societe Generale today showed the court a short
film taken May 21 of a sixth-floor trading desk at the Paris
headquarters of France&#8217;s second-largest bank by market value to
show how the desks are grouped and the amount of data displayed
on their computer screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel&#8217;s immediate neighbor &#8220;would had to have watched
all day to understand the totality&#8221; of what he was doing, said
Claire Dumas, a deputy to the bank&#8217;s head of operational risk.
Nonetheless &#8220;it is certainly possible to see the screens next
to you,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel, charged with abuse of trust, faking documents and
computer hacking in relation to a 4.9 billion-euro ($5.9
billion) trading loss, said when the trial opened June 8 that he
&#8220;hid nothing&#8221; from the bank when taking positions in European
stock market index futures. Kerviel, 33, worked for Societe
Generale for seven years, becoming a trader in 2005. The bank
disclosed his unauthorized bets in January 2008, with then-Chief
Executive Officer Daniel Bouton calling him a &#8220;terrorist.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dumas, a member of the team that caught Kerviel, said the
bank gave &#8220;maximum responsibility&#8221; to traders during the day
to track their results and risk using a function she compared
with a car&#8217;s speedometer, with an end-of-the-day check by the
bank to verify where they were. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a question from Kerviel&#8217;s lawyer Olivier
Metzner about intra-day monitoring, Dumas said, &#8220;it was not
operationally possible&#8221; to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Respecting the limits is written in the regulations,&#8221;
Dumas said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s witnesses are primarily fellow traders and
assistants from the bank. The trial is scheduled to end June 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel faces as many as five years in jail and 375,000
euros in fines if found guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congo, Gecamines Challenge Vulture Fund Claim to $116 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congo began a legal challenge over an injunction won by a
distressed debt investor that may cost the country more than
$100 million because of its failure to repay money owed for a
1980s-era building project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FG Hemisphere Associates LLC, a New York-based investment
fund, obtained the injunction in March 2009 on payments to
Gecamines, Congo&#8217;s state-owned mining company, by Groupement de
Terrils de Lubumbashi. Gecamines owns 20 percent of GTL. The
legal challenge, which began June 8, is being heard in Jersey in
the Channel Islands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calixthe Mukasa, the acting director of Gecamines, didn&#8217;t
answer several calls to his mobile phone, nor did he respond to
text messages and e-mails requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FG Hemisphere is trying to collect a debt it bought in 2004
from Energoinvest d.d., a Sarajevo-based company that won two
arbitration cases against Congo at the International Chamber of
Commerce over unpaid loans for the construction project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 11, Congo owed FG Hemisphere $116 million in
principal, interest, penalties and arbitration expenses,
according to a Jersey Court of Appeal decision in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OM Group Inc., the Cleveland-based majority owner of GTL,
&#8220;doesn&#8217;t believe that the Royal Court of Jersey has
jurisdiction over the assets of GTL, including payments to
Gecamines,&#8221; according to OMG&#8217;s first-quarter report for 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since buying the debt, FG Hemisphere has frozen millions of
dollars owed to Congo through court cases around the world in an
attempt to enforce the ICC&#8217;s arbitral award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jersey hearing is expected to continue throughout this
week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sued by Hedge Fund Basis Over Timberwolf CDO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is being sued by Basis Capital, an
Australian hedge fund company that lost money in mortgage-linked
securities, said Eric Lewis, the lawyer for Basis Capital&#8217;s
Basis Yield Alpha Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complaint in which Basis Capital asks for more than $1
billion in damages was filed yesterday in federal court in New
York, according to a press release and a copy of the complaint.
The suit&#8217;s filing couldn&#8217;t immediately be confirmed in the
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is over Goldman&#8217;s sale of the &#8220;now notorious
Timberwolf collateralized debt obligation,&#8221; Basis said in its
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman was pressuring investors to take the risk of
toxic securities off its books with knowingly false sales
pitches,&#8221; the news release said. &#8220;Goldman should be called to
account.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in a statement, &#8220;The lawsuit is a
misguided attempt by Basis, a hedge fund that was one of the
world&#8217;s most experienced CDO investors, to shift its investment
losses to Goldman Sachs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Basis Yield v. Goldman Sachs, 1:10-cv-04537,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wachovia Sued by Normandy Hill Over Le-Nature&#8217;s Loan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s Wachovia Capital Markets LLC was sued
for allegedly failing to disclose signs of fraud at Le-Nature&#8217;s
Inc. as it arranged a $285 million loan two months before the
drink maker went bankrupt in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor Normandy Hill Master Fund LP said it bought some
of the debt on the secondary market starting in 2008 and has a
current claim valued &#8220;well in excess of $10 million,&#8221;
according to the complaint it filed yesterday in New York state
Supreme Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le-Nature&#8217;s, based in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, made bottled
water, tea and other flavored drinks. Gregory Podlucky, the
company&#8217;s founder, and others were indicted in September on
charges he duped creditors out of more than $800 million by
overstating company revenue. Wachovia relied on the false
financial statements when it arranged the $285 million loan, the
indictment said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wachovia &#8220;knew about Le-Nature&#8217;s improper practices and
struggling finances long before completion of the September 1,
2006 credit facility, yet chose to press forward with the loan
and its syndication,&#8221; according to Normandy&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, which completed the acquisition of Wachovia in
2009, had no immediate comment on the suit, said spokeswoman
Alexandra Ball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Normandy Hill v. Wachovia, 650548/2010, New
York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Charges 13 in &#8216;Boiler Room&#8217; Stock Operation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen people, including one allegedly involved in the
Bonanno organized crime family, were charged in an indictment
accusing them of operating an illegal &#8220;boiler room&#8221; in a $12
million fraud scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Kimmel, who claimed to be a former employee of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, was among the
defendants charged in a decades-long scheme, prosecutors in the
office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said
yesterday in an indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2000 to this year, the 13 defendants operated a boiler
room, located on West 36th Street in Midtown Manhattan, that was
alternately called Powercom Energy Services Corp. and Empire
Energy Services Corp., the U.S. charged in the indictment. The
defendants include Anthony Guarino, who is a &#8220;soldier&#8221; in the
Bonanno crime family, said James Margolin, a spokesman for the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My client has been involved in a legitimate company for a
long time and there is no reason to think there is anything
wrong with them.&#8221; Matthew Mari, a lawyer for Guarino, said in a
telephone interview after court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The allegation that my client is a member of any crime
family is absolutely laughable nonsense,&#8221; Mari said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants were charged with inducing customers to buy
more than $12 million in stock in Realcast Corp., which
described itself on its website as an online live broadcast
provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimmel was the owner and chief executive officer of Miami-
based Realcast, prosecutors said. Realcast used Powercom and
Empire to solicit investors and sell shares, the U.S. said. The
defendants siphoned off almost half of investor&#8217;s money to pay
commissions to Powercom and Empire, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendants specifically targeted the elderly to
maximize the chances of getting away with their alleged scam,&#8221;
Bharara said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants are charged with conspiracy, securities
fraud and wire and mail fraud. Lawyers for the defendants
couldn&#8217;t be immediately be reached for comment. A voicemail
message left at Kimmel&#8217;s Realcast&#8217;s offices after business hours
wasn&#8217;t returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guarino was released on $1 million bond secured by $300,000
in cash, Mari said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All eight men arrested yesterday by FBI agents in New York
appeared before U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan
and entered not guilty pleas and were released on bond. Two
other men will surrender at a later date, Yusill Scribner, a
spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimmel, who was arrested in Miami, and another defendant
arrested in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, will appear in
federal courts in those states, Scribner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Griesa set the next hearing in the case for Sept. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Steven Kimmel, 10-CR-00476, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sands Singapore Casino Sued Over Lawyer Conference Mishaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Las Vegas Sands Corp.&#8217;s Singapore casino resort was sued by
organizers of the first conference it hosted for misrepresenting
a &#8220;complete disaster&#8221; as a world-class venue and for imposing
duress, fear and force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPBA 2010 Pte, on behalf of the Inter-Pacific Bar
Association conference, is asking the Singapore High Court to
assess damages for misrepresentation, breach of agreement and
Marina Bay Sands Pte&#8217;s conduct, according to a lawsuit filed
June 8. The case counters the casino&#8217;s suit over unpaid bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sands, controlled by billionaire Sheldon Adelson, promised
that the resort would be an &#8220;iconic venue&#8221; and open in a
&#8220;grand fashion with a full suite of facilities,&#8221; the
organizers of the May 2-5 conference said. Instead, power failed
during a speech by the chief justice of New South Wales,
Australia, and delegates complained of unfinished rooms,
shuttered facilities and misplaced luggage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegates were greeted by water leaking from the roof into
&#8220;unsightly&#8221; pails placed in the hotel lobby atrium. Some
guests had to be sheltered with umbrellas at the registration
counters. Others were locked into their rooms because of
malfunctioning latchkeys, the organizers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resort then threatened to &#8220;jeopardize&#8221; and withhold
services for the meeting unless it was paid in full, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the threats timed &#8220;to impose the maximum
duress, fear and force,&#8221; IPBA handed three checks to Marina Bay
Sands &#8220;under protest,&#8221; conference organizers said in their
filing. The bar association later stopped payment for two of the
checks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marina Bay Sands, built at a cost of $5.5 billion, sued
IPBA on May 14 for withholding payment of S$300,000 ($212,000). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expected them to counter, and we&#8217;ll be defending our
position very vigorously,&#8221; Michael Leven, Las Vegas Sands&#8217;
chief operating officer, said June 8 in a Bloomberg Television
interview in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of the problems were normal opening difficulties
that any property has, particularly one of that size,&#8221; Leven
said. &#8220;But we did have a convention of lawyers to start out
with, so we knew we were going to have some kind of
conversation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yap Wai Ming, chairman of the host committee for the IPBA
conference, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Marina Bay Sands Pte Ltd. v. IPBA 2010
Singapore Pte Ltd. S348/2010 in the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toyota California Lawsuits Will Be Coordinated in Los Angeles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty Toyota Motor Corp. lawsuits over alleged sudden
acceleration pending in California state court were ordered
coordinated before one judge in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Chief Justice Ronald M. George in a June 8 order
asked the presiding judge of the Los Angeles court to assign the
cases. George said it will be up to the coordinating trial judge
to decide whether the cases seeking damages for personal injury
or wrongful death should be managed separately from class-action
suits alleging economic loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota, the world&#8217;s largest carmaker, faces more than 300
lawsuits in state and federal Court over alleged sudden
acceleration of its vehicles. The California state court cases
include a class-action lawsuit brought by the Orange County
District Attorney and a lawsuit by the family of a state highway
patrol officer who died in a crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celeste Migliore, a spokeswoman for Toyota Motor Sales USA
in Torrance, California, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Toyota Motor Cases, JCCP4621, California
Superior Court, Los Angeles County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City, Adusbef Can Seek Damages for Milan Derivatives &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of Milan and Italian consumer group Adusbef can
seek damages from the four banks on trial for fraud over the
sale of derivatives to the municipality, Judge Oscar Magi said
in court yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge rejected requests from other consumer groups,
including Altroconsumo and Adusbef Lombardia, because they were
formed after June 2005, when the banks first sold derivatives to
the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, Depfa Bank Plc, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
UBS AG are on trial in Milan in the first criminal case in which
investment banks are being accused of deliberately misleading
cities on swaps. The firms and 11 bankers are charged with
fraud, and the banks are accused of earning 101 million euros
($120 million) by misleading Milan, Italy&#8217;s business capital.
Two former city officials are on trial for collusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge adjourned the trial to June 23. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothstein Gets 50 Years for $1.2 Billion Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former South Florida lawyer Scott Rothstein was sentenced
to 50 years in prison for using his law firm to run a $1.2
billion Ponzi scheme that financed a lavish lifestyle,
bankrolled his firm and bought political influence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Cohn sentenced Rothstein yesterday
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Rothstein, who turns 48 today,
pleaded guilty in January to two counts of wire fraud and three
conspiracy charges. He faced a maximum sentence of 100 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothstein sold investors discounted stakes in fraudulent
settlements of sexual-harassment and whistleblower lawsuits,
which ranged from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars,
he admitted in January. He told investors they would collect the
full proceeds when the cases settled. Rothstein took money from
new investors to pay back old ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothstein and unidentified co-conspirators created fake
settlement papers, bank statements and personal guarantees to
convince investors the scheme was real, he admitted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t expect your forgiveness,&#8221; Rothstein said,
reading from a prepared statement. &#8220;I do promise you that I
will do everything in my power to undo the terrible harm that I
caused.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothstein asked the judge for a sentence of 30 years, and
prosecutors requested 40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cooperated with prosecutors and participated in
&#8220;numerous undercover operations,&#8221; Rothstein said in a June 4
request for leniency. He didn&#8217;t disclose details. Prosecutors
said his &#8220;post-offense conduct has been extraordinary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Nurik, an attorney representing Rothstein, said he is
still cooperating with authorities and may request a sentence
reduction in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rothstein, 09-cr-60331, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palm Settles With Shareholder Challenging Buyout Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palm Inc., the money-losing handset maker, tentatively
settled a lawsuit filed by a shareholder who contended his stock
was undervalued in a planned $1.2 billion takeover by Hewlett-
Packard Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor Steve Ubaney sued Palm, based in Sunnyvale,
California, last month in Delaware Chancery Court claiming the
deal &#8220;unfairly favors&#8221; holders of preferred Series B shares.
Ubaney agreed to settle the suit in exchange for additional
information about the sale process, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palm denied any wrongdoing in a memorandum filed in court
yesterday, while saying it had made supplemental disclosures as
a result of the lawsuit and negotiations with the plaintiff&#8217;s
lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlement will not affect the amount of the merger
consideration&#8221; Palm stockholders will receive, the company said
in a filing yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard said in April it would buy palm for $5.70
per common share in cash, while Elevation Partners LP, Palm&#8217;s
biggest investor, stands to get $485 million for its preferred
shares and warrants under the proposal. The preferred stock is
priced at $8.50 a share. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rambus Appeals to Be Reheard in October, Court Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus Inc.&#8217;s patent-infringement claims against Hynix
Semiconductor Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. will have to be
reargued before a U.S. appeals court in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case will be heard Oct. 7 before the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, a clerk with the
court said yesterday. No reason was given for the need to rehear
the case. Former Chief Judge Paul Michel, who served on the
three-judge panel that heard the case in April, retired May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second time Rambus has been delayed in a key
ruling it has sought as part of its efforts to collect patent
royalties on high-speed computer-memory chips. The U.S.
International Trade Commission in Washington was scheduled to
rule on Rambus&#8217;s dispute with computer-graphics maker Nvidia
Corp. last month and instead said it wouldn&#8217;t decide until July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals are Micron Technology v. Rambus, 2009-1263, and
Hynix Semiconductor v. Rambus, 2009-1299, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower-court cases are
Micron Technology Inc. v. Rambus Inc., 00-cv-00792, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington) and Hynix
Semiconductor Inc. v. Rambus Inc., 00-cv-20905, U.S. District

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s $2
billion Hudson Mezzanine collateralized debt obligation, sold in
2006, is the target of a probe by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inquiry into the CDO may not lead to any additional
actions against the New York-based securities firm, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the investigation
isn&#8217;t public. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment, as did SEC spokesman John Nester. The
Financial Times reported the probe yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares have fallen 26 percent since the SEC
filed a fraud lawsuit against the firm on April 16 that related
to its 2007 sale of a CDO called Abacus. Senator Carl Levin, a
Michigan Democrat, said in April that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s sales of
CDOs such as Hudson raised &#8220;a real ethical issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ethical issue is valid, but Goldman isn&#8217;t the only
investment bank&#8221; that sold CDOs, said Ambrose Chang, a Hong
Kong-based fund manager at Daiwa SB Investments HK Ltd. &#8220;After
the financial crisis, all Wall Street banks&#8217; reputations have
been fundamentally damaged.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Abacus suit, the SEC said Goldman Sachs and one of
its employees, Fabrice Tourre, didn&#8217;t disclose to investors the
role played by hedge fund Paulson  Co. in devising and betting
against the securities. Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing on
the Abacus CDO and said it will fight the SEC&#8217;s case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge Fund Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDOs parcel fixed-income assets such as bonds or loans and
slice them into new securities of varying risks, providing
higher returns than other investments of the same rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate case, Goldman Sachs was sued by Australian
hedge fund Basis Capital for $1 billion. In the suit, filed
yesterday in Manhattan federal court, Basis claims it was forced
into insolvency after buying mortgage-linked securities that the
firm created and one of its executives termed &#8220;one shi**y deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lawsuit is a misguided attempt by Basis, a hedge fund
that was one of the world&#8217;s most experienced CDO investors, to
shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
led by Levin, released e-mails in April related to Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s mortgage-linked deals, including the Hudson Mezzanine
transaction. In one October 2006 e-mail, a Goldman Sachs
employee describes how the Hudson deal might be viewed by
investors as &#8220;junk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hudson Mezzanine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1 CDO contained credit default
swaps that referenced $2 billion in subprime, BBB-rated
residential mortgage-backed securities, according to the
documents released by Levin&#8217;s committee. While Goldman Sachs
selected the assets in the deal, the firm was also the only
investor buying credit protection on the entire transaction, the
documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold the Hudson CDO in late 2006,
near the time documents released by Levin show senior executives
wanted to reduce the firm&#8217;s exposure to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The CDO imploded within two years. Your clients lost;
Goldman profited,&#8221; Levin said in an April 27 hearing during
which he questioned Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein about the Hudson deal and other CDOs. &#8220;To go out and
sell these securities to people and then bet against those same
securities, it seems to me, is a fundamental conflict of
interest and is -- raises a real ethical issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein responded that &#8220;we are one of the largest client
franchises in market-making in these kinds of activities we&#8217;re
talking about&#8221; and that &#8220;they know our activities, and they
understand what market-making is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs was short on the Hudson Mezzanine CDO,
meaning it stood to gain from a collapse because of the credit
protection it had purchased, a marketing document for the deal
released by Levin&#8217;s committee states that &#8220;Goldman Sachs has
aligned incentives with the Hudson program.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a short sale, an investor bets the value of a security
will decline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hired law
firm Boies, Schiller  Flexner LLP to defend the company against
a $1 billion lawsuit filed by Australian hedge fund Basis
Capital this week, said a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law firm, founded by David Boies and Jonathan Schiller
in 1997, has handled Wall Street litigation including the Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy case. The person declined to
be identified because the hiring hasn&#8217;t been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, and Dawn Schneider at Boies, Schiller said they couldn&#8217;t
comment. Reuters reported the firm was hired earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The June 9 lawsuit by Basis Capital&#8217;s Basis Yield Alpha
Fund focuses on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s sale of the &#8220;now notorious
Timberwolf collateralized debt obligation,&#8221; Basis said in a
statement. The suit filed in Manhattan federal court says the
fund was forced into insolvency after buying mortgage-linked
securities created by Goldman Sachs, in what one of its own
executives described internally as a &#8220;shi**y deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boies, Schiller joins a growing list of firms providing
legal and regulatory advice to Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable firm in Wall Street history, which was sued by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in April over its marketing
of another CDO known as Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard H. Klapper at Sullivan  Cromwell LLP is among the
partners leading Goldman Sachs&#8217;s defense against the SEC
lawsuit. The firm also received advice ahead of a U.S. Senate
subcommittee hearing in April from K. Lee Blalack II of
O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP, who has worked as the subcommittee&#8217;s
chief counsel and staff director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skadden Arps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregory Craig, President Barack Obama&#8217;s former White House
counsel, is now the partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher 
Flom LLP assigned to advise Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Goldman Sachs considered hiring law firm Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison LLP to bolster its legal
team, before deciding against it, a person familiar with the
matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a June 9 statement about the Timberwolf lawsuit, Goldman
Sachs called it &#8220;a misguided attempt by Basis, a hedge fund
that was one of the world&#8217;s most experienced CDO investors, to
shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Basis Yield v. Goldman Sachs, 1:10-cv-04537,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks advanced, sending the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to the biggest weekly gain since
March, after National Semiconductor Corp. spurred a rally in
technology shares that helped the market overcome the largest
drop in American retail sales since September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Semiconductor, which makes parts used by Apple
Inc. and Research In Motion Ltd., climbed 5 percent as
technology companies in the SP 500 rose 1.1 percent. Microsoft
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, advanced 2.6 percent.
Pfizer Inc. increased 3.7 percent to lead gains in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average after a drug meant to prevent strokes proved
successful in a study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 increased 0.4 percent to 1,091.60 at 4 p.m. in
New York, extending its weekly gain to 2.5 percent. The index
wiped out a drop today of as much as 0.9 percent. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average rose 38.54 points, or 0.4 percent, to
10,211.07. Small companies rallied a third straight day, with
the Russell 2000 Index rising 1.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We probably had a negative overreaction on the economic
data in the morning,&#8221; said Richard Campagna, who helps oversee
$600 million as chief executive officer of 300 North Capital LLC
in Pasadena, California. &#8220;Tech and small-cap stocks did well
all day.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Index Futures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock futures retreated after the U.S. Commerce Department
said at 8:30 a.m. New York time that retail sales decreased 1.2
percent in May. Purchases were projected to increase 0.2
percent, according to the median estimate of 76 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Forecasts ranged from a decline of 0.7 percent
to a gain of 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities then rallied an hour and a half later after the
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of
consumer sentiment increased to 75.5, the highest level since
January 2008. The gauge was projected to rise to 74.5, according
to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 65
economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling consumer shares pushed the market lower before the
technology-stock rally helped power the SP 500 higher in the
final 25 minutes of trading. Volume of 7.6 billion shares on
U.S. stock exchanges was the lowest since April 6, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consumer confidence was quite a relief,&#8221; said James Paulsen, who helps oversee about $375 billion as chief
investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in
Minneapolis. &#8220;I&#8217;m still expecting a lot of volatility, though.
There are too many issues out there -- Europe, the oil spill.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to Back &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500, which surged 3 percent yesterday, completed
its second back-to-back rally since April today. The benchmark
index for U.S. stocks has fallen 10 percent since April 23 on
speculation the credit crisis spreading in Europe will curb
global economic growth. U.S.-traded shares of BP Plc plunged 44
percent since April 20, when the biggest oil leak in U.S.
history began at one of the firm&#8217;s wells in the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is hypersensitive to any negative data because
of the tug-of-war for market direction that exists right now,&#8221;
said Lawrence Creatura, a Rochester, New York-based fund manager
at Federated Investors Inc., which oversees $350 billion.
&#8220;Weaker-than-expected retail data is likely to be reflected in
lower share prices in the short term because of the macro
concern that the U.S. consumer will go back into a cocoon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest soda maker, fell 0.7
percent to 51.65 as a gauge of consumer companies declined 0.8
percent, the most of 10 industry groups in the SP 500. Philip
Morris International Inc., the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded
tobacco maker, lost 1.7 percent to $44.35. Procter  Gamble Co.
retreated 1.5 percent to $61.01. Home Depot Inc., the largest
U.S. home-improvement retailer, declined 1.5 percent to $32.22
for the biggest drop in the Dow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech Rallies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Semiconductor advanced 5 percent to $14.21 for the
third-biggest gain in the SP 500. The maker of analog chips
that control power in electronic devices forecast first-quarter
sales of at least $410 million in the first quarter, exceeding
the average analyst estimate of $394 million in a Bloomberg
survey. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained 0.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 2.6 percent to $25.66, leading the Standard
and Poor&#8217;s 500 Information Technology Index to the second-
biggest increase after materials producers among 10 industry
group in the benchmark index for U.S. equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, jumped 3.7 percent
to $15.46 for the biggest gain in the Dow. The drugmaker,
together with partner Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., ended a trial of
an experimental blood thinner after a panel found &#8220;clear
evidence&#8221; the drug, apixaban, helped reduce stroke risk in
patients with irregular heartbeats. Bristol-Myers rose 1.8
percent to $25.08 as a gauge of health-care stocks in the SP
500 gained 0.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP&#8217;s U.S. traded shares increased 3.6 percent to $33.97.
The largest oil and natural-gas producer in the Gulf of Mexico
was raised to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;sell&#8221; at Independent Research
GmbH. The company plans to defer its dividend to shareholders by
placing the money in an escrow account, the London-based Times
said, without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko Petroleum Corp., the Texas oil company that owns a
25 percent stake in BP&#8217;s well, rallied 6.7 percent to $41.79 for
the biggest gain in the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education stocks gained after Deutsche Bank AG said in a
note that a proposed rule aimed to limit for-profit colleges
from receiving federal financial aid, known as &#8220;gainful
employment,&#8221; may be &#8220;temporarily delayed,&#8221;, citing a
conversation with a Congressional staff. Apollo Group Inc., the
largest U.S. for-profit university, added 1.7 percent to $51.10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Paper Co. had the second-biggest gain in the
SP 500, adding 5.6 percent to $24.30. The world&#8217;s largest paper
and pulp maker was raised to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; at Longbow
Research. &lt;/p&gt;

to a court filing today. The purchase price wasn&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claims consist of commercial paper and a floating rate

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. are expected to lead General Motors Co.&#8217;s initial public
offering that may have the U.S. reducing its ownership as soon
as this year, people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least five investment banks competed to handle the sale,
which may be worth as much as $12 billion, making it the second-
largest in a decade. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, both based in
New York, would be responsible for writing the prospectus and
promoting the shares to potential investors, said two people who
asked not to be identified because the decision isn&#8217;t final. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning GM to public ownership will allow the U.S. to
reduce its 61 percent stake and harvest returns on its $50
billion investment in the nation&#8217;s largest automaker. Choosing a
lead bank in June means Detroit-based GM may hold an offering in
the fourth quarter, people familiar with the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government wants out as quickly as possible, but they
also want to tell the public it&#8217;s a good deal,&#8221; David Cole,
chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, said in an interview. &#8220;They will want to be out before
the presidential election in 2012.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Paustenbach, a spokesman for the Treasury, declined to
comment, citing a department statement yesterday that said
federal securities laws preclude it from discussing the identity
of potential underwriters before a registration statement is
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A GM
spokeswoman, Renee Rashid-Merem, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automotive Lending &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM Chief Executive Officer Ed Whitacre wants the company to
have an automotive-lending unit before going public, people
familiar with the plan have said. GM hasn&#8217;t had such a
subsidiary since former CEO Rick Wagoner sold 51 percent of GMAC
to private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said May 17 the
automaker&#8217;s first-quarter net profit of $865 million was a
&#8220;good, useful step&#8221; toward an initial offering. He said that
the stock sale may not come until 2011 and that it wouldn&#8217;t be
necessary to control a financing unit before going public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks&#8217; expected selection was reported earlier by the
Wall Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM&#8217;s choice will be &#8220;subject to Treasury&#8217;s agreement that
the selection is reasonable,&#8221; the government said yesterday in a
statement. The Treasury and GM are expected to sell shares, and
other holders may participate, the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPO Timing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the offering will depend on GM&#8217;s
profitability, the health of the economy and the state of
capital markets, said three people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will happen when the markets are ready and when the
company is ready,&#8221; Liddell said May 17 on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale may raise as much as $12 billion, an estimate by
Independent International Investment Research Plc showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM&#8217;s equity is worth $70 billion, according to a May 20
report by Eric Selle, a JPMorgan debt analyst who projects a
return of 47 cents on the dollar for holders of bonds issued by
GM&#8217;s predecessor, General Motors Corp., that will be converted
to stock and warrants in new GM. At today&#8217;s bond prices, GM&#8217;s
implied equity value is about $47 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1999, four U.S. IPOs have exceeded $5 billion -- Visa
Inc.&#8217;s $19.7 billion deal in 2008, ATT Wireless Group&#8217;s $10.6
billion offering in 2000, Kraft Foods Inc.&#8217;s $8.68 billion deal
in 2001 and United Parcel Service Inc.&#8217;s $5.47 billion sale in
1999, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the sale hasn&#8217;t been determined yet, said one
person familiar with the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankruptcy Emergence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM emerged from bankruptcy in July with its ownership split
between the old bondholders, the U.S., Canada and a trust to
cover health care for union retirees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government&#8217;s current net investment in the
automaker is $42.2 billion, according to a senior official in
President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration. GM has repaid $6.7
billion in loans and paid $600 million in interest and
dividends. The U.S. also holds $2.1 billion in the company&#8217;s
preferred shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When we did this restructuring we never expected a full
recovery of our investment,&#8221; Steven Rattner, the former head of
Obama&#8217;s automotive task force, said May 10 in Detroit. &#8220;If it
ends up costing us $10 billion, we should consider it a
success.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Treasury to break even, the value of GM would need
to rise to about $80 billion after bondholders and the UAW&#8217;s
health-care trust exercise stock warrants that dilute the U.S.
ownership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lazard Advice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury has hired Lazard Ltd. for $500,000 a month to
advise on selling its stake, according to a document on the
department&#8217;s website. Evercore Partners Inc. also is advising GM
on the selection, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM and Treasury officials met with senior executives from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc.,
JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley last month in Washington about
hiring a lead bank, said one person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury said yesterday that it will determine the
underwriters&#8217; fees, which finance professors at Cornell
University and Georgetown estimate may be as low as 2 percent.
That would be less than any U.S. IPO over $5 billion since 1999,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;General Motors is a government entity now, and the banks
that may underwrite the deal were government entities or got
help from the government,&#8221; said William Smith, president of New
York-based Smith Asset Management, which used to own shares of
GM. &#8220;I imagine with the IPO they&#8217;ll do the politically correct
thing and keep fees down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing a lead underwriter now allows GM to file an S-1
initial registration form as soon as July and sell shares in
October or November, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM management has been preparing for an IPO so they will be
ready whenever the timing is right, said a GM executive who
asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitacre was installed as chairman by Obama&#8217;s task force
when it replaced more than half of the directors in July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. sold $716.3
million of bonds backed by commercial mortgages in the second
offering of the debt this year, according to a person familiar
with the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest top-rated portion, maturing in 4.53 years,
yields 140 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
aren&#8217;t public. The AAA rated slice maturing in about 9.53 years
yields 165 basis points over the benchmark, the person said. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of commercial-mortgage backed securities halted in
2008 as credit markets froze, choking off funding to property
borrowers. Even with government aid, only $3.04 billion of the
debt was issued last year, compared with $11.2 billion in 2008
and a record $232.4 billion in 2007, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC sold $309.7 million of the
bonds in April, the first issue to pool loans from multiple
borrowers since June 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-rated securities tied to commercial property loans
yield about 3.04 percentage points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, compared with 2.19 percentage points over Treasuries
on April 16, then a 22-month low, according to Barclays Plc
data. Spreads have widened on concern that the European
sovereign debt crisis may slow global economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poland&#8217;s Treasury Ministry will
allow CEZ AS of the Czech Republic, GDF Suez SA of France, PGE
SA of Poland and two other bidders to conduct due diligence on
Energa SA, the country&#8217;s fourth-largest power utility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A consortium comprising Goldman Sachs Group Inc. funds and
Kulczyk Holding SA, controlled by Polish billionaire Jan
Kulczyk, made the short list, as did Energeticky a Prujmyslovy
Holding AS, the Treasury Ministry said on its website today,
without giving a value for the sale. The stake may sell for as
much as $1.6 billion, according to Pawel Puchalski, head of
equity research at Bank Zachodni WBK SA in Warsaw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week the ministry said eight companies had placed
initial offers. Poland is selling 83 percent of Energa as part
of its plan to get as much as $10 billion from asset sales this
year to help finance a growing budget gap. In addition to five
utilities, the government is selling shares in copper and coal
producers, an oil refiner and the Warsaw bourse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are interested in expanding our activities in
Poland,&#8221; which is &#8220;a great country for energy,&#8221; GDF Deputy
Chairman Jean-Francois Cirelli told reporters in Warsaw today.
&#8220;Energy consumption is going up and the landscape is changing,
there are more and more alternatives to coal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in Polish energy assets has increased since last
year, when the country canceled the sale of a majority stake in
Enea SA, the third-largest utility, after receiving a single
bid. Earlier this year the ministry shortlisted four companies
to buy Zespol Elektrowni PAK SA, which produces 8.5 percent of
the country&#8217;s electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland plans to return to the Enea sale after finding a
buyer for Energa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Ira Starr, the New York
investment adviser who represented actors Sylvester Stallone and
Wesley Snipes, was indicted for stealing at least $59 million
from clients, almost double the amount previously thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr, 66, of Manhattan, was charged in the indictment by a
federal grand jury in New York with 20 counts of wire fraud and
one count each of securities fraud, money laundering and fraud
by an investment adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s indictment replaces a May 27 criminal complaint
filed by federal prosecutors in the office of U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara. That complaint alleged Starr stole at least $30
million from seven clients. Yesterday&#8217;s indictment expands the
number of victims to 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the less than two weeks since Kenneth Starr&#8217;s arrest,
this investigation has maintained its velocity,&#8221; Bharara said
in a statement. &#8220;The scope of the alleged fraud has doubled and
is now up to $59 million and counting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If convicted of wire fraud, Starr faces as long as 20 years
in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbe Lowell, a lawyer representing Starr in a civil lawsuit
brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, couldn&#8217;t
be reached for comment. Peggy Cross, a public defender appointed
to represent Starr, didn&#8217;t return a voice-mail message left at
her office after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr was arrested May 27 and accused of defrauding
clients, including heiress Rachel &#8220;Bunny&#8221; Mellon, in a scheme
to buy a $7.5 million Manhattan apartment. He has been held in
jail since his arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr used his access to famous and powerful clients &#8220;to
burnish an image of trustworthiness, leading his clients to
entrust him with management and control of their financial
affairs,&#8221; sometimes assuming &#8220;total control&#8221; over their
financial lives, the indictment charges, repeating an earlier
allegation by prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr, who hasn&#8217;t entered a plea in the case, may again ask
for bail, which was denied earlier when the government argued he
was a flight risk. His bank accounts have been frozen, and the
former manager of more than $700 million was being represented
by a public defender because he couldn&#8217;t afford a lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Starr, 1:10-mj-01135, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
SEC civil lawsuit is SEC v. Starr, 1:10-cv-04270, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The Stanton
Suit is Stanton v. Starr, 08601122, New York State Supreme
Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-CSK Chief Fails to Get Clawback Suit Thrown Out &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSK Auto Corp.&#8217;s former chief executive officer lost a bid
for dismissal of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
lawsuit seeking to recover $4.1 million he received during an
accounting fraud he didn&#8217;t orchestrate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Murray Snow in Phoenix rebuffed Maynard
Jenkins&#8217;s argument that the SEC couldn&#8217;t properly use the
Sarbanes-Oxley law to recoup bonuses and stock-sale profits he
received after other CSK executives allegedly inflated the auto-
parts maker&#8217;s earnings. It&#8217;s the first time the agency invoked a
so-called clawback law against an executive it isn&#8217;t accusing of
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of the law shows executives can be forced to
&#8220;reimburse additional compensation received during periods of
corporate non-compliance regardless of whether or not they were
aware of the misconduct giving rise to the misstated
financials,&#8221; Snow said June 9 in his 15-page decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued after CSK was forced to restate financial
results from fiscal year 2001 through 2005. Company officials
said as much as $89 million in inventory and vendor allowances
were overstated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Spiegel, Jenkins&#8217;s Los Angeles-based lawyer, didn&#8217;t
return a phone call for comment on Snow&#8217;s decision to allow the
clawback suit to proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin G. Fraser, CSK&#8217;s former president and chief
operating officer, and Don Watson, its former chief financial
officer, were indicted on securities-fraud and conspiracy
charges over their alleged use of improper accounting methods to
artificially inflate the company&#8217;s revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraser died in January and Watson faces a June 2011 trial,
according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward W. O&#8217;Brien III, CSK&#8217;s former controller, pleaded
guilty to attempting to obstruct a probe of the company&#8217;s
accounting practices and is cooperating with prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Jenkins, 09-cv-1510, U.S. District
Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Au Optronics Indicted in U.S. Price-Fixing Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Au Optronics Corp. and six of its executives were indicted
for allegedly conspiring to fix prices of flat-panel screens
sold worldwide, part of a U.S. probe that has ensnared at least
six companies that have paid $860 million in fines, the U.S.
Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, Taiwan&#8217;s second-largest flat-panel maker, and
its executives, including President Hsuan Bin Chen, carried out
the conspiracy from 2001 to 2006, the Justice Department said
yesterday in a statement. Apple Inc., Dell Inc. and Hewlett-
Packard Co. are among companies directly affected by the alleged
conspiracy, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flat-panel screens are used in televisions, computers and
mobile phones. The worldwide market for the panels was valued at
$70 billion in 2006, the year the conspiracy ended, the agency
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elena Wu, an office manager at Au Optronics&#8217; U.S. unit in
Houston, declined to comment and referred questions to the
company&#8217;s parent in Taiwan. There was no answer before regular
business hours at the office of Freda Lee, an Au Optronics
spokeswoman in Taiwan. Michael Attanasio, a spokesman for Hsuan
Bin Chen, didn&#8217;t return a voice-mail message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal grand jury in San Francisco returned an
indictment against the company and executives on June 9,
according to the statement. The indictment was filed yesterday
in federal court, prosecutors said. It replaced an earlier
indictment against former executives at Chunghwa Picture Tubes
and LG Display Co. who are co-conspirators, the Justice
Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives agreed to fix prices during meetings and
issued quotes to buyers based on the agreed-upon prices,
prosecutors said. Executives from AU Optronics and its American
subsidiary also exchanged information on sales of thin-film
transfer liquid-crystal display panels to monitor and enforce
adherence to the agreed-upon prices, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v Au Optronics, 09-110, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIT Ex-Officers Lose Bid to Dismiss Investors&#8217; Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIT Group Inc. current and former officers and directors
lost a bid to dismiss a lawsuit claiming the company misled
investors about known risks of its subprime home-lending and
private student-loan businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officers and directors including ex-Chief Executive Officer
Jeffrey Peek asked U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in
Manhattan to throw out a suit brought by Pensioenfonds Horeca 
Catering, a Dutch pension fund, and other investors.     In a
ruling issued yesterday, Jones denied that request, saying the
plaintiffs &#8220;adequately pleaded&#8221; claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs alleged that some defendants made
misstatements regarding the performance of CIT&#8217;s student loan
portfolio, while other defendants made false statements about
its conservative composition and stability, including a comment
that there was &#8220;absolutely no risk in the student loan
business.&#8221; The plaintiffs also alleged the defendants had a
&#8220;duty to monitor the performance of the student lending
portfolio,&#8221; Jones said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIT filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Peek, nor a spokesman for CIT, could be immediately
reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re CIT Group Inc. Securities Litigation, 08-
6613, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German Court Rejects Euro Rescue-Fund Emergency Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s highest constitutional court rejected an attempt
by a lawmaker who sought an emergency order blocking the nation
from participating in the euro-area rescue fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergency bid, aimed at blocking the finance minster
from granting loan guarantees while the case is being reviewed,
was rejected by the Federal Constitutional Court. The court said
that in emergency proceedings it is allowed to base its decision
on the government&#8217;s assessment of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even a temporary retreat of Germany from the rescue plan
could, in the government&#8217;s view, jeopardizes the rescue fund, at
least in the eyes of the financial markets,&#8221; the court said in
an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the German parliament approved their country&#8217;s
participation in the 750 billion euro ($907 billion) package on
May 21, Peter Gauweiler, a lawmaker from the Bavarian wing of
Chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s Christian Democrats, filed the suit.
Gauweiler argues the bailout changes an EU treaty without proper
authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court will continue to review the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s case is BVerfG, 2 BvR 1099/10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowell Urges SEC Not to Be Heartless to Client Starr &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyer Abbe Lowell appeared in court to at least
temporarily represent jailed money manager Kenneth Starr and his
wife and urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission not
to be &#8220;heartless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowell and Starr&#8217;s wife, former stripper Diane Passage,
attended a hearing yesterday in Manhattan federal court in a
civil suit against Starr and Passage brought by the SEC. At
issue was whether the judge would maintain a freeze on the
Starrs&#8217; assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr, 66, was arrested and charged May 27 with
orchestrating a fraud scheme that prosecutors said may exceed
$30 million as more victims come forward. The SEC filed its
civil lawsuit the same day against Starr, Passage and New York-
based Starr Investment Advisors and Starr  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowell, who served as congressional counsel during the
impeachment proceedings against then-President Bill Clinton,
agreed to a four-week extension of the freeze while he prepares
legal papers seeking to lift at least a portion of it. After the
hearing, Lowell shared an elevator with Aurora Cassirer, the
receiver for Starr&#8217;s firms, and said the SEC shouldn&#8217;t be so
&#8220;heartless&#8221; as to deny Passage any funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s being heartless,&#8221; Cassirer responded.
The agency has an obligation to recover the money people
invested with Starr, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the SEC wants Ms. Passage and her son to
starve,&#8221; Lowell replied as the elevator descended to the
courthouse cafeteria, where the parties conferred. Passage had
no comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowell, 58, is a partner at McDermott Will  Emery. He said
in an interview that his continued representation of the Starrs
may depend on whether the judge releases assets to pay legal
fees. He said he also wants to represent Kenneth Starr, who has
been jailed since his arrest, in his criminal case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil suit is SEC v. Starr, 1:10-cv-04270, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypo Real Squeeze-Out May Not Violate Law, German Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Hypo Real Estate Holding AG minority investors,
including U.S. investment firm J.C. Flowers  Co., may not be
successful in arguing the German bank-rescue fund&#8217;s move to
force them to sell their stock in a squeeze-out was
unconstitutional, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The squeeze-out has helped to simplify refinancing and
restructuring, therefore we tend to regard the measure as
proportional,&#8221; Munich Regional Court Presiding Judge Helmut
Krenek said at a hearing yesterday. The court&#8217;s assessment is
preliminary and the case could still be sent to the European
Union&#8217;s top court, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 38 plaintiffs in the case are seeking to invalidate a
decision at Munich-based Hypo Real Estate&#8217;s Oct. 5, 2009,
shareholder meeting that paved the way for Germany&#8217;s first bank
nationalization since the 1930s. The vote allowed a government
bank-rescue fund, known as Soffin, to force the lender&#8217;s
minority owners including Flowers to sell their shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German government and financial institutions had to
rescue Hypo Real Estate in 2009 after the lender&#8217;s Dublin-based
Depfa Bank Plc unit couldn&#8217;t raise financing when the bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. froze credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flowers&#8217; lawyers Sebastian Zeeck and Alexander Honrath
argued the squeeze-out illegally seized shareholders&#8217; property.
Daniela Bergdolt, a lawyer for other plaintiffs, said that an
alternative would have been to exclude voting rights of Hypo
Real Estate&#8217;s minority owners for a limited time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypo Real Estate&#8217;s lawyers said that full ownership was
necessary to guarantee the success of the lender&#8217;s bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It can&#8217;t be fully ruled out that the squeeze-out violated
European Union government aid regulations,&#8221; Krenek said
yesterday. &#8220;Therefore a submission of the case to the EU&#8217;s
Court of Justice might be a possibility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is LG Muenchen, 5HK O 18800/09. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Hudson CDO Said to Be Target of Second SEC Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s $2 billion Hudson Mezzanine
collateralized debt obligation, sold in 2006, is the target of a
probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a
person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inquiry into the CDO may not lead to any additional
actions against the New York-based securities firm, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the investigation
isn&#8217;t public. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment, as did SEC spokesman John Nester. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1 CDO contained credit default
swaps that referenced $2 billion in subprime, BBB-rated
residential mortgage-backed securities. While Goldman Sachs
selected the assets in the deal, the firm was also the only
investor buying credit protection on the entire transaction,
documents released by Michigan Senator Carl Levin&#8217;s committee
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold the Hudson CDO in late 2006,
near the time, committee documents show, senior executives
wanted to reduce the firm&#8217;s exposure to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS Probed in Luxembourg for Forgery Over Madoff-Linked Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG&#8217;s Luxembourg unit is being probed by prosecutors
over allegations of forgery when it oversaw two funds linked to
Bernard Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A preliminary investigation by the prosecutor&#8217;s office is
under way,&#8221; Henri Eippers, a spokesman for the Luxembourg Court
of Justice said by telephone yesterday. &#8220;The police already
submitted a first report.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access International Advisors LLC&#8217;s LuxAlpha Sicav-American
Selection Fund and Luxembourg Investment Fund were among
Luxembourg funds forced to suspend customer redemptions after
Madoff&#8217;s December 2008 arrest. As custodian of the funds, UBS&#8217;s
Luxembourg unit was charged with overseeing the funds and
managing deposits and payments to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS and its local units have been sued for damages and
compensation in more than 100 Luxembourg cases by investors who
lost millions of dollars through the funds. LuxAlpha, which lost
95 percent of its approximately $1.4 billion in assets, was
dissolved four months after Madoff&#8217;s arrest in December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Neither UBS (Luxembourg) SA nor its employees are subject
to any Luxembourg criminal investigation over funds with Madoff-
positions,&#8221; Dominique Gerster, a spokesman for Zurich-based
UBS, said in an e-mailed statement. The bank is aware that
people &#8220;including current UBS employees&#8221; will be invited to
testify as part of a preliminary investigation over the funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor&#8217;s office is in the process of gathering more
information and will, based on the evidence, decide whether to
file a lawsuit against UBS, said Eippers. He declined to provide
details on the forgeries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidators for LuxAlpha and Luxembourg Investment
Funds have sued UBS and Ernst  Young LLP, the fund&#8217;s auditor,
seeking the return of the lost assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;UBS and EY knowingly made false statement to the
Luxembourg Supervisory Authority and to the investor community
in general about the internal functioning of the Luxalpha fund,
more particularly on the existence of the contractual
relationship between UBS and Madoff,&#8221; said Edouard Fremault, a
senior analyst at Deminor International, which advises about
1,200 investors with losses through Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernard Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty in March 2009 to
orchestrating the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. He was
sentenced to 150 years in a federal prison in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messier Defends Vivendi 2001 Share Buyback at Paris Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean-Marie Messier, former chief executive officer of
Vivendi SA, defended his decision to order a share buyback after
the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, denying it constituted
share manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messier told a Paris court the decision to try to boost
Vivendi&#8217;s share price by ordering 21 million shares be
repurchased between Sept. 18, 2001, and Oct. 2, 2001, was made
&#8220;under exceptional circumstances.&#8221; That was recognized by
France&#8217;s market regulator, which took no action, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think that it was a good decision,&#8221; Messier told the
Paris criminal court yesterday. The buyback was &#8220;utterly
consistent with, utterly coherent with, the desire to protect
investors&#8221; from a plunge in the share price after the attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messier is one of seven men on trial this month on charges
related to the era before to his 2002 ouster, when he sought to
transform the water company into a global media giant through a
$77 billion acquisition spree. A criminal probe began after a
complaint filed by small shareholders who said they were duped
into buying or holding shares by overly rosy financial reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the investigating judges raided the French
regulator, the Autorite des Marches Financiers, in search of
information gathered during its review of the share buyback. The
buyback program &#8220;respected entirely the French regulations that
were in place at the time,&#8221; Messier said to the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messier denies any wrongdoing. The Paris prosecutors&#8217;
office advised against prosecuting any of the men. The trial is
scheduled to end June 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santander Seeks Reduction of Largest-Ever U.K. Race Bias Award &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco Santander SA, Spain&#8217;s largest bank, asked a London
court to reduce a 2.8 million-pound ($4.1 million) judgment for
racial discrimination, the largest ever in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balbinder Chagger, 44, a former trading-risk controller at
the bank&#8217;s Abbey National Plc unit, was fired in 2006. A London
employment tribunal found he was discriminated against and
unfairly dismissed based on his Indian origin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A non-discriminatory process would have led to his
redundancy,&#8221; Christopher Jeans, a lawyer for Abbey, said at a
hearing yesterday. &#8220;That follows as night follows day.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chagger&#8217;s case had been appealed twice and sent back to the
tribunal for further argument on whether he would have been
dismissed regardless of discrimination and whether the award
should be reduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David von Hagen, a lawyer for Chagger, said the award would
be the highest-ever discrimination award in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have made no apology or any statement of regret for
the way Mr. Chagger has been treated,&#8221; Chagger&#8217;s lawyer, John
Bowers, told the tribunal. &#8220;This is an employer who has come
before you, having been found to have discriminated, asking you
to reduce the award. We ask you to bear in mind the way in which
this has developed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chagger could have received the same score as a co-worker
in a process the bank used in choosing whom to fire and he still
would have lost his job when the &#8220;tie-break&#8221; criteria were
taken into account, Jeans said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chagger v. Abbey National Plc, Central London
Employment Tribunal, case no. 2201763/2006. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada Publication Ban on Pretrial Evidence Upheld &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Canadian law barring publication of evidence from
pretrial hearings was upheld by the country&#8217;s highest court as
the judges ruled disclosure could improperly influence potential
jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of Canada, ruling on two cases in which
publications were barred from reporting on evidence from bail
hearings, ruled 8 to 1 yesterday the limits on expression to
ensure an accused&#8217;s right to a speedy and fair trial are
justified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ban may make journalists&#8217; work more difficult, but it
does not prevent them from conveying and commenting on basic,
relevant information,&#8221; Judge Marie Deschamps said on behalf of
the court in the ruling issued in Ottawa. &#8220;While not a perfect
situation, the mandatory ban represents a reasonable
compromise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law at issue, Section 517 of the Canadian Criminal
Code, bars the media from publicizing evidence taken at a bail
hearing or a preliminary hearing at the request of the accused.
Preliminary hearings are held to determine if there&#8217;s enough
evidence to take the case to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges to the law, by Torstar Corp.&#8217;s Toronto Star,
Canada&#8217;s most widely read newspaper, and other media outlets
stem from the publication ban imposed at the bail hearings of 18
people accused of plotting a terror campaign that included the
storming of parliament and beheading the prime minister. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Between Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. and Her
Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 33085 and Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada,
32865, Supreme Court of Canada (Ottawa). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losses in the biggest U.S. banks and
brokerages, whose share prices are more linked to the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index than at any time in seven years, suggest the
benchmark measure of American equities may extend its seven-week
slump, according to Concept Capital&#8217;s John Kolovos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reached $192.28 on Oct. 14, the
highest level since May 2008, and $184.46 on April 14 before
closing at $133.77 yesterday -- forming a rounding-top pattern
also seen in JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley --
suggesting the SP 500 faces losses, he said. The measure has
retreated 11 percent since April 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As long as these guys continue to move lower, mom and pop
or any big institutions will not be inclined to head into
equities,&#8221; said Kolovos, co-head of technical analysis research
for the New York-based firm. &#8220;We&#8217;re using these stocks as a
barometer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slowdown in an equity rally that eventually turns into
losses is called a rounding top by technical analysts, who base
forecasts on historical price fluctuations. Chart watchers, such
as Kolovos, say the pattern indicates stocks face more declines
in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial companies in the SP 500 are moving in line with
the U.S. equity benchmark. Using 30 days of trading data, the
correlation coefficient between the industry and the broader
stock index rose to 0.9724 yesterday, meaning price fluctuations
are the most similar since April 2003, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Readings of 1 show the measures are
rising or falling in lockstep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings for 2009, has
fallen 21 percent to $133.77 this year after U.S. regulators
sued the company for fraud related to mortgage securities.
Morgan Stanley is down 14 percent to $25.59, while JPMorgan lost
8.1 percent to $38.29 in 2010. All three banks are based in New
York. The SP 500 has slipped 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Steve Lim,
chief executive officer of the firm&#8217;s South Korea unit, has been
investigated by the financial regulator over alleged insider
trading, said an official at the Financial Services Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission handed the case to prosecutors after a probe
that began last year into whether Lim traded on insider
information, the person said, declining to be identified as the
investigation hasn&#8217;t been made public. Lim didn&#8217;t return calls
to his office and mobile phone seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MoneyToday, a local-language Internet news service,
yesterday reported the Seoul Central Prosecutors Office quizzed
Lim on June 9 over alleged unfair trading of securities related
to KCC Corp., a South Korean construction materials maker for
which JPMorgan had arranged bond sales. Lim denied wrongdoing
and said he was cleared following a written investigation by
prosecutors, according to MoneyToday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lim hasn&#8217;t been charged with wrongdoing, the Financial
Times reported today, citing unidentified people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Seoul-based spokeswoman Kang So Young declined
to comment on the MoneyToday report and the official&#8217;s remarks.
An official at Seoul Central Prosecutors Office declined to
connect a call from Bloomberg News to prosecutors. A KCC
spokesman, who declined to be identified citing company policy,
said he had no comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to Lloyd Blankfein: Imagine,
for a moment, what would happen if a cardiac surgeon were paid
like a Wall Street banker in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each operation, the doctor would earn more, regardless
of the risk to the patient, writes Suzanne McGee in &#8220;Chasing
Goldman Sachs.&#8221; The greater the risk, in fact, the higher the
fee. Should half his patients die the next year, the hospital
might dismiss the surgeon -- with a golden handshake. He could
then take up a post elsewhere or set up his own practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wall Street doesn&#8217;t have to purchase malpractice
insurance,&#8221; says McGee in this disturbing account of how the
big boys ran amok and began blowing up the money grid. &#8220;There
isn&#8217;t even a sense that there is a duty of care to the &#8216;patient&#8217;
-- whether that patient is the client or the financial system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGee, a contributing editor at Barron&#8217;s, isn&#8217;t out to bury Goldman Sachs Group Inc. or Blankfein, its chief executive
officer. Her goal is, rather, to show how Wall Street bankers
became preoccupied with their own short-term interests and
drifted away from their raison d&#8217;etre -- to funnel capital from
investors to companies that need it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were, by this account, almost predestined to do so
from the moment the Securities and Exchange Commission banned
fixed trading commissions in the stock market on May 1, 1975.
The prohibition turned their comfy business model upside-down:
&#8220;Mayday,&#8221; they called it, hinting at their distress level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. is investigating the
cause and size of an oil pipeline leak in the foothills of Salt
Lake City after shutting the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Neither the source of the leak or the quantity of oil
released has been determined at this time,&#8221; said Chevron
spokesman Sean Comey in an e-mail statement. The company was
notified of the leak at around 8:20 p.m. U.S. central time
yesterday, and workers were dispatched to shut the line and
start containment of the spill, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial estimates said around 500 barrels seeped from the
10-inch line that has a capacity of about 15,000 barrels a day,
according to Lisa Harrison Smith, a spokeswoman for Mayor Ralph Becker, citing Chevron data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron told Smith they shut the line yesterday and were
estimating a leak of about 50 gallons a minute before it was
turned off, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crews placed booms in waterways, including the Jordan
River, &#8220;to minimize downstream impact,&#8221; the mayor&#8217;s office
said in a release yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A boom was also laced in a drainage creek, said Comey.
&#8220;Wildlife rehabilitation experts have been engaged&#8221; and some
birds have been washed at the Salt Lake City zoo, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline was carrying crude oil from Colorado into the
Salt Lake Valley to its refinery, Smith said. Chevron&#8217;s Salt
Lake City plant can process 45,000 barrels a day of crude,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They haven&#8217;t given a firm timeline on when they&#8217;ll
restart the line,&#8221; Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A damaged Chevron Corp. pipeline
leaked as much as 500 barrels of oil into a Salt Lake City creek
on June 11 before being contained, the Associated Press
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underground pipeline broke at about 10 a.m. and city
officials were alerted early the next day, the newswire said.
The cause of the leak is unknown, AP reported, citing fire
department spokesman Scott Freitag and local Mayor Ralph Becker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. should face a new
trial for allegedly sanctioning beatings and shootings of
Nigerian protesters in 1998 because jurors who cleared the
company in 2008 were given erroneous instructions, lawyers for
protesters argued to a U.S. appeals court today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal court jury was told, incorrectly, that the
protesters had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that company-
paid soldiers used excessive force against those who boarded
Chevron&#8217;s oil drilling platform located nine miles offshore of
the Niger Delta, said Theresa Traber, an attorney for the
Nigerians and their families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it was Chevron&#8217;s burden to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the peaceful protesters, who were unarmed
and running away with arms raised when shots were fired, had
committed crimes that justified the type of force used by the
soldiers, Traber told the three-judge appellate panel at today&#8217;s
hearing in San Francisco. The Nigerians were protesting over
jobs and alleged environmental damage to the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a major error that deprived the plaintiffs of
the fair trial they should have had on their battery claims,&#8221;
Traber said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two men were killed, others were shot and beaten and one
man was hung by his wrists and tortured after a protest about
jobs and alleged environmental damage to the area, according to
a 1999 lawsuit against Chevron. Nineteen Nigerians sued the
company claiming it was liable for the actions of the Nigerian
soldiers it hired to provide security for the oil platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;150 Workers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, said at trial
that villagers invaded the platform and held 150 workers hostage
for ransom. They had knives, prevented workers from leaving the
platform and threatened to set it on fire, the jury was told.
The company said the soldiers acted in self-defense and denied
directing their conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Stewart, an attorney at Jones Day representing
Chevron today, told the judges that the jury was given proper
instructions by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, who presided
over the trial. Both sides had agreed that Nigerian law would be
applied to the battery claims by protesters, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nigerian law, like California law, like federal law, puts
the burden on plaintiffs to prove that the force was
excessive,&#8221; Stewart said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jury Cleared Chevron &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After almost 10 years of trial court proceedings, the case
went before a jury in October 2008. The jury cleared Chevron,
the second-largest U.S. oil company, of wrongful death, torture,
assault, battery and negligence claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the protesters appealed the verdict to the
federal appeals court in San Francisco. The judges took the
matter under submission and didn&#8217;t say when they would issue a
decision. A ruling in favor of the protesters could lead to a
retrial on battery claims of three Nigerians injured and the
family of a man who was killed in the attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We respect the rulings made by Judge Illston leading up
to and during the 5-week trial and believe that no errors were
made,&#8221; said Morgan Crinklaw, a Chevron spokesman, in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Larry Bowoto v. Chevron, 09-15641, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy bullish Netflix
Inc. options while selling bearish ones because the movie
subscription service&#8217;s technology makes it more profitable than
rivals, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists Amyn Bharwani and Marko Kolanovic recommended buying September $120 calls while selling
September $110 puts. The trade, known as a risk reversal,
profits if Netflix shares are above $125.15 when the contracts
expire in three months, the strategists wrote in a report before
the open of U.S. exchanges. The shares climbed 5.1 percent,  the
most in a month, to close at $123.29 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategists cited JPMorgan stock analyst Imran Khan,
who raised his share-price forecast to $133 on June 9 and
boosted his estimates for earnings and subscriber growth. He
maintained his &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the shares. Netflix,
based in Los Gatos, California, is poised to benefit as
consumers buy more devices to watch movies over the Internet and
video rental stores close, putting $1 billion in revenue &#8220;up
for grabs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company&#8217;s unique technology and reach allow it to
monetize content in ways competitors can&#8217;t,&#8221; Khan wrote. &#8220;We

&lt;p&gt;Xbox Live subscribers who pay $50 a year and whose Internet
provider pays to carry ESPN3.com can now access the programming,
Marc Whitten, general manager of Xbox Live, said today at the E3
video-game conference in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN3&#8217;s live video of 3,500 events, including Major League
Baseball, soccer, college football and basketball games, will be
available to Xbox Live Gold Members, Whitten said. Financial
terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. Broadcast and cable channels are
seeking new ways to reach viewers migrating to the Web and video
games for entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our fan base wants to be on all these screens, not just
one,&#8221; Matthew Murphy, senior vice president of digital video
distribution for Disney and ESPN networks, said in an interview.
&#8220;We want to provide access to our content in as many places as
possible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN3.com is available to Internet subscribers of Comcast
Corp., ATT Inc., Cox Communications Inc. and 57 other
providers, Amy Phillips, an ESPN spokeswoman, said in an
interview. The Internet video service, which is carrying World
Cup soccer matches, reaches 50 million homes through existing

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., looking to boost
profit and sales in its Xbox video-game unit, plans to start
selling a motion-controlled device called Kinect on Nov. 4 that
lets console users direct action by moving their bodies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device, demonstrated with several game titles in a
University of Southern California basketball arena yesterday,
will also support video chat. The company also unveiled an
exclusive deal with Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s ESPN to put live sports
events on the Xbox Live online game service, Microsoft said at a
Los Angeles press conference today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the No. 2 console seller behind Nintendo Co., is
looking to reinvigorate demand as the industry copes with an 11
percent sales decline this year in the U.S., according to data
from NPD Group Inc. Kinect may add $1.6 billion to revenue in
the fiscal year starting July 1 and $2 billion in the year after
that, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is unlike anything you have ever experienced before,&#8221;
Microsoft Senior Vice President Don Mattrick, who oversees the
Xbox group, said at the press conference. The system &#8220;brings
your living room to life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinect, previously known as Project Natal, also will let
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft extend the life of its Xbox
360 console, Sarah Friar, a Goldman Sachs analyst, said in a
note. Since new machines typically lose money for the first few
years, a longer shelf life should help Microsoft improve profit
in a division that has lost $8.6 billion since 1999, according
to estimates from Katherine Egbert, an analyst with Jefferies 
Co. in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing Catch-Up &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s first motion-sensing games come four years
after Nintendo started selling the Wii motion-activated system,
which helped the Kyoto-based company take the lead in console
sales. Sony Corp., maker of the PlayStation 3 console, will
demonstrate its Move motion-controller this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Kinect is geared toward family play, Microsoft also
showed off titles for traditional gamers. Activision Blizzard
Inc. played clips of its battle franchise &#8220;Call of Duty&#8221; to be
released later this year, and Microsoft and the Epic Games Inc.
previewed their new &#8220;Gears of War&#8221; title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will make 3,500 live sporting events from ESPN
available to customers who buy its Xbox Live gold membership.
The programming will include college football and basketball,
Major League Baseball and soccer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it now has 25 million members for Xbox Live.
The company has previously said that about half of Xbox Live
members pay for the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also will start shipping a new Xbox machine
today. The product has a sleeker design, built-in Wi-Fi and is
less noisy than the earlier model. The machine will cost
$299.99, the same as the old model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintendo sold 277,200 Wii consoles in the U.S. in April,
compared with shipments of 185,400 Xbox 360s and 180,800
PlayStation 3s, according to NPD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and
ConocoPhillips, the largest U.S. oil companies, will ask
lawmakers not to punish them for the human and environmental
damage inflicted by BP Plc&#8217;s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, Chevron CEO
John Watson and James Mulva, CEO of ConocoPhillips, are
scheduled to appear tomorrow before a House Energy and Commerce
Committee panel examining offshore drilling safety and U.S.
energy policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing presents the U.S. oil CEOs with an opportunity
to distance their companies from BP, said Anthony Sabino, who
teaches oil and natural-gas law at St. John&#8217;s University in New
York. BP has lost 43 percent of its market value since the
disaster and has been excoriated by President Barack Obama for
repeated failures to cap the leaking well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A crucifixion of the whole oil industry for the sins of
BP in the form of a ban on deep-water drilling isn&#8217;t a good idea
because look at all the people it&#8217;s going to put out of work,&#8221;
Sabino said. &#8220;Exxon and ConocoPhillips will stress their own
safety records to make that case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since an April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig that killed 11 workers, more than 50 million
gallons of crude have poured into the Gulf from a BP-owned well,
based on calculations from a government panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama Meeting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has intensified pressure on BP to stop
the spill and pay for damages. Obama has asked to meet June 16
with BP&#8217;s chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, and other company
officials. BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward will appear
before the House Energy and Commerce oversight committee the
following day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil company CEOs have been asked to testify tomorrow
about the spill&#8217;s effect on U.S. energy policy, Eben Burnham-
Snyder, a spokesman for Representative Edward Markey, said June
9. Markey is a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the
subcommittee holding the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives may also be pressed to explain dividend
payouts and share buyback programs that have dwarfed their
investments in alternatives to petroleum, such as solar and
wind, according to a June 12 memorandum written by Congressional
staff and distributed to lawmakers who will participate in
tomorrow&#8217;s hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Pleas &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson, Watson and Mulva probably will ask lawmakers to
avoid changes in offshore drilling rules that could discourage
exploration in U.S. territorial waters without making meaningful
contributions to safety, said Gianna Bern, president of
Brookshire Advisory  Research Inc. in Flossmoor, Illinois,
which advises oil companies on strategy and risk management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson will tell lawmakers that an investigation needs
to determine if BP took risks &#8220;beyond industry norms,&#8221;
according to prepared remarks he&#8217;s scheduled to deliver during
tomorrow&#8217;s hearing. Proper well design, redundant safety systems
and regular maintenance and tests help mitigate the risks
involved in drilling miles below sea level for oil and natural
gas, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurt Glaubitz, a spokesman for Chevron, based in San Ramon,
California, said he couldn&#8217;t immediately comment. Nancy Turner,
a spokeswoman for Houston-based ConocoPhillips, said in an e-
mail that the company wouldn&#8217;t release Mulva&#8217;s prepared remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 30 deep-water rigs have been ordered to cease
drilling off the coasts of Louisiana and Texas for at least six
months while federal officials conduct a review of offshore
safety practices. The Gulf accounts for 30 percent of U.S. oil
production, according to the Energy Information Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling Pause &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drilling halt may cut oil production in the Gulf by as
much as 11 percent next year, said Paul Cheng, a Barclays
Capital analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These executives need to explain to the politicians that
if you permanently shut us down in the deep water it&#8217;s going to
wreak havoc with energy production and put the United States
even more at the mercy of foreign oil producers,&#8221; Sabino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also scheduled to appear before tomorrow&#8217;s panel are Lamar McKay and Marvin Odum, the presidents of the U.S. units of BP
and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers may ask Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell
to describe safety measures they have used offshore to avoid the
sort of disaster BP faced, said Bern, a former BP crude trader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which pumps more crude than every member of OPEC
except Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, abandoned an exploration
project known as Blackbeard in the Gulf of Mexico in 2007 rather
than risk a blowout. The company quit the project, which sought
to drill more than six miles (9.7 kilometers) beneath the
seafloor, after repeated pressure surges indicated the well was
unstable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling Macondo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP engineers alerted federal regulators at the Minerals
Management Service that they were having difficulty controlling
the Macondo well six weeks before the disaster, according to e-
mails released by the Energy and Commerce Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think this would have happened on Exxon&#8217;s
watch,&#8221; Tom Bower, author of &#8220;The Squeeze: Oil, Money and
Greed in the 21st Century,&#8221; said in a June 11 Bloomberg
Television interview. &#8220;They&#8217;d be much more careful and much
more conscious of the need to supervise subcontractors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. should face a new
trial for allegedly sanctioning beatings and shootings of
Nigerian protesters in 1998 because jurors who cleared the
company in 2008 were given erroneous instructions, lawyers
for protesters told a federal appeals court in San Francisco
today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gregg Weinstein, a former global
head of risk management for Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s
investment management division, is establishing RocWood Capital
Management LP, an event-driven hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, based in New York, will begin marketing in July
with the aim of starting to invest in the third quarter,
according to a person familiar with the discussions, who
declined to be identified because RocWood&#8217;s plans aren&#8217;t public.
The fund doesn&#8217;t have a target size, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will invest across the corporate capital structure,
seeking mispriced investments following a particular catalyst,
the person said. Brandy Bergman, a spokeswoman for the RocWood,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RocWood has seven employees and plans a staff of twelve by
the fund&#8217;s launch, the person said. It will expand as assets
under management grow, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinstein, 45, left Goldman Sachs in December after 17
years, said Andrea Raphael, a Goldman spokeswoman. He held a
variety of jobs, including overseeing U.S. investment-grade
credit trading and convertible bonds. He was promoted to partner
in 2002, according to a news release at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 254 new funds launched in the first quarter of
the year, up from 230 during the fourth quarter of 2009. There
were 240 funds liquidated last quarter, up from 165 liquidated
the previous quarter, according to a report released June 8 from
Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of funds launched has been rising since the
fourth quarter of 2008, when 56 funds were launched and 778 were
liquidated, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgian Railways, the former Soviet
republic&#8217;s state-owned rail company, said it hired JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Merrill Lynch to manage a sale of Eurobonds,
without elaborating on the amount or the schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We already have signed agreements with JP Morgan and
Merrill Lynch to place our Eurobonds on the market, but we
cannot say when or what amount is being discussed,&#8221; the
company&#8217;s director general, Irakli Ezugbaia, said in an
interview in Tbilisi today. &#8220;We cannot talk about the details
as it will raise expectations on the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georgian Prime Minister Nika Gilauri said on Feb. 24 that
the rail company may sell as much as $200 million of Eurobonds.
Ezughbaia declined to confirm the amount. He also couldn&#8217;t say
whether the government may sell Georgian Railways, whose annual
capacity is set to reach as much as 20 tonnes this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s only outstanding bond is a 25 million lari
($14.5 million), 13.5 percent security due in 2011, according to
Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch is a unit of Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India may postpone or cut the size
of its scheduled bond sales this week as the payment of
corporate taxes and mobile-phone license fees squeezes cash at
banks, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Securities Trading Corp. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overnight interbank rates climbed to 5.43 percent on June
11, their highest level in more than two months, increasing the
cost of funding to buy bonds. The average amount of cash
borrowed each day by banks from the central bank&#8217;s repurchase
auction window jumped six-fold last week, showing the shortage
of funds. The Finance Ministry is due to auction up to 110
billion rupees ($2.4 billion) in the week beginning today,
according to the government&#8217;s debt sale calendar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This tight liquidity situation is going to be there for
quite some time, probably until at least August,&#8221; Jahangir Aziz, chief India economist at JPMorgan in Mumbai said in a June
12 telephone interview. &#8220;They may postpone the week&#8217;s auction
because that&#8217;s when the big shock is going to be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Secretary Ashok Chawla wasn&#8217;t immediately available
when called at his office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark 7.80 percent bonds due in May
2020 rose as much as three basis points today to 7.64 percent,
the highest level in more than a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireless broadband operators will have to pay a combined
385.4 billion rupees for licenses by June 22. The payment for
110 billion rupees of bonds sold by the government last week is
due today. Companies may pay up to 350 billion rupees in
quarterly tax this week, said Pradeep Madhav, managing director
of Mumbai-based Securities Trading Corp. of India, known as
STCI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room for Delays &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies that won permits to provide third-generation
services last month paid 677.2 billion rupees to the government,
reducing cash at banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since the government has mobilized so much money, they
can truncate the borrowing for a couple of auctions,&#8221; said
Mumbai-based Madhav. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madhav predicts lenders may borrow up to 900 billion rupees
from the Reserve Bank of India during this week. Banks borrowed
an average of 599.3 billion rupees from the central bank through
its repurchase-auction window every day last week, compared with
94.1 billion rupees the previous week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government plans to complete 63 percent of its record
borrowing program of 4.57 trillion rupees for the fiscal year
that began April 1 in the first half. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top six U.S. credit-card
lenders, led by JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp. and
Capital One Financial Corp., said overdue loans fell in May as
consumers avoided taking on new debt amid the economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loans at least 30 days late, a signal of future write-
offs, dropped to 4.22 percent in May compared with 4.4 percent
in the previous month and the lowest since last July, New York-
based JPMorgan said today in a regulatory filing. Write-offs of
loans deemed uncollectible, a lagging indicator, fell except at
Bank of America and Discover Financial Services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decline in overdue loans signals that the credit-card
industry continues to recover from a record $89 billion of
write-offs last year, when the U.S. unemployment rate topped 10
percent. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
of the U.S. economy, may remain muted as people focus on
&#8220;deleveraging,&#8221; according to Capital One Chief Executive
Officer Richard Fairbank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What they&#8217;re really doing is choosing not necessarily to
go load up on some credit cards, but more to pay down debt,&#8221;
Fairbank said at an investor conference earlier this month.
&#8220;This deleveraging phenomenon hasn&#8217;t provided strength to the
economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express Co., the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases, said overdue loans fell to 2.9 percent last month
from 3.1 percent in April. Late payments dropped to 4.8 percent
from 5.07 percent at McLean, Virginia-based Capital One; 6.39
percent from 6.73 percent at Bank of America; 5.59 percent from
5.85 percent at New York-based Citigroup Inc., and 4.95 percent
from 5.2 percent at Discover, based in Riverwoods, Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write-offs declined to 6.3 percent from 6.7 percent at New
York-based AmEx, the lowest for the group. They rose to 13.33
percent from 12.71 percent at Bank of America, based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, which posted the highest level of
losses. Discover increased to 8.82 percent from 8.42 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., ConocoPhillips,
Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are as ill-prepared as
BP Plc to halt and clean up an offshore oil spill because they
all use &#8220;carbon copy&#8221; disaster plans, lawmakers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight weeks after a drilling rig leased by BP exploded in
the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 workers and triggering the worst
spill in U.S. history, executives from the companies sought at a
House Energy Committee hearing to distance themselves from BP&#8217;s
practices that lawmakers said put profits before safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers faulted the four executives for disaster-response
plans that would halt oil leaks at the sea floor using the same
techniques that failed for BP at its Macondo well. The same firm
wrote the plans and included references to making sure crude
doesn&#8217;t injure walruses, which don&#8217;t live in the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The oil company response plans are great for public
relations but these plans are virtually worthless in the event
of a spill,&#8221; said Representative Bart T. Stupak, a Michigan
Democrat. &#8220;It could be said that BP is the one bad apple in the
bunch, but unfortunately, they appear to have plenty of
company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy companies, rig operators and lawmakers in oil-
producing states have urged the Obama administration to lift or
shorten a six-month moratorium on deepwater exploration that has
idled more than two dozen drilling vessels and threatens
thousands of jobs. Lawmakers said today they&#8217;re not convinced
the industry takes safety seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Magic Button&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can&#8217;t have a contingency plan that says cross your
fingers and hope the blowout preventer works,&#8221; said
Representative Joe Barton of Texas, the committee&#8217;s senior
Republican. &#8220;They pushed the magic button on the BP rig and it
didn&#8217;t work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon wouldn&#8217;t have used the well design, cement mixture or
testing procedures BP employed at the Macondo well, CEO Rex Tillerson told lawmakers today. The BP project faced &#8220;a lot of
indications of problems&#8221; in the weeks before the explosion,
Tillerson said. Shell&#8217;s U.S. president, Marvin Odum, and Chevron
CEO John Watson said they wouldn&#8217;t have drilled the well in the
same manner as BP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our internal review confirmed what our regular audits
have told us,&#8221; Watson told the committee. &#8220;Chevron&#8217;s drilling
and control practices for deepwater wells are safe and
environmentally sound.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Deliberate Deception&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEOs testified a day after the committee released
internal BP documents that lawmakers said showed the company put
cost concerns ahead of safety in the days leading up to April
20. BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward is to appear before
a subcommittee June 17, his first congressional testimony since
the well exploded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a preview of questions Hayward may face, Markey asked
Lamar McKay, president of BP America Inc., today why BP&#8217;s
initial estimates of the spill&#8217;s flow rate turned out to be
several times less than the actual leak. The initial estimates
reflected either a &#8220;deliberate deception or gross
incompetence,&#8221; Markey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are sorry for everything the Gulf coast is going
through,&#8221; McKay said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP, the biggest Gulf of Mexico oil producer, made five
&#8220;questionable decisions&#8221; aimed at cutting costs and speeding
completion of an overdue project before the disaster, Democratic
Representatives Henry Waxman of California and Stupak wrote in a
letter to Hayward released yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walruses in Plans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markey pressed the CEOs on why their safety plans for a
Gulf spill described the effects on walruses. Two of the
companies also incorporated contact information for a Florida
marine researcher who died in 2005, Markey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The plan needs to be updated more frequently,&#8221;
ConocoPhillips CEO James Mulva said. &#8220;Obviously, it is
embarrassing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate that walruses were included, and it&#8217;s an
embarrassment,&#8221; Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama plans to speak to the nation tonight
on the spill, and the administration is demanding that BP set up
an escrow account for damage claims. BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg has been called to the White House tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry groups oppose the six-month ban, which Obama put
in place to give a presidential commission time to probe the
spill. Pressed by Louisiana Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu,
who said her state could lose 330,000 jobs from the moratorium,
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar last week said the ban may be
shortened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost Jobs, Wages &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We acknowledge the reasons for the president&#8217;s decision
to pause deepwater drilling,&#8221; Shell&#8217;s Odum said in his prepared
remarks. &#8220;But it is not without consequence: thousands of lost
jobs, and billions in lost wages and spending. And not only on
the Gulf Coast, but also in places like Alaska.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventeen House members from Gulf coast states including
Barton and Representative Ted Poe, a Texas Republican, today
called on Obama to end the drilling ban. The group will meet
Salazar tomorrow to discuss the impact of the moratorium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many offshore drilling companies and suppliers will not be
able to survive this six-month period and will either go out of
business or move their employees and assets abroad,&#8221; the group
said in a statement. An extended suspension may cost more than
20,000 jobs in Gulf region, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Rigs Moving &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, has drilled 262 deep-water
wells in the past decade, 35 of which were in the Gulf,
Tillerson said. The company will send deepwater drilling rigs to
other parts of the world during the administration&#8217;s moratorium,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will redirect our human resources, the technical
talent, to other parts of the world where we&#8217;re allowed to work,
and we will redirect the equipment elsewhere,&#8221; Tillerson said.
&#8220;This stuff is too expensive to let them sit around.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the moratorium is lifted and federal regulators allow
deepwater drilling to resume, there may be few rigs available
for the work, said Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire Advisory
 Research Inc. in Flossmoor, Illinois, which advises oil
companies on strategy and risk management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling vessels are steaming out of the Gulf for
assignments in the South China Sea and off the Indonesia coast,
said Bern, a former BP crude trader. Those vessels won&#8217;t be able
to return to U.S. waters for a year or longer, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The moratorium will likely draw drilling rigs away from
the Gulf of Mexico to overseas basins, further delaying
development and negatively affecting crucial U.S. jobs that
support these operations,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;Any extension of the
moratorium will only exacerbate the economic consequences.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dubai World&#8217;s loans have a fair

company altered terms on $14.4 billion of bank debt, JPMorgan
Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures advanced,
indicating the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index may rebound towards
its 200-day moving average, a key level watched by some traders,
before reports that may show the recovery is continuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. might be active after the company&#8217;s 7.8 billion-
pound ($11.5 billion) offer to buy British Sky Broadcasting Plc
was rejected by the U.K. pay-TV provider. Exxon Mobil Corp. and
Chevron Corp. climbed in Germany as crude oil rose. Hershey Co.
may also move after the chocolate maker forecast earnings in

&lt;p&gt;Futures on the SP 500 expiring in September rose 0.5
percent to 1,091.7 as of 12:27 p.m. in London after the
benchmark for U.S. stocks yesterday slipped 0.2 percent. Futures
on the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.5 percent to
10,187, while Nasdaq-100 Index futures climbed 0.6 percent to
1,857. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think today&#8217;s move is largely technical,&#8221; said London-
based David Morrison, a market strategist at GFT. &#8220;U.S. traders
will try and take the SP 500 up through the 200-day moving
average at 1,108. It feels like equities will try to push higher
regardless&#8221; of the outcome of today&#8217;s economic reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell yesterday, extending the SP 500&#8217;s retreat
from April to 10 percent, after Moody&#8217;s Investors Service
downgraded Greece&#8217;s credit rating to junk, halting an earlier
rally of as much as 1.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal investigators must determine
if BP Plc took risks &#8220;beyond industry norms&#8221; with the Gulf of
Mexico well that exploded and caused the worst U.S. oil spill,
Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April 20 disaster that killed 11 workers and sank
Transocean Ltd.&#8217;s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig &#8220;represents a
dramatic departure&#8221; from the track record of deep-water oil
explorers, Tillerson said in remarks prepared for a House Energy
and Commerce Committee panel hearing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something went wrong at the BP project about 5,000 feet
(1,524 meters) below the sea surface that hasn&#8217;t happened at the
14,000 other deep-water wells drilled without incident worldwide,
Tillerson said. The catastrophe has damaged livelihoods and
coastal environments and will cause loss of public trust in the
oil industry, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to know if the levels of risk taken went beyond
industry norms,&#8221; said Tillerson, who oversees a company that
pumps more oil than every member of OPEC except Saudi Arabia,
Iran and Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, has drilled 262 deep-water
wells in the past decade, 35 of which were in the Gulf of Mexico,
he said. Proper well design, workforce training, redundant
safety systems and regular maintenance help mitigate the risks
involved in drilling miles below sea level, Tillerson said in
the remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Questionable Decisions&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP, the biggest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico, made
five &#8220;questionable decisions&#8221; aimed at cutting costs and
speeding completion of an overdue project in the days and weeks
preceding the disaster, U.S. Representatives Henry Waxman of
California and Bart Stupak of Michigan wrote in a letter to BP
CEO Tony Hayward that was released yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayward is scheduled to testify before U.S. lawmakers on
June 17. David Nicholas, a BP spokesman, said in an e-mail it
would be inappropriate to comment ahead of Hayward&#8217;s testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon overhauled its safety procedures after the 1989
Valdez tanker spill off the Alaskan coast, Tillerson said in his
remarks. The Valdez incident, which Tillerson described as &#8220;the
low point&#8217; in Exxon&#8217;s history, was one of the worst U.S. spills
before the failure of BP&#8217;s Macondo well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Watson, chief executive officer at Chevron Corp., and
ConocoPhillips CEO James Mulva are scheduled to testify at
today&#8217;s hearing in Washington. Lamar McKay and Marvin Odum, the
presidents of the U.S. units of BP and Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
respectively, have also accepted invitations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased Scrutiny &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell follows well-drilling safety standards that lawmakers
have said were sidestepped by BP, Odum said in a May 14 letter
to Elizabeth Birnbaum, former director of the U.S. Minerals
Management Service, which oversees the offshore drilling
industry. Shell&#8217;s plans to explore for oil and natural gas off
Alaska&#8217;s coast face increased scrutiny as a result of the Gulf
oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Shell has design standards and practices that have
enabled us to successfully and safely drill many deep-water and
shallow-water wells worldwide,&#8221; Odum said in the letter to
Birnbaum. &#8220;Shell will rigorously apply an appropriate similar
level of standards in all well operations on the Alaska&#8221; outer
continental shelf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 30 deep-water rigs have been ordered to stop
drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for at least six months while
federal officials conduct a review of offshore safety practices.
The moratorium has forced Exxon, Shell and other major oil
companies to suspend their deepwater exploration plans in the
Gulf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rigs Leaving &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulf accounts for 30 percent of U.S. oil production,
according to the Energy Information Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the moratorium is lifted and federal regulators allow
deep-water oil exploration to resume, there may be few rigs
remaining in the Gulf of Mexico to do the work, said
Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire Advisory  Research Inc.
in Flossmoor, Illinois, which advises oil companies on strategy
and risk management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling vessels are starting to leave the Gulf to take up
assignments in the South China Sea and offshore Indonesia, said
Bern, a former BP crude trader. Those vessels won&#8217;t be able to
return to U.S. waters for a year or longer, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a challenging time for everyone in the industry
because there&#8217;s some level of guilt by association going on,&#8221;
Bern said. &#8220;With oil continuing to spew out in the Gulf of
Mexico, the whole industry is going to be set back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Profits at Honda Motor Co. may be
cut by as much as 10 billion yen ($109 million), Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said, after the Japanese automaker suffered its worst
strikes in 18 years of making cars in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wage concessions by the company after walkouts that shut
down three parts factories in the past month may reduce net
income by as much as 5 percent, Kota Yuzawa, a Tokyo-based
analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in a report yesterday. Koji Endo,
an analyst in Tokyo at Advanced Research Japan, estimated the
strikes may reduce operating profit by 10 billion yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labor unrest reflects growing pressure for higher pay
in China as the supply of low-cost labor shrinks. Wage increases
will accelerate, posing greatest risk to manufacturers such as
carmakers and technology companies that rely on cheap labor and
have limited pricing power, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Honda can&#8217;t avoid rising labor costs and prices of
purchased parts,&#8221; Endo at Advanced Research Japan said by phone.
Many Chinese cities increased minimum wages this year by about
15 percent to 20 percent from 2009, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honda, Japan&#8217;s second-largest carmaker, fell 0.8 percent to
2,735 yen in Tokyo trading as of 10:28 a.m., while the Nikkei
225 Stock Average lost 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay Raises &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automaker agreed last month to raise pay 24 percent for
workers at a parts plant in Foshan, Guangdong province, to end a
strike that shut down all four of its car factories in China as
they ran out of components. Another Foshan parts supplier was
closed from June 7 to June 10 because of a walkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Motor Corp. told its suppliers that it may be forced
to stop an assembly line in Tianjin, China as early as today
because of a strike at a parts factory in the same city, the
Asahi newspaper reported today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers at the parts plant may have been on strike since
June 15, the newspaper reported, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota is still checking the report, said Tokyo-based
spokesperson Mieko Iwasaki. Niu Yu, a spokesman for the company
in Beijing declined to comment on the details of the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foxconn Technology Group, a Taipei-based assembler of Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPhones, said this month it will double salaries for its
lowest-paid workers after at least 10 employees at its China
factories killed themselves this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third Strike &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third Honda supplier strike, at the Honda Lock (Guangdong)
Co. parts factory in Zhongshan, Guangdong, is suspended until
tomorrow while union leaders and management negotiate over pay.
The plant, which makes key systems, door handles and sensors for
Honda Motor, is a joint venture between Honda Lock and the local
township government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For now, the strike doesn&#8217;t affect Honda&#8217;s sales,&#8221; said
Yoshiyuki Kuroda, a spokesman for the carmaker. &#8220;We are
planning to recover the production volume and expect we can do
so,&#8221; he said, declining to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honda&#8217;s four car factories in China are scheduled to resume
normal operations today after a national holiday, He Hong, a
spokeswoman for the company in Beijing said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees at Honda Lock, who began striking June 9, have
demanded a 72 percent raise to 1,600 yuan ($234) a month and
higher overtime wages, Honda said on June 10. The company has
proposed a 200 yuan pay increase, and union leaders and
management have set a June 18 deadline to reach an agreement,
said Liu Shengqi, a former protest organizer at the factory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations between Honda Lock and workers are continuing,
Honda Motor&#8217;s He in Beijing said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Guangqi Honda Automobile Co., one of Honda&#8217;s two joint
ventures in China, labor costs amounted to the equivalent of
about 6 percent of revenue last year, Credit Suisse analysts led
by Vincent Chan said in a June 14 report. Net income at the unit
could decline 13 percent if wages rose by 20 percent, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. in
Guangzhou, Guangdong, builds models including Accord sedans and
Odyssey minivans and is adding production of the Accord
Crosstour wagon this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross margins at Guangqi Honda this year may shrink 0.2
percent because of rising labor costs and the need to reschedule
production, Steve Man, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co.,
said in a June 15 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The impact would represent an earnings discount of around
4 percent,&#8221; Hong Kong-based Man said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North America Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honda began manufacturing in China in 1992, starting with
motorcycles. The company plans to have capacity to make 830,000
vehicles a year in the nation by the second half of 2012, Chief
Executive Officer Takanobu Ito said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carmaker aims to increase this year&#8217;s sales in China 9
percent to 630,000 vehicles, Ito said in April. Industrywide
sales in China, which surpassed the U.S. to become the world&#8217;s
largest auto market last year, may rise 17 percent to 16 million
this year, the State Information Center said the same month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honda may still boost profits in North America and Asia,
wrote Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Yuzawa, who maintained his &#8220;buy&#8221; rating
on the stock. The carmaker estimates net income will rise 27
percent to 340 billion yen in the fiscal year ending March 31,
thanks to recovering demand in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honda&#8217;s sales in North America, which remains its largest
market, may rise 14 percent to 1.48 million vehicles as the U.S.
recovers from a recession, the company said in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost Production &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honda will likely be able to make up for production lost to
the strikes in China through extra shifts, Yuzawa and Endo said
separately. Yuzawa estimated the production loss at &#8220;several
tens of thousand vehicles.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automakers will need to get used to higher labor costs in
China, said Edwin Merner, who oversees $3 billion as president
of Atlantis Investment Research Corp. in Tokyo. Rising prices
for housing and food &#8220;will mean continuing pressure on wages,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost increases aren&#8217;t likely to deter companies from
manufacturing in China, said Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio
manager at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Japanese companies aren&#8217;t going to China for cheap
labor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a huge market there that&#8217;s expanding
rapidly. The companies need to produce locally in part because
of tariffs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. was sued by
insurer Assured Guaranty Ltd. to recover all claims the
guarantor might have to pay on $378 million of coverage provided
for sewer bonds issued by Jefferson County, Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assured, the top U.S. municipal debt insurer by volume,
said in a lawsuit filed today in New York State Supreme court in
Manhattan that New York-based JPMorgan concealed about $3
million in illegal payments to friends of county commissioners
to ensure it won business with the county. Some of the payments
were then funneled to the officials, the complaint said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Had JPMorgan and the county not misrepresented and
concealed from Assured the true facts regarding the unlawful
payments that JPMorgan made to secure its position as lead
underwriter for the warrants and swap provider for the county,
Assured never would have issued the policies,&#8221; the lawsuit
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assured Guaranty is the second bond insurer to sue JPMorgan
over a $3 billion refinancing of sewer debt that collapsed
during the credit crisis and almost bankrupted the county.
Syncora Guaranty Inc. sued JPMorgan and thee county on April 29
alleging they fraudulently obtained more than $1 billion in
insurance coverage for the sewer bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call and e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan arranged the refinancing of the Jefferson County
sewer system in 2002 and 2003, converting the district&#8217;s fixed-
rate debt -- issued so the sewer system was able to comply with
a 1996 federal consent decree -- into floating-rate bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obligations were paired with more than $5 billion of
interest-rate swaps, meant to lock in lower borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Ratings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financing fell apart in 2008 when the companies
guaranteeing the debt lost their top credit ratings because of
losses on unrelated mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2008 Jefferson County&#8217;s interest costs soared
more than threefold to 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Security Assurance Holdings Inc., which was
acquired by Assured Guaranty in July 2009, provided insurance to
the county, which according to the lawsuit included $352 million
of the sewer bonds and a $26.4 million surety bond. Assured has
paid more than $4 million on the surety bond, the suit said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million settlement
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end a probe
into the sale of bonds and derivatives to Jefferson County. The
SEC sued two former JPMorgan bankers for making undisclosed
payments to friends of county commissioner who owned or worked
at local securities firms that didn&#8217;t do any work on the deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those friends, William Blount, the former chairman
of a Montgomery, Alabama, broker dealer, pleaded guilty to
paying $241,000 in bribes to former Jefferson County Commission
president Larry Langford. Langford, who later became the mayor
of Birmingham, is serving a 15-year sentence in a federal prison
in Kentucky after being convicted of on bribery and fraud
charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Assured Guranty Municipal Corp. F/K/A/
Financial Security Assurance Inc., V. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
650642, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Walt Disney Co. Chief
Executive Officer Michael Eisner said in a 1999 e-mail that
&#8220;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&#8221; was as important to Disney&#8217;s
ABC network as its National Football League deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisner, in a second 1999 e-mail also presented today at a
trial, estimated the value of the rights to the game show at
$1 billion and said it would turn ABC around. The e-mails were
introduced as evidence by lawyers for the show&#8217;s creator, which
accuses Disney, the world&#8217;s largest media company, of cheating
it out of its share of the profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Of course we own it and it costs almost nothing,&#8221; Eisner
said in an Aug. 24, 1999, message, shown to the federal court
jury in Riverside, California, by Roman Silberfeld, a lawyer for
Celador International Ltd. &#8220;Sometimes the entertainment
business is just wonderful.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Celador sued Disney six years ago, alleging
Disney&#8217;s Buena Vista Television unit broke an implied promise by
failing to negotiate a higher license fee with Disney&#8217;s ABC
television network after the show became a hit. That prevented
Buena Vista from making a bigger profit that it would have had
to share with the creators, according to London-based Celador. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisner&#8217;s e-mails were allowed as evidence because the
former CEO, who left Burbank, California-based Disney in 2005,
is out of the country and can&#8217;t testify at the trial. The
creators seek more than $200 million in damages for the network
run of &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; as well as $16 million for merchandising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s failure to deliver
a tablet-friendly version of Windows is forcing big computer
makers like Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc. to rely on rival
software to help them keep up with Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 7, the most recent version of Microsoft&#8217;s operating
system, is too unwieldy for an iPad-like device, said David Daoud, an analyst at IDC. A lighter edition won&#8217;t be ready until
the fourth quarter, giving Apple almost a year&#8217;s head start in
the burgeoning market for tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Windows world needs to respond,&#8221; said Daoud, whose
firm is based in Framingham, Massachusetts. &#8220;They will have to
play catch-up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPad&#8217;s success caught much of the PC industry by
surprise. Within two months of the April 3 release, Apple sold 2
million iPads -- more than IDC expected for the entire tablet
industry in 2010. To catch up, Dell and Hewlett-Packard are
turning to Google Inc.&#8217;s Android operating system. Taiwanese
manufacturers that build most of the world&#8217;s PCs said they&#8217;re
dissatisfied with Microsoft&#8217;s current lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t have any choice for now,&#8221; said Joseph Hsu,
chairman and president of Taipei-based manufacturer Micro-Star
International Co., a maker of laptops and computer parts.
Windows 7 is too powerful and consumes too much energy from
batteries, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPad, which can display books, videos and the Internet
on a thin touch screen, will reach sales of 5.5 million units
this year and jump to 13 million next year, according to
Macquarie Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Feedback Is Fair&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Kalkman, a vice president in the Microsoft division
that works with computer makers, said the feedback from PC
manufacturers is &#8220;fair.&#8221; Later this year, Microsoft will
release Windows Embedded Compact 7, which will require less
processing power and reduces the drain on batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has tried for more
than a decade to build a market for tablet-sized personal
computers. Chairman Bill Gates predicted in November 2001 that
the tablet would become the most popular form of PC within five
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for the Windows tablets currently sold by Hewlett-
Packard and Dell has been lackluster, according to IDC. Before
the iPad made its debut this year, the researcher had been
forecasting that sales of tablets would decline to less than 1
percent of the overall PC market in the U.S. IDC had predicted
total shipments of just 523,000 tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passed by Apple &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many customers watching the
World Cup and too few buying software and computers means the
soccer tournament may wind up a &#8220;yellow card&#8221; for earnings at
U.S. technology companies, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quarter coinciding with three of the past five World
Cups, technology companies on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index
had their biggest earnings-per-share misses of the year, Sarah Friar, a San Francisco-based Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote in a
report this week. By contrast, the April-to-June period was the
worst quarter in only three of the past 15 non-tournament years
since 1990, she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;World Cup-year second quarters appear more susceptible to
missing consensus estimates,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;With macro and
currency concerns already weighing on technology stocks, some
view the World Cup as another possible near-term negative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planet&#8217;s most popular sporting event kicked off last
week and is expected to draw half a billion TV viewers globally
by the time it ends July 11, according to FIFA, soccer&#8217;s
governing body. Even in the U.S., where the sport&#8217;s popularity
lags behind American football and basketball, some 14.5 million
people tuned in a match this week between the home team and
England, according to estimates from ratings-company Nielsen Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other fans are using vacation days to attend the matches in
South Africa. Average attendance per game has been 53,019, up
from 52,167 at the same stage of the 2006 World Cup in Germany,
FIFA spokesman Nicolas Maingot said at a news conference in
Johannesburg this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Not Overwhelming&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some impact is a possibility, though the likelihood is not
overwhelming,&#8221; Friar said in the report. She recommends buying
Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. shares and rates SAP AG
&#8220;neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst performance for SP 500 technology companies
during a World Cup quarter in the past 20 years occurred in 1990
when the tournament was held in Italy. More than 50 percent of
the companies fell short of analysts&#8217; average estimates,
according to Friar&#8217;s report. The U.S.-hosted 1994 World Cup and
the 2002 games in Japan and Korea also coincided with quarters
that were worse than the rest of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For investors concerned about the impact, Friar notes that
the round of 16 will fall at the end of the second quarter,
while the later rounds take place at the beginning of the third
quarter. The final is scheduled July 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information technology sub-index of the SP 500 has
risen 3.7 percent since June 11, when the tournament started,
while the broader index gained 2.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

rejected Dell Inc. Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell&#8217;s offer
to assist Russia&#8217;s computer industry at the World Economic Forum
in Davos, Medvedev will ask investors to help build a Russian
&#8220;Silicon Valley&#8221; to cut the country&#8217;s oil addiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Medvedev is on a very serious marketing campaign right
now,&#8221; said Jack Barbanel, managing director at Moscow-based
Strategic Investment Group, which focuses on technology and
healthcare in the former Soviet republics. &#8220;It&#8217;s a major change
because previously Russia wasn&#8217;t doing much.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s plans to attract economic development and the
latest technology will be among the main themes of at the annual
St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Arkady Dvorkovich,
Medvedev&#8217;s top economic adviser, told reporters yesterday. The
forum starts tomorrow and runs through June 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Putin&#8217;s eight-year presidency, Russia staked its
economic development on energy, as crude oil prices jumped to a
record $145 a barrel in July 2008, from an average of $30 in
2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s dependence on natural resources helped produce the
steepest contraction among emerging markets last year, when the
economy shrank a record 7.9 percent. China&#8217;s economy expanded
8.7 percent in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian &#8216;Silicon Valley&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medvedev, Putin&#8217;s handpicked successor who took office in
2008, has turned modernization into a mantra repeated by cabinet
ministers, homegrown billionaires and foreign investors. One of
the first owners of an Apple Inc. iPhone in Russia, the 44-year-
old president is basing Russia&#8217;s renewal on attracting money and
expertise from the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centerpiece of Medvedev&#8217;s program is Skolkovo, a Moscow
suburb where he plans to recreate California&#8217;s Silicon Valley.
The government plans to spend 110.5 billion rubles ($3.5
billion) on the project through 2015, the newspaper Vedomosti
reported last week, citing a draft of the 2011 federal budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The direction of the country&#8217;s economy should be moved
toward more value-added products, including high-tech,&#8221;
billionaire Viktor Vekselberg told reporters June 8 in Moscow.
Medvedev asked Vekselberg, who made his fortune in oil and
aluminum, to oversee the project in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Top-Down Direction&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo said June 3 that his company
wants to be a founding member of the Skolkovo project. In April
Medvedev named Craig Barrett, a former head of Intel Corp., as
co-chairman of Skolkovo&#8217;s supervisory board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the U.S. there is interest and willingness to test the
waters, but we need to know more before committing resources,&#8221;
said Charles Kupchan Eurasia Group, a New York-based political
risk consultant. &#8220;We have yet to see from Moscow an
appreciation that innovation comes from competition, not top-
down direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;primitive and humiliating&#8221; reliance on raw materials,
has tamed Russia&#8217;s ambitions, Medvedev said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO Gazprom, Russia&#8217;s state-run natural gas monopoly, said
in 2007 that it would become the world&#8217;s biggest company, with a
market value of $1 trillion, as early as 2014. Gazprom&#8217;s market
value is now a third of the $340 billion it peaked at two years
ago, when the company trailed only Irving, Texas-based Exxon
Mobil Corp. and Beijing-based PetroChina Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top two companies retain their places, while Apple and
Microsoft occupy third and fourth, followed by Industrial 
Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and China Mobile Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In 1990 Russian GDP was equal to China&#8217;s. Now it&#8217;s three
to four times smaller,&#8221; Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie
Moscow Center, said last week. &#8220;It&#8217;s no big deal to see the
tail of the U.S., but it is when you see China&#8217;s tail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corruption, Red Tape &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a group of U.S. venture capitalists met with Medvedev
last month, the Russian side was ready to acknowledge risks.
Weak legal protections, corruption, red tape and Russia&#8217;s
vulnerability to commodity price volatility hinder investment,
according to a presentation by Anatoly Chubais, head of state-
run Russian Nanotechnologies Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Expectations are high and we hope that in St. Petersburg
we won&#8217;t just hear nice speeches but get a concrete package of
measures,&#8221; Klaus Mangold, chief eastern Europe lobbyist for
Germany&#8217;s BDI industry group, said in an interview. &#8220;Russia
doesn&#8217;t have a problem recognizing its problems. It has a
problem implementing solutions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adolor Corp. said two drugs being
developed with Pfizer Inc. were no more effective than a placebo
at controlling pain from osteoarthritis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trial with more than 400 patients found neither of the
compounds, ADL5859 and ADL5747, showed a &#8220;statistically
significant&#8221; improvement over the placebo, or dummy pill, in
reducing pain, Exton, Pennsylvania-based Adolor said today in
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that a third medicine, oxycodone CR
-- a generic not made by Adolor-- also was no more effective
than a placebo. The drugs were being tested in patients with
arthritis of the knee. About 46 million U.S. adults have been
diagnosed with arthritis, and the disease limits activities for
about 19 million of those, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, based in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We obviously are disappointed with the results of the
study,&#8221; Eliseo Salinas, Adolor&#8217;s chief medical officer, said in
the statement. &#8220;The extent of the placebo response was
surprising, but unfortunately not unusual in osteoarthritis
studies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adolor&#8217;s shares fell 13 percent in extended trading after
declining 4 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $1.50 at 4 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adolor and New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drug
company, will evaluate the study data to determine if additional
testing of their medicines is warranted, Adolor said in its
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange
Commission pressed JPMorgan Chase  Co. to tell investors more
about mounting demands to buy back defective mortgages, an
obligation that cost the four biggest U.S. lenders about $5
billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC asked the New York-based company to disclose more
about reserves set aside to cover the cost of repurchasing bad
loans it sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other investors,
according to a Jan. 29 letter released today. The SEC also told
the bank to provide more details on when and how it recognizes
losses on mortgages that have been modified as well as on soured
credit-card debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What they&#8217;re asking for is a lot more than the banks put
out in the public domain right now,&#8221; said Christopher Whalen, a
bank analyst at Torrance, California-based Institutional Risk
Analytics. &#8220;This is going to make life uncomfortable for a lot
of the banks, because once they start mandating this kind of
disclosures, it&#8217;s going to stay.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders that sell mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
have to provide warranties assuring that the loans conformed to
the agencies&#8217; standards. With more loans going bad, the
government-sponsored companies are demanding that banks turn
over loan files so they can scour the records for missing
documentation, inaccurate data and fraud, information that can
be used to force loan buybacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, seized by federal regulators in
September 2008, asked the bank to repurchase $2.7 billion in
defective loans in 2009 and $1.4 billion in 2008, JPMorgan said.
The lender held $2 billion in reserves at the end of the first
quarter against future buyback requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defective Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the total requested, JPMorgan repurchased $1.1 billion
in defective loans in 2009 and has offered more than 750,000
borrowers trial modifications to try to &#8220;cure&#8221; their
delinquent loans, JPMorgan said in a separate filing. About
127,000 received permanent repayment plans. The bank&#8217;s mortgage
portfolio swelled to $292.6 billion from $115.8 billion from
2006 through 2008. The company&#8217;s response to the SEC sheds new
light on the company&#8217;s worst-performing loans made during the
housing boom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In requesting the information, SEC staff told JPMorgan
Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh that their comments and
the company&#8217;s response &#8220;do not foreclose the commission from
taking any action with respect to the filing.&#8221; The SEC
concluded its review of JPMorgan&#8217;s loan-loss disclosures, which
the bank included in a Jan. 15 securities filing, on May 3. SEC
spokesman John Heine and JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Demands &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before 2008, demands from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
weren&#8217;t significant, JPMorgan told the SEC in its March 2
response. &#8220;However, beginning in 2008, JPMorgan Chase
experienced a higher volume of demands; these demand volumes
have steadily increased every quarter,&#8221; Corporate Controller
Louis Rauchenberger told the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington-based Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in McLean,
Virginia, may ask U.S. banks to repurchase $17.2 billion in
faulty loans this year, Oppenheimer  Co. analyst Chris Kotowski
estimated. Kotowski said in a June 9 report that U.S. banks
could lose $6 billion this year when those loans are returned
and get marked down to their true value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a problem that will continue to drag on the big
banks to the tune of several hundred million per quarter, but
it&#8217;s not a problem that is mushrooming out of control,&#8221;
Kotowski said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third Parties &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan told the SEC that 75 percent of its current
repurchase requests stem from loans originated in 2007 and 2008
and that it is able to file claims against third-party
originators on 40 percent of all repurchase requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC questioned the bank&#8217;s calculations for its
allowance for loan losses, relating to breaches in the
agreements it has with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other
mortgage investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Estimating the allowance is highly subjective, and is
further complicated by limited and rapidly changing historical
data and uncertainty surrounding numerous external factors,&#8221;
JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, alleged that Mylan Inc., the biggest U.S. generic
pharmaceuticals maker, infringed three patents for Sutent, a
drug used to treat cancerous tumors of the digestive tract and
kidneys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s lawsuit contends Mylan violated its patent rights
by filing an application with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to market copies of Sutent before the patents
expire, according to the complaint filed yesterday in federal
court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sutent has annual sales of about $1 billion&#8221; and
&#8220;Pfizer will suffer irreparable injury&#8221; unless the
infringement is stopped, the company&#8217;s lawyers said in court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, New York-based Pfizer said it halted a study of
Sutent as a treatment for advanced liver cancer after observing
complications in test patients. The company said it will
continue studying Sutent&#8217;s use to fight other types of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan, based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, reported sales of
$5.09 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Laffin, a spokesman for Mylan, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 20 cents to $15.28 at 12:24 p.m. New
York time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer Inc. v. Mylan Inc., 10CV528, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emergency-room visits from abuse of
prescription and over-the-counter medicines doubled in the U.S.
in four years, matching for the first time the number of
overdoses of illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulator-approved treatments were implicated in a record 1
million patients who sought help at hospital emergency
departments in 2008, twice the number as in 2004, according to a
study released today by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, in Atlanta. Overdoses from illicit drugs were
unchanged, at 1 million emergency visits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most hospitalizations were caused by painkillers, with
visits more than doubling, and tranquilizers, with an 89 percent
increase. King Pharmaceuticals Inc., in Bristol Tennessee, and
Purdue Pharma LP, in Stamford, Connecticut, won approval in the
last year for drugs to prevent misuse. A half-dozen drugmakers
are developing pain pills that resist abuse methods such as
crushing, dissolving in alcohol, and taking more than needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Additional measures are needed urgently,&#8221; researchers
wrote in the CDC&#8217;s Morbidity  Mortality Weekly Report. &#8220;Recent
public health and law enforcement measures intended to prevent
nonmedical use of such drugs have not prevented rate
increases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s painkiller Celebrex
causes less bleeding and fewer ulcers in the gastrointestinal
tract than a combination of generic pain pills and heartburn
drugs, a company-funded study found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthritis patients taking Celebrex were four times less
likely to start bleeding anywhere from the stomach to the colon
than those given the generic pain drug diclofenac and
AstraZeneca Plc&#8217;s Prilosec, a heartburn medicine that reduces
acid production. The six-month study was presented today at the
Congress of the European League Against Rheumatism in Rome and
published in The Lancet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because chronic use of traditional painkillers is linked to
ulcers, doctors recommend either Celebrex or combination
treatment for arthritis patients who need regular treatment.
While previous studies showed they have similar effects on the
stomach, this is the first to examine the entire digestive
tract. The findings should be taken into account when
prescribing pain treatment for arthritis sufferers, the
researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study &#8220;has provided new data relevant to patients
requiring anti-inflammatory therapy,&#8221; said the researchers, led
by Francis K.L. Chan from the department of medicine at Prince
of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results come from one of two studies New York-based
Pfizer is counting on to boost sales of Celebrex. The drug never
fully recovered after the product&#8217;s main rival, Merck  Co.&#8217;s
Vioxx, was pulled off the market because of its ties to heart
attacks in 2004. Celebrex sales peaked at $3.3 billion that
year. The drug generated $2.4 billion in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too Short &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists tracked 4,484 patients with osteoarthritis
or rheumatoid arthritis who were at risk for developing ulcers
or other gastrointestinal problems. After six months, 0.9
percent on Celebrex and 3.8 percent given the pain and heartburn
combination developed bleeding, ulcers or anemia. More patients
getting the combination dropped out of the study because of side
effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short duration of the study limits its usefulness,
since arthritis patients tend to take the drugs for years, Elham
Rahme and Sasha Bernatsky from McGill University Health Center
in Montreal, wrote in a Lancet editorial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. faces a Texas trial over
its hormone-replacement drugs after a court overseeing lawsuits
over the medicines sent 200 cases back to their home courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge in Galveston, Texas, last week set a May 2011 trial
date for Karen Zahn&#8217;s claims against Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit. Zahn
says in her suit that the Prempro menopause drug helped cause
her breast cancer. It&#8217;s one of the first of more than 8,000
lawsuits over the medicine consolidated in federal court in
Arkansas to be returned for trial, plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Wilson in Little Rock,
Arkansas, is supervising pretrial proceedings in the cases
against Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn, another Pfizer unit. He
returned the 200 cases to their courts in March and told lawyers
to get another 400 ready to be sent back later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer is now going to have to gear up and hire lawyers
all over the country to try these cases,&#8221; said Carl Tobias, a
professor at the University of Richmond law school who teaches
classes on mass-tort law. &#8220;That makes things more expensive and
may provide some incentive to settle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took the menopause drugs to treat
symptoms such as hot flashes and mood swings before a 2002 study
highlighted their links to cancer. Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the
medicines, which are still on the market, topped $2 billion
before the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative study concluded they posed
an increased breast-cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menopause Medicines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with Upjohn&#8217;s progestin-laden
Provera, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth later combined the two
hormones in its Prempro pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of New York-based Pfizer said while Wilson has
sent back some cases, he refused plaintiffs&#8217; requests to send
back all the suits at one time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No decision has been made about how many additional cases
will be remanded or when,&#8221; Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder said in
an e-mailed statement. It also isn&#8217;t clear how many of the
remanded cases will go to trial, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, plaintiffs May 25 dismissed a case filed by
Linda Cardwell that Wilson sent back to a federal court in
Alexandria, Virginia, Loder noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides still must exchange case-specific information on
the remanded claims, Loder said. Pfizer lawyers also may ask
judges to throw some cases out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson is overseeing cases as part of the multidistrict
litigation system, which allows suits filed in courts around the
U.S. to be consolidated before a single judge for pretrial
hearings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saving on Expenses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once pretrial information exchanges are done, the cases are
sent back to the courts where they were originally filed for
trial. Consolidation cuts down on expenses for both sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such consolidations often lead to so-called global
settlements of litigations over drugs. In 2000, Wyeth agreed to
a $3.76 billion accord to resolve suits over its fen-phen diet
combination after the cases were consolidated before a federal
judge in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loder refused to comment on whether Pfizer will seek to
settle the remaining Prempro cases before Wilson. The company
faces at least 8,000 Prempro claims, Wyeth officials said in a
2009 regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer will continue to vigorously defend its hormone
therapy medicines,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;We do not comment
on the number of cases pending, nor do we comment on our legal
strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13,000 Cases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer for women suing over the menopause
drugs, said she expects to have many of the 200 cases set for
trial within the next 12 months. She estimates there may be more
than 13,000 Prempro cases pending before Wilson and state court
judges in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most of the hard work has been done on these cases, and
it&#8217;s time for women to get their days in court,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Littlepage represents Zahn, a retired school receptionist
from Manvel, Texas. The 57-year-old woman took Prempro for
almost three years starting in January 1999. She was diagnosed
with breast cancer in November 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt in Houston on June 9 set
the trial of Zahn&#8217;s suit in Galveston for next May 16,
Littlepage said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth has lost seven out of the 11 jury trials over the
menopause drugs. The drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown
out at the post-trial stage and or had awards reduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3,000 Cases Dismissed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases at
either the pretrial stage or after the cases have been set for
trials, Loder said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge in Philadelphia refused last month to throw out a
$9.4 million jury award to a woman who blamed Prempro for her
breast cancer. The case is on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, completed its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth last year. It acquired Upjohn in 2003
as part of a $54 billion buyout of Pharmacia Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upjohn has lost all three cases juries have considered over
Provera. A Pennsylvania judge ruled last month the Pfizer unit
deserved a new trial in a 2007 case that ended with a $1.5
million jury award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Prempro Products, 03-CV-015070-WRW, U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas (Little
Rock). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.K. court has found Total SA and
Chevron Corp. guilty of failing to prevent the Buncefield fire
in a fuel depot in north London in 2005, according to the Health
and Safety Executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the largest fire in peacetime Europe tore through
the Buncefield site on that Sunday morning in December 2005,
these companies had failed to protect workers, members of the
public and the environment,&#8221; the HSE said today in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd., operator of the depot, is a
venture between Paris-based Total, which holds 60 percent in the
company, and San Ramon, Californa-based Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We understand the decision made by the jury,&#8221; Claire
Elliot, a U.K.-based Total spokeswoman, said by phone. &#8220;We
deeply regret the events at Buncefield and would like to
apologize to all those affected by the incident.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Pipeline Agency Ltd. and TAV Engineering Ltd. were
among companies that were also found guilty or pleaded guilty to
various charges related to the fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buncefield oil depot is about 25 miles north of London
and supplies jet fuel by pipeline to Heathrow, Europe&#8217;s busiest
airport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Philips Electronics NV,
Europe&#8217;s biggest consumer-electronics maker, sued Palm Inc. for
patent royalties on the industry standard for storing compressed
images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips filed a complaint June 15 in federal court in San
Francisco, claiming certain Palm Treo model mobile-phones and
Palm Zire personal digital assistants infringe a patent that&#8217;s
related to the JPEG standard for images. The patent expired in
2007 and U.S. patent law lets Philips seek royalties from 2004,
Bjorn Teuwsen, a spokesman for Amsterdam-based Philips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have tried to come to a license agreement with Palm
for some years,&#8221; Teuwsen said in an e-mail. &#8220;We were left with
no other option than to start patent litigation against Palm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunnyvale, California-based Palm is being bought by
Hewlett-Packard Co. for $1.2 billion. Lynn Fox, a spokeswoman
for Palm, didn&#8217;t immediately return a message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips is represented by Victoria Q. Smith, Alan Grimaldi,
Brian Rosenthal and Brian Andrea of Washington&#8217;s Howrey LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. Philips Corp. v. Palm Inc., 10cv2623, U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California (San
Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm Faces Complaint to EU Over Antitrust Breach &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm Inc. is facing a new complaint over claims it
breached European Union antitrust rules related to patent
royalty demands, less than a year after the EU&#8217;s executive
agency dropped a similar investigation into the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icera Inc., a maker of wireless chips, has lodged a
complaint with the European Commission, Qualcomm said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday. The complaint &#8220;alleges that
Qualcomm has engaged in anticompetitive activity,&#8221; the company
said, adding that &#8220;matters are at a very preliminary stage and
we are currently reviewing the allegations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brussels-based commission, the antitrust agency for the
27-nation EU, in November dropped a four-year probe into the
company that started after competitors complained the chipmaker
was charging excessive royalties on patents. Qualcomm, the
world&#8217;s biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, said the
latest complaint is similar to previous ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the new allegations to be equally meritless&#8221;
as the ones made in previous complaints, the San Diego-based
company said. &#8220;Qualcomm will cooperate fully with the
commission, as we have done in the past.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the commission&#8217;s antitrust
unit, said the regulator had received a complaint. &#8220;We&#8217;re
looking into it and are in a fact-finding stage,&#8221; she said in
an interview in Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sally Doherty, a spokeswoman for Bristol, England-based
Icera, declined to immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Gets New U.S. Patent For Internet-based Social Networking &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc., the world&#8217;s largest online retailer, is
getting into the social-networking space, if a newly issued
patent is any indication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seattle-based company&#8217;s patent 7,739,139, issued June
15, is for a computer-based social-network system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism described in the patent sounds much like some
of the features of Palo Alto, California&#8217;s Facebook Inc.&#8217;s
social networking system, including the ability for users to
identify contacts of their contacts, automatic notification of
personal-information updated by their contacts, and the ability
of users to identify others by their affiliation with schools or
other organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology covered by the patent contains privacy
features enabling users to &#8220;selectively establish contact
relationships or connections with other users, and to grant
permissions for such other users to view personal information of
the use.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon applied for the patent in May 2008, and was assisted
in the application process by Knobbe, Martens, Olson  Bear LLP
of Irvine, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Sues Mylan Over Infringement of Three Patents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, alleged that
Mylan Inc., the biggest U.S. generic pharmaceuticals maker,
infringed three patents for Sutent, a drug used to treat
cancerous tumors of the digestive tract and kidneys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s lawsuit contends Mylan violated its patent rights
by filing an application with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to market copies of Sutent before the patents
expire, according to the complaint filed yesterday in federal
court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sutent has annual sales of about $1 billion&#8221; and
&#8220;Pfizer will suffer irreparable injury&#8221; unless the
infringement is stopped, the company&#8217;s lawyers said in court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, New York-based Pfizer said it halted a study of
Sutent as a treatment for advanced liver cancer after observing
complications in test patients. The company said it will
continue studying Sutent&#8217;s use to fight other types of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan, based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, reported sales of
$5.09 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Laffin, a spokesman for Mylan, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dispute are patents 6,573,293; 7,125,905; and 7,211,600. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer Inc. v. Mylan Inc., 10CV528, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel Persuades Court Its &#8216;iXL&#8217; Mark Doesn&#8217;t Infringe Quia&#8217;s &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel Inc., the largest toymaker in the world, can
continue to use &#8220;iXL&#8221; for its &#8220;multi-tech, six-in-one smart
device for preschoolers&#8221;, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quia Corp. sued Mattel May 3 in federal court in San
Francisco, claiming the toymaker infringed its &#8220;IXL&#8221;
trademark. The suit stems from advertisements by Mattel and
Fisher-Price for a &#8220;multi-tech, six-in-one smart device for
preschoolers&#8221; that is marketed as &#8220;iXL.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Mateo, California-based Quia, a maker of
educational software, said it feared its IXL product will be
drowned out or diminished because of the &#8220;significant Web
presence and financial prowess&#8221; of Mattel, and its &#8220;robust
corporate customers&#8221; such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Toys &#8220;R&#8221;
Us Inc. and Target Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel wasn&#8217;t convinced by Quia&#8217;s
complaint. In an 18-page order issued June 15, he said the
typical purchaser of Mattel&#8217;s toy and the cost of Quia&#8217;s
software meant that care would be taken in the purchase and
consumers were unlikely to confuse the two products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did order that El Segundo, California-based Mattel use a
disclaimer on its packaging saying its IXL Learning System and
related software &#8220;bear no relationship&#8221; to the Quia Corp. and
its products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quia was represented by J. Michael Keyes and Kathryn Mary
Wheble of KL Gates LLP of Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel&#8217;s lawyers were Bobby A. Ghajar, Peter Edward Moll,
and Robert Nathan Phillips from Washington-based Howrey LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Quia Corp. v. Mattel Inc., 5:10-cv-01902-JF,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese Producers Dominate $8.2 Billion EU Counterfeit Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese producers, with the aid of organized criminal
networks, control the $8.2 billion European market for designer-
clothes knockoffs, fake electronics and uninspected airplane
parts, the United Nations says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customs officials can&#8217;t keep up with shipments of bogus
products from China that have followed a surge in European
imports from Asia in the last decade, said Antonio Maria Costa,
director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see a relatively fixed portion of trade being
illegitimate, piggyback riding on the legitimate trade,&#8221; he
said in a June 10 interview in Vienna. &#8220;You have a gigantic
trade market exploding&#8221; and the absence of global regulation
&#8220;inevitably brings along the emergence of this counterfeit
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European criminal gangs are helping to distribute phony
Chinese goods, according to the UN, which yesterday released a
300-page study on international organized crime. The report
comes while the European Union considers broadening duties on
Chinese goods because of alleged state subsidies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a dramatic number of counterfeits in
manufacturing,&#8221; Costa said. &#8220;When we climb on a plane, there
is a risk that some of parts have been pirated and therefore
don&#8217;t meet specifications.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
said in 2007 that the international trade in counterfeit goods
is worth about $176 billion, accounting for around 2 percent of
global trade. Chinese producers have 55 percent, the United Arab
Emirates has 12 percent and Taiwanese manufacturers have 10
percent of the European market in fake products, according to
the UN report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU and China have discussed restricting shipments of
phony goods to Europe in the past. Chinese customs authorities
seized $490 million worth of counterfeit items last year, up
from $221 million in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, customs officials seize an average of more than
130 counterfeit shipments a day, the vast majority of which come
from China, the UN reported. The 27-nation bloc imported 769
billion euros ($930 billion) of Chinese goods in 2008, according
to Eurostat, the EU&#8217;s statistics office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the $8.2 billion illicit market pales in comparison
with the total market for legitimate trade between China and
Europe, the figure is more than four times larger than French
luxury-maker Hermes International SCA&#8217;s 1.9 billion euros of
revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brewsters Sued for Infringement by Ex-Guns n Roses Manager &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Niven, a songwriter who once managed Guns n Roses and
Great White, sued an Australian performing group for copyright
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He claims Richard and John Brewster, members of Australia&#8217;s
&#8216;The Angels,&#8217; and the Brewster Brothers Trio are using his music
without authorization and compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court June 14,
the songwriter said he had originally contracted with the
Brewsters for IP rights to some of his work for half the monies
they generated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He claims &#8220;it was clear&#8221; that the parties to the
agreement intended he receive half of all the revenue from the
Brewsters&#8217; use of his work. The Brewsters &#8220;never intended to
perform under the contract,&#8221;  and &#8220;deliberately attempted to
take advantage&#8221; of him, he claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niven terminated the Brewsters&#8217; rights to use of his
material in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2007, he says he received an e-mail from the
Brewster Brothers&#8217; manager telling him that despite his having
written &#8220;some fabulous lyrics&#8221; in the past, &#8220;you can&#8217;t string
a coherent sentence together&#8221; and &#8220;you&#8217;re over the hill ole
bud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brewsters continued to use Niven&#8217;s materials, including
several of his songs on their album &#8220;Wounded Healer,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked the court to order the Brewsters to quit using his
material, and for an award of &#8220;all profits&#8221; they made through
the use of his work. He&#8217;s also seeking destruction of any
infringing material in their possession, money damages, attorney
fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niven also asked for the court to order the Brewsters to
issue him a public apology, and to return several of his guitars
in their possession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is represented by Mark Karish and Alfred Eric Bjorgum of
Los Angeles-based Karish  Bjorgum PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Alan Niven v. Richard Brewster, 2:10-cv-04376-
GAF-PJW, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BNP
Paribas SA are issuing certificates linked to BP Plc that give
investors a bigger chance of making money than if they bought
the company&#8217;s stock directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade off on the so-called discount certificates is
that the size of any upside from an increase in BP&#8217;s share price
is limited. The notes allow investors to buy BP at below market
rates, with the extent of the discount dependent on the
volatility in the share price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP price volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
stock, soared to more than 90 percent this week, from about 18
percent in April before the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of
Mexico exploded, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
London-based company&#8217;s shares have slumped 44 percent to 368
pence ($5.34) since April 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have high volatility on the underlying, which means
that the product is cheaper to structure and is more interesting
for the customer in terms of return,&#8221; said Gregoire Toublanc,
head of German listed products distribution at BNP Paribas in
Frankfurt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discount note contains embedded derivatives that allow
banks to offer investors assets at below-market prices, but cap
gains at a pre-set level. The value of the derivatives increases
as volatility rises, which allows issuers to create the notes
more cheaply and offer a deeper discount to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs offered 18 series of discount certificates,
which began trading today, according to the bank&#8217;s website.
Paris-based BNP Paribas sold 30 BP-linked discount certificates
June 16 with a nominal value of 48 million euros ($59 million).
Both issues are listed on Germany&#8217;s Stuttgart and Frankfurt
stock exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discounted Shares &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of BNP Paribas&#8217;s notes allows investors to buy BP at
the equivalent of 234 pence a share, about a 30 percent discount
to the closing price on June 16, with a cap at 320 pence. If BP
is below 320 at the note&#8217;s maturity on Dec. 17, holders get the
cash value of the shares at the prevailing rate, creating the
potential for a loss if the stock is less than 234 pence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s BP-linked notes offer different levels of
risk and return. The highest paying certificate, which matures
on Sept. 17, offers an initial entry level of 3.14 euros, or
262.4 pence, with a cap of 380 pence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP rose 14.6 pence, or 4 percent, to 374.25 at 11:12 a.m.
in London. The stock fell to a 13-year low of 337 pence June 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale SA and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
have also issued certificates linked to BP in the last two weeks
to capitalize on increased volatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured notes are bank-issued securities that combine
bonds and derivatives, contracts whose value is derived from
stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. Banks earn fees from
issuing structured products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, investors
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Carlyle Group put up
$500 million in seed money to hunt for oil in the deep waters
of the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the BP Plc oil spill, smaller Gulf operators such
as the Goldman startup, Cobalt International Energy Inc., may
be swept up in a wave of consolidation as the regulatory
landscape tilts in favor of larger firms, said William Herbert, an analyst at Houston-based Simmons  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tougher rules are likely to boost costs and slow the
pace of drilling, said Scott Van Bergh, co-head of Americas
energy and power investment banking at Bank of America Corp.
Companies may also face higher liability caps and
requirements to post some clean-up costs in advance. That may
make drilling in the Gulf feasible for only the world&#8217;s
largest energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Total
SA, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Norway&#8217;s Statoil ASA and
Australian miner BHP Billiton Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules Congress enacts &#8220;are likely to favor larger
operators over smaller ones,&#8221; Van Bergh said. &#8220;People are
thinking about who will want to exit, and who will want to
become consolidators.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP Firepower &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt, founded in Houston in 2005 by the former
president of Unocal Corp., Joseph Bryant, operates in the
deep waters of the Gulf and the West African coast and went
public last year. The shares lost about 44 percent since the
spill on April 20, giving Cobalt a market value of about $2.8
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houston-based Plains Exploration  Production Co., with
a market value of about $3.3 billion, and Cobalt may be
targets for BHP, the world&#8217;s largest mining company,
according to a report last month by Deutsche Bank AG analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP already has four operating energy projects in the
Gulf, three of which are joint ventures with BP. The
Melbourne-based company has the &#8220;firepower to do enormous
things,&#8221; J. Michael Yeager, the chief executive officer of
BHP&#8217;s petroleum unit, said on a May 24 conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP is capable of spending as much as $20 billion to
acquire Gulf assets, including BP project stakes that may come
up for sale, Citigroup Inc. Sydney-based analyst Clarke Wilkins
said in an interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Public Enemy&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BP is public enemy number one in the U.S. at the moment,
and if there is any forced divestment of assets, BHP is in a
strong position to be able to pick them up,&#8221; Wilkins said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP, a partner with BP in the Atlantis, Mad Dog and
Gunflint ventures, may increase its stakes in those projects, he
said. BP&#8217;s share of those assets is worth $11 billion, Wilkins
estimated in a June 16 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Buckley, a spokeswoman for BHP, said the company
doesn&#8217;t comment on speculation. Cobalt spokesman Rich Smith
didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. Andrea Raphael of
Goldman Sachs declined to comment, as did a spokesman for
Riverstone Holdings LLC, which sponsors a fund with Carlyle
that invested in Cobalt. Spokespeople for Plains didn&#8217;t
return calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil and gas business is one of the busier sectors in
a slumping merger market this year, accounting for $68.8
billion of deals, or about 8.4 percent of the total across
all industries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Oil
and gas deals accounted for 5.9 percent of global takeovers
during the previous decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Buoyant Market&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy mergers and acquisitions may produce a &#8220;buoyant
market&#8221; in 2010, according to Wood Mackenzie Consultants Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it may be months or years before Gulf players get
a clear enough understanding of the new regulatory
environment to do deals, said Bank of America&#8217;s Van Bergh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department has begun a probe into the
BP oil leak, and President Barack Obama put a six-month ban
on offshore drilling. Congress is also considering removing
the $75 million limit on economic losses from oil spills that
large companies must pay. BP agreed this week to set up a $20
billion fund to pay victims and the spill had cost it more
than $1.2 billion as of June 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Costs will go up to operate in the region and that
could make it quite difficult for smaller companies,&#8221; said
Peter Chilton, an investment analyst at Sydney-based
Constellation Capital Management Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko, Noble &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changing economics of deep-water drilling have
prompted investor doubts about one $2.7 billion deal struck
just before the spill. Mariner Energy Inc. shares dropped
about 7.7 percent since the spill amid concern an agreed sale
to Apache Corp. may unravel. Apache is committed to
completing the deal and expects to do so after getting
regulatory and shareholder approval, probably in the third
quarter, said spokesman Bill Mintz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s too early to say how the BP spill will affect
Total&#8217;s plans for exploration, said Phenelope Semavoine, a
spokeswoman for Total in Paris. Alan Jeffers of Exxon Mobil
and Paula Almada of Petrobras declined to comment. Ola Morten Aanestad, a Statoil spokesman, didn&#8217;t return a call for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today the industry is focused very much on the spill
itself, but we believe that many are thinking about what the
longer-term implications will be as an operator in the deep-
water Gulf,&#8221; said Bank of America&#8217;s Van Bergh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko, Noble &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Noble Energy Inc. are among
companies that may opt to sell their deep-water Gulf assets,
according to Simmons&#8217;s Herbert. Anadarko, which owns a stake
in BP&#8217;s leaking well, has dropped 43 percent since the spill.
Houston-based Noble, which got about 10 percent of 2009
production from the deep-water Gulf, is down 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko said on June 3 it may shift capital spending to
projects outside the Gulf. The Woodlands, Texas-based company
got about a fourth of its production from the Gulf in 2009,
according to a regulatory filing. Spokesmen for Anadarko and
Noble declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risk premium for deep-water, highly pressured
reserves has gone up,&#8221; Herbert said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a seller&#8217;s
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korean stocks may rally 17
percent by the end of the year as improving corporate earnings
help draw more foreigners after the biggest influx of overseas
funds in more than two months, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark Kospi stock index may rise to 2,000 by the
end of the year, said Scott YH Seo, Seoul head of equity
research at JPMorgan who&#8217;s ranked third for Korean research by
Institutional Investor. The gauge fell 0.1 percent 1,706.11 as
of 1:57 p.m. in Seoul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas investors bought a net 982 billion won ($814
million) of shares on the Kospi this week, set for the biggest
weekly purchase since the five days ended April 9, according to
Koscom Corp., which provides financial data from the Korea
Exchange Inc. They sold a record 1.24 trillion won of Korean
equities on May 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;More foreign funds will come in the second half as
earnings are in good shape and as the European sovereign debt
problems stabilize,&#8221; Seo said in an interview today. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
buying opportunity for Korean stocks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korean equity prices assume sovereign debt risks in
some European countries will spread even when the issue is seen
as &#8220;manageable,&#8221; Seo said. Foreign funds may also invest in
Korean stocks on expectations the won will appreciate, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark measure dropped 11 percent from April 26 to
May 25 as concerns over the European crisis were compounded by
increased tensions between South and North Korea. It has since
rebounded 9.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Revision &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing upward revisions for corporate earnings this
year and next, and we believe the U.S. and European economies
are poised to improve further,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seo, 44, said South Korean equities are &#8220;cheap,&#8221;
especially for financial stocks. Share prices of banks already
factor any possible funding difficulties from Europe as well as
economic volatilities that could affect small- and medium-sized
corporate clients, he said, even though the chances for such
events are low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuation for the 762-member Kospi has fallen to 10.3 times
estimated earnings from a multiple of 16 a year ago. That makes
South Korea the cheapest stock market in Asia after Pakistan,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSCI Upgrade? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seo said it&#8217;s unlikely South Korean market will be upgraded
as a developed market by MSCI Inc. this year. A removal of the
nation from emerging markets will bring imbalance given the
heavy weighting of machinery, shipbuilding, engineering and
technology companies among the country&#8217;s stocks, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea has been under review by MSCI for a possible
upgrade since 2008. The company left the nation&#8217;s status
unchanged last year and said it will evaluate South Korea for a
reclassification this year. MSCI will announce its latest review
next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&#8217;s Kospi may rise to 1,900 in the second half as
a global economic recovery and stable commodity prices boost the
nation&#8217;s corporate earnings, Seok Yun, Seoul head of research at
Credit Suisse Group AG, said in a June 4 interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., a sponsor of this week&#8217;s U.S. Open golf tournament, is
counting on Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and the rest of the
world&#8217;s top golfers to showcase its Web technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company developed a smartphone app that lets users
track the tournament and players&#8217; statistics. It even shows a
so-called heat map of the course in Pebble Beach, California,
revealing the most challenging holes. IBM also helps manage
security, video and other features for the U.S. Open&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s strategy isn&#8217;t about reaching more golf-loving
consumers. Instead, it wants to show business customers how its
technology can handle a huge surge in traffic without breaking
the bank. While the number of people using the U.S. Open site
jumped from a year earlier, IBM was able to cut the cost per
user by 25 percent, said John Kent, program manager for the
company&#8217;s sponsorship marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When we talk to our customers about that, they have the
very same issues,&#8221; Kent said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM declined to say how much it spends on the U.S. Open or
what kind of return it gets from the event. The Armonk, New
York-based company also sponsors the Masters Golf Tournament, as
well as the U.S. Open tennis match and Wimbledon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 83 cents to $130.15 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange trading. The shares are little changed this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPad Version &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second year in a row that IBM has offered an
iPhone app for the U.S. Open. About 286,000 people downloaded
the software last year. This time around, it also runs on Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPad and other smartphones such as the Droid. IBM already
had 150,000 downloads by the first day of play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software gives up-to-the-minute scores and data for
each competitor, and the map indicates whether players are
shooting above or below par on each hole. The website also has
high-definition coverage of the tournament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM invites corporate customers to see its Web operations
up close by visiting a trailer near the course. A staff of more
than a dozen, supplied with Twizzlers and a mini-fridge filled
with energy drinks, monitors global Internet security threats
and viewership numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our clients love golf,&#8221; said Rick Singer, IBM&#8217;s vice
president for client executive marketing. &#8220;These relationships
are all about business, and how we can further the perception of
IBM, and really sell stuff.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day of the tournament, the heat map showed the
difficulty of the Pebble Beach course, which is located about
two hours from San Francisco. Woods and Mickelson, the world&#8217;s
two best golfers, failed to make a single birdie -- a score
that&#8217;s one stroke under par -- during the opening round. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside IBM&#8217;s trailer, the heat map was displayed on a 52-
inch flat screen. Kent pointed to a red blob where players were
performing better than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It looks like six is the only &#8216;easy&#8217; hole out there,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. will withdraw its blood
cancer drug Mylotarg after 10 years on the U.S. market because
studies didn&#8217;t prove it works and the treatment was linked to
deaths from liver and lung complications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylotarg, for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia, is the first
medicine to be pulled off the market that was cleared through
the Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s accelerated approval program,
the agency said today in a statement. Pfizer volunteered to halt
sales after trial results raised safety concerns &#8220;and the drug
failed to demonstrate clinical benefit,&#8221; the FDA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylotarg was approved in 2000 based on preliminary data
showing improved remission rates, with a requirement for more
complete trials to prove it extended survival. Wyeth, which sold
Mylotarg before being purchased by Pfizer in October, didn&#8217;t
start mandated follow-up research until 2004 and didn&#8217;t provide
results until this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Accelerated approval still has a place in the approval
process but it&#8217;s also more important that we learn over the
years that the whole development plan be set up well in
advance,&#8221; said Robert Kane, acting deputy director for safety
in the FDA&#8217;s Division of Hematology Products, in a phone
interview today. &#8220;The trials should be planned and if possible
under way when the sponsor submits the application.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., the
world&#8217;s biggest payments networks, climbed more than 4 percent
as the U.S. Congress worked toward a compromise that would
protect transaction fees they charge to banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House will seek to maintain the Senate&#8217;s proposed cap
on debit-card interchange, or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, according to
Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat leading
talks to produce a final regulatory overhaul bill. The plan from
Senator Richard Durbin would empower the Federal Reserve to set
fees charged to merchants that are &#8220;reasonable and
proportional&#8221; to the cost of processing debit transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the counter-proposal becomes law, Visa and MasterCard
still may have to cope with some business-model changes, but
these would likely be less than had been feared,&#8221; Jason Kupferberg, an analyst at UBS AG in New York, said today in a
note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compromise prevents the Fed from regulating &#8220;network
fees&#8221; that Visa and MasterCard charge to banks on each
transaction as long as the fees aren&#8217;t used to &#8220;circumvent&#8221;
interchange regulation, according to Durbin, the Illinois
Democrat and majority whip. Reloadable prepaid cards, including
those used to disburse government benefits, would be exempt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House version also would allow the Fed to consider
fraud-related costs in setting interchange rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were able to reach an agreement which makes minor
changes to strengthen consumer protections and bring competition
to a market where there is none,&#8221; Durbin said in a statement.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve addressed the concerns of states regarding their ability
to provide services to the unemployed and the concerns of small
financial firms regarding their ability to provide services to
the unbanked.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa rose 5 percent to $80.90 at 5:37 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard advanced 4.2 percent to $223.34. Shares of both
companies had fallen about 14 percent from May 3 through June 18
after Durbin said he would seek interchange limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed compromise, which the payments industry
opposes, may fail to survive a bipartisan conference committee
that is scheduled to debate the interchange amendment tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to have concerns that the ultimate outcome of
this legislation would be the passing of merchant acceptance
costs to consumers at a time when Americans can least afford
it,&#8221; MasterCard spokesman James Issokson said in an e-mailed
statement. Visa spokesman Will Valentine declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$20 Billion in Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard and San Francisco-based Visa set interchange
fees and pass the money to card-issuers including Bank of
America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. Interchange is the
largest component of the fees U.S. merchants pay to accept Visa
and MasterCard debit cards. The fees totaled $19.7 billion and
averaged 1.63 percent of each sale last year, according to the
Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate voted 64-33 on May 13 to include the debit-
interchange caps after Durbin agreed to exempt banks with assets
of less than $10 billion, or 99 percent of all U.S. lenders.
That failed to win the support of groups representing credit
unions and community banks, who said the exemption would make
their cards more expensive to accept than those issued by bigger
banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Severe Disadvantage&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed compromise &#8220;falls far short of safeguarding
consumers&#8217; best interests,&#8221; Fred Becker, president of the
National Association of Federal Credit Unions, said today in a
statement. &#8220;This legislation would still put credit unions at a
severe disadvantage compared to large credit-card issuers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 16, after 131 House members signed a letter urging
the conference committee to strip the debit-cap amendment from
the bill, Durbin said he would work to exempt reloadable prepaid
cards used to distribute government benefits. At least 10 state
treasurers including Shane Osborn, a Nebraska Republican, had
said the legislation could hurt those government programs and
their beneficiaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry escaped previous attempts to regulate
interchange on credit cards, which average about 2 percent per
transaction, saying the fees are needed to compensate banks for
the risk of lending money. That argument isn&#8217;t relevant to
interchange on debit cards, which tap funds held in consumer
checking accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durbin said in a June 17 interview that he&#8217;s determined to
push through his amendment and counteract the &#8220;unregulated
power&#8221; wielded by Visa and MasterCard. The companies accounted
for 91 percent of global purchase transactions made with
general-purpose cards last year, according to the Nilson Report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network Competition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compromise legislation would allow merchants to set
minimums and maximums for credit-card purchases and offer
discounts based on the form of payment. A provision that would
have allowed merchants to tailor discounts by card brand was
removed and replaced with a measure that directs the Fed to
issue rules preventing networks from requiring that their debit
cards can only be used on one network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Merchants will have the choice of at least two networks
upon which to run debit transactions,&#8221; Durbin&#8217;s statement said.
The measure &#8220;provides additional competition to a previously
non-competitive part of the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co., the
lender to the owners of Florida&#8217;s Sawgrass Marriott Resort,
failed to win bankruptcy court permission to take over and sell
the company&#8217;s assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul M. Glenn in Jacksonville,
Florida, today denied Goldman&#8217;s request to lift the automatic
stay, a part of the bankruptcy code that shields a company from
creditors&#8217; efforts to collect on its assets. Goldman Sachs
Mortgage is a division of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Commercial Mortgage Capital LP helped finance
the $220.5 million purchase of the 65-acre resort in Ponte Vedra
Beach by RQB Resort LP and RQB Development. New York-based
Goldman Sachs, owed about $192.5 million as of Jan. 10, hasn&#8217;t
been paid since August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The property, purchased in 2006, was valued at $135.3
million in an appraisal ordered by Goldman. David J. O&#8217;Halloran,
chief executive officer for RQB&#8217;s U.S. operation, told the court
the group believes the resort should be valued in the
$90 million to $100 million range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RQB Resort listed assets and debt of as much as $500
million each in Chapter 11 documents filed March 1 in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville. RQB Development also sought
protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RQB sought and received a six-month extension of the
exclusive right to propose a Chapter 11 plan. The new deadline
is Dec. 29. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court rejected
Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s appeal of a verdict for an Arkansas woman who
blamed the company&#8217;s menopause drugs for her breast cancer,
leaving intact a $2.7 million award that may grow with punitive
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices today let stand a lower court decision
upholding that award, which marked the first federal verdict
against Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit over its Prempro hormone-replacement
treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal by Wyeth and Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit sought to
leverage a different part of the appeals court ruling ordering a
new trial on punitive damages, which a jury had set at $27
million. Pfizer argued that the new trial should cover all
aspects of the case, including the jury&#8217;s finding that the drugs
helped cause Donna Scroggin&#8217;s cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we are disappointed with the court&#8217;s decision, it
does not change the prior ruling by the appeals court, which
affirmed the dismissal of punitive damages as to Upjohn and
ordered a new trial on punitive damages for Wyeth,&#8221; Pfizer said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scroggin was among 6 million women who took the pills to
treat menopause symptoms including hot flashes, night sweats and
mood swings. Wyeth faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the
medicines, which are still on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scroggin and other women contend company executives ignored
studies raising questions about the link between hormone-
replacement drugs and breast cancer to pump up sales of their
drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health Risks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court action &#8220;validates our evidence that
shows Wyeth hid the health risks of this drug and the drugs
caused breast cancer in thousands of women,&#8221; Jim Morris,
Scroggin&#8217;s lawyer, said in a telephone interview today. &#8220;We are
looking forward to asking another jury to decide the extent of
Wyeth&#8217;s wrongful conduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scroggin took three menopause drugs: Provera, a progestin-
laden treatment made by what is now Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit;
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug made by Wyeth, and Prempro, a
combination of the two other drugs introduced by Wyeth in 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual sales of Wyeth&#8217;s hormone-replacement drugs topped $2
billion before a 2002 study sponsored by the U.S. National
Institutes of Health suggested women using the medicines had a
higher breast cancer risk. New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
largest drugmaker, bought Wyeth last year in a $68 billion
transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jury&#8217;s Decision &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court&#8217;s decision not to review the case isn&#8217;t
surprising since the appellate court left the jury&#8217;s decisions
on liability and actual damages undisturbed, said Carl Tobias, a
professor at University of Richmond Law School who teaches
classes on mass-tort law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The denial &#8220;is a good sign for plaintiffs going forward&#8221;
with Prempro claims, Tobias said today in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth has lost seven of the 11 Prempro cases that have been
considered by juries since the cases began going to trial in
2006.
The drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown out at the post-
trial stage and or had awards reduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases at
either the pretrial stage or after the cases have been set for
trials, said Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s appeal in the Scroggin case centered on the
Constitution&#8217;s Seventh Amendment, which guarantees the right to
a jury trial in federal civil cases. In a separate line of
argument, the company contended that the trial judge should have
excluded the testimony of an oncologist who testified that the
hormone treatments caused Scroggin&#8217;s cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 11 cents to $15.10 at 4:00 p.m. New York
time. After the headlines were published, Pfizer shares fell as
much as 2.4 percent, from an opening high of $15.38 to an
afternoon low of $15.01. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wyeth v. Scroggin, 09-1123. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan Airlines Corp. may end an
information technology partnership with IBM Japan Ltd. in a move
to cut costs, Nikkei English News reported, without saying how
it obtained the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership began in 2000, when IBM Japan acquired a
stake in JAL Information Technology Co., Nikkei said. IBM Japan
has a 51 percent stake in the operation, while JAL owns 41
percent, and other shareholders the remaining 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. judge today in New York
signed an order granting Goldman Sachs Group Inc. more time to
respond to a April 16 lawsuit accusing the firm of defrauding
investors while selling mortgage-linked securities, according to
court records. &lt;/p&gt;
</body></entry><entry author="By Elisa Martinuzzi and Yuriy Humber" date="Jun 21, 2010 11:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-21/goldman-sachs-icon-are-bidding-for-wireless-broadband-operator-ariadsl.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs, Icon Are Bidding  for Wireless Broadband Operator AriaDSL</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Icon
Private Equity are trying to take control of AriaDSL BV after a
dispute between the Italian wireless broadband operator&#8217;s owners
pushed it into bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are planning an equity injection with possibly some
outside investors,&#8221; Kirill Dmitriev, chairman of Moscow-based
Icon and AriaDSL board member, said in an interview. &#8220;We
strongly believe in the broadband wireless market and especially
in Italy, where only a wireless solution can really solve
internet access issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Icon, whose group owns about 60 percent
of Aria, are pitted against a bid from a team led by minority
shareholder Gilo Ventures, according to three people with
knowledge of the talks. Icon&#8217;s group is offering around 100
million euros ($124 million), said one of the people, who
declined to be identified before the acquisition is agreed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AriaDSL, the Dutch parent of the Italian Wimax operator,
was declared bankrupt on March 2. The struggle for control of
the company began six months earlier after it hit a &#8220;liquidity
shortage,&#8221; according court papers filed in April by the
bankruptcy trustee, who is seeking a buyer for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials for Goldman in London declined to comment. Davidi Gilo, founder of Gilo Ventures, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, most shareholders agreed to short-term funding
through a convertible bond that would be sold in three stages.
The investment would have given the company access to a 75
million-euro bank loan, the court papers show, cash that would
have been invested to build more base stations, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financing Fails &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conflict among shareholders led that shareholder
financing to fail, the court documents show. Only the first of
the three payments was made and a number of shareholders, which
the documents don&#8217;t identify, requested that AriaDSL pay back
the loan. The shareholders sought the bankruptcy after failing
to get their money back, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Icon&#8217;s interest Aria in began in 2008 when they
led a group that injected 55 million euros into AriaDSL to help
it fund a 48 million-euro purchase of six Wimax licenses, court
papers show. Goldman was involved through both its asset
management unit and its special situations group, which mainly
invests in distressed assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the license agreement, Aria pledged to build 700
base stations by Nov. 1. To boost its reach, in June 2009 Aria
and Telecom Italia SpA said Aria would use Telecom Italia&#8217;s
Wimax frequencies in Italy&#8217;s central and southern regions. In
exchange, Telecom Italia agreed to sell Aria&#8217;s broadband
services to its own clients. By April, Aria had built only about
120 base stations and the company isn&#8217;t likely to meet its
licensing target, according to the court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Icon, Aria remains a long-term project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look at investments on a four-to-five year horizon and
the same here,&#8221; said Icon&#8217;s Dmitriev. &#8220;We have good experience
with Wimax in Russia and Ukraine, so we can use our scale of
operations to buy equipment cheaper.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tullett Prebon Plc, the inter-dealer
broker, lost a lawsuit accusing competitor BGC Partners Inc. of
a hiring raid on 77 of its partners that cost the U.K. firm $387
million in market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Stanley Chesler in Newark, New Jersey
ruled June 18 that Tullett had failed to include its allegedly
victimized U.S. units in the lawsuit and said the firm lacked a
stake in the matter that would allow it to pursue the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tullett U.K. is, at bottom, a shareholder of the affected
subsidiaries,&#8221; Chesler said, adding that the firm failed to
show it &#8220;meets the basic standing requirement that a plaintiff
may seek to vindicate only its own rights, not those of a third
party.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tullett, a London-based firm that matches securities trades
between banks, sued New York&#8217;s BGC Partners in October,
complaining that BGC&#8217;s hiring of brokers from two units of
Tullett in the U.S. had diminished its market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tullett said in its complaint it had sustained a $387
million loss in its market value from August when hiring raid
began through the end of the year. The company&#8217;s shares fell 28
percent during the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BGC has shown no sign that it is willing to stop its
unlawful activity,&#8221; according to the complaint. Only a court
order directing BGC to end its &#8220;systematic destruction of
Tullett Prebon&#8217;s subsidiaries&#8221; would put an end to its attempts
to put Tullett Prebon &#8220;out of business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tullett disagreed with the court&#8217;s decision and is
considering its options, firm spokesman Nigel Szembel in London
said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Judge Chesler&#8217;s opinion, which does not reach the merits
of Tullett&#8217;s claims, was in part based on the pendency of a
Finra arbitration brought by Tullett&#8217;s subsidiaries against BGC
subsidiaries,&#8221; Szembel said. The case before the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority is unaffected by the decision, and
will go to trial soon, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BGC spokesman Robert Hubbell declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Tullett Prebon Plc v. BGC Partners Inc.,
09cv5365, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida Family Awarded $2.5 Million Over Defective Drywall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Florida couple suffered $2.5 million in damages as a
result of defective drywall from China, a Florida jury found
June 18, helping to set a standard for trials throughout the
U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first jury trial in the U.S. over defective drywall,
a state court panel in Miami deliberated more than a day before
finding closely held Banner Supply Co. 55 percent responsible
for damage done to the home of Armin and Lisa Seifart. The jury
found a company not included in the lawsuit, Germany&#8217;s Knauf
Group, 35 percent liable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs had sought $4.3 million for loss of enjoyment of
their home and other damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It sets a precedent to the extent that we were able to
see what a jury thinks about this case,&#8221; said Ervin Gonzalez,
attorney for the Seifarts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USG Corp. and Knauf are among about 1,000 defendants that
may face claims they distributed defective drywall manufactured
in China. As many as 40,000 plaintiffs may bring claims, U.S.
District Judge Eldon Fallon of New Orleans, who is overseeing
federal drywall lawsuits nationwide, said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases, part of coordinated litigation over allegedly
defective drywall, are intended as a bellwether to help
determine property damage issues in other cases against
manufacturers. More than 2,100 people in the U.S. have sued in
federal court claiming damages from drywall made in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seifarts bought their home in February 2008. After less
than a year they learned their problems with appliances and a
sulfur smell originated with the drywall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banner countered that the Seifarts should be reimbursed for
the cost of repairs only, urging the jury not to make an award
for loss of enjoyment or the reduction of the value to the home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are a bit disappointed and we will weigh all of our
rights, including our appellate rights,&#8221; Banner&#8217;s attorney,
Todd Ehrenreich said after the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca to Pay $103 Million to Settle Drug-Pricing Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s second-largest drugmaker, will
pay $103 million to settle claims it overcharged for some
medicines in the U.S., court records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca&#8217;s accord will end claims by third-party payers
who paid some of their insured&#8217;s Medicare for the Zoladex or
Pulmicort Respules products and other consumers and third-party
payers who paid cash or a co-payment for the drugs outside of
Medicare. Massachusetts plaintiffs will receive $13 million,
while those outside the state will get $90 million, according to
papers filed June 18 in federal court in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers will receive 11 percent of the settlement while
the rest will go to insurers, according to a statement by Hagens
Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, the law firm that brought suit. The
proposed settlement of the class-action suit requires court
approval to become final. AstraZeneca, which denied wrongdoing,
said the settlement was in the company&#8217;s best interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;AstraZeneca has competed responsibly with respect to
pricing and marketing of our medicines, and we firmly believe
that we have acted at all times in accordance with the law,&#8221;
Tony Jewell, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the plaintiffs will be paid one-third of the
settlement funds, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs accused the company of illegally seeking to
boost market share by selling medicines to physicians at steep
discounts to the published average wholesale price that
consumers, pension funds and others paid, while secretly
encouraging doctors to claim full reimbursement from insurers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Pharmaceutical Industry Average
Wholesale Price Litigation, MDL No. 1456 or 01-cv-12257, U.S.
District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.R. Capital Founder Sentenced to 37 Months in Prison &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.R. Capital Group Inc.&#8217;s Alan Fishman, a car-service
driver before he launched the hedge fund, was sentenced to 37
months in prison for his role in stealing from investors,
federal prosecutors in New York said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fishman, 50, and Daniel Ledven, 38, a principal at the
firm, pleaded guilty in March to one count each of conspiring to
commit securities fraud, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in New York
said June 18 in a statement. Ledven was sentenced to 57 months
in prison, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.R. Capital raised about $20 million from individual
investors in its purported hedge fund between 2003 and September
2006, claiming the money would be invested in international real
estate companies and used for leveraged trading, prosecutors
said. About $18 million of the money was wired to bank accounts
in the Ukraine, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domenico Savatta, a lawyer for Fishman, and Henry Putzel, a
lawyer representing Ledven, didn&#8217;t return calls to their offices
after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Ledven, 09-1088, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill Wins Dismissal of Chunilal&#8217;s U.K. Lawsuit Over Bonus &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co. won dismissal of a lawsuit over a
reduced bonus filed by its former head of Asia-Pacific
investment banking, Damian Chunilal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute shouldn&#8217;t be heard in the U.K. because &#8220;there
is no good arguable case that the breach relied on in fact
occurred within the jurisdiction,&#8221; Judge Michael Burton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chunilal, who was fired from Merrill in November 2008, less
than two months after the bank agreed to be taken over by Bank
of America Corp., said his bonus was reduced to 20 percent of
the year-earlier level. He sued the firm in London in October
for breach of contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill sought the dismissal, saying English courts didn&#8217;t
have jurisdiction over the matter. Chunilal, who worked for the
bank for 19 years, relocated to Hong Kong from London in 2004.
He was paid a bonus of $2.3 million in his last year, compared
with $11.7 million in 2007 and $13.9 million in 2006, according
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chunilal&#8217;s lawyer, Robin Knowles, didn&#8217;t respond to a
request for comment on the ruling. Chunilal didn&#8217;t respond to an
e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowles argued the decision to pay the reduced bonus was
made in London by the head of human resources for investment
banking, and that Chunilal&#8217;s first contract with Merrill was
governed under English law, while the second contract,
negotiated in New York, didn&#8217;t specify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Damian Chunilal v. Merrill Lynch International
Inc., case no. 2009-1354, High Court of Justice (London). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-RBG Chairman Rastogi Ordered to Pay $44 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former RBG Resources Plc Chairman Virendra Rastogi, who is
serving a 9 1/2-year jail sentence for a trans-Atlantic fraud,
was ordered to pay 30 million pounds ($44 million) to compensate
victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rastogi, 42, defrauded JPMorgan Chase  Co. and other banks
that provided the now-defunct metals trading company, also known
as Allied Deals Plc, with cash backed by worthless assets. The
company obtained loans used to gamble on the metal exchange, for
personal gain or to pay back other loans, the U.K. Serious Fraud
Office said June 18 in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBG Resources owed more than $420 million when it went into
liquidation in 2002, the SFO said. The ex-chairman gained more
than 1 billion pounds from the fraud and used some of the money
to buy a flat in London&#8217;s Mayfair neighborhood, now worth 5
million pounds. The order strips Rastogi of the last of his
assets, the office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendant is a very intelligent and able man&#8221; who,
for much of his adult life, &#8220;has had absolutely no regard for
truth or honesty,&#8221; Judge James Wadsworth said in his order,
according to the SFO. &#8220;The defendant accepts that the whole of
his business success was based on deceit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony Brown, Rastogi&#8217;s lawyer, said his client
&#8220;absolutely does not have 30 million pounds&#8221; and is
considering whether to appeal the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rastogi was sentenced to prison in 2008 for the fraud,
which expanded from New York to London in 1996. It eventually
grew to involve more than 200 RBG-related companies across six
jurisdictions, many of which didn&#8217;t conduct any metals trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total, Chevron Found Guilty in U.K. Buncefield Fuel Depot Fire &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.K. court found Total SA and Chevron Corp. guilty of
failing to prevent the Buncefield fire in a fuel depot in north
London in 2005, according to the Health and Safety Executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the largest fire in peacetime Europe tore through
the Buncefield site on that Sunday morning in December 2005,
these companies had failed to protect workers, members of the
public and the environment,&#8221; the HSE said June 18 in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd., operator of the depot, is a
venture between Paris-based Total, which holds 60 percent in the
company, and San Ramon, California-based Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We understand the decision made by the jury,&#8221; Claire
Elliot, a U.K.-based Total spokeswoman, said by phone. &#8220;We
deeply regret the events at Buncefield and would like to
apologize to all those affected by the incident.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Pipeline Agency Ltd. and TAV Engineering Ltd. were
among companies that also were found guilty or pleaded guilty to
various charges related to the fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buncefield oil depot is about 25 miles north of London
and supplies jet fuel by pipeline to Heathrow, Europe&#8217;s busiest
airport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Faces Trials in 200 Suits Over Hormone-Drugs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. faces a Texas trial over its hormone-
replacement drugs after a judge overseeing lawsuits related to
the medicines sent 200 cases back to their home courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge in Galveston, Texas, set a May 2011 trial date for
Karen Zahn&#8217;s claims against Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit. Zahn says in
her suit that the Prempro menopause drug helped cause her breast
cancer. It&#8217;s one of the first of more than 8,000 lawsuits over
the medicine consolidated in federal court in Arkansas to be
returned for trial, plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Wilson in Little Rock,
Arkansas, is supervising pretrial proceedings in the cases
against Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn, another Pfizer unit. He
returned the 200 cases to their courts in March and told lawyers
to get another 400 ready to go back later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer is now going to have to gear up and hire lawyers
all over the country to try these cases,&#8221; said Carl Tobias, a
professor at the University of Richmond law school who teaches
classes on mass-tort law. &#8220;That makes things more expensive and
may provide some incentive to settle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of New York-based Pfizer said that while Wilson
has sent back some cases, he refused plaintiffs&#8217; requests to
send back all the suits at one time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No decision has been made about how many additional cases
will be remanded or when,&#8221; Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder said in
an e-mailed statement. It also isn&#8217;t clear how many of the
remanded cases will go to trial, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loder refused to comment on whether Pfizer will seek to
settle the remaining Prempro cases before Wilson. The company
faces at least 8,000 Prempro claims, Wyeth officials said in a
2009 regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer will continue to vigorously defend its hormone
therapy medicines,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;We do not comment
on the number of cases pending, nor do we comment on our legal
strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Prempro Products, 03-cv-15070, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas (Little Rock). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browner Says BP Claims Probably Will Surpass $20 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $20 billion that BP Plc will set aside for claims from
the worst oil spill in U.S. history probably won&#8217;t be all the
company ultimately must pay, President Barack Obama&#8217;s senior
energy and environment adviser said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is likely that the number will be higher,&#8221; Carol
Browner said in an interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
&#8220;Conversations with Judy Woodruff,&#8221; that aired this weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP agreed with Obama on June 16 to set up a $20 billion
compensation fund for victims of the environmental and economic
disaster caused by the explosion of its well in the Gulf of
Mexico. BP and the administration are struggling to stop the
flow of as much as 60,000 barrels of oil daily from the well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP should be able to contain as much as 90 percent of the
gushing crude in coming days or weeks, Obama said in a June 15
address televised from the Oval Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have pushed them very hard to improve that plan that
will get us to up to 90 percent of it captured while the relief
wells are being dug,&#8221; Browner said June 18. BP is working to
complete relief wells by August that the company says provide
the only prospect of completely plugging the leak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivendi Investors Ask Court to Order Company, Messier to Repay &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivendi SA investors asked a Paris court to order former
Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marie Messier and six other former
executives, as well as the company, to repay them money lost
during a $77 billion acquisition spree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivendi isn&#8217;t a defendant and has participated in the trial
claiming it was also a victim of the acquisition campaign that
preceded Messier&#8217;s 2002 ouster. The company&#8217;s lawyer said June
18 that its goal was to &#8220;aid in a manifestation of the truth&#8221;
of the Messier era and said it should pay no damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivendi joined the case &#8220;so that we might at last turn the
page, so that we can focus on what Vivendi does now,&#8221; company
lawyer Herve Pisani said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholder lawyer Frederik-Karel Canoy asked the court to
&#8220;set a precedent,&#8221; estimating the loss at 160 euros ($198) per
share and seeking 10 euros a share in prejudice. He told the
court Vivendi should join in paying. An award would tell
shareholders &#8220;if we can stay in France or do we have to go to
the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French investors joined a class action in New York, where
the jury in January cleared Messier and former Chief Financial

&lt;p&gt;Prince Charles&#8217;s Design Protest Not &#8216;Fatal,&#8217; Qatari Diar Said &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real-estate investment arm of Qatar&#8217;s sovereign-wealth
fund considered ignoring opposition from Prince Charles over its
plan for a London luxury apartment complex, saying the heir to
England&#8217;s throne had failed to stop other developments he didn&#8217;t
like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Co. executive John Ward
said in an April 2009 internal e-mail that London had approved
other developers&#8217; designs for the Shard skyscraper -- which will
be the city&#8217;s tallest -- and the One New Change office complex
near St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral, over the prince&#8217;s objections to their
modern appearances, according to documents revealed at a court
hearing this week in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prince of Wales&#8217;s &#8220;track record on public
pronouncements on building design is not always one-way
traffic,&#8221; Ward said in the e-mail. &#8220;His public views are not
always fatal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatari Diar withdrew its site plan application for the
landmark Chelsea Barracks in June 2009, claiming it would likely
be rejected. Its U.K. developer, CPC Group Ltd., sued claiming
that Qatari Diar was obliged to submit the plan or pay costs.
The developer argues the plan could have been approved and was
wrongfully abandoned to appease Prince Charles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breach-of-contract case went to trial last month, with
CPC, controlled by real-estate entrepreneur Christian Candy,
seeking 81 million pounds ($120 million) it says it would have
received if the complex had been built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatari Diar spokeswoman Georgiana Gibbs declined to comment
when reached by phone June 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CPC Group Ltd. v. Qatari Diar Real Estate
Investment Company, 4260/09, High Court of Justice, Chancery
Division (London). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers of Dish Network Corp.&#8217;s
satellite-TV service lost access to four high-definition
channels owned by Walt Disney Co. in a fee dispute between the
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HD programming from ESPNews, ABC Family, Disney Channel and
Disney XD was taken down today, the companies said in separate
e-mailed statements. The standard-definition versions of the
channels are still available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish says it wants to negotiate a contract with Disney that
allows the pay-TV operator to continue offering low-priced HD
programming. Disney says a New York state court ruled in March
that Dish didn&#8217;t have the right to air its HD channels for free.
Dish, which is appealing the decision, paid Disney $65 million
in overdue fees, Multichannel News reported earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We could not agree to the significant fees requested by
Disney,&#8221; Dish said. Both companies said in their statements
they hope to reach an agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, declined 71
cents to $34.35 today in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The Burbank, California-based company&#8217;s shares have
climbed 6.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish, owner of the second biggest U.S. satellite-TV
service, fell 79 cents to $20.25 today in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. The Englewood, Colorado-based company&#8217;s stock has
slipped 2.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. accused
Barclays Plc of misleading a federal judge when it bought Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s defunct brokerage in the falling
markets of September 2008, said a Lehman lawyer, citing a letter
from JPMorgan Chairman Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Group Chief Executive John Varley was asked by
Lehman lawyer Robert Gaffey in federal court in Manhattan today
about what he characterized as &#8220;two big-time bankers in a very
big dispute.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaffey said Dimon wrote to Varley and Barclays President
Robert Diamond, saying the court was misinformed about the
Barclays deal. JPMorgan had asked Barclays to participate in an
accounting of the transaction and they declined, Dimon said in
the letter, according to Gaffey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I could refute him point by point but he&#8217;s not here,&#8221;
Varley said. &#8220;I inwardly groaned when I read it because I knew
that there were a number of points on which Jamie Dimon and I
would disagree.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varley was the second witness today in a U.S. Bankruptcy
Court trial over Lehman&#8217;s claim that the U.K.&#8217;s third-biggest
bank should pay it as much as $11 billion for an allegedly
undisclosed &#8220;windfall&#8221; on the deal for the brokerage. The
purchase was approved by Judge James Peck and closed a week
after Lehman&#8217;s Sept. 15, 2008, bankruptcy, the biggest in U.S.
history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custodial Account &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan around that time had taken $7 billion out of a
Barclays custodial account, according to Varley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was deeply unhappy that without our consent a large
amount of money had been taken out of our account,&#8221; Varley
said. He interpreted the letter about misleading the court as a
device by JPMorgan to distract attention from the dispute over
money, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
on the dispute, which was later settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Lehman in May sued JPMorgan to recover tens of
billions of dollars in &#8220;lost value,&#8221; accusing the bank of
precipitating its downfall and preventing it from winding down
in an orderly fashion. Evangelisti said the lawsuit was &#8220;ill
conceived.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Varley said the week when Barclays bought the
Lehman brokerage was &#8220;the riskiest week of my life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Markets were collapsing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We needed to ensure
there was a buffer between assets and liabilities. We needed to
be able to look regulators in the eye and say the deal would be
capital accretive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protect Our Ratios &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a time when there was a great deal of focus by
supervisors around the world, including the U.K. Financial
Services Authority and the Bank of England, on capital ratios,
and it was clear to me that the only circumstances in which I
could look our regulators in the eye, and indeed look our
shareholders in the eye, would be if we were able to protect our
capital ratios,&#8221; Varley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To put it another way, were we not capable of doing that,
then I was not prepared to recommend that we should proceed to
the board&#8221; of Barclays, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman lawyer Gaffey has tried to prove that Barclays made
a safe, or &#8220;derisked&#8221; acquisition, and took more assets out of
the defunct firm than it should have without telling the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You expected an immediate profit&#8221; on the brokerage
purchase? Gaffey asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yes we did,&#8221; Varley said. &#8220;That&#8217;s because we expected
the income we generated to exceed costs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BofA Balked &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s first witness, Barclays President Diamond, said the
bank had qualms about acquiring Lehman&#8217;s brokerage after Bank of
America Corp. balked at buying it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BofA walked away from an opportunity to do a deal with
Lehman at some distressed price,&#8221; said Diamond, who runs
Barclays&#8217;s corporate and investment banking operations. &#8220;But
they paid $50 billion for Merrill Lynch. That created real
concern for us. What had they seen?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamond was responding to questions from Barclays&#8217;s lawyer
David Boies about the bank&#8217;s concerns when it bought Lehman and
why it sought to buffer itself from risk by staking claim to
assets in the brokerage business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BofA could have bought it for about $1 billion,&#8221; Diamond
said. &#8220;They walked away and paid $50 billion for Merrill. It
reinforced in Varley and myself and our board what a risky
environment we were working in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government Help &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns it got government
help,&#8221; Diamond said. &#8220;Barclays wasn&#8217;t able to get help. So it
was especially important to get the values and commitments we
had received or we couldn&#8217;t go forward. There were hours when we
were expecting not to execute on the deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which wants money to pay off creditors, has accused
the London-based bank of making a &#8220;secret&#8221; asset raid on
Lehman that wasn&#8217;t disclosed to the court. The brokerage&#8217;s
trustee, James Giddens, has said changes were secretly inserted
in the sale contract without notice to him or Lehman&#8217;s lawyers.
He wants $6.7 billion from Barclays to pay hedge funds and other
institutional clients of Lehman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s lawyers are beginning to wrap up their case after
more than two weeks of testimony by former Lehman executives,
advisers and Barclays officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. bank&#8217;s lawyers have tried to show when questioning
Lehman&#8217;s witnesses that all the key facts of the deal were known
by the main players. They are scheduled to present Barclays&#8217;s
side of the story starting Aug. 23. Barclays, which announced a
gain on its purchase on Sept. 17, 2008, has said it owes Lehman
nothing and wants $3 billion that is being withheld by the
trustee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman spent $794 million on lawyers, advisers and managers
in 19 months through April, with $277.4 million going to Lehman
CEO Bryan Marsal&#8217;s restructuring firm, Alvarez  Marsal. Marsal
has said he will spend five years selling assets to pay
unsecured creditors as little as 14.7 cents on the dollar. Any
proceeds from litigation would add to the payout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-
13555, and Giddens v. Barclays Capital Inc., 09-01732, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, the chief executive
officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co., named longtime associate Heidi Miller to the new post of president of JPMorgan International as
part of a management shuffle to groom an eventual successor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller, 57, who had been executive vice president for
Treasury and Securities Services, will be replaced by Chief
Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh, 44. Doug Braunstein, 49,
head of Investment Banking Americas, will succeed Cavanagh as
CFO, the company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 54, said in March that he planned to rotate senior
executives across business lines as part of a succession plan.
Miller&#8217;s working relationship with Dimon spans about two
decades, including stints at Travelers Group Inc., Citigroup
Inc., Bank One Corp. and JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is someone who has the capability of staring Jamie
Dimon down, so that&#8217;s obviously served her well,&#8221; said Duff
McDonald, author of &#8220;Last Man Standing: The Ascent of Jamie
Dimon and JPMorgan Chase.&#8221; &#8220;The fact that he&#8217;s chosen her to
take on this new and expanded role should surprise nobody.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move gives Cavanagh, who has never run a business
division at JPMorgan, operational experience as a possible
successor to Dimon, McDonald said. Cavanagh worked with Dimon at
Primerica and Citigroup before joining Bank One, where Dimon had
become CEO, in 2000. He was named CFO of JPMorgan after Dimon
sold his lender to the bank in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealmaker &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braunstein has been one of JPMorgan&#8217;s most prolific
dealmakers for corporate clients. He is also Dimon&#8217;s go-to
banker for his own acquisitions after working across the
negotiating table from him during the Bank One sale. Braunstein
helped JPMorgan seal a deal to buy Bear Stearns Cos. during a
weekend of frenzied negotiating in 2008. The company said it
will announce Braunstein&#8217;s replacement soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s grooming multiple potential successors,&#8221; said
Bradley Hintz, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein  Co. &#8220;Jamie
hasn&#8217;t made a decision about who&#8217;s going to take over, and he&#8217;s
got time to see how they do in their new roles.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2004, Miller has run JPMorgan&#8217;s Treasury  Securities
Services unit, which provides clients with payment-processing
and cash-management services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller turned around the business and generated stable
returns throughout the economic crisis, Hintz said. JPMorgan
credited her with producing &#8220;record increases in net revenue
and net income&#8221; during her tenure at the unit, which processes
an average of $3.7 trillion in transfers daily and has $15.3
trillion in assets under custody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competing With Citigroup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As head of JPMorgan&#8217;s Global Corporate Bank, Miller will
lead the company&#8217;s expansion plans in emerging markets like
China, Brazil, India and Russia, regions where JPMorgan will
battle Citigroup for business, said Anthony Polini, a banking
analyst at Raymond James  Associates Inc. More than half of
Citigroup&#8217;s total revenue comes from overseas, compared with
about a quarter at JPMorgan, Polini said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a key play to get a piece of the pie that Citi
has a bigger slice of right now,&#8221; Polini said. &#8220;The projected
growth rate for those economies are two or three times greater
than the projected growth rates of the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan, which have fallen 6 percent this year
compared with a 3 percent advance in the SP 500 Financials
Index, were little changed as of 12:53 p.m. in New York trading
at $39.19. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s cocaine output fell to
less than half the world&#8217;s total last year, as Peru overtook the
country in cultivation of the drug&#8217;s base ingredient for the
first time in more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia last year produced 37 percent to 49 percent of the
estimated 842-to-1,111 metric tons of the world&#8217;s cocaine, down
from 51 percent in 2008, according to the 2010 World Drug Report
published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
Colombian output fell to 410 tons, from 450 tons in 2008,
Leonardo Correa, the project coordinator of the UN agency&#8217;s
Illicit Crop Monitoring Program in Colombia, said at a news
conference in Bogota to present the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru overtook Colombia in potential production of coca, the
base ingredient of the drug, harvesting 119,000 tons of the leaf
compared with 103,100 tons for Colombia, according to the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last year Peru produced more coca than Colombia was in
1997, when Colombia&#8217;s total of world cocaine output stood at 40
percent. Coca yields in Peru were higher than Colombia last year
because the drug crops there did not face as much pressure from
eradication efforts, Correa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Land dedicated to production of coca in Colombia fell to
68,000 hectares (167,960 acres) last year, an 11-year low,
according to the study based on satellite monitoring. Coca
cultivation rose to 59,900 hectares in Peru from 56,100 a year
ago and to 30,900 in Bolivia from 30,500 in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eradication &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombian coca production has fallen due to U.S.-backed
aerial spraying of coca fields with herbicide, and a program of
&#8220;manual eradication&#8221; whereby workers dig up coca bushes by
hand. Colombia receives more than $600 million annually in U.S.
anti-narcotics aid, more than any country outside the Middle
East and Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates for cocaine output in Peru and Bolivia are not
yet available, Correa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A kilogram of cocaine cost $2,147 in Colombia last year
compared with a wholesale price of $34,700 in the U.S. and
street price of $120,000, Correa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Guaviare province in southern Colombia, the spraying and
eradication have caused an &#8220;economic crisis&#8221; said Giovanny
Gomez, a lawmaker for the Green Party in the state&#8217;s assembly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provincial capital, San Jose del Guaviare, is
struggling to cope with an increase in unemployment, informal
employment and squatter invasions as farmers affected by the
spraying move to the town, Gomez said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We welcome the help of the U.S., we welcome international
help, but this money needs to be used for crop substitution, not
fumigation,&#8221; Gomez said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President-elect Juan Manuel Santos has pledged to continue
the government&#8217;s eradication programs, saying that the cocaine
trade is financing the country&#8217;s Marxist guerrillas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ICP Asset Management LLC and its
founder were sued by U.S. regulators for their role in
overseeing mortgage-linked investments insured by American
International Group Inc. as the housing market declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Priore, 41, and New York-based ICP directed more
than $1 billion of trades at artificially high prices on behalf
of collateralized debt obligations they managed, the Securities
and Exchange Commission said yesterday in a lawsuit filed at
federal court in New York. Priore denied wrongdoing and said he
would fight the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, the SEC&#8217;s first aimed at a so-called collateral
manager, may open a new front for the agency in its examination
of firms that dealt with mortgage assets before the U.S. housing
market collapsed in 2007. ICP violated its duty to clients by
making investments that broke rules limiting risk, and failing
to get required approvals for trades from AIG and bond insurer
FGIC Corp., another victim, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The CDOs were complex but the lesson is simple:
collateral managers bear the same responsibilities to their
clients as every other investment adviser,&#8221; George Canellos,
director of the SEC&#8217;s New York regional office, said in a
statement. &#8220;When they violate their clients&#8217; trust, we will
hold them accountable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDOs, known as Triaxx, invested primarily in mortgage-
backed securities. ICP favored itself and certain clients in its
trading, for example, by having one CDO sell assets to another
at inflated prices, the SEC said. The firm used the dealings to
cover other clients&#8217; losses and to generate higher fees for
itself, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We at all times acted in the best interest of our clients
and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these
allegations,&#8221; Priore said yesterday in an e-mail statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerviel, Once &#8216;Relied On,&#8217; Now &#8216;Pathetic&#8217; to Ex-SocGen Bosses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerome Kerviel&#8217;s last boss at Societe Generale SA said he
now finds it &#8220;hard&#8221; to look into the face of a trader who was
seen as a reliable employee before the bank&#8217;s 4.9 billion-euro
($6 billion)trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel&#8217;s excuses for building up 50 billion euros worth of
bets are &#8220;pathetic,&#8221; Eric Cordelle, the former trader&#8217;s last
manager on the Delta One trading desk before his activities were
discovered in January 2008, told a Paris court yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard for me to look at his face,&#8221; said Cordelle,
who testified that he is still looking for work after being
fired following the discovery of the unauthorized trades. &#8220;No
one else is allowed to make bets, but he thinks it doesn&#8217;t work
that way for him.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel, 33, is accused of abuse of trust, faking documents
and hacking the bank&#8217;s computers, hiding positions that exceeded
his mandate with faked hedges. The bank announced the loss in
January 2008, with former Chief Executive Officer Daniel Bouton
calling the former trader a &#8220;terrorist.&#8221; Kerviel has argued
that his superiors were aware of his actions and condoned the
bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cordelle and his then boss Martial Rouyere denied they knew
anything of Kerviel actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rouyere said there were three traders he &#8220;relied on&#8221; on
the Delta One desk and counted Kerviel among them. He said he
had thought Kerviel could help train Cordelle, who said he had
no trading experience when he arrived on the desk in April 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I had faith in Jerome,&#8221; said Rouyere, who left the bank
in August 2008. &#8220;He was someone serious, professional.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the bank began to uncover Kerviel&#8217;s bets and faked
hedges, Rouyere said the team looking into his transactions
didn&#8217;t immediately understand what he had done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto Wins as Court Backs Alfalfa Seed Planting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court, ruling in favor of Monsanto Co.,
overturned a judge&#8217;s ban on the planting of alfalfa seeds
engineered to be resistant to the company&#8217;s Roundup herbicide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7-1 ruling shifts the focus of the environmental
dispute to the Agriculture Department, which under yesterday&#8217;s
ruling now can consider allowing limited planting. That would be
an interim measure while the USDA finishes an environmental
impact statement that ultimately might clear the way for
unrestricted planting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices said a federal judge in San Francisco went too
far when he placed a nationwide ban on so-called Roundup-ready
alfalfa seeds because of the possibility they would contaminate
other plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An injunction is a drastic and extraordinary remedy,
which should not be granted as a matter of course,&#8221; Justice
Samuel Alito wrote for the majority. Justice John Paul Stevens
was the lone dissenter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Monsanto v. Geertson Seed Farms, 09-475, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Rejected by High Court in Menopause Drug Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court rejected Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s appeal of a
verdict for an Arkansas woman who blamed the company&#8217;s menopause
drugs for her breast cancer, leaving intact a $2.7 million award
that may grow with punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday let stand a lower court decision
upholding that award, which marked the first federal verdict
against Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit over its Prempro hormone-replacement
treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal by Wyeth and Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit sought to
leverage a different part of the appeals court ruling ordering a
new trial on punitive damages, which a jury had set at $27
million. Pfizer argued that the new trial should cover all
aspects of the case, including the jury&#8217;s finding that the drugs
helped cause Donna Scroggin&#8217;s cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we are disappointed with the court&#8217;s decision, it
does not change the prior ruling by the appeals court, which
affirmed the dismissal of punitive damages as to Upjohn and
ordered a new trial on punitive damages for Wyeth,&#8221; Pfizer said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scroggin was among 6 million women who took the pills to
treat menopause symptoms including hot flashes, night sweats and
mood swings. Wyeth faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the
medicines, which are still on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scroggin and other women contend company executives ignored
studies raising questions about the link between hormone-
replacement drugs and breast cancer to pump up sales of their
drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court action &#8220;validates our evidence that
shows Wyeth hid the health risks of this drug and the drugs
caused breast cancer in thousands of women,&#8221; Jim Morris,
Scroggin&#8217;s lawyer, said in a telephone interview yesterday. &#8220;We
are looking forward to asking another jury to decide the extent
of Wyeth&#8217;s wrongful conduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wyeth v. Scroggin, 09-1123, U.S. Supreme Court
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko Asks Court to Cancel Drill Rig Contract Over U.S. Ban &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko Petroleum Corp. asked a court to cancel its
contract leasing an offshore oil rig from Noble Corp., claiming
a U.S. six-month ban on deepwater drilling triggered a &#8220;force
majeure&#8221; provision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. moratorium, announced May 27, followed the April
explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf
of Mexico and subsequent oil spill. As a result of the ban, the
U.S. ordered Anadarko to stop using the drilling vessel, the
Noble Amos Runner, in the Gulf of Mexico, the company said in
court filings June 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko, based in The Woodlands, Texas, sued Noble in
federal court in Houston on June 18, asking for a declaratory
judgment, after the rig-leasing company said the ban didn&#8217;t
block Anadarko from redeploying the vessel elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A provision in the contract would require Anadarko to pay a
force majeure rate for up to a maximum of 15 consecutive days,
after which no day rate was payable, Anadarko said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble doesn&#8217;t view the ban as a force majeure, the company
said in a June 4 statement. &#8220;Anadarko is not prevented from
using the unit on a variety of activities permissible under the
contract,&#8221; Noble said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Breed, a spokesman for Noble, didn&#8217;t return a call
seeking comment made after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The contract with Noble is specifically for the Gulf of
Mexico, and in adherence with the government&#8217;s deep-water
drilling moratorium we are managing our business appropriately
during this force majeure event,&#8221; John Christiansen, an
Anadarko spokesman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is Anadarko Petroleum Corp. v. Noble Drilling
(U.S.) LLC, 4:10-cv-012185, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit Agricole Sued Over Creation of Millstone CDO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Agricole SA was sued for at least $100 million over
the creation and sale of a collateralized debt obligation,
according to papers filed June 18 in state court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers of notes issued by the CDO, named Millstone IV CDO
Ltd., accused two units of Credit Agricole of fraud and unjust
enrichment, according to a summons filed with the court. CDOs
are pools of debt securities sliced into various tranches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs -- Loreley Financing (Jersey) No. 31 Ltd.
and Loreley Financing (Jersey) No. 32 Ltd. -- are seeking the
return of the $50 million purchase price for the notes and
damages of no less than $50 million, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Credit Agricole couldn&#8217;t be reached for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha Beta Sues Pursuit for $40 Million, Claims Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha Beta Capital Partners LP sued Pursuit Investment
Management LLC to recover $40 million in losses as a result of
what it calls a fraud in connection with its investment in two
Pursuit hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursuit Investment, based in Stamford, Connecticut,
inflated the net asset values of Pursuit Capital Management Fund
I LP, and Pursuit Opportunity Fund I LP, to obtain millions in
management and incentive fees, Alpha Beta said yesterday in New
York state court complaint. False monthly statements kept Alpha
Beta invested in the funds, the New York-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By pricing the Pursuit Funds&#8217; assets essentially
arbitrarily to make their performance look good,&#8221; the company
made it &#8220;appear as though the value of the Pursuit Funds&#8217;
portfolios were continually rising, even in a market that was
declining precipitously, when in fact their value was not,&#8221;
Alpha Beta said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursuit and its principals Anthony P. Schepis and Frank
Canelas Jr., who also were sued, didn&#8217;t return a call for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Alpha Beta Capital Partners v. Pursuit
Investment Management, 650674/2010, New York State Supreme
Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, SEC, Agree to Extend Goldman&#8217;s Reply &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge yesterday in New York signed an order granting
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. more time to respond to a April 16
lawsuit accusing the firm of defrauding investors while selling
mortgage-linked securities, records say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones signed a request granting
Goldman an extension until July 19, according to court records.
The original deadline was June 21, court documents show. The
SEC, in the joint filing submitted to the court with Goldman,
consented to the firm&#8217;s extension of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said New York-based Goldman Sachs and one of its
employees, Fabrice Tourre, didn&#8217;t disclose to investors the role
played by hedge fund Paulson  Co. in devising and betting
against the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre also has until July 19 to respond, according to
court documents signed by Lorin Reisner, the SEC&#8217;s deputy
director of enforcement and Richard Klapper, a lawyer for
Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC alleged the firm wasn&#8217;t forthcoming about the role
that a hedge fund, Paulson  Co., played in selecting and
betting against the instrument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, has denied the SEC&#8217;s allegations and said it will fight
the case. Company spokesman Michael DuVally said he couldn&#8217;t
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Goldman created and sold
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages in
early 2007, as the U.S. housing market faltered, without
disclosing that Paulson helped pick the underlying securities
and bet against the vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana Governor Asks Judge to Lift Deepwater Drilling Ban &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and state Attorney General
Buddy Caldwell asked a U.S. judge to lift a six-month moratorium
on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico within 30 days to
avoid &#8220;turning an environmental disaster into an economic
catastrophe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drilling ban may cost Louisiana&#8217;s economy, &#8220;which was
already weakened by Katrina and is now crippled by the Deepwater
Horizon disaster,&#8221; almost 11,000 direct and indirect jobs in
five months, Caldwell said in papers filed June 20 in federal
court in New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even after the catastrophic events of Sept. 11, the
government only shut down the airlines for three days,&#8221;
Caldwell said in support of Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC&#8217;s
lawsuit seeking to end the moratorium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barack Obama temporarily halted all drilling
in water deeper than 500 feet on May 27 in response to the worst
oil spill in U.S. history, caused by the April sinking of the
Deepwater Horizon drilling rig off the Louisiana coast. The ban,
implemented at the recommendation of Interior Secretary Kenneth
Salazar, gives a presidential commission six months to study
ways to improve the safety of deepwater drilling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court papers last week, lawyers for U.S. regulatory
agencies said the ban is necessary to &#8220;ensure more lives are
not lost and that new blowouts and spills do not occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar,
2:10-cv-01663, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starr Said &#8216;Not That Much&#8217; to Theft-Size Accusation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth I. Starr replied &#8220;not that much&#8221; to an
investigator who accused him of stealing $30 million, a
prosecutor said in court -- a statement the government said it
may try to use against the accused investment adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney William Harrington yesterday told
District Judge Shira Scheindlin in New York that prosecutors are
deciding whether to use the statement Starr made May 27 after he
was found hiding in a closet in his home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the time he was handcuffed, the agent made some
comment about, &#8216;This is your time to get things straight. You&#8217;re
at the crossroads. You stole $30 million,&#8217;&#8221; Harrington said.
&#8220;The defendant responded, saying, &#8216;Not that much.&#8217; This
occurred after he was in custody, after being handcuffed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr, 66, was indicted June 11 for 20 counts of wire fraud
and one each of securities fraud, money laundering and fraud by
an investment adviser. He stole at least $59 million, almost
twice the first estimate, according to the indictment. He is
being held without bail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheindlin asked Harrington if the government was certain
of Starr&#8217;s exact words and whether the alleged comment made was
made after he&#8217;d been advised of his constitutional right not to
incriminate himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington said that the government would put together a
report from the agent&#8217;s notes to determine the exact timing of
the comment and if the U.S. would seek to use them against him
at a trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr, who pleaded not guilty, faces as long as 20 years in
prison if convicted of wire fraud, prosecutors in the Manhattan
office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. evidence in the case
from Starr&#8217;s computer and his company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peggy Cross, a public defender appointed by the court to
represent Starr, told Scheindlin she is determining whether her
client can obtain funds to pay a private lawyer. As part of the
government&#8217;s case, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
froze his bank accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheindlin granted Cross&#8217;s request for a two-week
adjournment delay. The next hearing is set for July 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil suit is SEC v. Starr, 1:10-cv-04270, and the
criminal case is U.S. v. Starr, 1:10-mj-01135, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agility Is &#8216;Fugitive&#8217; in Overbilling Case, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agility, the Middle East&#8217;s largest storage and logistics
company, is a &#8220;fugitive from American justice&#8221; that is trying
to evade trial on charges of overbilling on military supplies,
U.S. prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agility, formerly known as Public Warehousing Co., was
indicted in November on allegations it overcharged the U.S.
government on a multibillion dollar contract to supply food for
troops in Kuwait and Iraq. The Kuwait-based company said April
28 it was negotiating with the U.S. Justice Department on a
possible settlement of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said in a filing yesterday in Atlanta federal
court that Agility has &#8220;retreated to the safe haven of Kuwait&#8221;
and contends it isn&#8217;t subject to U.S. laws or courts. They urged
the judge not to even consider Agility&#8217;s motion to nullify the
indictment on the grounds that it wasn&#8217;t properly served. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agility &#8220;boasts repeatedly in the media that it wishes to
vindicate its reputation in this court by fully litigating this
case, yet it remains a fugitive, trying to litigate its claims
in the court of public opinion, while attempting to evade this
court of law,&#8221; prosecutors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agility adopted a company procedure that only one person
could accept service of the indictment and that person was
located outside the U.S., the government said in Monday&#8217;s
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry Frazier, a spokesman for the company, said it
welcomes the court&#8217;s review and an eventual ruling on the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question currently before the federal court in
Atlanta is whether the Justice Department complied with U.S.
law,&#8221; Frazier said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The Department&#8217;s
filing today substitutes rhetoric for legal analysis and
provides no justification for its decision to ignore
longstanding U.S. law on proper service of process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Crosby, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in
Atlanta, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Groups Win U.S. High Court Arbitration Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court gave a new endorsement to the use of
arbitration to resolve employment and consumer disputes, ruling
in favor of business groups in a fight over the extent of an
arbitrator&#8217;s authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices, in a 5-4 ruling yesterday, said that
arbitrators in many cases can decide whether an arbitration
agreement is so one-sided that it shouldn&#8217;t be enforced,
rejecting contentions that judges should always be the ones to
make that determination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling, which overturned a lower court decision, is a
victory for a unit of Rent-A-Center Inc. in a fight with a black
employee who says he was the victim of racial discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rent-A-Center&#8217;s arbitration agreement, which Antonio
Jackson signed when he was hired, says that an arbitrator should
resolve any issue involving the enforceability of the accord.
The rent-to-own company, based in Plano, Texas, argued that a
federal arbitration law requires such agreements to be enforced
as written. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackson argued that the federal law gives federal judges
the responsibility to determine whether a valid arbitration
agreement exists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Rent-A-Center West v. Jackson, 09-497, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky Wins $52.6 Million Ruling Over Loan to Ex-Employee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boris Berezovsky, the Russian billionaire with U.K.
political asylum, won a $52.6 million judgment against a former
employee who defaulted on a loan for an oil-trading business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruslan Fomichev, his business partner Vasily Peganov, and
their trading company Anstead Holdings Inc. must repay $47
million plus interest on a 2003 loan from North Shore Inc., an
offshore entity set up by Berezovsky, Judge Guy Newey ruled
yesterday in London&#8217;s High Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute arose after almost half of the loaned money was
frozen by Swiss authorities as part of a probe into embezzlement
claims against Berezovsky related to the Russian carrier OAO
Aeroflot, according to court documents. Fomichev claimed the
contract could be avoided because Berezovsky failed to warn him
that the money could be frozen if it were deposited in
Switzerland. Newey disagreed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A contract cannot be rescinded for misrepresentation&#8221;
unless the borrower &#8220;was induced to enter into the contract by
the misrepresentation,&#8221; Newey said in the 86-page judgment.
&#8220;North Shore&#8217;s claims against Mr. Fomichev and Mr. Peganov
succeed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Swainston, a lawyer for Fomichev and Peganov with
the firm Brick Court Chambers in London, didn&#8217;t return a call

&lt;p&gt;Knauf Settles Two U.S. Chinese-Drywall Suits, Trial Dismissed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knauf Plasterboard Tianjin Co., a Chinese drywall maker,
settled with two U.S. property owners, resulting in the
dismissal of a trial intended to help determine issues in
related lawsuits nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms of the agreements weren&#8217;t filed following a
settlement conference June 18 in the New Orleans chambers of
U.S. District Judge Eldon Fallon, who oversees Chinese drywall
cases in federal courts. Knauf is among about 1,000 defendants
that may face claims, Fallon said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallon ordered the dismissal of the two suits brought
against Knauf by Paul Clement and Celeste Schexnaydre and by
John Campbell, who own real estate near New Orleans and in Gulf
Shores, Alabama, that they claimed had been tainted by
contaminated drywall that can cause health problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Clement and Campbell cases had been selected by the
manufacturers to be heard together in a jury trial overseen by
Fallon and used as a benchmark for property damage in other
cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Chinese-Manufactured Drywall Products
Liability Litigation, 2:09-md-02047, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Yee Kai Pin" date="Jun 22, 2010  3:50 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-22/goldman-sachs-cuts-crude-oil-price-forecasts-because-of-fragile-markets.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Cuts Crude Oil Price Forecasts Because of `Fragile' Markets</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable bank in Wall Street history, reduced its price
forecasts for crude oil because commodity markets are
&#8220;fragile&#8221; on concern growth in Europe and China will slow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate oil, traded in New York, was
forecast at $100 a barrel in 2011, down 9.1 percent from its
previous prediction of $110, Goldman said in a report today. The
bank also downgraded prices for three-month, six-month and 12-
month crude and for Brent oil, traded in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Commodity markets are generally rebounding strongly off
their lows but sentiment remains fragile on European and Chinese
concerns,&#8221; said analysts led by New York-based Allison Nathan.
&#8220;Markets will remain fragile until there is further evidence
that sovereign pressures are stabilizing and global trend
economic growth remains intact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil in New York has gained more than 10 percent so far in
June, set for the biggest monthly increase since October, amid
speculation global demand for fuels will recover as Europe
overcomes its debt crisis. Futures yesterday reached a six-week
high of $78.92 a barrel after China, the world&#8217;s second-largest
energy consumer, signaled an end to the yuan&#8217;s fixed rate to the
dollar, a move that may boost the country&#8217;s purchasing power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have lowered our three-month oil and base metals price
forecasts but to levels still above current prices, and maintain
a positive medium-term view of key commodities,&#8221; the analysts
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman said the market is &#8220;overestimating&#8221; any negative
impact of government policies on growth and has discounted
possible constraints on oil supply in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Too Bearish&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sentiment is too bearish on both the sovereign-debt risks
as well as the effects of macroeconomic momentum slowing,&#8221; the
analysts wrote. &#8220;Despite some macro slowing, absolute growth
indicators are still firmly positive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI, a low-sulfur crude, is the reference grade for futures
contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent is quoted
in oil contracts at the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Implied demand for key commodities has remained at
exceptionally high levels in the emerging markets,&#8221; the Goldman
analysts said. &#8220;Developed market demand has generally surprised
to the upside.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI contracts for December delivery have gained $3.40 a
barrel since a May 10 buy recommendation, according to the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global fuel consumption will increase 2 percent this year
to a record 86.4 million barrels a day, the International Energy
Agency predicted June 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following tables show Goldman Sach&#8217;s price forecasts
for crude, in dollars a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanghai will have more than half of
Asia&#8217;s stock market liquidity in 2020 as China gradually moves
to full currency convertibility and opens yuan-denominated A
shares to foreign investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a financial centre, we expect Shanghai to develop more
along the lines of the New York model -- that is, primarily
dedicated to its domestic market -- rather than as a regional
financial centre like London or Singapore,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
analysts Christopher Eoyang, Jason Lui and Sunil Koul said in a
research report released today. &#8220;In many ways, we think
Shanghai may partially emulate the development of Hong Kong
during the 1980s and 1990s, when manufacturing was gradually
replaced by higher value added services.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai currently accounts for 25 percent of the region&#8217;s
daily cash equity and futures turnover, the analysts wrote. The
city will benefit &#8220;disproportionately&#8221; as China&#8217;s financial
markets grow deeper and more sophisticated, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s central government has a goal of making Shanghai an
international financial center by 2020. The city&#8217;s economy,
which already surpassed Hong Kong&#8217;s in size last year, grew 8.2
percent in 2009. In comparison, New York City&#8217;s expanded 0.9
percent in the fourth quarter after seven straight quarterly
declines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs report comes after the People&#8217;s Bank of
China pledged June 19 to make its currency more flexible, a move
that drove the yuan up by the most since July 2005. The Shanghai
Composite Index climbed 2.9 percent yesterday. U.S. President
Barack Obama said the policy action will &#8220;contribute to a more
balanced global economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman forecast that with a gradual liberalization, the
value of equities and futures traded daily in China could reach
$455 billion in 2020, about 70 percent of the regional total, up
from the current $58 billion, or 36 percent of the liquidity in
Asia, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the same scenario, trading turnover in Shanghai could
increase to more than $350 billion per day in a decade from the
current $47 billion, Goldman Sachs estimated. That means
Shanghai would account for more than 75 percent of China&#8217;s
liquidity, and as much as 53 percent of Asia&#8217;s, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite Shanghai&#8217;s image as a modern commercial centre
and its notable achievements, China&#8217;s equity capital markets are
relatively immature,&#8221; the Goldman analysts wrote. &#8220;Although
the government is on the path towards full currency
convertibility and the opening up of the domestic equity market,
the process will probably be very gradual, and this could
potentially benefit Hong Kong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ownership of yuan-denominated or A-shares is limited to
Chinese citizens and approved overseas investors under the
qualified foreign institutional investor, or QFII, program. The
analysts estimated current foreign ownership of A shares at
about 0.5 percent of market capitalization, compared to 25
percent in Japan and about 30 percent in Korea and Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, said it suspended trials of its experimental pain
relief drug, tanezumab, for osteoarthritis after reports that
patients&#8217; conditions worsened and led to joint replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, isn&#8217;t recruiting any new patients or giving the
drug to patients already in 10 osteoarthritis trials or those
with the condition taking the drug in studies for other
diseases, the New York-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanezumab would generate an estimated $100 million in
annual sales by the end of 2012, and $260 million by 2013,
according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The drug was one of
500 projects the company had preserved in a pared-down
development portfolio. Pfizer said in April 2009 that the drug
as a treatment for the pain of osteoarthritis in the knee had
moved into the third and final stage of testing usually needed
for regulatory approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA asked the company to show data on potential effects
in clinical studies of the drug among patients with cancer pain,
interstitial cystitis, chronic low back pain and painful
diabetic peripheral neuropathy, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency will then decide whether to halt Pfizer&#8217;s
remaining trials of tanezumab after reviewing company data.
Trials for other conditions haven&#8217;t reported similar adverse
events, MacKay Jimeson, a Pfizer spokesman, said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., Yahoo! Inc. and
Google Inc. have taken their battle to become the online
advertiser of choice to the sandy shores of Cannes, wining,
dining and making pitches to the world&#8217;s biggest ad agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology companies are fighting for a chunk of the
$456 billion global ad market, as Coca-Cola Co., Unilever NV and
Procter  Gamble Co. increasingly follow their customers online.
The Internet ranks second behind television as the most popular
medium for marketing, and traditional ad agencies are the key to
unlocking access to such ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ad agencies are a great driver of growth for
companies like Google and Microsoft,&#8221; said Alex DeGroote, a
media analyst at Panmure Gordon  Co. in London. &#8220;Google
doesn&#8217;t do creative work like an agency, but it can tell you
through research if search advertising is the way forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &#8220;Microsoft Advertising Beach Club,&#8221; on the French
Mediterranean coast, executives mingled this week over cocktails
and hors d&#8217;oeuvres. Yahoo! gave away free flip-flops and flew in

YouTube smoothies and let attendees of the 57th Cannes Lions
Advertising Festival design T-shirts on a digital board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should use options to bet
that JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s shares have fallen too much in
relation to Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s given that industry-reform
legislation from the U.S. Congress is likely to affect their
earnings equally, Barclays Plc said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maneesh Deshpande, who leads the top-ranked equity
derivatives strategy team in Institutional Investor magazine&#8217;s
2009 survey, recommended selling New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s
September $35 puts while buying Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America&#8217;s November $14 puts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiators in Congress are working to agree on financial-
regulation legislation to rein in risk-taking and predatory
lending after the 2008 credit crisis. Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, and Senator Christopher Dodd,
the Connecticut Democrat, have said they want to deliver a final
bill to President Barack Obama for his signature by the U.S.
July 4 holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the financial reform bill has gathered pace, JPMorgan
has underperformed Bank of America even though our analysts
estimate the likely impact of the bill in its current shape on
earnings of both banks to be potentially the same,&#8221; the New
York-based strategist wrote in a report yesterday. &#8220;This
underperformance of JPMorgan&#8217;s equity is also reflected in the
options market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, rose 1.5
percent to $38.89 at 4 p.m. in New York. Before today, the
shares had fallen 8 percent this year. Bank of America lost 1
percent to $15.43 today. The largest U.S. lender by assets had
gained 3.5 percent since Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has more to gain than Bank of America if lawmakers
pass a weaker version of the proposed derivatives regulation and
the so-called Volcker rule banning proprietary trading at U.S.
banks, Deshpande said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America and JPMorgan were among four of the
nation&#8217;s largest lenders that earned money in their trading
businesses every day in the first quarter. JPMorgan said almost
a third of its $3.3 billion in first-quarter earnings came from
trading and securities sales. The company doesn&#8217;t break out
proprietary trading from its investment bank revenue. Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has publicly opposed the Volcker
rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vivus Inc. options are a good
investment strategy for those who &#8220;don&#8217;t have the stomach&#8221; to
bet on the shares before next month&#8217;s U.S. panel review of the
company&#8217;s lead drug candidate, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the unprofitable biotechnology company may double
to a 12-year high if Food and Drug Administration advisers
recommend approval of the obesity drug Qnexa, equity derivatives
strategist Marko Kolanovic and biotechnology industry analyst
Cory Kasimov said. They recommend buying September $12.50 calls
while selling the same number of September $20 calls, a strategy
known as a &#8220;spread&#8221; that cuts the cost of the trade while
capping potential profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivus is in a race with San Diego-based companies Arena
Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Orexigen Therapeutics Inc. to sell new
prescription weight-loss drugs. While sedentary lifestyles and
fatty diets caused the number of obese U.S. adults to double in
the past 30 years, companies have struggled to find medicines
that help people slim down without dangerous side effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The options market suggests investors are generally
expecting a positive outcome,&#8221; Kolanovic and Kasimov wrote
yesterday in a note to clients. &#8220;There is a significant volume
and open interest imbalance towards call options ahead of the
July 15th Advisory Committee meeting convened by the FDA,
suggesting the market expects a recommendation for approval.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approval Bet &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They placed a 60 percent probability of Vivus winning a
favorable recommendation from the panel. While the FDA usually
follows the recommendations of its advisers, it isn&#8217;t required
to do so. The agency is scheduled to release a preliminary staff
report of its findings on July 13 to guide the panel&#8217;s
discussion. A final decision on approval is due by Oct. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasimov has rated Vivus shares at &#8220;overweight&#8221; since
January 2008, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mountain View, California-based drugmaker lost 12
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $9.68 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The shares have increased
5.2 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy JPMorgan recommended starts to make money if
the shares are more than about $14.50 by expiration on Sept. 17
and the maximum profit is reached if the stock is more than $20.
That level would be the highest price for Vivus since December
1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivus September $20 calls are the most-widely owned on the
stock, accounting for 9.5 percent the total 224,115 outstanding
Vivus options. September $11 calls are second, at 5.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Calls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls have an open interest of 141,023 contracts, or about
two-thirds of the total. By comparison, put options account for
almost three-quarters of the contracts on the Health Care Select
Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When sophisticated investors trade options in
anticipation of a binary event such as an approval date, they
leave useful information embedded in option pricing,&#8221; Kolanovic
and Kasimov said. &#8220;Historically, a large call/put open interest
imbalance has been a bullish signal for the underlying stock,
which is consistent with a higher probability assigned for a
positive outcome.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The options market is pricing in a gain or loss of about 64
percent after the announcement, they said. The September options
are best to use because they are the next available maturity
after the July contracts, which expire a day after the event,
they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous Drugs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth pulled its diet pill known as fen-phen in 1997 after
reports of heart valve damage in some women. Paris-based Sanofi-
Aventis SA failed in 2007 to persuade U.S. regulators that its
experimental weight-loss drug Zimulti should be approved despite
risks of suicide and depression. The drug, also called Acomplia,
was withdrawn in Europe the following year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Roche Holding AG of Basel, Switzerland, and London-
based GlaxoSmithKline Plc added warnings to their prescription
Xenical and over-the-counter Alli diet pills about the potential
for serious liver injury. Xenical was approved in 1999 and Alli,
a half-dose version of that drug, was introduced in 2007 as the
first non-prescription diet drug approved by FDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients on higher doses of Vivus&#8217;s Qnexa reported memory
loss and trouble concentrating, according to data presented in
October. The drug combines low doses of the appetite suppressant
phentermine, a commonly prescribed obesity drug that made up
half of fen-phen, with the anticonvulsant drug topiramate, the
generic form of Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s Topamax, used to treat
epilepsy and migraine headaches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2008, more than one-third of American adults were
obese -- measured as a ratio between height and weight -- and
two-thirds were overweight, according to the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey. Excess fat increases the risk of
diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heidi Miller, a confidant of Jamie Dimon for almost two decades, more than quintupled pretax profit
at JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s treasury unit since taking over the
division in 2004. Her reward: a newly created job heading all of
the company&#8217;s international operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role, handed to Miller in a series of senior management
changes yesterday, increased speculation that Dimon, the bank&#8217;s
54-year-old chief executive officer, is grooming long-time
loyalists such as Miller and Mike Cavanagh as potential
successors to run the second-largest U.S. bank. Cavanagh, 44,
took over Miller&#8217;s job from the chief financial officer post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller, 57, has been climbing the Wall Street power roster
since taking over JPMorgan&#8217;s payment-processing division, called
Treasury and Securities Services, six years ago. Since then, she
has been ranked among Fortune&#8217;s &#8220;Top 50 Women in Banking&#8221; and
Forbes&#8217;s &#8220;100 Most Powerful Women.&#8221; Last year she topped
Crain&#8217;s &#8220;50 Most Powerful Women in New York.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Going out and doing deals on the investment-banking side
generates a lot of press and prestige, but being able to
consolidate the back office of a bank, which is what Heidi did,
shows a management capability that we should appreciate more,
and I think Jamie recognizes it,&#8221; said Bradley Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford Bernstein  Co. &#8220;That portion of the
business is not appreciated in the equity markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said in March that he planned to rotate senior
executives across business lines as part of a succession plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;So Much Talent&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bank has so much talent in an industry that is sorely
lacking in it that one wonders how Mr. Dimon will keep his team
together,&#8221; Dick Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities LLC,
said in a research note today. &#8220;At some point, it is highly
likely that the JPMorgan team will break apart as its executives
are wooed by other banking companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treasury business provides clients with payment
processing and cash management. The unit handles an average of
$3.7 trillion in transfers daily and has $15.3 trillion in
assets under custody, the New York-based company said. Miller
turned the business around and generated a reliably high return
on equity throughout the economic crisis, according to Hintz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her tenure at the unit, revenue rose to $7.3 billion
last year from $4.2 billion in 2004, while the division&#8217;s
earnings jumped to $2.1 billion from $372 million in the same
period, Hintz said. The business has contributed an average of 9
percent to the bank&#8217;s total revenue over the past five years,
peaking at 11 percent in 2008 during the worst of the financial
crisis, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical Bank &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few executives have worked with Dimon as long as Miller,
apart from Dimon&#8217;s former mentor, Sandy Weill, who fired Dimon
from Citigroup Inc. in 1998. And few have been as loyal. Dimon
hired Miller away from Chemical Bank as his assistant at
Travelers Group Inc. in 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller was Dimon&#8217;s chief credit officer and risk officer at
Salomon Smith Barney and served as CFO under Dimon at both
Travelers and Citigroup. She had stints on her own as CFO at
discount Internet travel agency Priceline.com and as a vice
chairman at insurance broker Marsh Inc. from 2000 to early 2002,
when Dimon lured her to Bank One in Chicago as CFO. He then
brought her along as part of his senior management team when
JPMorgan merged with Bank One in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I had a few excursions off the reservation,&#8221; Miller said
in an interview yesterday. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always come back to recognize
that sometimes when you have a great boss -- and I do think
Jamie is a great CEO, he has huge integrity, great business
judgment -- it&#8217;s worth staying with that person.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Princeton Degree &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller doesn&#8217;t have a formal education in business. She was
among the first women ever admitted to Princeton University in
New Jersey, where she graduated in 1974 with a history degree,
according to Monica Langley&#8217;s book on Weill: &#8220;Tearing Down the
Walls.&#8221; She went on to earn a doctorate from Yale University in
Latin American studies and landed her first job with Chemical
Bank in its Latin American division in 1979 as a banker credit
trainee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She serves as a trustee at Princeton along with Supreme
Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who graduated two years behind
Miller in 1976, and sits on the board at General Mills Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller has shown she can manage overseas expansions.
Treasury and Securities Services derived 35 percent of its
revenue outside the U.S. and had 51 international locations in
2004, compared with 48 percent of revenue and 68 overseas
offices last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multinational Clients &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Multinationals operate in sometimes more countries than
we do,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;We increasingly see our clients look to
us to provide services and solutions throughout the world. We
want to make sure that we can do it for them seamlessly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the bank has a &#8220;good presence&#8221; internationally.
&#8220;The question is, can we accelerate growth plans in Asia, can
we accelerate what&#8217;s going to be growth in emerging Europe and
Latin America?&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s our goal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller&#8217;s new business will offer corporate clients
investment banking, advisory, debt capital markets, equity
capital markets, lending, payments and securities processing
services globally, she said. She&#8217;ll be targeting emerging
markets including China, Brazil, India and Russia, regions where
JPMorgan will battle Citigroup for business, said Anthony Polini, a banking analyst at Raymond James  Associates Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The projected growth rate for those economies are two or
three times greater than the projected growth rates of the
U.S.,&#8221; Polini said. More than half of Citigroup&#8217;s total revenue
comes from overseas, compared with about a quarter at JPMorgan,
Polini said. &#8220;This is a key play to get a piece of the pie that
Citi has a bigger slice of right now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer Lending &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Citigroup, JPMorgan isn&#8217;t looking to dominate the
consumer lending market overseas, said analysts including Paul Miller at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia, who isn&#8217;t
related to Heidi. Miller will instead focus on the wholesale
banking side, coordinating with Cavanagh and investment-bank
chief executive Jes Staley, who will still report to Dimon. She
will also chair a new International Operating Committee of the
firm&#8217;s global leaders, focusing on developing international
branches across all lines of business, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they want to be a Citigroup that wants to
run credit card operations in Mexico or run retail banking
franchises in Indonesia,&#8221; Paul Miller said. &#8220;They want to have
strategic investment banking relationships in places where it
matters.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve will keep
its key rate unchanged until 2012 because of high unemployment
and low inflation, said Edward McKelvey, senior U.S. economist
at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman predicts no rate change until 2012 &#8220;because the
unemployment rate is very high, because inflation is well below
the Fed&#8217;s objective, and is actually drifting down,&#8221; McKelvey
said in an interview with Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Inside
Track&#8221; program today. &#8220;They&#8217;re really missing on both their
targets and there&#8217;s no reason to raise rates at this point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed officials, who are likely to repeat the commitment to
an &#8220;extended period&#8221; of low interest rates in a Washington
meeting today, are contending with joblessness that&#8217;s still
close to a 26-year high. Rising foreclosures and a drop in new
home sales are threatening to harm the recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaker home sales are &#8220;the reflection of an extreme excess
supply in the industry which has been apparent for several years
and will persist for a while,&#8221; McKelvey said. &#8220;As long as
that&#8217;s the case it&#8217;s hard to forecast significant improvement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain&#8217;s new bank levy will have a
&#8220;minimal&#8221; impact on U.S. investment banks with operations in
London, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. likely to pay only a sixth
of the bill it faces for the bonus tax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. may pay about a quarter of the 2 billion-pound ($3
billion) total levy a year, according to analysts at Seymour
Pierce Ltd. and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit
today. The U.K.&#8217;s five biggest banks will pay about 76 percent
of the Treasury forecast for the bank tax, according to Mark Phin, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The impact will be minimal for U.S. investment banks,&#8221;
said Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London
with an &#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on New York-based Goldman
Sachs. &#8220;It could impact Goldman by about $100 million per year,
or about 1 percent of earnings. That assumes the industry in
general doesn&#8217;t pass on the cost to customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm in U.S.
history, has said the U.K.&#8217;s one-time bonus tax will leave it
with a $600 million bill. In December, the U.K. put a one-time
50 percent levy on bankers&#8217; discretionary bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokeswomen for JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs in London
declined to comment on the bank levy today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne told lawmakers
yesterday the tax will raise about 2 billion pounds annually as
other European governments consider similar taxes to tackle
budget deficits inflated by bank bailouts. The 0.07 percent levy
on wholesale liabilities is less than half the 0.15 percent rate
being considered by the U.S. government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six biggest U.K. banks will pay about 1.5 billion
pounds of the 2 billion pounds forecast, with the remaining 500
million pounds coming from building societies and foreign banks,
Bank of America said today in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oriental Land Co., operator of
the Tokyo Disney Resort, said it may cooperate with Walt
Disney Co. on a planned Shanghai theme park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a possibility we may work together with Disney
on Shanghai,&#8221; Akiyoshi Yokota, executive director, said in
an interview at the company&#8217;s headquarters in Chiba
prefecture, a Tokyo suburb. No details on cooperation were
decided, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oriental Land has been talking about the planned theme
park and exchanging information with Disney, Yokota said,
without elaborating. Disney last year won Chinese government
approval for a park in Shanghai that may be completed by 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese theme park operator, aiming to post a
record profit for the second straight year, is looking to
expand its business outside Japan while trying to attract
tourists from China and other countries, as domestic
customers spend less amid falling wages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oriental Land gained 0.3 percent to 7,380 yen at 1:08
p.m. in Tokyo trading, 50 yen below the 7,430 yen reached on
June 21, the highest since Jan. 5, 2009. The benchmark Nikkei
225 Stock Average today sank 1.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income will probably rise 1.6 percent to 25.8
billion yen ($285 million) for the year ending March 31,
Oriental Land said in May. Sales may decline 4 percent to
356.6 billion yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s Disney resort includes Disneyland,
DisneySea and Disney Ambassador Hotel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (Japan) Ltd. acquired Retail Networks
Co., operator of Disney retail stores in Japan, from Oriental
Land in March, the Japanese company said in May. Oriental
Land pays royalties to Disney to operate its theme parks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three of the five U.S. banks that
dominate swaps trading already perform most transactions outside
their depository institutions and would face minimal disruption
from a congressional proposal to reorder the derivatives
business, financial statements and banking records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup Inc. would be hit
hardest by the proposal, crafted by Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln, to wall off swaps desks from commercial banks. JPMorgan
had 98 percent of its $142 billion in current value derivatives
holdings inside its bank in the first quarter of this year while
Citigroup had 89 percent of $112 billion, the records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., each of which
entered the commercial banking business in 2008 in the midst of
the financial crisis, would be less affected. Morgan Stanley
kept just over 1 percent of its $86 billion in derivatives
holdings in its bank in the first quarter, and Goldman Sachs
Group&#8217;s held 32 percent of its $104 billion. Bank of America
Corp., which absorbed broker-dealer Merrill Lynch in 2009, had
33 percent of its $115 billion in its bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lincoln, a Democrat, contends the swaps-desk measure would
reduce taxpayers&#8217; exposure to risky banking activities. The
banking industry has been lobbying against the idea for weeks,
saying it would drive up costs and send business to foreign
lenders. The trading numbers call into question the extent of
the impact and whether the congressional action would favor one
business model over another. While JPMorgan and Citigroup might
have to spend billions to re-capitalize their trading desks, the
three others might have much smaller costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Pick and Choose&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any time that Congress tries to pick and choose what
parts of the genie to put back in the bottle, we&#8217;re going to be
creating some pretty strange creatures,&#8221; said Bill Brown, a
Duke University law professor and former global co-head of
listed derivatives at Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has the vast majority of swaps trades in its bank,
though the percentage may be inflated due to the double counting
of a small amount of transactions in other parts of the its
businesses, according to a person familiar with the company&#8217;s
derivatives operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America
and Goldman Sachs declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$615 Trillion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swaps-desk provision is the most contentious of a
larger set of rules aimed at reducing risk in the system by
imposing for the first time a regulatory structure for the $615
trillion over-the-counter derivatives market. The changes would
also require standardized derivatives trades to be cleared
through a third party and traded on an exchange or so-called
swap-execution facility and would regulate the foreign-exchange
swaps market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A committee of lawmakers reconciling the House and Senate
versions of financial-regulatory reform is scheduled to take up
derivatives language tomorrow. Lawmakers said they have left it
for the end of the debate because of its complexity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swaps-desk measure introduced in April by Lincoln, who
is chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has cleared
several hurdles in the legislative process while being
criticized by the banking industry, the administration of
President Barack Obama, the Federal Reserve and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. Last week, seven U.S. regional lenders,
including U.S. Bancorp and SunTrust Banks Inc., came out against
the measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who
is leading the House negotiations, said in May that he thought
the Lincoln provision &#8220;goes too far.&#8221; He has changed his
stance recently, telling reporters yesterday that &#8220;the
essence&#8221; of the Lincoln proposal would be in the final
legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Certainly they will be totally insulated from any insured
deposits,&#8221; Frank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volcker &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month Frank raised the idea that one way to achieve
Lincoln&#8217;s goals without unintended consequences could be to
expand the scope of another proposal in the bill -- the so-
called Volcker rule, a ban on proprietary trading by banks. That
notion has failed to gain traction in the talks, because the
majority of the swaps trading by the banks is executed for other
customers and might not be covered by a prohibition on banks&#8217;
trading for their own accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations have been continuing on possible exemptions
for banks to the Lincoln proposal for certain types of customer-
driven derivatives products. Frank said yesterday Lincoln has
pushed back against those, including an exemption for desks that
serve as market-makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Senator Lincoln wants that to go outside&#8221; the depository
institution, Frank said. &#8220;And I think she&#8217;s going to win that
one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucrative Business &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling over-the-counter derivatives is among the most
lucrative businesses for the largest financial companies. U.S.
commercial banks held derivatives with a notional value of
$212.8 trillion in the fourth quarter, according to the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency. JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of
America, Goldman and Morgan Stanley hold 97 percent of that
total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculation of derivatives holdings for the five
largest banks is based on a Bloomberg News analysis of the
financial records of the bank holding companies and their
subsidiaries, as well as records filed with federal banking
regulators and posted publicly by the Federal Financial
Institutions Examination Council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps and other derivatives are financial instruments based
on the value of another security or benchmark. Some instruments,
including contracts that insured mortgage-backed bonds, have
been blamed for fueling a financial crisis that led to the worst
recession since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Lending &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lincoln and her supporters argue that separating swaps
trading from commercial banking would protect depositors and
other small customers from potentially risky trading that could
bring down a firm. They also say it would prevent bailouts by
denying swaps traders the assistance that the government gives
to banks, such as access to emergency lending from the Fed or
deposit insurance from the FDIC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We view this as an essential component of making the
system sound so that we can get back to where banks are lending
to businesses that are growing and creating jobs,&#8221; said Heather
Slavkin, a senior legal and policy adviser at the AFL-CIO.
&#8220;When banks use their resources to gamble in the derivatives
markets, they have less capital to invest in businesses that
will create good jobs for working people and grow the middle
class.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substantial Cost &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts from Citigroup last week wrote that longtime
commercial banks would bear the brunt of the rule, noting that
they would have to give up the benefit of funding their
derivatives deals with funds from deposits. The June 16 report
concluded that while it is &#8220;very difficult&#8221; to determine how
much it would cost to capitalize a free-standing swaps desk, the
price tag is likely to be &#8220;substantial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It all comes down to the cost of funding and it&#8217;s always
easier inside the bank where the credit rating is going to be
higher, the source of funding is more stable and it&#8217;s cheaper,&#8221;
said Brian Gardner, an analyst at investment firm Keefe Bruyette
 Woods. &#8220;Can you do it in a broker-dealer? Yep. People have
done it before and if they have to, they&#8217;ll do it again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-Term Disadvantage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the swaps-desk rule, if adopted, would put JPMorgan
and Citigroup at a short-term disadvantage with their
competitors, the big dealers have been arguing on Capitol Hill
that the bigger concern is that U.S. banks will be put at a
competitive disadvantage with foreign counterparts. Large
dealers such as Credit Suisse AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays
Plc, would be even less affected by the requirement, analysts
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the European Union nor Asian countries are looking
at requiring banks to wall off their derivatives trading as part
of their responses to the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m getting a lot of calls, hearing from a lot from folks
who do this for a living and they really think this is going to
drive the business away from U.S. banks,&#8221; Representative Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Bing search engine
is adding an entertainment page that allow users to watch
television shows, play games and listen to music without leaving
the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bing is providing local TV times, movie listings and access
to song lyrics, Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president of
Microsoft&#8217;s online audience business, said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement. The company invited press to an event in West
Hollywood, California, to announce the updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The features may help Microsoft gain ground on Google
Inc.&#8217;s dominant search engine. A survey of Bing users found that
76 percent want one online destination for entertainment options
to eliminate clutter, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said.
Bing organizes search results into TV shows, music, video games
and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the content on the Web has exploded, it has become
difficult to navigate and find what you are looking for,&#8221; Mehdi
said in the statement. &#8220;So we see a great opportunity to help
customers make important entertainment decisions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, fell 18
cents to $25.77 yesterday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The
shares have declined 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Microsoft&#8217;s Zune music service, Bing provides one-
time access to 5 million full-length songs and then 30-second
clips afterwards, according to Adam Sohn, a spokesman. Listeners
will also be able to buy the track, read the lyrics and find
concert information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service also lets users watch 1,500 TV shows and 20,000
full-length episodes of programs posted at Hulu.com, YouTube.com
and at the websites of cable and TV networks, without ever
actually leaving the Microsoft website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviews, Program Times &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bing also provides reviews, program times and the ability
to invite friends to watch together on Facebook, Twitter and
other social networks, Microsoft said. Users will also be able
to find movie times and buy tickets, and watch trailers and
clips with search results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers can use the site to find video-game reviews and
tips. The site is providing 100 casual games, including
&#8220;Bejeweled&#8221; and &#8220;Bubble Town,&#8221; that can be played on the
search results page. Friends can also be invited to play along
through Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com Inc. filed a patent-
infringement lawsuit today against Microsoft Corp., escalating a
fight between the two companies over the growing market for
cloud-computing software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s products such as .Net platform and SharePoint
perform in a way that violates the Salesforce.com patents, and
the &#8220;risk of infringement was either known or so obvious that
it should have been known by Microsoft,&#8221; Salesforce.com said in
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft has incorporated Salesforce.com&#8217;s patented
technology into its services and products,&#8221; the San Francisco-
based company said today in the lawsuit filed in federal court
in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint is in response to a patent-infringement
lawsuit Microsoft filed in May against Salesforce.com, which
pits the world&#8217;s largest software maker against the biggest
seller of Internet-based customer-management programs. Microsoft
targeted Salesforce.com&#8217;s customer-relationship management
software and sought a court order that would prevent the company
from providing features that Microsoft claims it invented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com hired David Boies, the lawyer for the U.S.
Justice Department in its successful antitrust case against
Microsoft, to handle the case. &#8220;Salesforce.com doesn&#8217;t comment
on pending litigation, and we will let our court filings speak
for themselves,&#8221; spokeswoman Jane Hynes said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft &#8216;Confident&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horacio Gutierrez, Microsoft&#8217;s deputy general counsel for
intellectual property, said the company was reviewing the
Salesforce.com complaint. &#8220;We remain confident in our position
and will continue to press ahead with the complaint&#8221; filed in
federal court in Seattle, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com, founded in 1999, sells subscriptions to
business software that runs marketing campaigns and tracks sales
leads using the Internet. It competes with Microsoft&#8217;s Dynamics
programs. Salesforce.com had $1.3 billion in sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint seeks a court order that would prevent
Microsoft&#8217;s further use of Salesforce.com products, plus
unspecified cash compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier case is Microsoft Corp. v. Salesforce.com Inc.,
10cv825, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington
(Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weinstein Co., the film studio run
by brothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein, reached an agreement with
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to eliminate its $450 million in debt,
a person with knowledge of the terms said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman was paid $115 million and took ownership of 250
films with $225 million in receivables and future cash flow that
should retire Weinstein&#8217;s debt, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the accord isn&#8217;t public. Weinstein will
be paid to manage the movies and can buy them back before 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement frees New York-based Weinstein of $30 million
a year in interest payments, the person said. The closely held
studio retains 150 titles including &#8220;The Reader&#8221; and
&#8220;Inglourious Basterds.&#8221; Goldman and partner Assured Guaranty
Ltd. got titles including &#8220;Halloween II&#8221; and &#8220;The Road,&#8221; The
Wall Street Journal reported earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Obviously this is an exciting time for the company,&#8221;
Harvey Weinstein said in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s always nice when a
deal can be a win-win for all partners involved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm in U.S.
history, fell 9 cents to $134.98 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 20 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the largest computer-services provider, sued a former

Corp., saying the new position violates a non-compete clause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanne Olsen, a 31-year veteran of IBM, left the company
this month to become a senior vice president at Oracle,
according to the suit, filed June 16. As a general manager in
IBM&#8217;s technology services division, Olsen knew about IBM&#8217;s

and as a member of the company&#8217;s leadership team, Joanne Olsen
possesses valuable confidential information about IBM and our
operations,&#8221; IBM spokesman Doug Shelton said today in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM trails only Oracle and Microsoft Corp. in software
sales. Oracle bought Sun Microsystems Inc. in January for $7.4
billion to enter the server-computer market, where they&#8217;ll also
compete with IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olsen signed a non-compete clause in July 2009, stating she
can&#8217;t join a competitor for a year after leaving, according to
the suit. At Oracle, she would become senior vice president of
on-demand services, managing the delivery of its applications
and reporting directly to Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison,
it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, fell $1.92, or 1.48
percent, to $128.19 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
today. The shares were little changed this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit comes one year after IBM tried to keep David Johnson, its former head of mergers and acquisitions, from
joining Dell Inc., another server-computer rival. A judge
dismissed the case, saying Johnson didn&#8217;t have knowledge that
would qualify as &#8220;quintessential trade-secret information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olsen&#8217;s lawyer, Michael Delikat, of Orrick Herrington 
Sutcliffe, couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. Oracle spokeswoman
Deborah Hellinger also didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
payments network, is to blame for a U.S. Senate proposal that
would cap fees merchants pay to accept debit cards, Discover
Financial Services Chief Executive Officer David Nelms said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Visa has tremendous market power in this area, and that&#8217;s
how we ended up here,&#8221; Nelms said in an interview today after
Riverwoods, Illinois-based Discover posted second-quarter
results. &#8220;Visa raised prices quite a bit and, I think, took the
actions that have led to the legislation in the first place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure pushed by U.S. Senator Richard Durbin as part
of the financial-overhaul bill would empower the Federal Reserve
to set &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, or interchange, that are &#8220;reasonable and
proportional&#8221; to the cost of processing debit transactions. The
Illinois Democrat and majority whip also backs a provision that
directs the Fed to issue rules barring networks from requiring
that their debit cards can only be used on one network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That non-exclusivity rule may create an opportunity for the
Discover-owned Pulse debit network and other competitors to gain
market share. San-Francisco-based Visa accounted for 73 percent
of U.S. debit purchase volume last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That opens up the prospect that Pulse or other debit
networks could no longer be excluded from those cards, and that
could be a pro-competitive outcome,&#8221; Nelms said. Discover
opposes Durbin&#8217;s proposed debit-fee caps as government price
controls &#8220;could be a negative for consumers,&#8221; Nelms said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Odds Are Increasing That Microsoft's Business Will Collapse"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a pretty good title if you (like Henry Blodget from Silicon Alley Insider, the writer of the article) are trying to grab eyeballs. It also provides a useful introduction to what I call the "Innovator's Paradox."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blodget's article was provocative. He argued that Microsoft is in a no-win situation. It isn't sitting on any idea that is on the cusp of turning into a multi-billion dollar business. The personal computer is losing its dominance to mobile devices and tablets. The company's core profit drivers (Windows and Office) are under disruptive assault from Google's freely available applications and operating system. At best, Microsoft will respond with its own free products and erode its profit margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most telling thing in Blodget's post was a chart that showed the sources of Microsoft's profits over the past few years. Microsoft's core business has continued &#8212; despite continued proclamations of the company's coming demise &#8212; to throw off cash and to grow. But new growth businesses that were specks in 2006 (entertainment and devices and online services) remain tiny, and Microsoft hasn't created any material new businesses over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the real problem isn't what Microsoft is doing today. It's what Microsoft did, or didn't do, five, or even 10 years ago. At the time, its base business was a bastion of strength. Today's threats were in their infancies. It would have been the perfect time to plant seeds that today would be blooming profit generators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why didn't it? It's The Innovator's Paradox: When you don't need the growth, you act in ways that lead to you not getting the growth you will need. And when you do need the growth, you can't act in ways that deliver it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use this chart to illustrate this point. It's helpful to stimulate discussion among a company's leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the chart shows, when times are going great ("exploitation"), companies have ample resources to invest in growth. But because times are going great, innovation efforts tend to be undisciplined. New growth efforts get flooded with cash. Companies don't worry about iterating to find a successful business model. Overpriced acquisitions occur.
Then, inevitably, maturation sets in. The need for new growth intensifies. But resources are harder to come by. Acquisition targets would rather join forces with the new kid on the block whose rapidly appreciating stock acts as a powerful acquisition currency. The acute need for growth gives an almost gravitational pull to large, existing markets. After all, that's where the money is. But large, existing markets are an innovator's fool's gold; glimmery, shiny, but not of much value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you do about the Innovator's Paradox? Consider what my colleague Clark Gilbert found in his doctoral research. He looked at how newspaper companies responded to the Internet, intersecting the disruptive innovation research of Clayton Christensen and the famous behavioral research of Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies in Gilbert's study viewed the Internet as a threat. That led to them committing resources to innovation efforts. However, they responded in very rigid ways (typically creating replicas of the newspapers online). Other companies viewed the Internet as an opportunity. That framing allowed for more expansive response strategies, but made it difficult to support serious resource allocation. Gilbert summarized this challenge by saying, "Absent a sense of threat, response to disruptive opportunities is inadequate; but with threat, the fully funded response is too rigid."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick, Gilbert argued, was to decouple the allocation of resources from the use of the resources. Breaking the Innovator's Paradox requires similar logic. Companies have to recognize that their core business, no matter how great it seems today, has a limit. That recognition should drive consistent allocation of resources to new growth efforts, especially when times are good. But those resources can't be burdened with a "bunker" mentality, or else they will struggle. As one friend told me, "No great growth business was built from a defensive crouch." Further, companies have to make sure they avoid the "curse of abundance" that can lead overly resourced growth efforts to struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all you have to do is invest when you don't need to, break psychological barriers that might unintentionally inhibit creativity, and somehow avoid the abundant resources that would seem to be your primary source of competitive advantage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one said this was going to be easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan
Stanley led bank stocks lower, and bearish option trades jumped,
on concern that financial-reform legislation due to be completed
as soon as today may reduce Wall Street revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 Financials Index, which includes 79 financial
firms, dropped as much as 2.2 percent as JPMorgan and Wells
Fargo  Co. fell as much as 3.8 percent. Morgan Stanley dropped
as low as $24.22, its lowest intraday level since May 2009.
Trading of puts to sell the Financial Select Sector SPDR
exchange-traded fund was 2.6 times the four-week average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are
negotiating the final language of legislation that may limit
banks&#8217; trading in over-the-counter derivatives as well as how
they invest their own capital. Some analysts say the proposed
laws have become tougher in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s starting to really cross over, quite clearly, not
into the area of financial regulatory reform but into punishment
of Wall Street,&#8221; Brian Gardner, a former congressional staffer
who is now a Washington analyst for Keefe, Bruyette  Woods
Inc., said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television.
&#8220;It&#8217;s become a net negative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House and Senate conferees are debating a ban on
proprietary trading, nicknamed the Volcker rule after former
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, as well as a provision
championed by Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln that would
require commercial banks to push out their swaps-trading
operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts Cut Estimates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation comes as analysts reduce their forecasts
for bank and securities firm earnings in the second quarter
because of a reduction in investment banking and deterioration
in markets in May and June. Barclays Capital analysts slashed
their estimates for Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s second-quarter
earnings per share 63 percent yesterday to $1.95 from an earlier
forecast of $5.35. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s so much uncertainty around it and that&#8217;s why
people are scared,&#8221; said Kevin Nichols, vice president for ETF
strategy at Newedge Group in New York. &#8220;It also has to do with
regulators coming in to an industry that&#8217;s facing a lot of other
headwinds like slower investment banking business, analysts
cutting projections and lower volumes in equities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 Financials Index was down 1.95 percent as of
11:42 a.m. and JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
dropped $1.16, or 2.98 percent, to $37.73. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 485,000 puts to sell the financial ETF changed
hands, 18 times the number of calls giving the right to buy. The
ETF tracking 79 companies fell 1.7 percent to $14.27 as all but
two members retreated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most active contracts were August $13 puts, which rose
37 percent to 37 cents and accounted for almost a third of all
options trading. The ETF hasn&#8217;t closed below $13 since July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Orleans judge who lifted the
U.S. ban on deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico probably
lost money selling shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. the same day he
issued his ruling, according to records released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman released his financial
information at the request of environmentalists, who&#8217;ve
questioned whether Feldman is violating a judicial conduct code
that requires judges to step aside from cases in which they have
a financial interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 22, Feldman lifted a six-month moratorium President
Barack Obama issued May 27 as a reaction to the worst oil spill
in U.S. history, caused by the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig off the Louisiana coast in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feldman said he didn&#8217;t recall owning Exxon shares until
&#8220;9:45 p.m. Monday the 21st,&#8221; according to a statement released
today by the judge&#8217;s office. &#8220;Because he remembered that Exxon,
who was not a party litigant in the moratorium case,
nevertheless had one of the 33 rigs in the Gulf, the judge
instructed his broker to sell Exxon and XTO as soon as the
market opened the next morning,&#8221; according to the statement.
Feldman said he &#8220;doesn&#8217;t know whether there was a profit or a
loss on the sale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XTO refers to XTO Energy Inc., a Fort Worth, Texas--based
energy company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offshore Safety &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government lawyers told Feldman the ban was needed to give
a presidential commission time to study improvements in the
safety of offshore drilling. The government urged Feldman to
uphold the moratorium at a June 21 hearing in a lawsuit Hornbeck
Offshore Services Inc. and a dozen other offshore service firms
brought against Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar and other
regulators, seeking overthrow of the ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feldman sold the less than $15,000 worth of Exxon Mobil he
purchased in December, recording an undisclosed loss, on a trade
the judge said was made &#8220;at the opening of the stock market on
June 22,&#8221; according to a letter he sent the U.S. Courts&#8217;
Administrative Office. This places the trade several hours prior
to his ruling lifting the ban, which was released just after
noon New Orleans time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil traded as high as $63.20 on June 22,
before closing at $61.94 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The lowest price Exxon sold for in December was $67.64
on Dec. 18, meaning the judge probably lost at least 6.6 percent
on his investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon shelved plans to drill one deep-water exploratory
well and one deep-water production well because of the
moratorium, company spokeswoman Cynthia Bergman said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclosure Statements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to his 2008 financial disclosure statements,
Feldman owned interests in 16 oil and gas-related companies,
including Halliburton Co. and Transocean Ltd., which are both
involved in the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Feldman has since
sold the Halliburton and Transocean positions, along with most
of his other offshore-related holdings, according to his latest
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feldman still holds other energy-related investments,
including Ocean Energy, El Paso Corp. and Valero Energy Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 23, the U.S. said it will appeal Feldman&#8217;s ruling,
and Salazar said the government may consider imposing a second
drilling moratorium that would keep 33 floating rigs inactive in
the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feldman refused to stay his order lifting the moratorium
while the government seeks its appeal at U.S. Fifth Circuit,
also located in New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar,
2:10-cv-01663, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans), and the appeal is 10-30585, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co., the two largest U.S. banks, drove a measure of
financial stocks to the biggest daily gain in a month after
Congress agreed to ease proposed curbs on trading and investing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America and JPMorgan each rose more than 3 percent,
in line with a 3.1 percent advance in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
Diversified Financials Index, as the Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell. It was the financial index&#8217;s largest one-day
increase since May 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is sort of celebrating the fact that the
largest banks&#8217; operations are largely left intact,&#8221; said Nancy Bush, founder of NAB Research LLC in Annandale, New Jersey, who
covers JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo  Co. Even so,
future expansion of the biggest banks may be limited, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called Volcker rule to ban banks from investing in
hedge funds and private equity was &#8220;watered down a bit,&#8221;
allowing lenders to invest as much as 3 percent of their
capital, Deutsche Bank analysts Matt O&#8217;Connor and Michael Carrier said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ban on derivative-trading by commercial banks proposed by
Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas was amended to allow trades
on interest rates and foreign-exchange swaps, which made up
about 92 percent of their total notional trading volume in the
first quarter. Banks will have as many as two years to comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What Senator Lincoln wanted to do didn&#8217;t come to pass and
that&#8217;s a major win for the big banks,&#8221; said Gerard Cassidy, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20-Hour Session &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, rose
2.7 percent to $15.42. JPMorgan, based in New York, advanced 3.7
percent to $39.44. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers from the House and Senate worked through the
night in a 20-hour session to reach deals on a ban on
proprietary trading by banks and oversight of the derivatives
market. The legislation, which also seeks to protect consumers
from abusive lending practices, still needs to be approved by
the full House and Senate. Congressional leaders aim to hold
votes next week and send it for Obama&#8217;s signature by July 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama today praised lawmakers for agreeing on what he
called the &#8220;toughest&#8221; consumer reforms in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill is &#8220;not as bad as it looks,&#8221; FBR Capital Markets
analyst Paul Miller wrote in a report. &#8220;The conference
committee avoided adopting the worst-case scenario.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, congressional negotiators removed language
that would have required banks to act as a fiduciary when
selling derivatives to states, municipalities and pension funds,
Miller said. Instead, a code of conduct was adopted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. sold $650 million of bonds tied to a loan on One
Bryant Park, an office tower in midtown Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top-rated 10-year securities yield 150 basis points
more than the benchmark swap rate, according to a person
familiar with the offering who declined to be identified because
terms aren&#8217;t public. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue was marketed with a spread of 155 basis points
over swaps. A tighter spread reflects increased demand for
commercial-mortgage backed securities linked to new loans with
conservative terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue marks this year&#8217;s third sale of new commercial-
mortgage-backed securities containing loans without government
backing, bringing the 2010 total to about $1.67 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales halted in 2008 as
credit markets froze, choking off funding to property buyers.
Even with government aid, only $3.04 billion of the debt was
issued last year, compared with $11.2 billion in 2008 and a
record $232.4 billion in 2007, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the sales peak, commercial-mortgage bonds were sold
that were as large as $7.6 billion and bundled as many as 300
loans for real estate across the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have been slow to write new loans to package for sale
as many borrowers struggle to pay off their existing mortgages
with property prices down 41 percent from the October 2007
highs, according to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. Also, it takes
several months to accumulate mortgages to be bundled into bonds,
making some banks hesitant to write the loans without a means to
protect against price swings on the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads to Treasuries &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Plc&#8217;s $309.7 million April sale was
the first offering to contain mortgages from multiple borrowers
since June 2008, Bloomberg data show. JPMorgan sold $716.3
million of bonds backed by pooled loans on June 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-rated bonds backed by commercial real estate yield
about 2.88 percentage points more than Treasuries, compared with
more than 7 percentage points more than benchmarks a year ago,
according to a Barclays PLC index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporations from the U.S., Japan
and Europe expect the euro to remain under pressure against the
dollar for the rest of this year, a quarterly survey of clients
by JPMorgan Chase  Co. showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 90 percent of respondents expect the common
currency to remain below $1.30 at the end of the year, JPMorgan
said. The bank between June 14 and June 21 surveyed 141 clients
with a total market capitalization of about $2 trillion. The
euro traded between $1.2103 and $1.2487 during that period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average forecast for euro&#8217;s year-end level, weighted by
firm size, fell to $1.22 from $1.34 in March, according to the
survey. The average forecast for December 2011 fell to $1.25 in
this quarter&#8217;s survey from $1.34 in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Only European companies envisioned a modest recovery in
the euro toward end-2011 to above 1.3, while companies in both
the U.S. and Japan expected the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate
to remain under pressure throughout 2010 and 2011,&#8221; a team of
JPMorgan strategists led by Gabriel de Kock wrote in a note
published today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro, at $1.2294 today, has weakened 0.4 percent this
week. Last week it gained the most in most than a year as an
easing in concern over Europe&#8217;s debt crisis spurred traders to
end bets the shared currency would decline. The common currency
touched a four-year low of $1.1877 on June 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. dollar lost ground for a third consecutive week
versus the Japanese yen, falling 1.5 percent to 89.35 yen from
90.71 yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign-Exchange Hedging &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union policy makers last month announced a loan
plan of almost $1 trillion to aid debt-laden governments and
shore up the 16-nation currency. EU leaders agreed last week to
disclose how banks perform in stress tests, seeking to show
investors that the financial system can withstand shocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S., European and Japanese corporations boosted foreign-
exchange hedging as of the end of the second quarter relative to
March, the JPMorgan survey showed. The percentage of 2010
foreign-exchange exposure hedged by these corporations rose to
64.6 percent in June, up from 58.2 percent in March. The hedging
ratio was close to the average June level in the client surveys
over the past five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G-20 leaders meet in Toronto June 26-27 to discuss policies
aimed at addressing Europe&#8217;s crisis, spurring global growth and
overhauling financial regulation. &lt;/p&gt;

drilling to resume while the U.S. notified an appeals court it
would challenge the decision lifting the six-month moratorium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman in New Orleans yesterday
refused to stay his June 22 order lifting a moratorium imposed
by President Barack Obama in reaction to the worst oil spill in
U.S. history. The government said it would appeal and asked
Feldman to put his order on hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendants&#8217; motion to stay pending appeal is hereby
denied for the same reasons given in this court&#8217;s June 22, 2010,
order granting the plaintiffs&#8217; motion for preliminary
injunction,&#8221; Feldman wrote in yesterday&#8217;s ruling. The judge
said in the earlier decision that the ban was too broad and
would cause irreparable harm to offshore-oil service companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Miller, spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department,
declined to comment on yesterday&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government yesterday filed a notice with Court of
Appeals in New Orleans saying defendants including Kenneth
Salazar, secretary of the Interior, &#8220;hereby appeal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama temporarily halted all drilling in waters deeper than
500 feet on May 27 to give a presidential commission time to
study improvements in the safety of offshore operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc. and more than a dozen
Louisiana offshore service and supply companies sued U.S.
regulators to lift the ban, arguing they would suffer
irreparable economic harm from the suspension in drilling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar,
2:10-cv-01663, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans), and the appeal is 10-30585, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banker Who Blew Whistle on Tax Cheats Secrecy Seeks Pardon &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradley Birkenfeld, once a UBS AG banker who handled a $200
million investment for a billionaire client, now makes 12 cents
an hour mopping floors at the federal prison in Minersville,
Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleeping in a bunk bed in a dormitory-style building with
35 other inmates is far from the reward Birkenfeld says he
deserves for exposing a massive tax-evasion scandal at UBS, the
biggest Swiss bank. He told U.S. authorities how UBS bankers
came to the U.S. to woo rich Americans, managed $20 billion of
their assets, and helped them cheat the Internal Revenue
Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birkenfeld, 45, has asked President Barack Obama to commute
a 40-month term he began in January at Schuylkill Federal
Correctional Institution for his part in the conspiracy. He is
seeking payment from the IRS whistleblower program and wants the
U.S. Department of Justice to punish prosecutors who wouldn&#8217;t
grant him immunity before his 2008 indictment and guilty plea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I delivered and documented this entire scandal, the
largest in U.S. history,&#8221; Birkenfeld said in one of two prison
interviews with Bloomberg News. &#8220;I&#8217;m the most famous
whistleblower in the history of the world. It&#8217;s a question of
doing the right thing, and that&#8217;s what I did.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His disclosures preceded UBS&#8217;s decision to pay $780 million
to avoid prosecution, admit it fostered tax evasion from 2000 to
2007, and turn over data on 250 secret accounts to the IRS. UBS
later agreed to reveal data on another 4,450 accounts, a
transfer upheld last week by the Swiss Parliament. For lifting
the veil on Swiss bank secrecy, Birkenfeld said, he&#8217;s a hero,
not a criminal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Birkenfeld, 08-cr-60099, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Sues to Bar Former Services Manager From Joining Oracle &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp., the largest
computer-services provider, sued a former technology services
manager to keep her from working at Oracle Corp., saying the new
position violates a non-compete clause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanne Olsen, a 31-year veteran of IBM, left the company
this month to become a senior vice president at Oracle,
according to the suit, filed June 16. As a general manager in
IBM&#8217;s technology services division, Olsen knew about IBM&#8217;s
growth strategies and potential acquisitions, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a long time general manager in our services business
and as a member of the company&#8217;s leadership team, Joanne Olsen
possesses valuable confidential information about IBM and our
operations,&#8221; IBM spokesman Doug Shelton said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olsen signed a non-compete clause in July 2009, stating she
can&#8217;t join a competitor for a year after leaving, according to
the suit. At Oracle, she would become senior vice president of
on-demand services, managing the delivery of its applications
and reporting directly to Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison,
it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel Prosecutor Seeks Four-Year Prison Sentence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerome Kerviel should serve four years in prison for his
role in Societe Generale SA&#8217;s 4.9 billion-euro ($6 billion)
loss, French prosecutor Jean-Michel Aldebert said in his closing
arguments to judges in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel, 33, is accused of abuse of trust, faking documents
and hacking the bank&#8217;s computers. The trading loss occurred as
the bank unwound 50 billion euros in positions he&#8217;d built up by
January 2008, far beyond his trading limits, and concealed with
faked hedges and forged orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jerome Kerviel is a liar, a trickster, and a fraudster,&#8221;
Aldebert said. &#8220;I ask you to declare him guilty of the
charges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel has insisted that his actions were &#8220;professional
errors&#8221; rather than crimes. He told the court earlier in the
trial that the faked documents were so simple anyone would have
known they were forgeries, his excuses were so far-fetched they
shouldn&#8217;t have been believed, and that the money he was using
was always visible to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommended sentence is &#8220;very, very heavy,&#8221; Kerviel
lawyer Olivier Metzner said outside the courtroom. Kerviel&#8217;s
goal &#8220;was to make money for the bank.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metzner will deliver closing arguments today, on the
trial&#8217;s final day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-week long trial has featured more than 30
witnesses, including Kerviel&#8217;s bosses, colleagues and bank
controllers. Daniel Bouton, Societe Generale&#8217;s chief executive
officer at the time of the loss, called the former trader&#8217;s
conduct a &#8220;catastrophe&#8221; for the bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese Drywall Claimant Count Is Unknown, Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts are still unsure how many claimants will sue USG
Corp. and Knauf Group over defective drywall as they seek to
determine the magnitude of the litigation, said a federal judge
who is overseeing the cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Eldon Fallon said yesterday during a
court conference in New Orleans that his rulings have resolved
only 10 of what could be 40,000 claims. The court is using
various methods to determine the &#8220;whole census&#8221; of parties to
the litigation, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those cases, part of coordinated litigation over allegedly
defective drywall, are intended as a bellwether to help
determine property damage issues in other cases against
manufacturers. Two of the bellwether claims settled this week
before trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that settlement, Knauf Plasterboard Tianjin Co.
agreed to pay for removal and replacement of the drywall from
one home and repairs to the electrical system, as well as
$40,000 for moving, rent, storage and personal items. In the
other claim, Knauf agreed to pay $20,175 to an apartment owner
for lost rental income pending a six-month inspection of 21
units allegedly damaged by the drywall. The company also agreed
to remove and replace the drywall and replace wiring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first jury trial in the U.S. over defective drywall,
a state court panel in Miami last week said a Florida family
suffered $2.5 million in damages as a result of defective
drywall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Chinese-Manufactured Drywall Products
Liability Litigation, 2:09-md-02047, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley to Pay $102 Million in Subprime Accord &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley reached a $102 million settlement with
Massachusetts over allegations the firm financed and securitized
unfair residential loans, state Attorney General Martha Coakley
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Morgan Stanley backed loans for homeowners they knew or
should have known were destined to fail,&#8221; Coakley said during a
press conference yesterday in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is barred from making unfair loans and will be
required to make additional disclosures going forward, Coakley
said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bundling of the riskiest type of mortgages into
securities turned the U.S. housing slump into a global recession
as foreclosures deflated bond values and toppled Wall Street
firms such as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. The Massachusetts
attorney general reached a $60 million settlement last year with
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A representative of New York-based Morgan Stanley didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilling, Black Get Partial Victories From High Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court scaled back a favorite tool used by
prosecutors in fraud cases, ruling in favor of Jeffrey Skilling
on his conviction for leading the Enron Corp. accounting fraud
while stopping short of granting him a new trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court also sided with former Hollinger International
Inc. Chairman Conrad Black, telling a lower court to reconsider
his corporate fraud conviction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With both men, the effect on their convictions will be
determined by lower courts. Skilling&#8217;s lawyers said before the
ruling that a victory on the honest-services question would give
them grounds to seek reversal of the rest of the conviction,
along with his 24-year sentence. The government has said even
the conspiracy verdict that was directly before the high court
might not have to be overturned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re back in the game,&#8221; Daniel Petrocelli, Skilling&#8217;s
lead lawyer, said in a telephone interview. He said yesterday&#8217;s
ruling would be &#8220;fatal to the government&#8217;s case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black was convicted of mail fraud and obstruction of
justice and sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison. As with
Skilling, his lawyers will have a chance to seek invalidation of
the entire verdict, while the government can argue that the
entire conviction should stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing for the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the
law, which covers fraud schemes to &#8220;deprive another of the
intangible right to honest services,&#8221; was so vague it could be
constitutionally applied only to cases involving bribery or
kickbacks. The ruling raises questions about potentially
hundreds of other convictions and pending prosecutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Skilling v. United States, 08-1394, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Qwest Chief Nacchio Loses Bid for Reduced Prison Sentence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Nacchio, the former chief of Qwest Communications
International Inc., lost a bid to reduce his insider trading
sentence by almost half after a judge heard arguments on how
much he gained from his crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Marcia Krieger in Denver said yesterday
that Nacchio, who had been sentenced to six years in prison,
must serve 70 months. She upheld a $19 million fine -- the
maximum Nacchio faced -- and approved forfeiture of $44.6
million, a figure that Nacchio and the government had agreed on.
He was originally ordered to forfeit $52 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nacchio, 61, of Rumson, New Jersey, was convicted in 2007
for illegally selling $52 million of stock in Denver-based Qwest
in 2001 based on inside information. A federal appeals court
last year ordered that he be resentenced because the trial judge
incorrectly calculated his gains from stock sales. He has served
almost 15 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nacchio, over the objection of at least one Qwest officer
he worked with, &#8220;refused to tell investors about the breakdown
of revenue,&#8221; Krieger said at yesterday&#8217;s hearing. Specifically,
he withheld how much Qwest was relying on riskier, declining,
non-recurring sources of revenue, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Nacchio knew what the risk was, he could assess the
risk&#8221; as he sold more than $50 million in Qwest shares in 2001,
Krieger said. &#8220;The public did not know.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Nacchio, 1:05-cr-00545, U.S. District
Court, District of Colorado (Denver). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philip Morris $100 Million Punitive Verdict Reversed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Morris USA won a ruling from the Oregon Supreme
Court blocking a $100 million punitive damage verdict awarded to
the husband of Michelle Schwarz, an Oregon woman who died of
lung cancer in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court yesterday ordered a new trial on punitive
damages, ruling that the jury that awarded the money received
faulty instructions from the trial judge. Yesterday&#8217;s ruling
upholds the decision of a state appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oregon Supreme Court found that the trial court should
have told jurors that they weren&#8217;t permitted to award punitive
damages to punish Philip Morris for harm caused to anyone other
than Schwarz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trial court did, in giving the uniform jury
instruction, permit the jury to consider evidence of harm to
nonparties in assessing punitive damages,&#8221; Justice Martha Lee
Walters wrote on behalf of the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Estate of Michelle Schwarz v. Philip Morris
Inc., S053644, Oregon Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Brocade Chief Reyes Gets 18 Months for Backdating &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Reyes, former chief executive officer at Brocade
Communications Systems Inc., was sentenced to 18 months in
prison for backdating employee stock-option grants and hiding
the practice from company auditors and shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco also
ordered Reyes yesterday to pay a fine of $15 million and said he
must surrender by Sept. 10 to begin his term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reyes, 47, was found guilty of securities fraud and other
charges in March at his second trial stemming from stock-options
manipulation at Brocade, the biggest maker of switches for data-
storage networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reyes&#8217;s attorney, Stephen Neal, pleaded for leniency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I find Greg Reyes a man of extraordinary integrity,&#8221;
Neal said. &#8220;I would trust him with everything in my life, from
my family to the shirt off my back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a courtroom that included Reyes&#8217;s family and more than
two dozen supporters, Reyes broke down in tears standing before
the judge, too overcome to read his prepared statement. Instead,
Neal read Reyes&#8217;s statement, saying in part, &#8220;I am a shell of
the man I once was. Words cannot express how sorry I am.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Reyes, 06-556, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Court Curbs Overseas Reach of U.S. Securities Laws &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court limited foreign investors&#8217; ability
to sue companies based abroad in American courts, throwing out a
shareholder lawsuit against National Australia Bank Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices unanimously said federal securities laws don&#8217;t
reach allegations by three Australians who bought shares of
Melbourne-based NAB in that country. The Australians argued that
U.S. courts could consider the case because it centered on
alleged wrongdoing by a former U.S. subsidiary of the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors in the Supreme Court case said HomeSide
Lending Inc., formerly a Florida-based mortgage-service
subsidiary of NAB, fraudulently overvalued its assets,
eventually forcing $2.2 billion in writedowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAB disclosed in 2001 that interest-rate assumptions used
by HomeSide in a valuation model were incorrect and caused
inflated estimates of mortgage-servicing fees. Writedowns in
2001 caused the bank&#8217;s American depositary receipts to fall more
than 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAB acquired HomeSide in 1998, then sold it to Washington
Mutual Inc. in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAB argued that the alleged misstatements and omissions all
were made in Australia by the parent company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddo Loses Bid to Get $37 Million Back in Madoff Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French money manager Oddo  Cie lost a bid to get 30
million euros ($37 million) from a Luxembourg fund that had lost
millions investing with Bernard Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luxembourg&#8217;s Cour de Cassation, the nation&#8217;s highest court,
dismissed Oddo&#8217;s appeal in the case at a hearing yesterday. A
UBS AG unit had turned the money over to the liquidators for the
LuxAlpha Sicav-American Selection fund last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s Court of Appeal in July 2009 reversed a ruling
that had forced UBS to pay the money to Oddo. The appeals court
doubted whether Oddo Asset Management had the right to the
money, ordering it to give the funds back to UBS, which in turn
handed it to LuxAlpha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddo was the first to file a case in Luxembourg seeking
redemptions from funds or banks after Madoff&#8217;s 2008 arrest. UBS
and its local unit, which had served as custodian for LuxAlpha,
have been sued in more than 100 Luxembourg cases by investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decision is part of &#8220;a provisional procedure,&#8221;
Gregoire Charbit, manager at Oddo, said in an e-mail. &#8220;There&#8217;s
still a case on the substance in which the Group Oddo  Cie
started a case against LuxAlpha over reimbursement and one
against UBS over fault.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS spokeswoman Tatiana Togni said by telephone the Zurich-
based bank &#8220;welcomed&#8221; the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernard Madoff pleaded guilty in March 2009 to
orchestrating the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. He was
sentenced to 150 years in a federal prison in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemazee Sentence of Up to 19 1/2 Years Urged by U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hassan Nemazee, a former political fundraiser for U.S.
President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,
should be sentenced to as much as 19 years and seven months in
prison for his bank fraud conviction, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemazee pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan in
March to defrauding Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank
of America Corp. out of millions of dollars. After he was
arrested in August, prosecutors said he cheated the banks out of
$292 million. He&#8217;s to be sentenced June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemazee deserves from 15 years and eight months to 19 years
and seven months, prosecutors said June 23 in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendant was, in essence, running a Ponzi scheme --
using the proceeds of one fraud to pay off another fraud
victim,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel W. Levy wrote in a
memorandum to U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court during his guilty plea, Nemazee said his fraud
began in the mid-1990s as he faced financial difficulties. He
admitted that he used forged documents to borrow from banks and
said he intended to repay the lenders. He said he was unable to
do so as his investments went bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemazee&#8217;s lawyer, Paul Shechtman, didn&#8217;t reply to a voice-
mail message left at his office seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Nemazee, 09-mj-1927, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Pays Its Bankruptcy Advisers $830.6 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the investment bank that has
been in bankruptcy since September 2008, paid its lawyers and
managers $830.6 million for 20 months of work, according to a
regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restructuring firm Alvarez  Marsal LLC, which provided
Lehman with its current chief executive officer, Bryan Marsal,
led the payments with $296 million in fees for &#8220;interim
management&#8221; through May, according to the June 23 filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenner  Block LLP, the law firm headed by Lehman examiner
Anton Valukas, earned $54 million for more than a year&#8217;s work
producing a 2,200-page report on the bankruptcy. Duff  Phelps
LLC, a financial advisory firm that worked with Valukas, made
$39.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP of New York collected $190.7
million for acting as the investment bank&#8217;s lead bankruptcy law
firm. Milbank Tweed Hadley  McCloy LLP got $52.8 million for
advising Lehman&#8217;s creditors&#8217; committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman and its affiliates had cash holdings of $18.4
billion on May 31, up from $17.4 billion at the start of the
month. Lehman filed the biggest U.S. bankruptcy in September
2008 with assets of $639 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers Group Says Nominee Kagan Is Well Qualified for Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Bar Association, the nation&#8217;s largest legal
professional association, said U.S. Solicitor General Elena
Kagan is well qualified to be on the Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ABA &#8220;has returned its highest rating of unanimously
well qualified,&#8221; said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Patrick Leahy in a statement. The rating &#8220;is further evidence
of Elena Kagan&#8217;s qualifications to serve as an independent
justice,&#8221; the Vermont Democrat said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ABA, a group of 400,000 legal professionals, regularly
provides ratings for nominees to the federal bench. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama on May 10 nominated Kagan, 50, to
replace retiring Justice John Paul Stevens. A former dean of
Harvard Law School, Kagan is currently the administration&#8217;s
chief courtroom lawyer. Her confirmation hearings before the
Senate Judiciary Committee begin June 28. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of derivatives traders from
firms such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays Capital are
starting an Asia-focused hedge fund to profit from price swings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore-based RSR Capital Pte plans to raise about $500
million in the next three years for its Caerus Arbitrage Asia
Fund, named after the ancient Greek god of opportunity, said
partner Christophe Delorme, formerly the head of Japanese over-
the-counter derivatives at Newedge Group. The fund, which is
planning to start trading with $15 million to $20 million in
August, will trade instruments that thrive on volatility, such
as options, Delorme said in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The thing which could go against us, like any volatility
fund, is a very, very quiet market for the next three years,&#8221;
Delorme said. &#8220;We really don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to happen; the
world is so on edge, the market is not ready to get quiet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds such as the one planned by RSR Capital tend to
outperform when markets are falling because they trade on
volatility, which increases when prices decline. Volatility, as
measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index,
was at a 14-month high in late May as the sovereign debt crisis
swept through Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSR is targeting annualized returns of 15 percent to 25
percent this year, he said. The manager produced a return of
about 35 percent from March till May trading with $4 million of
the partners&#8217; money, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barracuda Fund &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore-based Artradis Fund Management Pte, whose
volatility funds posted the best returns among Asian hedge funds
during the global financial crisis in 2008, posted a 7 percent
return last month for its Barracuda volatility fund. In contrast,
the Eurekahedge Hedge Fund Index fell 2.6 percent, the
industry&#8217;s worst performance since October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other partners at RSR are Remi Colinmaire, formerly
head of index volatility trading in London and Tokyo at Goldman
Sachs; Serge Handjian, previously head of equity derivatives at
Barclays Capital in Tokyo; and Robert Webb, who previously ran
index option trading in Asia at Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSR, which bets on rising and falling volatility, plans to
use computer algorithms to make investment decisions starting
next year, Delorme said. Such strategies will account for as
much as 15 percent of the fund&#8217;s trades, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund will focus on arbitraging strategies to profit
from disparities in the relative value of one option against
another, mainly in the listed markets of Japan, Hong Kong, India,
Korea, Australia and Taiwan, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S.
mobile-phone company, cut the price of its two Microsoft Corp.
Kin models today about a month after the phones&#8217; release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kin One now sells for $29.99, down from $49.99, with a
$100 discount and a two-year contract, according to Basking
Ridge, New Jersey-based Verizon&#8217;s website. The price of the Kin
Two, which has a larger screen and takes sharper photos, has
been reduced to $49.99 from $99.99, according to the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phones, released in stores on May 13, are Microsoft&#8217;s
attempt to regain share in the smartphone market after losing
sales to phones from Google Inc. and Apple Inc. Before the Kin,
Microsoft had previously only developed software for phones,
rather than design help design them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon spokeswoman Brenda Raney said the new pricing is
part of a broader set of price reductions. The company is
&#8220;comfortable&#8221; with the way the Kin is being accepted, she
said. Katy Asher, a spokeswoman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system accounted for 6.9
percent of the worldwide smartphone-software market in the first
quarter, down from 10.8 percent a year earlier, according to
Michael Morgan, an analyst at ABI Research. Shipments of the
iPhone rose to 15.8 percent and Android-based phones took 9.9
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon Communications Inc., which co-owns the wireless
company with Vodafone Group Plc, rose 16 cents to $28.71 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:01 p.m. The stock has
declined 13 percent this year. Microsoft, down 20 percent this
year, fell 22 cents to $24.31 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gains by the U.K. pound may be
limited as investors bet the government&#8217;s budget cuts will
hinder the economic recovery, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At some stage the impact of fiscal tightening on growth
will become visible and at that stage, weaker demand could
translate into weaker sterling again,&#8221; analysts including
Thomas Stolper in London wrote in an e-mailed report received

&lt;p&gt;The pound was little changed at $1.5060 as of 1:38 p.m. in
London, leaving it 1.6 percent stronger since last month&#8217;s
election. It was 0.4 percent stronger at 81.82 pence per euro. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The euro will only resume its
decline against the dollar in the second half of next year after
expectations for earlier U.S. interest-rate hikes faded,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. said, revising an earlier call for the
European currency to begin weakening by the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Having pushed back the first Fed hike to late 2011
last week, we expect euro-dollar to range trade for longer
around a mid-point of $1.25, so flatline the forecast at that
level until the second quarter of 2011,&#8221; John Normand, head of
global foreign-exchange strategy at JPMorgan in London, wrote in
a research report published on June 25. &#8220;From the third quarter
2011 forward, the dollar should strengthen as U.S. rate
expectations trend higher.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had previously forecast the euro would fall to
$1.20 by the end of 2010 and $1.18 by the end of the first
quarter of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.2343 as of 12:08 p.m. in

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government is considering
auctioning visas for businesses wishing to employ foreign
migrants, part of a plan to set an annual cap on immigration,
Home Secretary Theresa May said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning a 12-week consultation on its proposals, the Home
Office said it is considering offering a &#8220;pool&#8221; of work visas
on a quarterly basis or operating a first-come, first-served
system for applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are always in the business of trying to operate with
as little bureaucracy as possible,&#8221; May told a news conference
in London today. She said she would invite businesses and
London&#8217;s financial district to respond and say which option they
prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May will ask the independent Migration Advisory Committee
to examine at what level an annual cap on immigration from non-
European Union countries should be set. The home secretary said
she hopes the measures will eventually bring net migration down
to the levels of the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultation will be held after reports that some
Cabinet ministers are worried that a cap may hamper employers&#8217;
ability to attract talented staff from abroad. Business
Secretary Vince Cable, a Liberal Democrat,&#160;told the BBC&#8217;s Sunday
AM program yesterday that the proposal &#8220;has to be implemented
in a flexible way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a Financial Times report on June 25,
Universities Minister David Willetts and Schools Secretary
Michael Gove, both Conservatives, have concerns that too low a
cap might hurt the competitiveness of London&#8217;s financial
district, alongside universities and colleges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conservative mayor of London, Boris Johnson, also
warned that any &#8220;crude cap&#8221; would be detrimental to the free
flow of workers, according to a statement by his spokesman on
June 26. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Canada named Goldman
Sachs Canada Chief Executive Officer Timothy Hodgson as a
special adviser to Governor Mark Carney, who also worked at the
investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hodgson will work on developing rules for trading repos and
over-the-counter derivatives, and regulations to ensure banks
have enough capital, the Ottawa-based central bank said in a
statement today. A repo is a short-term contract to sell and
repurchase a security, and derivatives are securities whose
value depends on the value of another asset, such as crude oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bank is privileged that someone of his experience has
chosen public service at this critical time,&#8221; Carney said in a
statement. Carney and Hodgson worked together at Goldman Sachs
in New York from 1998-2000, Bank of Canada spokesman Jeremy Harrison said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada and other Group of 20 nations are crafting rules to
have derivatives traded more through clearinghouses with
standardized contracts, Carney said in a June 10 speech in
Montreal. The global credit crisis was caused in part by
questions about the solvency of banks that led to the breakdown
of trading in important financial markets, he said in Montreal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney earlier today was named to lead a group at the Bank
for International Settlements that monitors global financial
markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivey Graduate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hodgson will work for an 18-month term in Toronto starting
Sept. 1. He will serve on bank committees that review
developments affecting monetary policy and the health of the
financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hodgson was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and has a Master of
Business Administration degree from the Ivey School of Business
at the University of Western Ontario. He has served as the head
of Goldman&#8217;s Canadian unit since 2005, and joined the firm in
1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Curtin will replace Hodgson at Goldman Sachs on July
1, the New York-based company said today in a staff memo. Curtin
was chief executive of the bank&#8217;s Canadian unit from 1995 to
2000, and became chairman in 2002. He joined the firm in 1976
and is based in Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the firm
run by billionaire Warren Buffett, is a &#8220;buy&#8221; because its
earnings will grow as the U.S. economy recovers, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire, which owns railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe
and auto insurer Geico Corp. and has stakes in firms including
credit-card lender American Express Co., may rise about 25
percent in 12 months, analysts led by Christopher Neczypor said
today in a research note. The note initiated coverage in the
Omaha, Nebraska-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The non-insurance entities are tied to GDP growth and to
a lesser extent, industrial production,&#8221; Neczypor wrote. &#8220;As
the economy continues to emerge from its cyclical downturn, we
would expect earnings to grow at a faster rate than what appears
to be currently discounted in the stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, the 79-year-old chairman of Berkshire, executed
takeovers and stock picks to transform his firm over four
decades from a failing textile mill into a seller of bricks,
electric power and hurricane insurance with a market value of
almost $200 billion. He called his $27 billion purchase of
Burlington Northern, completed in February, an &#8220;all-in wager&#8221;
on the U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Post the acquisition of Burlington Northern, we estimate
close to half of Berkshire&#8217;s intrinsic value will be derived
from operating entities, as opposed to securities investments,&#8221;
Neczypor wrote. This &#8220;reduces the long-term reliance on senior
management&#8217;s equity investing decisions, and provides greater
clarity into the source of future value for the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has been
more responsive to information requests from the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission since being subpoenaed and has made
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein available for an
interview, the panel&#8217;s leaders said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein was interviewed recently by FCIC staff &#8220;at
length,&#8221; commission Chairman Phil Angelides said today in a
conference call with journalists. Angelides said on June 7 that
the panel had subpoenaed Goldman Sachs after the bank tried to
hinder a probe by overwhelming the commission with documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have no question&#8221; that New York-based Goldman Sachs
will now cooperate with requests, FCIC Vice Chairman Bill Thomas
said today on the call. &#8220;It was the lack of specificity, or
even the acknowledgement that what we asked for was in the piles
of documents we got, that was cleared up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs executives including Chief Financial Officer
David Viniar will testify at a two-day FCIC hearing beginning
tomorrow reviewing the role of derivatives in the recession.
Also scheduled to testify is Joseph Cassano, the former American
International Group Inc. executive whose bets on subprime
mortgages led the insurer to the brink of collapse in 2008,
requiring a U.S. bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This hearing is focused on derivatives which is a subset,
obviously, of what Goldman does, and if you want to get some
answers that are useful and meaningful you&#8217;d probably ask the
people who were head of that subset,&#8221; Thomas said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$12.9 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After AIG&#8217;s bailout, Goldman Sachs collected $12.9 billion
tied to contracts with the New York-based insurer, including
derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG sold credit-default swaps to firms including Goldman
Sachs, Societe Generale SA and Deutsche Bank AG protecting them
against declines in the value of mortgages. When the housing
market collapsed, AIG didn&#8217;t have enough funds to honor its
contracts and turned to the U.S. for a rescue that swelled to
$182.3 billion. Cassano was interviewed for about five hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was sued in April by U.S. regulators for
misleading clients who invested in collateralized debt
obligations. The Securities and Exchange Commission said that
investors weren&#8217;t told that the hedge fund led by John Paulson
helped pick the mortgages in the CDOs and was betting on them to
fail. Goldman Sachs has said the suit is unfounded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the highest-paying and most profitable firm
in Wall Street history, has been criticized by lawmakers as a
symbol of greed and excess. AIG and failed securities firm Bear
Stearns Cos. are among companies hobbled by losses on
investments from Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-Default Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission is investigating the causes of the credit
crisis, which followed the collapse of the housing market
beginning in 2007 and sparked the worst recession since the
1930s and the loss of more than 8 million U.S. jobs. It will
report its findings to Congress and President Barack Obama by
December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives such as credit-default swaps contributed to the
crisis, making it difficult for regulators to understand how
interconnected financial firms had become after the bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. opened its first
redesigned store in Montebello, California, today as part of a
six-year plan to make its 350 retail outlets worldwide more
entertaining for shoppers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media company will open revamped locations 20 in the
U.S. and Europe by November, the start of the holiday shopping
season, Jim Fielding, president of Disney Stores Worldwide, said
in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney has consolidated its retail business after taking
back control over U.S. and Japan operations. The new stores will
let customers build characters from Disney&#8217;s Pixar Studio movie
&#8220;Cars,&#8221; interact with a magic mirror and watch clips from film
and TV shows in a movie theater with a 12-foot (3.6-meter)
screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today in retail you have to be a special destination or
very, very price conscious,&#8221; Fielding said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going for
special.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney will next open revamped stores in Madrid, then in
Portugal and Italy, before an outlet at Roosevelt Field mall in
Garden City, New York, at the end of July, Fielding said. A
store in Santa Monica, California, is slated for Aug. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Montebello store features 13-foot plastic trees on
which Disney videos are projected. The goal is to keep shoppers
entertained in the store for 30 minutes, Fielding said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, which owns movie studios, theme parks and the ABC
and ESPN television networks, got about 6.7 percent of its $36
billion in revenue last fiscal year from the consumer-products
unit, which includes retail stores, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 92 cents to
$32.30 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares are little changed this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Richard Berliand, who helped combine Bear Stearns Cos.&#8217;s prime brokerage
unit into the firm, is retiring after 23 years at the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berliand will be replaced by Sandie O&#8217;Connor, JPMorgan&#8217;s
global head of financing and market products, who has also spent
more than two decades at the company, according to a memo sent
to employees today from Carlos Hernandez, JPMorgan&#8217;s global head
of equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Richard&#8217;s deep understanding of our markets businesses
and the regulatory environment has enhanced our ability to stay
ahead of the changes occurring in our industry,&#8221; Hernandez
wrote. The memo was confirmed by spokesman Brian Marchiony.
Financial News reported the move earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berliand ran several global divisions during his career at
New York-based JPMorgan, overseeing cash equities, futures and
options. As the global head of prime services, he oversaw the
bank&#8217;s prime brokerage, futures and options as well as
derivatives-clearing operations. Berliand, who wants to spend
more time with his family, will stay for a month while O&#8217;Connor
transitions to her new role, Hernandez said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Connor will work with the global equities group to expand
JPMorgan&#8217;s prime services business in Europe, the Middle East
and Asia, Hernandez said. She will also continue her role
overseeing JPMorgan&#8217;s prime custody solutions group, which acts
as a custodian for hedge funds and other large institutional
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She previously oversaw global securities lending, clearing,
collateral management, foreign exchange, depository receipts and
execution services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Barnum, 38, a managing director in the bank&#8217;s global
fixed-income group, will take over Berliand&#8217;s duties chairing
the firm&#8217;s market-structure group, which evaluates regulatory
and market changes. Barnum will also continue in his current
role reporting to Daniel Pinto, the co-head of fixed-income
products, Hernandez said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gramercy, a Greenwich, Connecticut-
based investment firm with more than $2.6 billion in assets,
hired Jeffrey Grills and Gunter Heiland to help manage emerging-
market debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grills and Heiland, who as co-heads of emerging-market debt
at JPMorgan Chase  Co. managed as much as $12 billion, will
help oversee investments in government and corporate bonds in
local and international markets, Gramercy said in a statement.
They will report to Gramercy founder and Chief Investment
Officer Robert Koenigsberger. Grills, 38, and Heiland, 43, left
JPMorgan in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll continue to work within one unified investment
committee process,&#8221; Koenigsberger said in a telephone interview
from San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointments follow Gramercy&#8217;s swap of its Argentine
bond holdings in a restructuring of the country&#8217;s defaulted debt
that ended last week. The firm was part of a group of
institutional investors that approached the Argentine government
via a &#8220;reverse inquiry&#8221; to restructure the nation&#8217;s $18.3
billion worth of defaulted securities, Koenigsberger said.
Gramercy had &#8220;in excess of 10 percent&#8221; of the defaulted bonds,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creditors holding about $12.1 billion of eligible defaulted
debt, or 66 percent of the total, tendered their securities in
the restructuring, Economy Minister Amado Boudou said June 23. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc may consider bidding for BP Plc after the London-based
oil company lost more than half of its market value in the wake
of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, JPMorgan Cazenove Ltd. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil has the stronger balance sheet and proven
ability to integrate a large transaction, according to Fred Lucas, a London-based analyst at JP Morgan. It could make a cash
and share offer, valuing BP at 473 pence a share compared with
yesterday&#8217;s close of 308.25 pence, and including a $50 billion
spin-off of BP&#8217;s downstream assets, according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP&#8217;s market value has collapsed by more than $100 billion
since the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig that killed 11 crew members and caused the leak.
The company has set aside $20 billion to pay for Gulf
restoration and compensation claims and said yesterday the cost
of battling the spill had reached $2.65 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any potential attempt to buy BP would have to be backed by
&#8220;ruthless integration,&#8221; JPMorgan said. BP has many high
quality assets, including deepwater positions and upstream
operations, Lucas wrote under a future possible scenario. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheila Williams, a spokeswoman for BP, declined to comment,
as did Kim Blomley, a London-based spokesman for Shell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are wrong when they bet on
the parallels between the current sovereign bond crisis and the
fallout from the 2008 meltdown in the U.S. mortgage market,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries that have more ways to raise revenues than
corporations, a growing economy, more savvy politicians,
healthier private balance sheets and banks holding $1.2 trillion
in liquidity versus $200 billion in 2008 make the current
sovereign debt problems less contagious than the subprime
mortgage-induced crisis two years ago, Alberto Gallo and Annie Chu, New York-based strategists with Goldman Sachs, wrote in a
note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market-wide systemic risk priced by the market is now
far worse than what economic data suggests,&#8221; the two analysts
wrote. &#8220;The current environment is different from the mortgage
crisis. Headline risk will likely remain high for the upcoming
weeks, but beyond that we see stability for bondholders.&#8221;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. are among U.S. banks that may have as long as a
dozen years to cut stakes in in-house hedge funds and private-
equity units under a regulatory revamp agreed to last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules curbing banks&#8217; investments in their own funds would
take effect 15 months to two years after a law is passed,
according to the bill. Banks would have two years to comply,
with the potential for three one-year extensions after that.
They could seek another five years for &#8220;illiquid&#8221; funds such
as private equity or real estate, said Lawrence Kaplan, an
attorney at Paul, Hastings, Janofsky  Walker LLP in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving banks until 2022 to fully implement the so-called
Volcker rule is an accommodation for Wall Street in what
President Barack Obama called the toughest financial reforms
since the 1930s. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 forced
commercial banks such as what is now JPMorgan Chase  Co. to
shed their investment-banking units in less than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the big concerns for the banks was how to unwind
these funds,&#8221; Kaplan said. &#8220;This takes a lot of that argument
away by giving them as much as 12 years to do so.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal, named for former Federal Reserve Chairman and
current Obama adviser Paul Volcker, 82, seeks to avoid future
bailouts by curbing risk-taking and initially aimed to ban banks
from investing in hedge funds and private equity. It was
&#8220;watered down&#8221; in final negotiations last week, allowing
lenders to invest as much as 3 percent of their capital in the
funds, Deutsche Bank analysts Matt O&#8217;Connor and Michael Carrier
wrote in a note to clients last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volcker&#8217;s View &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment, as did Citigroup&#8217;s Duncan Smith. Both banks are
based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partly as a result of last-minute changes to the wording of
the bill, analysts, lawyers and congressional staffers say it&#8217;s
unclear whether the extension period for illiquid funds would
run concurrently with the other transition periods. That could
mandate full compliance in less than 12 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital analyst Jason Goldberg wrote in a report
yesterday that there would be a seven-year transition period for
the Volcker rule. Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz wrote that
banks would have until 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Nine Years&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In our understanding, it is nine years,&#8221; said Mike
Westling, a spokesman for Senator Jeff Merkley, the Oregon
Democrat who proposed changes to the rule that were later
incorporated by Senator Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Glass-Steagall Act gave banks one year to get out of
the underwriting business. Their banking licenses were subject
to revocation if they were in violation six months after that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate part of last week&#8217;s bill allows banks to provide
&#8220;initial equity&#8221; in new funds to help &#8220;attract unaffiliated
investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has to be something like that in there, to
literally make it work,&#8221; said Jim Reichbach, U.S. head of the
banking and securities practice at Deloitte LLP. &#8220;Someone has
to put the first dollar in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks must reduce their investments in each fund to
less than 3 percent of total investor contributions within one
year of formation, according to the bill. They can apply for a
two-year extension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Capital Infusions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule forbids banks from stepping in with
capital infusions or other forms of support when their own funds
fail. In December 2007, Citigroup agreed to assume $59 billion
of assets bought by &#8220;structured investment vehicles&#8221; sponsored
by the bank. During the following two years, Citigroup lost more
than $3 billion on the SIVs, which were a kind of hedge fund
that invested in mortgage bonds, credit-card securities and
other assets that soured amid the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has $29.1 billion of principal investments,
Keith Horowitz, a Citigroup analyst, wrote yesterday in a report
summarizing the potential impact of the Volcker rule. JPMorgan
has $8.88 billion and Morgan Stanley has $6.34 billion, wrote
Horowitz, who doesn&#8217;t cover Citigroup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alyson Barnes, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, declined
to comment, as did Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan.
The two banks are also based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley,
investments in private-equity funds might pay off before the
Volcker rule requires an exit, based on regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Substantially All&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Substantially all&#8221; of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s $11.5 billion of
investments in private-equity, hedge funds and real-estate funds
are slated to be liquidated in the next 10 years, according to a
company filing. Morgan Stanley estimated in a filing that 60
percent of its $1.81 billion of private-equity investments and
50 percent of real-estate investments will be liquidated within
the decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s hedge-fund and private-equity business, Citi
Capital Advisors, oversees about $14 billion, 38 percent of
which is the bank&#8217;s own money, according to a marketing brochure
for the unit from April. At least four of the bank&#8217;s 14 hedge
funds consist only of proprietary capital. Citigroup&#8217;s Metalmark
Capital Partners private-equity unit started a new fund last
year with $1.7 billion of capital commitments from the bank and
its employees, according to the brochure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank plans to raise more than $3 billion from outside
investors for hedge funds and private equity during the next two
years, people with direct knowledge of the matter said this
month. Such fundraising would reduce the bank&#8217;s percentage of
its own funds, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule&#8217;s limits may still be enough to push banks
to reconsider whether to stay in the hedge-fund and private-
equity business, said Randall Guynn, head of the financial-
institutions practice at Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP. The specter
of future caps might deter would-be investors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They may think that there&#8217;s not enough skin in the game
from the sponsors,&#8221; Guynn said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. scrapped the new Kin
social-networking smartphone because sales fell well short of
the company&#8217;s expectations, a person with knowledge of the
decision said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone&#8217;s high price contributed to lackluster demand,
said the person, who declined to be named because the
discussions were private. Microsoft announced plans to end work
on the Kin earlier today, saying it would focus on Windows Phone
software. The device debuted less than two months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kin, sold through Verizon Wireless, marked Microsoft&#8217;s
first major foray into the hardware design of a mobile phone. It
was part of a dual strategy of developing its own phone while
working on new Windows software for other companies&#8217; handsets.
Verizon&#8217;s price cuts of the Kin on June 28 may have come too
late to save the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sales weren&#8217;t going that well at Verizon, so better to
kill it than have it fester on,&#8221; said Ken Dulaney, a Gartner
Inc. analyst in Redwood City, California. &#8220;Verizon did a very
poor job advertising this thing. The price of the data plan was
a killer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon required an unlimited data plan for $29.99, plus a
voice plan. The phones were released May 6 online and went on
sale in stores May 13. Those models will remain available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will continue to work with Verizon in the U.S. to sell
current Kin phones,&#8221; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brenda Raney, a spokeswoman for Basking Ridge, New Jersey-
based Verizon Wireless, said the Kin &#8220;is still an important
part of our portfolio.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower Price &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon cut the price of the Kin One to $29.99 from $49.99,
with a $100 discount and a two-year contract. The price of the
Kin Two, which has a larger screen and takes sharper photos, was
reduced to $49.99 from $99.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft team working on the product has been folded
into the Windows Phone unit, the company said today. A planned
release of the devices in Europe has been canceled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will now focus its attention on its mobile
operating system, which has been losing market share to software
from Apple Inc. and Google Inc. Mobile-phone makers will begin
offering devices with Windows Phone 7, a complete overhaul of
the software, later this year. It&#8217;s critical that those phones
fare better than the Kin, Dulaney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The big bet is on Windows Phone 7 -- if they don&#8217;t get
that right, they&#8217;re in big trouble,&#8221; he said. The Kin &#8220;was a
sidecar effort.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system accounted for 6.9
percent of the worldwide smartphone-software market in the first
quarter, down from 10.8 percent a year earlier, according to
Michael Morgan, an analyst at ABI Research. Shipments of the
iPhone rose to 15.8 percent, while Android-based phones took 9.9
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s decision was reported earlier by Gizmodo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s third-
biggest bank, hired Ana Cabral-Gardner to help lure corporate
clients in Brazil as part of an expansion of its investment-
banking business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabral-Gardner, 40, will serve as a managing director in
the investment banking division in Sao Paulo and report to Alceu Lima, president of Banco Barclays in Brazil, the bank said in a
statement. She was previously head of Latin American equity
capital markets at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointment is part of an effort by London-based
Barclays to expand beyond fixed-income and debt capital markets
in Latin America&#8217;s largest economy. In April, the bank began
equities trading on Brazil&#8217;s stock exchange through local
broker-dealer Barclays Corretora de Titulos e Valores
Mobiliarios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you are a truly global bank today, it&#8217;s important to
have a significant presence in Brazil,&#8221; Cabral-Gardner said in
a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. &#8220;Barclays is committed to
Brazil to a point where it&#8217;s willing to put its balance sheet to
work for companies in the market, and that&#8217;s one of the biggest
differences and competitive advantages that we can offer our
clients locally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s economy may expand 7.3 percent this year, the
fastest pace in more than two decades, the country&#8217;s policy
makers said today in a quarterly report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays has boosted its employee total in Brazil to about
150 from 60 since late 2008, spokesman Brandon Ashcraft said in
an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On a fundamental basis, there&#8217;s significant value to be
realized in Brazil in almost every equity sector,&#8221; Cabral-
Gardner said. &#8220;The Brazilian consumer today has gained critical
mass, and is large enough that it cannot be ignored.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. didn&#8217;t mark
down values of mortgage-backed securities to drive down prices,
President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn told a U.S.
panel examining collateral calls that almost toppled American
International Group Inc. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To me, it&#8217;s simple,&#8221; Cohn, 49, told the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission today, responding to a question about what
basis the New York-based bank had for marks on its securities.
The legitimacy of marks are demonstrated by &#8220;actual trades and
the fact that we were willing and aggressively willing to
liquidate our portfolio back to our clients at those prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street record for a U.S.
securities firm&#8217;s profits in 2007, is battling accusations from
regulators, members of Congress and former clients that it
designed mortgage-backed securities it knew would fail and bet
on their collapse by buying credit-default swaps, which pay out
in the event of a default. The commission is questioning Cohn
and Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief risk officer, Craig Broderick, in
Washington during the first half of a two-day hearing on
practices in the market for derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s global
derivatives sales manager, Adrian Valenzuela, has left the
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valenzuela&#8217;s departure last week comes three months after
his boss, David Herzberg, left the firm. Richard Berliand, who
ran JPMorgan&#8217;s global prime services business which oversaw
Valenzuela&#8217;s division, announced yesterday he would retire after
23 years at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valenzuela, who was based in London, joined JPMorgan in
2007 from Merrill Lynch  Co., where he was a managing director
and head of the Alpha Strategies group, the company said at the
time. Previously, he worked at London-based hedge fund WMG
Advisors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valenzuela&#8217;s departure was confirmed by his former

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bought
protection against a decline in just 1 percent of the mortgage-
backed securities the company underwrote since late 2006,
according to President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We did not &#8216;bet against our clients,&#8217; and the numbers
underscore this fact,&#8221; Cohn, 49, will tell the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission today, according to his prepared testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street record for a U.S.
securities firm&#8217;s profits in 2007, is battling accusations from
regulators, members of Congress and former clients that it
designed mortgage-backed securities it knew would fail and bet
on their collapse by buying credit-default swaps, which pay out
in the event of a default. The commission is set to take Cohn&#8217;s
testimony this afternoon in Washington during the first half of
a two-day hearing on practices in the market for derivatives
like credit-default swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His testimony begins with an apology to the commission,
which subpoenaed information from Goldman Sachs June 4 as it
complained that the New York-based bank failed to hand over
documents in a &#8220;timely manner&#8221; and didn&#8217;t cooperate with
interview requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have stated that we have not been sufficiently
responsive to the FCIC&#8217;s requests for information. We apologize
for any failure on our part,&#8221; Cohn said in the prepared
remarks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc.
had a &#8220;contentious relationship&#8221; with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
tied to derivative contracts, according to the chairman of the
Federal Crisis Inquiry Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship, in a two-year period when AIG posted the
biggest quarterly loss in U.S. corporate history and Goldman
Sachs recorded record profits, involved bets on subprime
mortgages. FCIC Chairman Phil Angelides said the panel will
today review trades between the two New York-based companies as
it probes the role of derivatives in the 2008 credit freeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clearly there was a significant relationship between AIG
and Goldman over the issue of derivatives, and it&#8217;s
an issue we&#8217;ve explored to see what happened and what motivated
the players, both Goldman and AIG, in that contentious
relationship,&#8221; he said in a news briefing yesterday. Below is a
timeline of key dates in the dealings between AIG and Goldman
Sachs since 2008 when the insurer almost collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 15, 2008: Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase  Co. work to
arrange a credit line of as much as $75 billion for AIG. The
effort is not successful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 16, 2008: AIG accepts an $85 billion loan from the Federal
Reserve after credit downgrades force the insurer to post
collateral to banks including Goldman Sachs that purchased
credit-default swaps from the company. The insurer draws down
about $61 billion in two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 18, 2008: Edward Liddy, a Goldman Sachs director and ex-
chief executive officer of Allstate Corp., is announced as AIG&#8217;s
new leader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 23, 2008: Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. says it
will buy $5 billion in Goldman Sachs preferred stock, less than
two weeks after the billionaire investor rejected a proposal to
aid AIG. Berkshire also gets warrants to buy Goldman Sachs
shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 26, 2008: Goldman Sachs says Liddy stepped down from the
board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov. 5, 2008: A BlackRock Inc. presentation for AIG on credit-
default swaps shows that Goldman Sachs was the most aggressive
bank counterparty before its bailout, demanding more collateral
while assigning lower values to real estate assets backed by the
insurer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov. 10, 2008: A Federal Reserve financial vehicle named Maiden
Lane III is created to buy about $70 billion in collateralized
debt obligations from banks that bought protection, AIG says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dec. 4, 2008: Goldman Sachs was seen by the public as favored by
regulators, New York Fed employee Danielle Vicente says in an e-
mail. The perception is cited in the e-mail as a reason to
reject a media request for the names of securities purchased
from banks during AIG&#8217;s rescue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 5, 2009: Senators including Christopher Dodd, a
Connecticut Democrat, tell the Federal Reserve that the
regulator should reveal the banks that bought swaps from AIG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 15, 2009: AIG discloses banks that received funds after
the bailout to retire credit-default swaps and securities-
lending contracts. Goldman Sachs received $12.9 billion from the
insurer, more than any other counterparty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 20, 2009: Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar says the bank was &#8220;fully protected and didn&#8217;t have to
take a loss&#8221; in the event of an AIG bankruptcy. The bank wasn&#8217;t
willing to accept anything less than complete repayment from AIG
because it had $7.5 billion of collateral as well as credit-
default swaps that would have paid off if AIG defaulted, Viniar
says on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 25, 2009: Lawmakers call for a federal probe into whether
banks including Goldman Sachs received more funds than necessary
from AIG&#8217;s bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 16, 2009: Liddy&#8217;s $3.3 million stake in Goldman Sachs is
&#8220;reason for alarm,&#8221; according to Representative Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 4, 2009: The Wall Street Journal reports that Stephen Friedman, then chairman of the New York Fed, bought 37,300 more
shares of Goldman Sachs while he was on the board of both the
regulator and the Wall Street firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 7, 2009: Friedman resigns as chairman of the board of the
New York Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July 16, 2009: Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who
had previously ran Goldman Sachs, says at a Congressional
hearing he had &#8220;no role&#8221; in the Federal Reserve decisions to
pay AIG&#8217;s trading partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 11, 2009: Robert Benmosche, in his first month as AIG&#8217;s new
CEO, says at a company town-hall meeting that he told
derivatives employees to focus on maximizing the value of assets
they are unwinding over speed in exiting the trades. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want to feed Goldman Sachs&#8217;s bonus pool anymore,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan. 7, 2010: E-mails show the New York Fed pressed AIG to
withhold details from the public about the insurer&#8217;s payments to
banks, Bloomberg reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan. 14, 2010: Maurice &#8220;Hank&#8221; Greenberg, AIG&#8217;s former CEO,
says in an interview with CNBC that Goldman Sachs is &#8220;to blame
for a lot of what went on&#8221; that led to the insurer&#8217;s bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 16, 2010: The Securities and Exchange Commission sues
Goldman Sachs for fraud, saying the bank misled investors about
collateralized debt obligations tied to subprime mortgages and
failed to disclose that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was betting
against the security and influenced the selection of assets for
the portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 6, 2010: AIG has replaced Goldman Sachs with Citigroup Inc.
and Bank of America Corp. as its main corporate adviser, The New
York Times reports, citing people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 12, 2010: Benmosche says AIG attorneys are reviewing whether
the company should pursue the recovery of funds tied to
transactions with Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 30, 2010: FCIC begins a two-day hearing into derivatives,
with witnesses including Goldman Sachs executives and former AIG
leaders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court in New
Orleans set an expedited hearing date for arguments over whether
to lift a moratorium on deep-water drilling. The hearing is
scheduled for July 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman ruled the six-month
drilling ban, issued after the explosion and sinking of the
Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April, was overly broad and he
prohibited federal regulators from enforcing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 25, the government asked the U.S. Court of Appeals
in New Orleans to put the order on hold during an appeal. The
U.S. previously filed notice that it would appeal Feldman&#8217;s
order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court yesterday ordered lawyers for plaintiffs
challenging the ban to file responses to the U.S. request by
July 2. &#8220;If it can be filed earlier, the court would appreciate
that,&#8221; according to a letter to attorneys posted on the court&#8217;s
web site. &#8220;No extension will be granted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama temporarily halted all drilling in
waters deeper than 500 feet on May 27 to give a presidential
commission time to study improvements in the safety of offshore
operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc. and other offshore service
and supply companies sued U.S. regulators, including Interior
Secretary Kenneth Salazar, on June 7, seeking to lift the ban.
They argued they would suffer irreparable economic harm from the
suspension in drilling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feldman rejected the ban June 22, finding it too broad, and
barred federal regulators from enforcing it. Two days later he
denied a U.S. request to put his order on hold while regulators
appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar,
2:10-cv-01663, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). The appeal case is 10-30585, 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorola, Nokia Allowed to Refile LCD Antitrust Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Inc., Nokia Oyj and other buyers of liquid crystal
display panels used in handsets may refile a price-fixing
lawsuit they brought against makers of the screens, including
Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Display Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco rejected
both federal and state antitrust claims brought by the mobile-
phone makers and gave them until July 23 to file amended
complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illston, agreeing with the LCD makers that Motorola failed
to show she had jurisdiction in the case, said the mobile-phone
maker didn&#8217;t demonstrate that products bought abroad were
imported into the U.S. or that there was an anti-competitive
effect in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although Motorola argues that defendants intended for the
foreign-purchased LCD panels and products to be brought to the
United States, Motorola has not cited any authority adopting
such an expansive definition of &#8216;import,&#8217;&#8221; Illston said in an
order filed June 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge also ruled that Nokia, which sought only damages
for domestic purchases and purchases directly imported into the
U.S., failed to distinguish between purchases of its Finnish
parent company and those of its U.S. subsidiary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc.&#8217;s wireless unit failed to allege that its
purchases of price-fixed products occurred in states whose
antitrust laws it invoked, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Illston certified a class action on behalf of
direct purchasers of LCDs or goods containing them from 1999 to
2006. She also certified a nationwide class of indirect buyers
who bought TVs and computers beginning in 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2008, six LCD makers have pleaded guilty and were
fined more than $860 million in a criminal investigation in the
U.S. Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung, the world&#8217;s largest LCD
maker, hasn&#8217;t pleaded guilty to price fixing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Erickson, a spokeswoman for Schaumburg, Illinois-
based Motorola, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust
Litigation, 07-1827, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FedEx Wins Dismissal of Some Claims in Worker Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FedEx Corp. won partial dismissal of a class-action lawsuit
by contract drivers who contend they&#8217;re entitled to full
benefits because the company treats them as employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in South Bend, Indiana, threw out some
claims in the suit, saying the workers failed to exhaust out-of-
court, administrative procedures that might help them get the
medical, dental and retirement benefits they&#8217;re seeking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Merely showing that FedEx is predisposed to deny the
plaintiffs&#8217; claims and has consistently taken that position in
this lawsuit isn&#8217;t sufficient to show by certainty that the
claims would be denied,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Robert L. Miller
wrote in a June 28 opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller&#8217;s decision allows the plaintiffs to re-file claims
against Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx, the world&#8217;s largest air-
cargo carrier, should the named plaintiffs exhaust the
administrative process. The company says its contract driver
model is legal and was approved for tax purposes by the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service in 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a procedural setback as opposed to a substantive
setback,&#8221; plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer Lynn Faris said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;We will do exactly as the judge says and have the
named plaintiffs file the administrative claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ruling is the latest victory for FedEx Ground in the
ongoing legal challenges to the independent contractor model,&#8221;
FedEx spokesman Maury Lane said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We
believe that all lawsuits in the multidistrict litigation are
without merit and part of a broad-based assault on independent
contractors who have chosen to own and operate their own
businesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re FedEx Ground Package System Inc.
Employment Practices Litigation, 3:05-md-00527, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Indiana (South Bend). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr Prosecutors Get Another Month to Indict Andrew Stein &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government attorneys prosecuting Kenneth Ira Starr, the New
York investment adviser who faces federal fraud charges,
obtained a month-long extension of a deadline to indict Andrew
Stein, the former Manhattan borough president, in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court records show that U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald Ellis
yesterday signed an order to extend, to July 28, the date by
which prosecutors must indict Stein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stein was arrested on May 27 along with Starr and charged
with committing a tax crime and with lying to investigators.
Both men were charged in a criminal complaint filed with the
court the day before. Starr was indicted alone on June 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 17, Stein was seen leaving the offices of U.S.
prosecutors in Manhattan. Stein&#8217;s attorney, Andrew Maloney,
didn&#8217;t return calls seeking an explanation for why his client
was meeting with prosecutors. Janice Oh, a spokeswoman for the
U.S. attorney in Manhattan, declined to comment on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr, 66, is charged with stealing at least $59 million
from 11 clients including film star Uma Thurman and former
basketball star Julius Erving. Starr has pleaded not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Starr, 10-MJ-1135, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Bristol-Myers Executives&#8217; Prosecution Deferred &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors agreed to drop five-year-old fraud charges
against former Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. executives Frederick S.
Schiff and Richard Lane, who must pay money to a settlement fund
under a court-approved deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schiff, 62, a former finance chief, and Lane, 59, a former
director of worldwide medicines, were first charged in 2005 with
fraud and conspiracy. Prosecutors accused them of failing to
tell investors in 2000 and 2001 that Bristol-Myers arranged tens
of millions of dollars in incentives to spur wholesalers to buy
more drugs than needed, a practice known as channel stuffing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under deferred-prosecution agreements approved yesterday in
federal court in Newark, New Jersey, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman
will drop charges in one year as long as Schiff pays $225,000,
Lane pays $175,000, and both abide by their terms of pre-trial
release. Neither can serve as a chief executive officer or chief
financial officer of a publicly traded company for two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This misguided prosecution should have never happened in
the first place,&#8221; said Schiff attorney David M. Zornow of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom LLP in New York. &#8220;It has
been a nightmare, and no one can give him back those years but
he is extremely gratified today that he has been vindicated this
way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lane&#8217;s attorneys, Richard Strassberg and Robert Braceras of
Goodwin Proctor LLP, called the agreement a &#8220;tremendous
vindication&#8221; for their client. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It vividly demonstrates what we have always maintained --
that at all times Mr. Lane acted properly and in the best
interests of Bristol-Myers Squibb and its shareholders,&#8221; the
attorneys said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers paid $300 million in 2005 to avoid
prosecution for channel stuffing, part of the $839 million it
spent to resolve investor lawsuits and probes by U.S.
prosecutors and regulators. In 2003, Bristol-Myers erased $2.5
billion in revenue from 1999 to 2001 related to the practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money that Schiff and Lane will pay will go to the
&#8220;Department of Justice Bristol-Myers-Squibb Settlement Fund or
such other settlement fund as the United States Attorney
directs,&#8221; according to their deferred-prosecution agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Schiff, 06-cr-406, U.S. District Court,
District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United, Continental Sued in Bid to Block Merger &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UAL Corp.&#8217;s United Airlines and Continental Airlines Inc.
were sued over claims the companies&#8217; proposed merger would
create a monopoly, increasing fares and costing jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint was filed yesterday in federal court in San
Francisco by Joseph Alioto, a lawyer who said he is representing
U.S. consumers and small businesses. Alioto is seeking to block
the merger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe in competition, not combination,&#8221; Alioto said
in an interview. &#8220;The trend in this particular industry is
heading straight for monopoly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merger will increase fares, reduce the number of
flights, diminish services such as meals and eliminate tens of
thousands of jobs, according to the complaint. The proposed
merger &#8220;substantially restrains&#8221; the competition between the
carriers for passenger service throughout the U.S. at the
expense of consumers, Alioto wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United and Continental are seeking regulatory approval to
combine under an all-stock merger they announced May 3. The new
company would surpass Delta as the world&#8217;s biggest airline and
mesh United&#8217;s Pacific routes with Continental&#8217;s service in Latin
America and over the Atlantic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe this suit has no merit, and we will vigorously
defend what we strongly believe to be a transaction that is in
the best interests of Continental, its shareholders and the
flying public,&#8221; Julie King, a spokeswoman for Continental, said
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean Medina, a United spokeswoman, also said the complaint
has no merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Malaney v. UAL Corp., 10-2858, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal Reviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Oil Broker Fined for Trading Abuses While Drinking &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. financial regulator fined a former broker at PVM
Oil Futures Ltd. 72,000 pounds ($108,000) for trading without
client authorization and lying to his employer about it while
going on drinking binges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority also banned Steven Perkins
from working in the financial services industry for five years.
Perkins traded on the ICE Futures Europe exchange &#8220;in the early
hours of the morning&#8221; in June 2009 without client
authorization, the FSA said in a statement yesterday. He &#8220;drank
excessively&#8221; over the weekend and the day of the trades, the
regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Perkins&#8217; drunkenness does not excuse his market abuse,&#8221;
said Alexander Justham, director of markets at the FSA.
&#8220;Perkins has been banned because he is not a fit and proper
person to be involved in regulated activities and his behavior
posed a risk to the proper functioning of the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perkins&#8217; job was to trade orders on an execution only basis
in Brent Crude Futures contract on the ICE exchange for his
firm&#8217;s clients. He traded &#8220;in extremely high volume&#8221; on the
exchange in August, accumulating a long position in Brent crude
in excess of 7,000 lots, or more than 7 million barrels of oil,
the FSA said. The value of the position was over $520 million,
according to the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perkins&#8217; lawyer, Stephen Pollard, didn&#8217;t respond to a
request for comment. Perkins agreed to settle the case and
qualified for a 20 percent discount on his fine under the FSA&#8217;s
settlement procedures. The regulator also reduced his fine
because of his financial circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three Ordered to Pay $173 Million Over FSA Deposit-Rule Breach &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three men who accepted deposits without proper
authorization from the U.K. financial regulator were ordered by
a London court to return 115 million pounds ($173 million) to
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Anderson, Kenneth Peacock and Kautilya Nandan Pruthi
were ordered to pay the U.K. Financial Services Authority for
unlawfully accepting deposits while operating as Business
Consulting International, John Anderson Consulting and Kenneth
Peacock Consulting, the regulator said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator will return any money it receives to
investors. It is unlikely that the money will be repaid, the FSA
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case again emphasizes the importance of taking care
to ensure that any firm or individual consumers deal with are
authorized or approved by the FSA,&#8221; enforcement director
Margaret Cole said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men were arrested in May last year by the City of
London police on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud, money
laundering and fraud by misrepresentation. The police
investigation into Business Consulting is ongoing, and a fourth
man was arrested in the probe in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pruthi, Anderson and Peacock represented themselves at
trial and numbers for them couldn&#8217;t be located. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE Loses 10-Year-Old Challenge to EPA Superfund Law &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Electric Co. lost a federal appeals court challenge
to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s Superfund law that
governs cleanup of hazardous waste sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington sided with a lower court, rejecting the company&#8217;s
argument that the agency violated its due process rights under
the U.S. Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE was contesting a provision of the Superfund law that
denies the company the ability to go to court to challenge the
government&#8217;s claims. The lawsuit was filed in 2000, before GE
agreed to and began to clean up 40-mile stretch of the Hudson
River polluted with polychlorinated biphenyl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;GE is evaluating the decision and reviewing its
options,&#8221; said Mark Behan, a spokesman for Fairfield,
Connecticut-based GE. The ruling will have no effect on the
company&#8217;s dredging, where one phase of work was completed last
year and the next is scheduled to start in 2011, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is General Electric Co. v. Jackson, 09-5092, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDA&#8217;s Avandia Ruling Won&#8217;t Affect Suits, Lanier Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Plc&#8217;s legal liabilities won&#8217;t worsen even
if U.S. regulators decide the company&#8217;s diabetes drug Avandia
should be pulled off the market, plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer Mark Lanier
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An advisory panel will meet next month to consider whether
Avandia&#8217;s ability to control blood-sugar levels in diabetics
outweighs a possible increase in heart attacks, strokes and
deaths from cardiovascular disease. While no studies have proven
the drug is dangerous, the availability of a similar medicine
that appears to lower heart attack risk has drug-safety
advocates calling for Avandia to be withdrawn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based Glaxo, the U.K.&#8217;s biggest pharmaceutical
company, has settled or is close to settling as many as half the
13,000 lawsuits claiming Avandia caused heart attacks and other
risks, said Lanier, of the Lanier Law Firm in Houston, in an e-
mail. An FDA decision to withdraw Avandia wouldn&#8217;t open the door
to new lawsuits by patients who claim they were injured by
taking the drug, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Word has been out way too long about possible medical
troubles,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Avandia cases are really hard to prove at
trial. The costs associated with trying the cases are huge
compared to the potential returns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo agreed to pay about $60 million, or about $86,000 per
case, to resolve 700 Avandia suits filed by attorneys including
Lanier last month. The settlement suggests about $1.1 billion of
liability, wrote Gbola Amusa, a UBS AG analyst in London, in a
May 11 note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few more cases may be filed if Avandia is deemed
dangerous and pulled from the market, &#8220;but probably not too
many more,&#8221; Lanier said. A decision by the FDA or Glaxo to
withdraw the drug &#8220;probably wouldn&#8217;t affect settlement values
much, either,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo doesn&#8217;t comment on specific litigation, company
spokeswoman Claire Brough said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Rejected by U.S. High Court on Nigerian Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court rebuffed business calls for limits
on human-rights lawsuits, refusing to stop claims that Pfizer
Inc. tested unproven antibiotics on Nigerian children without
telling their parents about the risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, sought in its
unsuccessful appeal to shield companies from U.S. lawsuits by
foreigners under the Alien Tort Statute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suits stem from a 1996 outbreak of bacterial meningitis
in northern Nigeria. New York-based Pfizer allegedly worked in
concert with Nigerian officials to recruit 200 sick children for
an experimental study of its new Trovan antibiotic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits say Pfizer didn&#8217;t disclose the experimental
nature of the study or the risks involved. Eleven children died
and others were left paralyzed, deaf or blind, according to the
suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court ruled that the lawsuits could go
forward. In rejecting the company&#8217;s appeal, the justices heeded
the advice of the Obama administration, which argued that the
appeal wasn&#8217;t suitable for high court review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alien Tort Statute authorizes federal courts to
consider some lawsuits by non-citizens for human-rights
violations committed abroad. Courts have said the Alien Tort
Statute applies to private companies when they act in concert
with a foreign government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in a statement that, while it is disappointed
by the high court rebuff, it can still press other arguments at
the trial court level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company has reserved its right to again move to
dismiss the cases on various grounds, including the fact that
Nigeria is the appropriate forum for the cases to be heard,&#8221;
the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer v. Abdullahi, 09-34, U.S. Supreme Court
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merck Doesn&#8217;t Have to Refund Louisiana, Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co. doesn&#8217;t have to refund money the state of
Louisiana paid for the withdrawn Vioxx painkiller, a federal
judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers of Louisiana&#8217;s state-sponsored health programs had
no power under state law to halt reimbursements for Vioxx
prescriptions, even had they known that Merck misled them about
the drug&#8217;s heart-attack risk, U.S. District Judge Eldon Fallon
in New Orleans ruled yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana &#8220;did not carry its burden that, had the state
possessed different clinical information about Vioxx, it would
have sought to restrict Vioxx Medicaid reimbursements
entirely,&#8221; wrote Fallon, who heard the case without a jury. It
was the first of more than a dozen refund cases filed by states
over Vioxx to go to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re satisfied with the court&#8217;s decision and believe
that the evidence showed that Merck acted appropriately by
labeling Vioxx under the direction of the FDA and according to
the evolving science available at the time it was on the
market,&#8221; said Ron Rogers, a Merck spokesman, in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re shocked and disappointed in the judge&#8217;s decision,&#8221;
said James Dugan, one of the state&#8217;s lawyers. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to
meet with the attorney general&#8217;s office to discuss our appellate
rights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana sought to recover more than $20 million in the
state&#8217;s case, including more than $11 million in damages, along
with its litigation expenses and attorneys fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana case is State of Louisiana v. Merck, Sharp 
Dohme Corp., 05-3700, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kagan Says Military Had Access to Harvard Students &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan defended her
treatment of military recruiters when she was dean at Harvard
Law School, saying they had access to students &#8220;every single
day&#8221; and any limitations were aimed at protecting the rights of
gays and lesbians on campus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan said military officials recruited through an off-
campus veterans&#8217; group as she enforced a rule barring them from
using the law school&#8217;s office of career services because the
military kept gay people from serving openly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Military recruiters had access to Harvard students every
single day I was dean,&#8221; Kagan said in response to questioning
on the second day of her confirmation hearings before the Senate
Judiciary Committee. She said military recruiting increased at
one point during her tenure, and that she often told alumni and
students in the military &#8220;how much I respected their service.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military recruitment question is one of the major
issues facing Kagan, President Barack Obama&#8217;s choice to become
the nation&#8217;s 112th justice. Republicans have used the issue to
question her political leanings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the ranking Republican on
the committee, told Kagan he believed she treated the military
&#8220;in a second-class way.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I feel like you mishandled
that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan said she opposed the military&#8217;s &#8220;don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t
tell&#8221; policy on gay people serving in the armed forces and
still does. She called it &#8220;unwise and unjust.&#8221; The U.S. House
of Representatives on May 27 voted to repeal the policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
general counsel, took a call in his 37th-floor office at One New
York Plaza on Dec. 16, 2008. It was his old boss, Stephen Friedman, a former Goldman chairman who was then head of the
audit committee of its board of directors. Goldman&#8217;s stock was
down 65 percent from its 52-week high during an accelerating
global financial breakdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman, who had become chairman of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York that year, told Palm he wanted to buy,
Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its August issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palm says he couldn&#8217;t think of a reason why Friedman
shouldn&#8217;t: Goldman had made the necessary disclosures in that
day&#8217;s filings, Palm says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;d just reported earnings,&#8221; says Palm, whose job
includes approving trades by directors. &#8220;There was no material
information that wasn&#8217;t public from Goldman&#8217;s standpoint.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman, 72, who is still a Goldman director, bought
37,300 shares at an average of $80.78 each on Dec. 17. Five
weeks later, he picked up 15,300 more at an average of $66.61.
By yesterday, the stock had doubled to $133.76, giving Friedman
a paper profit of $3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee is investigating Friedman&#8217;s stock purchases. It wants
to know why he was permitted to buy stock in a bank he was
regulating as chairman of the New York Fed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. made Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein available for an interview
with the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission and has been more
responsive to information requests from the panel, the FCIC&#8217;s
leaders said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 55, was interviewed recently by FCIC staff &#8220;at
length&#8221; as part of its probe into causes of the 2008 credit-
market freeze, commission Chairman Phil Angelides said yesterday
in a conference call with reporters. Angelides said on June 7
that the FCIC subpoenaed Goldman Sachs after the bank tried to
hinder a probe by overwhelming the panel with documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have no question&#8221; that New York-based Goldman Sachs
will now cooperate with requests, FCIC Vice Chairman Bill Thomas
said on the call. &#8220;It was the lack of specificity, or even the
acknowledgement that what we asked for was in the piles of
documents we got, that was cleared up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs executives including Chief Financial Officer
David Viniar and President Gary Cohn will testify at a two-day
FCIC hearing beginning today reviewing the role of derivatives
in the recession. Also scheduled to testify is Joseph Cassano,
55, the former American International Group Inc. executive whose
bets on subprime mortgages led the insurer to the brink of
collapse in 2008, requiring a U.S. bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This hearing is focused on derivatives which is a subset,
obviously, of what Goldman does, and if you want to get some
answers that are useful and meaningful you&#8217;d probably ask the
people who were head of that subset,&#8221; Thomas said, when asked
about the choice of executives to appear before the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG Chief Risk Officer Robert Lewis will also testify as
will Martin Sullivan, who was ousted as the insurer&#8217;s CEO in
2008 after the company was overwhelmed by losses on real estate-
related bets that he had projected would be &#8220;manageable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinallo, Gensler &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-New York Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo and Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
are also scheduled to appear. The FCIC tried to compel former
Office of Thrift Supervision Director John Reich to testify,
said Tucker Warren, a spokesman for the commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subpoena wasn&#8217;t served to Reich because he is outside
the U.S., Warren said. Attempts to reach Reich for comment
weren&#8217;t immediately successful. The OTS is one of AIG&#8217;s
regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After AIG&#8217;s bailout, Goldman Sachs collected $12.9 billion
tied to contracts with the New York-based insurer, including
derivatives. AIG sold credit-default swaps to firms including
Goldman Sachs, Societe Generale SA and Deutsche Bank AG
protecting them against declines in the value of mortgages. When
the housing market collapsed, AIG didn&#8217;t have enough funds to
honor its contracts and turned to the U.S. for a rescue that
swelled to $182.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Cassano &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassano, who oversaw an AIG unit managing $2 trillion in
derivative trades, was interviewed for about five hours by FCIC
staff. He had previously shied away from public statements while
regulators investigated his role in the swaps trades, which he
said in 2007 would be profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was a person with extraordinary knowledge of the inner
workings of that company and the relationships with others,&#8221;
Angelides said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Serious Fraud Office said on May 26 that a
review of the business Cassano oversaw didn&#8217;t turn up any
criminal violations. U.S. prosecutors also won&#8217;t bring charges,
a person familiar with the investigation said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was sued in April by U.S. regulators for
misleading clients who invested in collateralized debt
obligations. The Securities and Exchange Commission said that
investors weren&#8217;t told that the hedge fund led by John Paulson
helped pick the mortgages in the CDOs and was betting on them to
fail. Goldman Sachs has said the suit is unfounded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the highest-paying and most profitable firm
in Wall Street history, has been criticized by lawmakers as a
symbol of greed and excess. AIG and failed securities firm Bear
Stearns Cos. are among companies hobbled by losses on
investments from Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission is investigating the causes of the credit
crisis, which followed the collapse of the housing market
beginning in 2007 and sparked the worst recession since the
1930s and the loss of more than 8 million U.S. jobs. It will
report its findings to Congress and President Barack Obama by
December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives such as credit-default swaps contributed to the
crisis, making it difficult for regulators to understand how
interconnected financial firms had become after the bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as higher education and
corporate America would like to be engaged, college presidents
are struggling to reconcile the demands and values of academia
with shareholder skepticism about their boardroom commitments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Marathon Oil Corp. investors cast 67.5 million votes
against Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute President Shirley Ann
Jackson in April after a shareholder questioned whether she had
time to serve. At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Brown University
President Ruth Simmons declined to stand for reelection in May,
citing time demands, amid student criticism of her tie to the
company, which was involved in the Wall Street meltdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University System of Georgia Chancellor Erroll B. Davis Jr.
is a defendant in at least two lawsuits stemming from BP Plc&#8217;s
oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, even though he quit BP&#8217;s board
in April, five days before the spill began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For university presidents, sitting on a corporate board
used to be a resume enhancer and a networking opportunity,&#8221;
Nell Minow, chairman of the Corporate Library, a Portland, Maine,
company that evaluates board performance, said in an interview.
&#8220;Now it is a genuine and very demanding task with some daunting
liability -- reputational and financial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. acquired Tapulous
Inc., a developer of music-related video games for Apple Inc.&#8217;s
iPhone and iPad, to expand its mobile business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney anticipates growth on Apple&#8217;s platforms and mobile
devices, Steve Wadsworth, head of the company&#8217;s Internet unit,
said today in an interview. Terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the deal, Burbank, California-based Disney becomes one
of the biggest developers of games for Apple&#8217;s App Store.
Tapulous has 30 million users and is profitable, according to
its website. &#8220;Tap Tap Revenge,&#8221; a top-selling download at the
App Store, is played by tapping a screen to the rhythm of a
song. While the software is free, players must buy new songs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an extremely high-growth industry, both mobile
games and mobile media,&#8221; Wadsworth said. &#8220;We are there and we
want to continue to be there in a very big way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapulous founder and Chief Executive Officer Bart Decrem,
operating chief Andrew Lacy and the development team are joining
Disney&#8217;s mobile-games group, Wadsworth said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their ability to effectively monetize, in a very
efficient way, games on these devices is very attractive,&#8221;
Wadsworth said. &#8220;Their insight into how that works will be very
helpful as we grow on these platforms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Characters &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decrem said in an interview he will be head of Disney&#8217;s
mobile division, which will create new titles based on Disney
characters and intellectual property, as well as continue to
distribute the &#8220;Tap Tap Revenge&#8221; games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal came together over the past three to four months,
Decrem said. Tapulous was considering whether to raise another
round of funding from investors when it decided to join Disney
instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge opportunity,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition was reported earlier by industry website
TechCrunch.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapulous investors include Salesforce.com Inc. CEO Marc Benioff and Sun Microsystems Inc. co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim,
according to the company&#8217;s website. Steve Jobs, Apple&#8217;s chief
executive officer, is Disney&#8217;s biggest shareholder and a
director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, fell 1 cent to
$31.49 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares have declined 2.4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dollar may slide further beyond a
seven-month low against the yen if the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
continues to fall, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar&#8217;s &#8220;violation of key support&#8221; at the 89.25-
88.95 yen level earlier this week implies &#8220;a breakdown is
underway which should allow for an extension of the current
decline,&#8221; Niall O&#8217;Connor, a technical analyst in New York at
the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, wrote in a note
yesterday. Support refers to areas on charts where buy orders
are clustered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar yesterday fell 0.9 percent against the yen to
87.60 at in New York. It touched 86.97 yen, its weakest level
since Dec. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The story is really what&#8217;s going on in equities,&#8221;
O&#8217;Connor said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Even though we&#8217;ve
bounced off the lows, equities have had a rough day.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 touched 1,010.91, the lowest intraday level
since Sept. 4, before closing at 1,027.31 in New York. The break
below the 1040 level &#8220;suggests that risk sentiment will remain
on the defensive,&#8221; according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s currency usually outperforms the dollar when U.S.
stocks decline, O&#8217;Connor said, and continued weakness in
equities could drive the dollar lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. refused a
request from the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission to reveal
how much it makes trading derivatives, saying the bank doesn&#8217;t
separate the figure from other businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some other firms have provided us with that data when
we&#8217;ve asked for it and Goldman Sachs hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; Commissioner
Brooksley Born said today in Washington on the second day of a
hearing investigating the role of derivatives in the 2008 credit
crisis, which sparked the worst recession since the 1930s. &#8220;It
makes one wonder why Goldman has the incentive or impetus to not
release this information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
derivatives dealer, have provided estimates to investors. The
top five U.S. commercial banks, including Goldman Sachs,
generated an estimated $28 billion in revenue from privately
negotiated derivatives in 2009, according to company reports
collected by the Federal Reserve and people familiar with banks&#8217;
income sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm in
history, is being questioned about credit-default swap trades
with American International Group Inc., the insurer bailed out
by the U.S. government after AIG was unable to meet collateral
demands from trading partners on the contracts. The swaps, used
by Goldman Sachs and other banks to hedge against declines in
the value of mortgage-linked debt, caused losses at AIG as
housing prices collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;It&#8217;s Integrated&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar
testified today that the firm has no way of separating out its
derivatives data from trading in cash securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a separate derivatives business,&#8221; Viniar
told the panel. &#8220;It&#8217;s integrated into the rest of our
business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commissioner Byron Georgiou said he doubted Goldman Sachs
was unable to provide the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you tell us that you don&#8217;t know how much you make in
your derivatives business, nobody here really believes it,&#8221;
Georgiou told Viniar. &#8220;Nobody here believes that you don&#8217;t know
how much money you&#8217;re making on the various aspects of your
business, it doesn&#8217;t make any sense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$49.1 Trillion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs held a gross amount of $49.1 trillion of
derivatives contracts as of March 31, according to an Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency report last month. The bank
reported total trading revenue of $7.65 billion during the first
quarter. That follows total trading revenue of $23.2 billion in
2009, according to a filing with the Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of dangerous, don&#8217;t you think, to claim to the
FCIC that you don&#8217;t know the profitability of a major line of
business,&#8221; said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the
University of Houston. &#8220;How can you rationally allocate
capital, for instance, if you don&#8217;t know the return to that
capital?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a March 2008 amendment to derivatives accounting
standards, companies are exempt from breaking out gains or
losses on derivatives used as part of a trading book that also
includes cash securities, if other information on the trading
activities is provided, according to the Financial Accounting
Standards Board&#8217;s Statement No. 161. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is &#8220;definitely capable of providing the data
that was asked for, but I can understand their fear of doing
so,&#8221; said Brian Yelvington, head of fixed-income strategy at
broker-dealer Knight Libertas LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut, and
a former credit swaps trader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives Revenue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a potential for such a number to vastly
overstate the amount of profit or loss captured by a particular
business because much of that business may be symbiotic with
another,&#8221; Yelvington said. &#8220;They may have made money on the
derivatives leg of a trade, for example, and lost it on the cash
leg.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in February 2009 that about 8 percent of its
total revenue from 2006 to 2008 came from derivatives in its
investment-banking unit, according to a presentation made to
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That breakdown and revenue figures from regulatory filings
imply that half of JPMorgan&#8217;s $31.2 billion in trading revenue
those years came from derivatives, according to Alexander Yavorsky, a senior analyst at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Highly Imprecise&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Reporting a revenue number, just the profit on
derivatives without looking at cash positions associated with
hedging those, is going to be a highly imprecise exercise,&#8221;
Yavorsky said in an interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was subpoenaed by the commission last month
after the New York-based firm sent more than a billion pages of
documents to the panel, a shipment so sizable that panel members
called it an attempt to hinder their probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We did not ask them to pull up a dump truck to our
offices and dump a bunch of rubbish,&#8221; Chairman Phil Angelides,
who previously served as California&#8217;s treasurer, said June 7.
&#8220;This has been a very deliberate effort over time to run out
the clock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission, which will report its findings to Congress
and President Barack Obama by December, said June 29 that the
bank had been more responsive to information requests since
being subpoenaed. Separately, Goldman Sachs faces a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission fraud suit over sales of a
mortgage-linked security. The bank has said the SEC suit is
unfounded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born&#8217;s Warning &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born had warned in 1998, as chairman of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, that the unregulated over-the-
counter derivatives market posed a danger to the global
financial system. She moved to address changes in how swaps
based on interest rates, commodities or currencies were traded
and was stopped by then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,
who all argued the market could regulate itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born said last year that the banks that caused the crisis
were trying to stop the congressional overhaul of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Special interests in the financial-services industry are
beginning to advocate a return to business as usual,&#8221; Born said
in May 2009 as she accepted a Profile in Courage award from the
John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, agreed to
buy closely held BigFix Inc., gaining programs that automate
security and compliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price is about $400 million, according to a person
familiar with the matter. Armonk, New York-based IBM said in a
statement today it&#8217;s not disclosing the terms. BigFix software
identifies devices that aren&#8217;t in compliance with corporate
policy and recommends fixes in real-time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano has said he is
planning to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions in the next
five years. The software unit, the company&#8217;s most profitable,
will make up about half of total earnings in 2015, the company
said in May. The unit has made about 60 acquisitions since 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BigFix, based in Emeryville, California, has about 200
employees and 700 customers, including SunTrust Bank. The deal
is expected to close this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 91 cents to $122.57 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 6.4 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank, named Barry Sommers to lead an effort to
boost the share of assets it holds for its wealthiest clients to
more than 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sommers, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Securities,
will become CEO of retail affluent and investment services,
JPMorgan said today in a statement from Business Wire. He&#8217;ll
report to Charlie Scharf, head of retail financial services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our initiative will help us serve customers better and
could increase pretax profits by $500 million to $1 billion
annually,&#8221; Scharf said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and
Wells Fargo  Co. are encouraging wealthy customers to do more
business with them as the weak economy and new regulations make
it harder to earn money from loans and investment banking.
Morgan Stanley plans to hire as many as 500 bankers to build its
private bank, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customers JPMorgan distinguishes as affluent typically
have at least $500,000 in investable assets, spokesman Thomas Kelly said in a telephone interview. JPMorgan Securities was
formerly known as Bear Stearns Private Client Services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares, down 15 percent this year compared with a
6.6 percent decrease in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials
Index, fell 3 percent to $35.48 as of 11:27 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow drivers suffer the longest
traffic jams of major cities, making for a &#8220;grueling&#8221;
atmosphere that inhibits commerce, International Business
Machines Corp. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average Muscovite motorist spent a &#8220;whopping&#8221; 2 1/2
hours stuck in traffic at least once in the last three years,
IBM said in its first global study on the &#8220;emotional and
economic toll of commuting,&#8221; which was e-mailed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 40 percent of drivers in the Russian capital
reported jams exceeding 3 hours, or three times the average for
the 20 cities in the Commuter Pain report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The daily commute in some of the world&#8217;s most
economically important international cities is longer and more
grueling than before imagined, reflecting the failure of
transportation infrastructure to keep pace with economic
activity,&#8221; Armonk, New York-based IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traffic has become so clogged in parts of Moscow that
Sheremetyevo Airport, the hub of flagship carrier OAO Aeroflot,
issued a public plea for help yesterday, saying that hundreds of
passengers and pilots have missed flights this week. Aeroflot is
losing 400,000 euros ($495,440) a day because of the &#8220;transport
collapse,&#8221; Interfax reported, citing Deputy Chief Executive
Officer Andrei Kalmykov. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;People Are Complaining&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Vladimir Putin addressed the issue on state
television today, asking Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov to
work with municipal authorities to expedite road repairs that
have quintupled the average time it takes to reach the airport
from the city center to as much as five hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are complaining, you can&#8217;t reach Sheremetyevo,&#8221;
Putin told Ivanov on Rossiya 24. Russia&#8217;s Transportation
Ministry estimates that traffic delays in and around Moscow cost
the economy 400 billion rubles ($12.8 billion) a year, or 6
percent of gross product. The city needs to add 400 kilometers
of roads to ease the 650 traffic jams that occur on average
every day, according to the ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public spending on transportation in Russia will fall to
1.9 percent of gross domestic product this year from the
&#8220;already low level of&#8221; 2.5 percent in 2009, the World Bank
said in a report published on June 16. The quality of the
country&#8217;s road infrastructure is ranked 111th in the world,
according to the Washington-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing, New York &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of the 8,192 motorists on five continents surveyed by
IBM said gridlock has worsened in the last three years. Beijing
and New Delhi showed the most improvement, while Johannesburg,
Moscow and Toronto showed the least. Beijing and Moscow led the
world with the most road trips canceled due to anticipated
traffic jams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing won the title of most &#8220;onerous&#8221; commute overall,
when factors such as traffic predictability, gasoline prices and
emotional stress are included. Mexico City was second worst,
followed by Johannesburg, Moscow and New Delhi. Stockholm,
Melbourne and Houston have the &#8220;least painful commutes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of the motorists polled, or 57 percent, said
traffic stress has harmed their health, led by Mexico City and
Sao Paolo, while drivers in Beijing and Moscow reported being
the angriest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Yorkers reported less anxiety than drivers from any
other city, with just 34 percent feeling &#8220;traffic stress&#8221; on a
regular basis, followed by Houston, Melbourne and Toronto.
&#8220;These are all cities with well-developed transportation
systems,&#8221; IBM said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global poll, conducted in April and May, has an overall
margin of error of 2 percentage points. It follows similar
surveys carried out in the U.S. in 2008 and 2009, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives
repeated their position that disputes with American
International Group Inc. over securities prices and collateral
in 2007 and 2008 reflected the firm&#8217;s typical risk-management
efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer David Viniar and David Lehman, co-
head of the firm&#8217;s structured products group trading desk, are
scheduled to testify this morning before the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission in Washington. Their prepared testimony
replays comments made yesterday by President and Chief Operating
Officer Gary Cohn and Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We established credit terms with AIG consistent with
those extended to other major counterparts, including collateral
arrangements that we tightly managed,&#8221; Viniar said in prepared
remarks. &#8220;As we do with many other counterparty relationships,
we limited our exposure to AIG through a combination of
collateral and market hedges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCIC, led by Chairman Philip Angelides and Vice
Chairman William Thomas, today holds its second day of a two-day
hearing into the role that derivatives played in the credit
crisis, with a focus on the relationship between Goldman Sachs
and AIG, the insurer that had to be bailed out by the federal
government. Members of the committee repeatedly questioned
yesterday whether Goldman Sachs marked down the value of its
complex trades with AIG to force AIG to pay collateral. AIG
disputed Goldman Sachs&#8217;s marks as too low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients Complained &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee released internal e-mails yesterday that
showed Goldman Sachs employees discussing other clients such as
Tokyo-based AIOI Insurance Co. complaining that Goldman Sachs
was marking mortgage-backed securities at prices that were
&#8220;more than twice as bad as the second worst dealer&#8217;s.&#8221;
Angelides asked Goldman Sachs yesterday to provide information
about how the firm derived the prices it set on its trades with
AIG, and Cohn agreed to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, whose record profits in 2007 were helped in
part by the firm&#8217;s negative bets on subprime mortgage-related
securities, is fighting accusations from regulators, members of
Congress and former clients that the firm designed securities it
knew would fail and bet on their collapse by buying credit-
default swaps, which pay out in the event of a default. Goldman
Sachs has denied any wrongdoing. Cohn said yesterday that the
firm had shorted just 1 percent of the mortgage-backed
securities and collateralized debt obligations the company
underwrote between December 2006 and June 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pricing Sources &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his testimony today, Lehman will say that the firm&#8217;s
prices were based on two main sources: the marks of comparable
transactions trading in the market and information obtained from
market participants through bid or offer prices for similar
securities or derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would collect information generated by these
comparable transactions,&#8221; Lehman says in his testimony. &#8220;Then,
we would perform a variety of analyses on the collected
comparables in order to gain a sense of the market value of the
Goldman/AIG swaps from the pricing reflected in actual market
transactions in similar derivatives.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar and Lehman will testify today alongside former AIG
Chief Financial Officer Steven Bensinger and other AIG
executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers appointed the 10-member FCIC last July to
investigate the causes of the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression. The panel has until December to report its
findings to Congress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bright Oceans Inter-Telecom Corp., a
Chinese software maker, gained the most in four months in
Shanghai trading after International Business Machines Corp.
bought a stake in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bright Oceans increased 8.3 percent to 9.43 yuan as of the
11:30 a.m. local time trading break, headed for the biggest one-
day gain since Feb. 22. China&#8217;s benchmark Shanghai Composite
Index fell 0.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM bought 5.92 million Bright Oceans shares from the
Beijing-based software company&#8217;s parent for 50 million yuan
($7.37 million) and said it wouldn&#8217;t sell the stake in the next
year, according to a filing to Shanghai&#8217;s stock exchange. Bright
Oceans wants to add strategic investors that can help bolster
its product development and increase its international exposure,
the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese company&#8217;s profit last year gained 11.7 percent
to 82.4 million yuan from 2008 as sales grew 8.7 percent to 928
million yuan, according to Bright Oceans&#8217; 2009 annual report.
Bright Oceans stock has fallen 8.6 percent this year, compared
with a 27 percent drop in the Shanghai Composite Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM in January of last year also bought a 1.56 percent
stake in Chinese television maker Sichuan Changhong Electric Co.
for 108 million yuan. In September 2006, Intel Corp. acquired a
$40 million stake in Chinese software maker Neusoft Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. could have
done a better job managing reputational risks as it navigated
the credit crisis and has since reconsidered some decisions,
said President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve done a good job. Could we have done a better job?
Sure.&#8221; Cohn, 49, said yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg
Television. &#8220;With hindsight, I know a lot more today than I did
back then.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn spoke after testifying before the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission, where he answered questions about the firm&#8217;s
derivatives business and particularly its interactions with
American International Group Inc., the insurer that was bailed
out by the U.S. government. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s reputation was
marred in April when the Securities and Exchange Commission sued
the firm for fraud over sales of a mortgage-backed security. The
bank has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Based on all our internal data, we are doing fine, we are
doing well with our clients,&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;We continue to be at
the center of all flows, we continue to be engaged with clients,
we continuously are winning business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial regulatory reform legislation, which passed the
House of Representatives yesterday and still needs Senate
approval, will require New York-based Goldman Sachs to hold more
capital, to be less leveraged, and to abandon &#8220;pure proprietary
trading,&#8221; he said. He didn&#8217;t rule out the possibility that the
firm could give up its bank holding company status sometime in
the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
growth forecast for China this year to 10.1 percent from 11.4
percent as government restrictions on lending and real estate
slow expansion in the world&#8217;s fastest-growing major economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian stocks fell after the report fanned concern that
slower growth in China will undermine the global recovery. Hours
after Goldman&#8217;s revision, China increased its estimate for last
year&#8217;s growth to 9.1 percent, signaling output almost matched
Japan&#8217;s as the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman joins BNP Paribas, Macquarie Securities Ltd. and
China International Capital Corp. in reducing estimates as the
government tightens property restrictions to prevent overheating.
A third of China economists may cut &#8220;overly bullish&#8221; forecasts
for 2010 and 2011 in coming weeks, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
economist Lu Ting said in a June 30 note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China&#8217;s growth has been slowing down sharply and the
tightening measures we saw in April on property have been quite
aggressive,&#8221; Isaac Meng, a Beijing-based economist at BNP
Paribas, said in a phone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government won&#8217;t &#8220;launch easing measures in the short
term as the major concerns, especially about the property bubble,
haven&#8217;t been fully addressed,&#8221; Meng said. BNP this week reduced
China&#8217;s 2010 growth forecast to 9.8 percent from 10.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing in the nation, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of
computers and mobile phones, expanded at the slowest pace in 16
months, a survey of purchasing managers showed yesterday. Stocks
declined around the world this week on evidence that a cooling
China combined with austerity measures in Europe and slower
growth in the U.S. will hurt the global recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.3 percent to 111.64 as
of 6:06 p.m. in Tokyo, the fourth straight decline. The gauge
has slumped 14 percent from its high this year on April 15. The
Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of China&#8217;s
stock exchanges, slid to its lowest level in 14 months this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liao Qun, a Hong Kong-based economist at Citic Bank
International Ltd, today lowered his forecast for China&#8217;s growth
this year to 10.1 percent from 10.3 percent, citing the property
sector, the European crisis and the government&#8217;s 0.4 percentage
point upward revision to 2009 gross domestic product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adjustment put the value of last year&#8217;s GDP at 34.05
trillion yuan, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a
statement on its website. The figure translates to $4.98
trillion based on the average exchange rate between the yuan and
the dollar in 2009, suggesting Japan retained its position as
the second-largest economy with output of $5.07 trillion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Sustainable Pace &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts including Sun Mingchun at Nomura Holdings Inc. say
China&#8217;s moderation is a sign that the government is moving the
country to a more sustainable pace of expansion after a 4
trillion yuan stimulus package drove an 11.9 percent rebound in
the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The June PMI data confirms that the manufacturing sector
still remains in a solid expansion stage,&#8221; Sun, a Hong Kong-
based economist at Nomura, said in a note yesterday. &#8220;If the
decline does not continue for too long, it should prove a
healthy correction that reduces the risk of the economy
overheating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economy is moving in the &#8220;expected direction,&#8221;
Premier Wen Jiabao said in meetings with businesspeople and
economists this week. Policy makers will &#8220;further cement and
develop the positive economic trend&#8221; amid an &#8220;extremely
complicated&#8221; domestic and global outlook, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macquarie cut its growth estimate for China to 9.5 percent
to 10 percent from a previous 10 percent to 10.5 percent last
month and CICC said in May that growth would likely ease to 9.5
percent from a previous estimate of 10.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The momentum of growth has moderated as expected, but we
do not see a sharp slowdown in China,&#8221; Liu Li-Gang, economist
at Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said in Hong Kong.
&#8220;With this moderation, this will be a good thing for policy
makers that they don&#8217;t have to tighten excessively.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s current-account deficit may
&#8220;remain high&#8221; this year as economic growth boosts imports,
adding pressure on the rupee to weaken in the near term, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are near-term weakening pressures on the rupee
exacerbated by external uncertainties,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
economists Pranjul Bhandari and Tushar Poddar wrote in a report
to clients yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current-account gap, a measure of trade and investment
flows, widened to a record $13 billion in the quarter through
March, the central bank said June 30, sending the rupee headed
to its biggest weekly loss in a month. The currency slid 0.7
percent this week to 46.625 per dollar at 1:30 p.m. in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India yesterday said India has become
more vulnerable to slowdowns and financial crises abroad as
foreign trade plays a bigger role in the economy. Trade
represented 35 percent of gross domestic product in the year
ended March 31, 2008, from 21 percent a decade earlier,
according to the central bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman economists expect the rupee to gain over a six-to-
12-month period as faster growth attracts foreign investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman forecasts the rupee to touch 47.5 against the
dollar in three months, 46 in six months and 44.5 in a year,
according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s $1.2 trillion economy may expand 8.5 percent in the
year ending March 31, from 7.4 percent in the previous year,
according to the finance ministry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology companies are suffering
some of the U.S. stock market&#8217;s biggest losses, sending the
Nasdaq-100 Index to the longest losing streak in its 25-year
history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure, which gets 63 percent of its value from
computer-related companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Apple
Inc., has declined 9.7 percent after slumping 10 consecutive
days. Microsoft has tumbled 26 percent since peaking on April
22, while Apple has fallen 9.9 percent in two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is an orderly liquidation of equity positions by
traders who are taking risk units off the table,&#8221; said Kevin Caron, a market strategist at Stifel Nicolaus  Co. in Florham
Park, New Jersey, whose clients have about $90 billion in
assets. &#8220;Nasdaq is typically the home of high beta risk units.
Makes perfect sense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. shares are experiencing the largest losses since the
bull market began in March 2009, when the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index sank to a 12-year low. The benchmark measure of U.S.
equities has fallen in 9 out of the past 10 days as reports on
consumer confidence, manufacturing, home sales and employment
were weaker than economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted,
fueling concern the recovery is in peril. The SP 500 fell 5
percent since June 25, the biggest weekly loss since May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re in a psychological bear market,&#8221; said Robert Lutts,
president of Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts,
which oversees $500 million. &#8220;The recent economic setback is
significant,&#8221; and investors are bracing for companies to reduce
forecasts in the next few weeks, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDP, Profits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists predict that U.S. gross domestic product will
expand 3.2 percent this year and 2.9 percent in 2011, according
to the median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey. Profit for
companies in the SP 500 are projected to rise 32 percent to a
combined $81.72 a share in 2010, according to estimates from
more than 2,000 analysts tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barton Biggs, whose purchase of stocks in March 2009 gave
Traxis Partners LLC a 38 percent gain last year, said concern
the economy is about to contract prompted him to sell almost all
his U.S. technology shares this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m worried that we could have not just a soft patch but
a double dip which lasts two or three quarters, and where
nominal GDP is only up 2 or 3 percent, and that&#8217;ll have a big
effect on profits,&#8221; Biggs said in a Bloomberg Television
interview yesterday. &#8220;It&#8217;ll scare everybody, and I&#8217;m afraid the
market goes down another 10 or 15 percent if that happens.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When stocks rebound, technology shares may be the leaders,
according to James Paulsen, who helps oversee about $375 billion
as chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in
Minneapolis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is &#8220;one of the first groups to go if you go
into a downward trend,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be one that&#8217;s
going to come back if we turn the corner again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private equity wing of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and TPG Capital are to buy diaper maker Ontex
from Candover Investments Plc for 1.2 billion euros ($1.5
billion), the Sunday Telegraph reported, without saying where it
got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, which faltered when Goldman&#8217;s initial private
equity partner withdrew, may be announced as early as this week,
according to the newspaper. Ontex has about 60 percent of the
European market for non-label diapers, the Telegraph said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Fiona Laffan declined to comment
on the report. &lt;/p&gt;
