<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was
subpoenaed by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission after
panel members said the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history engaged in a document dump to hinder a probe. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs sent more than a billion pages of documents,
FCIC Vice Chairman Bill Thomas said on a conference call with
reporters today. Not all of the information is what the panel
requested, and Goldman Sachs didn''t cooperate with requests to
interview Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, Chief
Operating Officer Gary Cohn and Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, FCIC Chairman Phil Angelides said. </p>
<p>We did not ask them to pull up a dump truck to our
offices and dump a bunch of rubbish, said Angelides, 56, who
previously served as California''s treasurer. This has been a
very deliberate effort over time to run out the clock. </p>
<p>The FCIC, which Congress appointed last year to investigate
the causes of the worst economic slump since the Great
Depression, issued the subpoena June 4. The request adds to
government scrutiny of New York-based Goldman Sachs, as
regulators and lawmakers examine how it packaged mortgages into
securities that fueled investor losses when the housing market
collapsed in 2007. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is being
legitimately scrutinized by regulators who sued the firm for
fraud based on conduct that many in the industry consider to be
common practice, according to a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history
has suffered the worst reputational decline among its largest
competitors, according to the global quarterly poll of 1,001
investors and analysts who are Bloomberg subscribers. Eighty-
three percent of respondents said Goldman Sachs''s stature
diminished in the past six months; the next closest were UBS AG,
with 27 percent, and Citigroup Inc., at 26 percent. </p>
<p>This disaster didn''t occur by mistake, said respondent
Dane Fulmer, who has traded fixed-income financial instruments
for 39 years and runs Dane Fulmer Investments in Fort Smith,
Arkansas. If it was an honest mistake, then it far, far
surpasses what the law would consider negligent. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was sued April 16 by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which said the New York-based company
failed to inform investors about the role hedge fund Paulson 
Co. played in both helping to select contracts underlying a
mortgage-linked investment and betting against it. Goldman Sachs
has said it did nothing wrong and is fighting the case. </p>
<p>Asked for their opinion of the SEC fraud suit, 61 percent
of respondents replied that the firm is being legitimately
scrutinized, while 29 percent answered that the company is
being unfairly vilified. The remainder were undecided. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the poll. </p>
<p>Views of Goldman Sachs and its outlook were more negative
outside the U.S., where 69 percent of respondents found the SEC
suit to be reasonable, compared with 48 percent of people polled
in the U.S. </p>
<p>Common Practice </p>
<p>About three-quarters of the people in all regions who said
they thought the SEC''s case was justifiable also said the
alleged behavior is common practice. </p>
<p>Complex transactions that may appear to some to be
malicious likely occur at every large investment house on the
Street, said respondent Eric McCarthy, an analyst at a U.S.
hedge fund. </p>
<p>Leverage derived from packaging subprime mortgage debt into
collateralized debt obligations and related derivatives, such as
the transaction at the center of the SEC''s suit against Goldman
Sachs, magnified losses in the mortgage market and contributed
to the near-collapse of the financial system in 2008. The crisis
led to an unprecedented taxpayer-funded bailout of banks,
including Goldman Sachs, which repaid its $10 billion capital
injection, with interest, last year. </p>
<p>Clients Second </p>
<p>Gala Prada, a fund manager at Fiatc Mutua de Seguros y
Reaseguros in Barcelona, an insurer with 1 billion euros ($1.2
billion) in assets, agreed that Goldman''s conduct wasn''t
unusual. </p>
<p>Investment banks, not only Goldman, first do their own
proper account trades and only then advise their clients to do
whatever is in their best interest, and I mean in the investment
bank''s interest, Prada said. </p>
<p>The outlook for Goldman Sachs''s stock and management was
more optimistic in the U.S., where more than half of those
polled said Lloyd Blankfein would remain chairman, compared with
36 percent of non-U.S. respondents who said so. </p>
<p>If you''re a Goldman shareholder or a Goldman employee, by
and large you have been well served by the management team
relative to the environment and relative to the competition,
said Brenden Smith, founder and principal of San Francisco-based
Cypress Capital Management LP and a former Goldman Sachs
employee. </p>
<p>$13.4 Billion Profit </p>
<p>Goldman set a profit record for a stand-alone U.S.
securities firm in 2007, when it earned $11.6 billion. In 2009,
after converting to a bank holding company, the firm topped its
previous record with $13.4 billion in profit. </p>
<p>Three-quarters of respondents said they believe that
Goldman Sachs will settle the charges, with a plurality of 40
percent saying the issue would then dissipate, compared with 34
percent who said the damage to the firm would be lasting. About
34 percent of non-U.S. respondents said they thought the bad
publicity would blow over after the firm settles the suit. </p>
<p>There''s a real break between perceptions inside the U.S.
and outside the U.S., said J. Ann Selzer, president of Des
Moines, Iowa-based Selzer  Co., which conducted the survey.
If you just look at the U.S. customers, they see these current
troubles as temporary and predict the firm will exit standing
tall. </p>
<p>Blankfein''s Future </p>
<p>The quarterly Bloomberg Global Poll of investors, traders
and analysts in six continents was conducted June 2-3. It is
based on interviews with a random sample of 1,001 Bloomberg
subscribers, representing decision makers in markets, finance
and economics. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus
3.1 percentage points. </p>
<p>While 36 percent of non-U.S. respondents said they expect
Blankfein to remain as chairman, half of those polled said they
didn''t expect any major changes to the firm''s leadership as a
result of the lawsuit. A bigger proportion of U.S. subscribers,
59 percent, didn''t expect major changes, compared with 44
percent of people outside the U.S. </p>
<p>Still, Blankfein was viewed unfavorably by 56 percent of
poll respondents, second only to BP Plc CEO Tony Hayward''s 65
percent among a list of 10 public figures that included
President Barack Obama, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. </p>
<p>Goldman''s stock, which ended New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday at $138.68, has fallen 25 percent
since the suit was filed, and 41 percent of the people surveyed
said they are generally bullish on the shares. Forty percent
said they''re generally bearish. Fifty-four percent of U.S.
investors were bullish, compared with 28 percent in Europe and
43 percent in Asia. </p>
<p>Money Machine'' </p>
<p>I''m bullish on it, I actually bought it, said
respondent Carey Chapman, treasurer of the Asheboro, North
Carolina-based bank CommunityOne, part of FNB United Corp.
They''re just a money machine, they know how to make money. </p>
<p>Much of the criticism is politically motivated, he added. </p>
<p>The Obama administration is trying to build a case
against Wall Street to push the financial legislation, Chapman
said. </p>
<p>Fallout Modest </p>
<p>Yesterday, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a panel
appointed by Congress to investigate the causes of the economic
slump, said it subpoenaed Goldman Sachs after the firm didn''t
follow its requests, deliberately producing so many documents
that investigators cannot quickly sort them. </p>
<p>Goldman said it is committed to providing the FCIC with
the information they have requested. That inquiry is separate
from the SEC''s case. </p>
<p>Spain''s Prada said the fallout from the SEC lawsuit against
Goldman Sachs would be modest. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, it''s going to be business as
usual, Prada said. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. will pay $715 million
for the rights to distribute some Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.
brands, in a new agreement prompted by the acquisition of its
largest bottler. </p>
<p>The cash payment will allow Coca-Cola to sell brands
including Dr Pepper and Canada Dry in some regions of the U.S.
and Canada for 20 years, the Atlanta-based company said today in
a statement. Dr Pepper also takes back the distribution of some
brands. </p>
<p>Dr Pepper renegotiated its distribution contracts with
Coca-Cola, the world''s largest soda maker, and PepsiCo Inc.
after both companies agreed to buy bottlers. PepsiCo paid $900
million this year to distribute some Dr Pepper drinks. The Coca-
Cola payment announced today is close to an estimate by Carlos Laboy, an analyst at Credit Suisse in New York. </p>
<p>The terms and cash amount are in-line with the previous
deal with PepsiCo, however we believe some investors expected a
higher payment to come from Coke, Laboy said today in a note.
He has a neutral recommendation on Dr Pepper stock and
doesn''t rate Coca-Cola. </p>
<p>Dr Pepper, based in Plano, Texas, fell 64 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $35.85 at 4:04 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Coca-Cola dropped 47 cents to $50.80. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola agreed to buy Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.''s North
American bottling unit in February. The distribution deal will
replace those between Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola Enterprises when
the acquisition closes later this year, Coca-Cola said. </p>
<p>Freestyle Fountain </p>
<p>The payment is lower than the $900 million estimated by
Kaumil Gajrawala, an analyst with UBS AG in New York. The
difference will be made up largely by Coca-Cola''s agreement to
give Dr Pepper access to fountain drink accounts and put Dr
Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper on its new Freestyle fountain,
Gajrawala said today in a note. He recommends buying Dr Pepper
and Coca-Cola shares. </p>
<p>Dr Pepper, in a statement, valued the Freestyle access at
$115 million to $135 million. </p>
<p>The Freestyle, a touch screen-controlled drink dispenser
that expands offerings to more than 100, will be available in at
least 500 U.S. outlets this summer, Coca-Cola said. </p>
<p>Dr Pepper said it will take back distribution of Squirt,
Canada Dry, Schweppes and Cactus Cooler sold by Coca-Cola
Enterprises in certain U.S. territories. </p>
<p>The agreement imposes new performance conditions on Coca-
Cola, Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said on a call with
reporters, declining to provide further details. Fayard also
declined to say whether the new agreement includes a change-in-
control clause that would trigger a renegotiation should Coca-
Cola spin off the bottling operations. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola bottlers distribute about 42 percent of the Dr
Pepper brand''s volume while PepsiCo distributes 39 percent,
Fayard said, citing statistics by industry newsletter Beverage
Digest. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley slashed its forecasts
for Venezuela''s economy, saying it may contract this year and
next as higher oil prices fail to stimulate business and a
tightening of controls restricts access to foreign currency. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley now forecasts gross domestic product will
shrink 6.2 percent this year and 1.2 percent in 2011, compared
with an earlier prediction for 0.3 percent growth this year and
3.5 percent expansion next year. </p>
<p>While most of Latin America, in line with the globe, has
been in recovery mode since last year, Venezuela has seen an
intensifying downturn in activity, Daniel Volberg and Giuliana
Pardelli said in a report today. Our new baseline of at least
three years of economic contraction suggests the risks to
Venezuela''s ability to honor its international financial
commitments may be on the rise. </p>
<p>Venezuela''s economy contracted 3.3 percent last year as
investment dried up following nationalizations and oil revenue
plunged on waning output and production cuts in line with OPEC
quotas. Morgan Stanley, based in New York, expects investment to
plunge 28.1 percent this year while private consumption drops
5.8 percent. </p>
<p>President Hugo Chavez on May 18 closed the unregulated
currency market that companies used to buy dollars and ordered
the central bank to oversee the trading of dollar-denominated
securities that will be used to obtain currency at a government-
set exchange rate. </p>
<p>Bolivar Devaluation </p>
<p>Chavez devalued the bolivar as much as 50 percent on Jan. 8
to close a budget deficit and to slow capital flight, creating a
multi-tiered exchange system. </p>
<p>The government''s Foreign Exchange Board pared dollar sales
at the official rates of 2.6 and 4.3 per dollar last year and
during the first three months of 2010, causing imports to
plummet 38 percent in the first quarter. </p>
<p>While Venezuela may be successful in slowing capital flight
through the new currency market, imports will likely continue to
fall, Volberg and Pardelli said. </p>
<p>Given that imports have been essential in offsetting the
multi-year deterioration in domestic supply in Venezuela, the
restrictions may prove a significant negative supply shock for
the Venezuelan economy, the analysts said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. is marketing
$716.3 million of bonds backed by commercial mortgages,
according to a person familiar with the offering. </p>
<p>The transaction, which is the second of newly issued
commercial-mortgage backed bonds to be sold this year, consists
of 36 loans on 96 properties, said the person, who declined to
be identified because terms aren''t public. </p>
<p>Sales of commercial-mortgage backed securities halted in
2008 as credit markets froze, choking off funding to property
borrowers. Even with government aid, only $3.04 billion of the
debt was issued last year, compared with $11.2 billion in 2008
and a record $232.4 billion in 2007, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC sold $309.7
million of the bonds in April. During the boom, sales grew as
large as $7.6 billion, the data show. </p>
<p>Plunging property values have made it difficult for
borrowers to secure enough financing to retire maturing debt,
with prices down 42 percent from October 2007 peaks, according
to Moody''s Investors Service. A record 7.02 percent of borrowers
are behind on payments, versus 1.87 percent a year ago,
according to Moody''s. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s offering consists of loans equal to 61.5 percent
of the value of the properties on average, the person said. In
2007, borrowers were able to take out loans equaling about 69.1
percent of a property''s value, according to Jefferies Group Inc.
data. </p>
<p>Spreads to Treasuries </p>
<p>The current ratio doesn''t seem all that much lower, but
the difference is today''s valuations, said Lisa Pendergast, an
analyst at Jefferies in Stamford, Connecticut. Property values
are no longer being driven by overly optimistic expectations on
cash flow and cheap and plentiful sources of capital. </p>
<p>Top-rated commercial-mortgage backed securities yield about
3.09 percentage points more than Treasuries, compared with 8.03
percentage points over the benchmark a year ago, according to
Barclays PLC data. Lower spreads mean banks can offer more
attractive financing to borrowers. </p>
<p>The largest top-rated portion of the RBS offering priced to
yield 0.9 percentage points more than the benchmark swap rate as
tighter underwriting standards give investors more confidence in
the mortgages being bundled into securities being sold now
compared with those written in 2007. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was attacked

that plays tricks carefully designed to gamble with Chinese
enterprises, the Financial Times reported. </p>
<p>The Chinese newspaper''s article, which alleged that Goldman

<p>China Youth Daily said Goldman has made an excessive amount

transactions and making its own private-equity investments,

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s biggest
software maker, plans to sell $1.15 billion of convertible
senior notes due in 2013 and will use the proceeds to repay
short-term debt. </p>
<p>Microsoft may grant underwriters an option to buy an
additional $100 million of the notes, the Redmond, Washington-
based company said today in a statement. The debt received
ratings of Aaa from Moody''s Investors Service and AAA from
Standard  Poor''s. </p>
<p>The proceeds will let Microsoft retire some of its
commercial paper. As of March 31, it had $2.25 billion of short-
term debt outstanding, according to a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The notes give Microsoft
more stability with debt at a fixed rate, compared with the more
volatile interest of short-term paper. Convertible notes allow
investors to exchange debt into common stock at a pre-
established rate under specified conditions. </p>
<p>The commercial paper market in the last few years has
done some backflips no one would have expected, at times
freezing or seizing up entirely, said Michael Holland, who
oversees more than $4 billion, including Microsoft shares, as
chairman of Holland  Co. in New York. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s action indicates the company believes the
convertible market is an attractive place to sell now. If I
owned some convertibles now, I''d be looking to sell them, he
said. </p>
<p>Microsoft issued $3.75 billion of 5-, 10- and 30-year debt
in May 2009 as it tapped the corporate bond market for the first
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

2014 traded at 103.936 cents on the dollar to yield 1.916
percent at 11:01 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond

2.9 percent after shrinking 7.9 percent in 2009, the biggest

<p>Australian hedge fund Basis Capital
sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for $1 billion in a Manhattan
court, claiming it was forced into insolvency after buying
mortgage-linked securities that the New York-based firm created
and one of its executives termed one shi**y deal. </p>
<p>The lawsuit by Basis Capital''s Basis Yield Alpha Fund was
filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court over Goldman Sachs''s
sale of the now notorious Timberwolf collateralized debt
obligation, Basis said in a statement. </p>
<p>Goldman was pressuring investors to take the risk of
toxic securities off its books with knowingly false sales
pitches, Eric Lewis, the lawyer for Basis Capital, said in the
statement. Goldman should be called to account. </p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs on April 16, alleging fraud tied to a CDO known as Abacus
2007-AC1. Later that month, U.S. Senate lawmakers released
internal Goldman Sachs e-mails in which Thomas K. Montag, former
head of sales and trading in the Americas at Goldman Sachs,
called the Timberwolf Ltd. CDO one shi**y deal. </p>
<p>In its securities-fraud complaint, Basis said that this e-
mail was sent in the same week that it was closing its deal with
Goldman Sachs to purchase exposure to Timberwolf through credit
default swaps. The company asked for more than $1 billion in
compensatory and punitive damages. </p>
<p>Misguided Attempt'' </p>
<p>The lawsuit is a misguided attempt by Basis, a hedge fund
that was one of the world''s most experienced CDO investors, to
shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs, the investment
bank said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Basis, which invested $78 million in Timberwolf, said in
its complaint that Goldman Sachs falsely claimed in June 2007
that the market for securities such as Timberwolf had stabilized
and that the investment was a good entry point. </p>
<p>All of these representations were knowingly false,
Basis said in its statement. </p>
<p>Within 2 1/2 weeks of its investment in the Timberwolf CDO,
Goldman Sachs began to make significant margin calls on
Basis and forced the firm into insolvency, Basis said. </p>
<p>Timberwolf held pieces of other CDOs, according to a
statement from the U.S. Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations in April. Timberwolf also included optimistic
side-bets on the performance of CDOs, derivatives in which the
firm took the opposite pessimistic side in many cases, the
panel said. </p>
<p>Senator''s Comments </p>
<p>The CDO was among the securities that Goldman Sachs sold to
clients after deciding the New York-based firm needed to reduce
its mortgage holdings, said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan
Democrat. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs denied it cheated Basis. </p>
<p>At the time of the Timberwolf transaction, Basis
specifically stated that it would not place any reliance on
Goldman Sachs, and this decision formed part of the agreement
Basis signed, the bank said in its statement. </p>
<p>Basis made its investment at market levels that were
substantially below the face value of the securities and
consistent with where other investors were purchasing the same
Timberwolf securities during the same time, Goldman Sachs said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs lost several hundred millions of dollars of
its money from its exposure to Timberwolf, according to its
statement. </p>
<p>The Yield Alpha Fund, formerly Basis Capital''s second
biggest, filed for bankruptcy protection in the Cayman Islands
in August 2007 after banks cut the value of its investments in
collateralized debt obligations, triggering margin calls the
fund was unable to meet. That came a month after investors in
two Bear Stearns Cos. hedge funds were told there was no value
left, wiping out the $1.6 billion initially invested. </p>
<p>The case is Basis Yield v. Goldman Sachs, 1:10-cv-04537,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s biggest
software maker, raised $1.15 billion of interest-free financing
from its first sale of convertible bonds. </p>
<p>The senior notes, which don''t pay a coupon and will be
redeemed at face value, can be handed over for shares when
Microsoft stock rises to about $33.40, a 33 percent increase
from June 8, according to a statement. The bonds, which Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft may redeem in cash, stock or both,
can''t be converted until March 2013 except in certain
circumstances, and they mature in June that year. </p>
<p>Microsoft is the only issuer of convertible bonds with a
top rating from Moody''s Investors Service and Standard  Poor''s,
allowing it to benefit from investors seeking to boost the
average credit rankings of their funds. Convertible bonds are
typically sold by companies that are unrated or graded below
BBB-, the lowest investment grade, by SP and Baa3 by Moody''s. </p>
<p>Really, with the zero coupon this didn''t look that
attractive to us, said Anja Eijking, who manages the
equivalent of about $2 billion in global equity-linked
securities at FC Netherlands BV in Amsterdam and didn''t order
the bonds. You''d need a strong view on the stock appreciating.
Basically, this is cheap financing for the issuer. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. is shuttering five
ESPN Zone restaurants, saying the economics of the business
became too challenging. </p>
<p>Locations in Baltimore, Chicago, Las Vegas, New York and
Washington will close June 16, ESPN said today in an e-mailed
statement. The cable sports network is controlled by Burbank,
California-based Disney, </p>
<p>ESPN Zone is a sports-themed restaurant chain started 12
years ago by Disney. It will stay open in Los Angeles and
Anaheim, California, where the restaurants are run by Anschutz
Entertainment Group and Zone Enterprises, ESPN said. </p>
<p>This was a very difficult decision to make Rick
Alessandri, senior vice president at the cable sports network,
said in an interview. But it was the right decision to make.
It comes as Disney is opening a new retail store in New York''s
Times Square. </p>
<p>Each restaurant was split into three sections, according to
Disney regulatory filings: a studio grill for dining, a
screening room for watching ESPN sports coverage and a
sports arena for playing interactive games. </p>
<p>The restaurants averaged about 30,000 square feet, large by
industry standards, Alessandri said. The 50,000-square-foot
location in Times Square was the biggest, and the restaurant in
Baltimore was the chain''s first, he said. </p>
<p>ESPN wouldn''t release revenue or other financial
information about the chain. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s biggest media company, gained 22 cents
to $33.37 at 2:12 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Before today, the shares had climbed 2.8 percent this
year. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley hired Michael V. Johnson, a Deutsche Bank AG investment banker, to advise oil and
gas exploration and production companies, a person briefed on
the plans said. </p>
<p>Johnson will join as a managing director in the energy
investment-banking group this year, said the person, who spoke
on condition of anonymity because Johnson hasn''t started yet.
Deutsche Bank spokesman John Gallagher confirmed the departure.
Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney said she couldn''t
comment. </p>
<p>Johnson is among at least three senior Deutsche Bank
investment bankers with clients in the energy industry to be
hired by rivals as the Frankfurt-based company leads financial
firms in advising oil and gas mergers this year. James Denaut
and Michael B. Hill are leaving for Tokyo-based Nomura, ranked
22nd, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. New York-based
Morgan Stanley is ranked eighth. </p>
<p>Johnson was deputy head of global banking for the Americas
at Deutsche Bank until last year, when he became a senior client
coverage officer in New York. He joined the company in 2001
after stints as chief financial officer for a technology startup
and as a banker at firms including Donaldson, Lufkin  Jenrette. </p>
<p>He advised Oklahoma City-based SandRidge Energy Inc. when
it agreed in April to buy Arena Resources Inc. for $1.6 billion. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is the world''s fourth-biggest merger adviser
across all industries so far this year, and Deutsche Bank is

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. agreed to set up
an investment banking joint venture in China with First Capital
Securities Co., paving the way for the U.S. bank to manage
domestic share sales in China. </p>
<p>Shenzhen-based First Capital and JPMorgan signed the
agreement today following a memorandum of understanding in March,
the New York-based company said in a press release today. The
venture, to be 33 percent owned by JPMorgan, requires regulatory
approval, it said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the world''s biggest manager of equity sales this
year, aims to close the gap with rivals in China including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG after having lagged behind
in forming ventures. Tying up with a local firm is a
prerequisite for arranging share sales in China, the world''s
biggest market for initial public offerings in 2009. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG last year won approval to form a venture
with Shanxi Securities Co. Credit Suisse Group AG cleared the
hurdle in 2008. CSLA Asia-Pacific Markets''s securities venture
also won approval to offer brokerage services that year, after
operating in the country for about five years. </p>
<p>First Capital, established a decade ago, offers corporate
finance, fixed income, merger-and-acquisition, securities
brokerage and asset management services. It has branches in 12
Chinese cities, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Biggest IPO Market </p>
<p>Companies raised 209 billion yuan ($31 billion) in IPOs in
Shanghai and Shenzhen last year, making China the world''s
biggest market for first-time stock sales even after the
securities regulator blocked offerings in the first half. </p>
<p>JPMorgan spent four years in failed talks with Bohai
Securities Co. and Liaoning Securities Co., Asia-Pacific Chief
Executive Officer Gaby Abdelnour said in a March 2 interview. </p>
<p>The bank now has asset management and futures and options
ventures and operates a locally incorporated bank in China. It
must wait five-years to qualify for a brokerage license under
rules set by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. </p>
<p>First Capital was ranked 33rd among underwriters in China
last year after it arranged 6.76 billion yuan in stock and bond
sales, according to the Securities Association of China. The
ranking made the firm eligible to form a partnership with a
foreign bank, under the nation''s securities laws. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President
Gary Cohn said he sees no signs of a resolution to the
Securities and Exchange Commission''s fraud claims against the
firm. </p>
<p>There''s no indications of anything at this point, Cohn
told reporters at a conference in Montreal today. </p>
<p>Cohn''s comments follow news that the SEC is probing a
second Goldman Sachs collateralized debt obligation in addition
to the Abacus transaction at the center of the SEC''s suit. Asked
about the new investigation, Cohn, 49, told reporters: I read
it in the newspaper this morning, like you did. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s stock fell as much as 4 percent today to
its lowest in more than a year after a person familiar with the
matter said the SEC is looking into the firm''s 2006 sale of a
CDO called Hudson Mezzanine. While the inquiries may not lead to
any action, the news came less than a week after the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission subpoenaed New York-based Goldman
Sachs for information and an Australian hedge fund sued the
firm. </p>

4:25 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after
dropping as low as $131.30. The last time the shares closed

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s $2
billion Hudson Mezzanine collateralized debt obligation, sold in
2006, is the target of a probe by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>The inquiry into the CDO may not lead to any additional
actions against the New York-based securities firm, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the investigation
isn''t public. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment, as did SEC spokesman John Nester. The
Financial Times reported the probe yesterday. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs shares have fallen 26 percent since the SEC
filed a fraud lawsuit against the firm on April 16 that related
to its 2007 sale of a CDO called Abacus. Senator Carl Levin, a
Michigan Democrat, said in April that Goldman Sachs''s sales of
CDOs such as Hudson raised a real ethical issue. </p>
<p>The ethical issue is valid, but Goldman isn''t the only
investment bank that sold CDOs, said Ambrose Chang, a Hong
Kong-based fund manager at Daiwa SB Investments HK Ltd. After
the financial crisis, all Wall Street banks'' reputations have
been fundamentally damaged. </p>
<p>In the Abacus suit, the SEC said Goldman Sachs and one of
its employees, Fabrice Tourre, didn''t disclose to investors the
role played by hedge fund Paulson  Co. in devising and betting
against the securities. Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing on
the Abacus CDO and said it will fight the SEC''s case. </p>
<p>Hedge Fund Suit </p>
<p>CDOs parcel fixed-income assets such as bonds or loans and
slice them into new securities of varying risks, providing
higher returns than other investments of the same rating. </p>
<p>In a separate case, Goldman Sachs was sued by Australian
hedge fund Basis Capital for $1 billion. In the suit, filed
yesterday in Manhattan federal court, Basis claims it was forced
into insolvency after buying mortgage-linked securities that the
firm created and one of its executives termed one shi**y deal. </p>
<p>The lawsuit is a misguided attempt by Basis, a hedge fund
that was one of the world''s most experienced CDO investors, to
shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs
said in a statement. </p>
<p>The U.S. Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
led by Levin, released e-mails in April related to Goldman
Sachs''s mortgage-linked deals, including the Hudson Mezzanine
transaction. In one October 2006 e-mail, a Goldman Sachs
employee describes how the Hudson deal might be viewed by
investors as junk. </p>
<p>Hudson Mezzanine </p>
<p>The Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1 CDO contained credit default
swaps that referenced $2 billion in subprime, BBB-rated
residential mortgage-backed securities, according to the
documents released by Levin''s committee. While Goldman Sachs
selected the assets in the deal, the firm was also the only
investor buying credit protection on the entire transaction, the
documents show. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs created and sold the Hudson CDO in late 2006,
near the time documents released by Levin show senior executives
wanted to reduce the firm''s exposure to subprime mortgages. </p>
<p>The CDO imploded within two years. Your clients lost;
Goldman profited, Levin said in an April 27 hearing during
which he questioned Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein about the Hudson deal and other CDOs. To go out and
sell these securities to people and then bet against those same
securities, it seems to me, is a fundamental conflict of
interest and is -- raises a real ethical issue. </p>
<p>Blankfein responded that we are one of the largest client
franchises in market-making in these kinds of activities we''re
talking about and that they know our activities, and they
understand what market-making is. </p>
<p>While Goldman Sachs was short on the Hudson Mezzanine CDO,
meaning it stood to gain from a collapse because of the credit
protection it had purchased, a marketing document for the deal
released by Levin''s committee states that Goldman Sachs has
aligned incentives with the Hudson program. </p>
<p>In a short sale, an investor bets the value of a security
will decline. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hired law
firm Boies, Schiller  Flexner LLP to defend the company against
a $1 billion lawsuit filed by Australian hedge fund Basis
Capital this week, said a person briefed on the matter. </p>
<p>The law firm, founded by David Boies and Jonathan Schiller
in 1997, has handled Wall Street litigation including the Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy case. The person declined to
be identified because the hiring hasn''t been made public. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, and Dawn Schneider at Boies, Schiller said they couldn''t
comment. Reuters reported the firm was hired earlier today. </p>
<p>The June 9 lawsuit by Basis Capital''s Basis Yield Alpha
Fund focuses on Goldman Sachs''s sale of the now notorious
Timberwolf collateralized debt obligation, Basis said in a
statement. The suit filed in Manhattan federal court says the
fund was forced into insolvency after buying mortgage-linked
securities created by Goldman Sachs, in what one of its own
executives described internally as a shi**y deal. </p>
<p>Boies, Schiller joins a growing list of firms providing
legal and regulatory advice to Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable firm in Wall Street history, which was sued by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in April over its marketing
of another CDO known as Abacus. </p>
<p>Richard H. Klapper at Sullivan  Cromwell LLP is among the
partners leading Goldman Sachs''s defense against the SEC
lawsuit. The firm also received advice ahead of a U.S. Senate
subcommittee hearing in April from K. Lee Blalack II of
O''Melveny  Myers LLP, who has worked as the subcommittee''s
chief counsel and staff director. </p>
<p>Skadden Arps </p>
<p>Gregory Craig, President Barack Obama''s former White House
counsel, is now the partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher 
Flom LLP assigned to advise Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Last month, Goldman Sachs considered hiring law firm Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison LLP to bolster its legal
team, before deciding against it, a person familiar with the
matter said at the time. </p>
<p>In a June 9 statement about the Timberwolf lawsuit, Goldman
Sachs called it a misguided attempt by Basis, a hedge fund
that was one of the world''s most experienced CDO investors, to
shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, once the biggest
property investor among Wall Street banks, raised $4.7 billion
for a new global real estate fund, less than half its target
before the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Some of the New York-based firm''s largest institutional
clients didn''t put money in the new fund after market losses.
The Washington State Investment Board, which placed $880 million
in two prior Morgan Stanley property funds, decided against
committing new capital. </p>
<p>We will not be investing in the new fund because it is
global including U.S. and we already have a large U.S.
concentration, Liz Mendizabal, spokeswoman for the Olympia-
based pension board, said in an e-mail today. </p>
<p>Many investors have shied away from real estate deals amid
falling property values and scarcer debt financing. Morgan
Stanley had hoped to raise $10 billion for the fund, according
to minutes from a June 2008 meeting of the Contra Costa County
Employees'' Retirement Association. Still, the fund is the
largest to close since 2008. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund VII will invest in the U.S.
and internationally, said company spokeswoman Alyson Barnes,
noting that the firm supplied less than 10 percent of the
capital. </p>
<p>Significant'' Opportunities </p>
<p>The real estate fund will take advantage of the
significant investment opportunities this part of the real
estate cycle presents to us, Morgan Stanley said in a
statement. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms may be barred from owning and investing
in hedge funds and private equity under the so-called Volcker
rule, part of the Senate''s financial reform bill. Lawmakers from
the House and Senate are merging bills passed by the two
chambers into a single measure for President Barack Obama''s
signature. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, which managed $46.4 billion of real estate
assets for clients as of March 31, suffered losses in its last
fund. The firm told investors this year that it expects to lose
$5.4 billion of an $8.8 billion real estate fund from 2007, a
person familiar with the situation said in April. </p>
<p>Concord, California-based Contra Costa County Employees''
Retirement Association rescinded its decision to invest $75
million in the new fund in February 2009, citing market risk and
staff departures at Morgan Stanley. New Jersey''s pension fund
also decided not to pursue a $150 million potential investment. </p>
<p>John Klopp </p>
<p>To bolster its real estate effort, Morgan Stanley named
John Klopp as head of investing in Americas real estate and
global property debt in February, and its Alternative Investment
Partners fund of funds business raised $370 million for a fund
focused on private-equity real estate funds. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley recorded about $4.4 billion in real estate
losses in 2008 and 2009. In April, the firm booked a $932
million loss on its investment in Revel Entertainment Group LLC,
the developer of an unfinished casino resort in Atlantic City,
New Jersey. In November, Morgan Stanley agreed to hand over
Crescent Real Estate Equities to Barclays Capital, ending its
obligation on a $2 billion loan. </p>
<p>The firm sent a fourth-quarter update to clients of its
Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund VI International showing it was
likely to recover $3.4 billion of its investments, the person
said in April. The California State Teachers'' Retirement
System''s $440 million investment in the fund has declined 86
percent as of Sept. 30, 2009, according to figures provided by
spokeswoman Sherry Reser. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. are expected to lead General Motors Co.''s initial public
offering that may have the U.S. reducing its ownership as soon
as this year, people familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>At least five investment banks competed to handle the sale,
which may be worth as much as $12 billion, making it the second-
largest in a decade. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, both based in
New York, would be responsible for writing the prospectus and
promoting the shares to potential investors, said two people who
asked not to be identified because the decision isn''t final. </p>
<p>Returning GM to public ownership will allow the U.S. to
reduce its 61 percent stake and harvest returns on its $50
billion investment in the nation''s largest automaker. Choosing a
lead bank in June means Detroit-based GM may hold an offering in
the fourth quarter, people familiar with the matter have said. </p>
<p>The government wants out as quickly as possible, but they
also want to tell the public it''s a good deal, David Cole,
chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, said in an interview. They will want to be out before
the presidential election in 2012. </p>
<p>Mark Paustenbach, a spokesman for the Treasury, declined to
comment, citing a department statement yesterday that said
federal securities laws preclude it from discussing the identity
of potential underwriters before a registration statement is
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A GM
spokeswoman, Renee Rashid-Merem, also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Automotive Lending </p>
<p>GM Chief Executive Officer Ed Whitacre wants the company to
have an automotive-lending unit before going public, people
familiar with the plan have said. GM hasn''t had such a
subsidiary since former CEO Rick Wagoner sold 51 percent of GMAC
to private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP in 2006. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said May 17 the
automaker''s first-quarter net profit of $865 million was a
good, useful step toward an initial offering. He said that
the stock sale may not come until 2011 and that it wouldn''t be
necessary to control a financing unit before going public. </p>
<p>The banks'' expected selection was reported earlier by the
Wall Street Journal. </p>
<p>GM''s choice will be subject to Treasury''s agreement that
the selection is reasonable, the government said yesterday in a
statement. The Treasury and GM are expected to sell shares, and
other holders may participate, the government said. </p>
<p>IPO Timing </p>
<p>The timing of the offering will depend on GM''s
profitability, the health of the economy and the state of
capital markets, said three people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>It will happen when the markets are ready and when the
company is ready, Liddell said May 17 on a conference call. </p>
<p>The sale may raise as much as $12 billion, an estimate by
Independent International Investment Research Plc showed. </p>
<p>GM''s equity is worth $70 billion, according to a May 20
report by Eric Selle, a JPMorgan debt analyst who projects a
return of 47 cents on the dollar for holders of bonds issued by
GM''s predecessor, General Motors Corp., that will be converted
to stock and warrants in new GM. At today''s bond prices, GM''s
implied equity value is about $47 billion. </p>
<p>Since 1999, four U.S. IPOs have exceeded $5 billion -- Visa
Inc.''s $19.7 billion deal in 2008, ATT Wireless Group''s $10.6
billion offering in 2000, Kraft Foods Inc.''s $8.68 billion deal
in 2001 and United Parcel Service Inc.''s $5.47 billion sale in
1999, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The size of the sale hasn''t been determined yet, said one
person familiar with the plan. </p>
<p>Bankruptcy Emergence </p>
<p>GM emerged from bankruptcy in July with its ownership split
between the old bondholders, the U.S., Canada and a trust to
cover health care for union retirees. </p>
<p>The U.S. government''s current net investment in the
automaker is $42.2 billion, according to a senior official in
President Barack Obama''s administration. GM has repaid $6.7
billion in loans and paid $600 million in interest and
dividends. The U.S. also holds $2.1 billion in the company''s
preferred shares. </p>
<p>When we did this restructuring we never expected a full
recovery of our investment, Steven Rattner, the former head of
Obama''s automotive task force, said May 10 in Detroit. If it
ends up costing us $10 billion, we should consider it a
success. </p>
<p>For the Treasury to break even, the value of GM would need
to rise to about $80 billion after bondholders and the UAW''s
health-care trust exercise stock warrants that dilute the U.S.
ownership. </p>
<p>Lazard Advice </p>
<p>The Treasury has hired Lazard Ltd. for $500,000 a month to
advise on selling its stake, according to a document on the
department''s website. Evercore Partners Inc. also is advising GM
on the selection, a person familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>GM and Treasury officials met with senior executives from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc.,
JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley last month in Washington about
hiring a lead bank, said one person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The Treasury said yesterday that it will determine the
underwriters'' fees, which finance professors at Cornell
University and Georgetown estimate may be as low as 2 percent.
That would be less than any U.S. IPO over $5 billion since 1999,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>General Motors is a government entity now, and the banks
that may underwrite the deal were government entities or got
help from the government, said William Smith, president of New
York-based Smith Asset Management, which used to own shares of
GM. I imagine with the IPO they''ll do the politically correct
thing and keep fees down. </p>
<p>Choosing a lead underwriter now allows GM to file an S-1
initial registration form as soon as July and sell shares in
October or November, a person familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>GM management has been preparing for an IPO so they will be
ready whenever the timing is right, said a GM executive who
asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. </p>
<p>Whitacre was installed as chairman by Obama''s task force
when it replaced more than half of the directors in July. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. sold $716.3
million of bonds backed by commercial mortgages in the second
offering of the debt this year, according to a person familiar
with the transaction. </p>
<p>The largest top-rated portion, maturing in 4.53 years,
yields 140 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
aren''t public. The AAA rated slice maturing in about 9.53 years
yields 165 basis points over the benchmark, the person said. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>Sales of commercial-mortgage backed securities halted in
2008 as credit markets froze, choking off funding to property
borrowers. Even with government aid, only $3.04 billion of the
debt was issued last year, compared with $11.2 billion in 2008
and a record $232.4 billion in 2007, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC sold $309.7 million of the
bonds in April, the first issue to pool loans from multiple
borrowers since June 2008. </p>
<p>Top-rated securities tied to commercial property loans
yield about 3.04 percentage points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, compared with 2.19 percentage points over Treasuries
on April 16, then a 22-month low, according to Barclays Plc
data. Spreads have widened on concern that the European
sovereign debt crisis may slow global economic growth. </p>

<p>Losses in the biggest U.S. banks and
brokerages, whose share prices are more linked to the Standard 
Poor''s 500 Index than at any time in seven years, suggest the
benchmark measure of American equities may extend its seven-week
slump, according to Concept Capital''s John Kolovos. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reached $192.28 on Oct. 14, the
highest level since May 2008, and $184.46 on April 14 before
closing at $133.77 yesterday -- forming a rounding-top pattern
also seen in JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley --
suggesting the SP 500 faces losses, he said. The measure has
retreated 11 percent since April 23. </p>
<p>As long as these guys continue to move lower, mom and pop
or any big institutions will not be inclined to head into
equities, said Kolovos, co-head of technical analysis research
for the New York-based firm. We''re using these stocks as a
barometer. </p>
<p>A slowdown in an equity rally that eventually turns into
losses is called a rounding top by technical analysts, who base
forecasts on historical price fluctuations. Chart watchers, such
as Kolovos, say the pattern indicates stocks face more declines
in the future. </p>
<p>Financial companies in the SP 500 are moving in line with
the U.S. equity benchmark. Using 30 days of trading data, the
correlation coefficient between the industry and the broader
stock index rose to 0.9724 yesterday, meaning price fluctuations
are the most similar since April 2003, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Readings of 1 show the measures are
rising or falling in lockstep. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings for 2009, has
fallen 21 percent to $133.77 this year after U.S. regulators
sued the company for fraud related to mortgage securities.
Morgan Stanley is down 14 percent to $25.59, while JPMorgan lost
8.1 percent to $38.29 in 2010. All three banks are based in New
York. The SP 500 has slipped 2.5 percent. </p>

<p>Note to Lloyd Blankfein: Imagine,
for a moment, what would happen if a cardiac surgeon were paid
like a Wall Street banker in 2006. </p>
<p>For each operation, the doctor would earn more, regardless
of the risk to the patient, writes Suzanne McGee in Chasing
Goldman Sachs. The greater the risk, in fact, the higher the
fee. Should half his patients die the next year, the hospital
might dismiss the surgeon -- with a golden handshake. He could
then take up a post elsewhere or set up his own practice. </p>
<p>Wall Street doesn''t have to purchase malpractice
insurance, says McGee in this disturbing account of how the
big boys ran amok and began blowing up the money grid. There
isn''t even a sense that there is a duty of care to the patient''
-- whether that patient is the client or the financial system. </p>
<p>McGee, a contributing editor at Barron''s, isn''t out to bury Goldman Sachs Group Inc. or Blankfein, its chief executive
officer. Her goal is, rather, to show how Wall Street bankers
became preoccupied with their own short-term interests and
drifted away from their raison d''etre -- to funnel capital from
investors to companies that need it. </p>
<p>They were, by this account, almost predestined to do so
from the moment the Securities and Exchange Commission banned
fixed trading commissions in the stock market on May 1, 1975.
The prohibition turned their comfy business model upside-down:
Mayday, they called it, hinting at their distress level. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. is investigating the
cause and size of an oil pipeline leak in the foothills of Salt
Lake City after shutting the line. </p>
<p>Neither the source of the leak or the quantity of oil
released has been determined at this time, said Chevron
spokesman Sean Comey in an e-mail statement. The company was
notified of the leak at around 8:20 p.m. U.S. central time
yesterday, and workers were dispatched to shut the line and
start containment of the spill, he said. </p>
<p>Initial estimates said around 500 barrels seeped from the
10-inch line that has a capacity of about 15,000 barrels a day,
according to Lisa Harrison Smith, a spokeswoman for Mayor Ralph Becker, citing Chevron data. </p>
<p>Chevron told Smith they shut the line yesterday and were
estimating a leak of about 50 gallons a minute before it was
turned off, she said. </p>
<p>Crews placed booms in waterways, including the Jordan
River, to minimize downstream impact, the mayor''s office
said in a release yesterday. </p>
<p>A boom was also laced in a drainage creek, said Comey.
Wildlife rehabilitation experts have been engaged and some
birds have been washed at the Salt Lake City zoo, he said. </p>
<p>The pipeline was carrying crude oil from Colorado into the
Salt Lake Valley to its refinery, Smith said. Chevron''s Salt
Lake City plant can process 45,000 barrels a day of crude,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>They haven''t given a firm timeline on when they''ll
restart the line, Smith said. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. should face a new
trial for allegedly sanctioning beatings and shootings of
Nigerian protesters in 1998 because jurors who cleared the
company in 2008 were given erroneous instructions, lawyers for
protesters argued to a U.S. appeals court today. </p>
<p>A federal court jury was told, incorrectly, that the
protesters had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that company-
paid soldiers used excessive force against those who boarded
Chevron''s oil drilling platform located nine miles offshore of
the Niger Delta, said Theresa Traber, an attorney for the
Nigerians and their families. </p>
<p>Instead, it was Chevron''s burden to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the peaceful protesters, who were unarmed
and running away with arms raised when shots were fired, had
committed crimes that justified the type of force used by the
soldiers, Traber told the three-judge appellate panel at today''s
hearing in San Francisco. The Nigerians were protesting over
jobs and alleged environmental damage to the area. </p>
<p>This was a major error that deprived the plaintiffs of
the fair trial they should have had on their battery claims,
Traber said. </p>
<p>Two men were killed, others were shot and beaten and one
man was hung by his wrists and tortured after a protest about
jobs and alleged environmental damage to the area, according to
a 1999 lawsuit against Chevron. Nineteen Nigerians sued the
company claiming it was liable for the actions of the Nigerian
soldiers it hired to provide security for the oil platform. </p>
<p>150 Workers </p>
<p>Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, said at trial
that villagers invaded the platform and held 150 workers hostage
for ransom. They had knives, prevented workers from leaving the
platform and threatened to set it on fire, the jury was told.
The company said the soldiers acted in self-defense and denied
directing their conduct. </p>
<p>Craig Stewart, an attorney at Jones Day representing
Chevron today, told the judges that the jury was given proper
instructions by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, who presided
over the trial. Both sides had agreed that Nigerian law would be
applied to the battery claims by protesters, he said. </p>
<p>Nigerian law, like California law, like federal law, puts
the burden on plaintiffs to prove that the force was
excessive, Stewart said. </p>
<p>Jury Cleared Chevron </p>
<p>After almost 10 years of trial court proceedings, the case
went before a jury in October 2008. The jury cleared Chevron,
the second-largest U.S. oil company, of wrongful death, torture,
assault, battery and negligence claims. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the protesters appealed the verdict to the
federal appeals court in San Francisco. The judges took the
matter under submission and didn''t say when they would issue a
decision. A ruling in favor of the protesters could lead to a
retrial on battery claims of three Nigerians injured and the
family of a man who was killed in the attacks. </p>
<p>We respect the rulings made by Judge Illston leading up
to and during the 5-week trial and believe that no errors were
made, said Morgan Crinklaw, a Chevron spokesman, in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The case is Larry Bowoto v. Chevron, 09-15641, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco). </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp., looking to boost
profit and sales in its Xbox video-game unit, plans to start
selling a motion-controlled device called Kinect on Nov. 4 that
lets console users direct action by moving their bodies. </p>
<p>The device, demonstrated with several game titles in a
University of Southern California basketball arena yesterday,
will also support video chat. The company also unveiled an
exclusive deal with Walt Disney Co.''s ESPN to put live sports
events on the Xbox Live online game service, Microsoft said at a
Los Angeles press conference today. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the No. 2 console seller behind Nintendo Co., is
looking to reinvigorate demand as the industry copes with an 11
percent sales decline this year in the U.S., according to data
from NPD Group Inc. Kinect may add $1.6 billion to revenue in
the fiscal year starting July 1 and $2 billion in the year after
that, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>It is unlike anything you have ever experienced before,
Microsoft Senior Vice President Don Mattrick, who oversees the
Xbox group, said at the press conference. The system brings
your living room to life. </p>
<p>Kinect, previously known as Project Natal, also will let
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft extend the life of its Xbox
360 console, Sarah Friar, a Goldman Sachs analyst, said in a
note. Since new machines typically lose money for the first few
years, a longer shelf life should help Microsoft improve profit
in a division that has lost $8.6 billion since 1999, according
to estimates from Katherine Egbert, an analyst with Jefferies 
Co. in San Francisco. </p>
<p>Playing Catch-Up </p>
<p>Microsoft''s first motion-sensing games come four years
after Nintendo started selling the Wii motion-activated system,
which helped the Kyoto-based company take the lead in console
sales. Sony Corp., maker of the PlayStation 3 console, will
demonstrate its Move motion-controller this week. </p>
<p>While Kinect is geared toward family play, Microsoft also
showed off titles for traditional gamers. Activision Blizzard
Inc. played clips of its battle franchise Call of Duty to be
released later this year, and Microsoft and the Epic Games Inc.
previewed their new Gears of War title. </p>
<p>Microsoft will make 3,500 live sporting events from ESPN
available to customers who buy its Xbox Live gold membership.
The programming will include college football and basketball,
Major League Baseball and soccer. </p>
<p>Microsoft said it now has 25 million members for Xbox Live.
The company has previously said that about half of Xbox Live
members pay for the service. </p>
<p>The company also will start shipping a new Xbox machine
today. The product has a sleeker design, built-in Wi-Fi and is
less noisy than the earlier model. The machine will cost
$299.99, the same as the old model. </p>
<p>Nintendo sold 277,200 Wii consoles in the U.S. in April,
compared with shipments of 185,400 Xbox 360s and 180,800
PlayStation 3s, according to NPD. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and
ConocoPhillips, the largest U.S. oil companies, will ask
lawmakers not to punish them for the human and environmental
damage inflicted by BP Plc''s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. </p>
<p>Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, Chevron CEO
John Watson and James Mulva, CEO of ConocoPhillips, are
scheduled to appear tomorrow before a House Energy and Commerce
Committee panel examining offshore drilling safety and U.S.
energy policy. </p>
<p>The hearing presents the U.S. oil CEOs with an opportunity
to distance their companies from BP, said Anthony Sabino, who
teaches oil and natural-gas law at St. John''s University in New
York. BP has lost 43 percent of its market value since the
disaster and has been excoriated by President Barack Obama for
repeated failures to cap the leaking well. </p>
<p>A crucifixion of the whole oil industry for the sins of
BP in the form of a ban on deep-water drilling isn''t a good idea
because look at all the people it''s going to put out of work,
Sabino said. Exxon and ConocoPhillips will stress their own
safety records to make that case. </p>
<p>Since an April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig that killed 11 workers, more than 50 million
gallons of crude have poured into the Gulf from a BP-owned well,
based on calculations from a government panel. </p>
<p>Obama Meeting </p>
<p>The U.S. government has intensified pressure on BP to stop
the spill and pay for damages. Obama has asked to meet June 16
with BP''s chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, and other company
officials. BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward will appear
before the House Energy and Commerce oversight committee the
following day. </p>
<p>The oil company CEOs have been asked to testify tomorrow
about the spill''s effect on U.S. energy policy, Eben Burnham-
Snyder, a spokesman for Representative Edward Markey, said June
9. Markey is a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the
subcommittee holding the hearing. </p>
<p>The executives may also be pressed to explain dividend
payouts and share buyback programs that have dwarfed their
investments in alternatives to petroleum, such as solar and
wind, according to a June 12 memorandum written by Congressional
staff and distributed to lawmakers who will participate in
tomorrow''s hearing. </p>
<p>Executive Pleas </p>
<p>Tillerson, Watson and Mulva probably will ask lawmakers to
avoid changes in offshore drilling rules that could discourage
exploration in U.S. territorial waters without making meaningful
contributions to safety, said Gianna Bern, president of
Brookshire Advisory  Research Inc. in Flossmoor, Illinois,
which advises oil companies on strategy and risk management. </p>
<p>Tillerson will tell lawmakers that an investigation needs
to determine if BP took risks beyond industry norms,
according to prepared remarks he''s scheduled to deliver during
tomorrow''s hearing. Proper well design, redundant safety systems
and regular maintenance and tests help mitigate the risks
involved in drilling miles below sea level for oil and natural
gas, he said. </p>
<p>Kurt Glaubitz, a spokesman for Chevron, based in San Ramon,
California, said he couldn''t immediately comment. Nancy Turner,
a spokeswoman for Houston-based ConocoPhillips, said in an e-
mail that the company wouldn''t release Mulva''s prepared remarks. </p>
<p>More than 30 deep-water rigs have been ordered to cease
drilling off the coasts of Louisiana and Texas for at least six
months while federal officials conduct a review of offshore
safety practices. The Gulf accounts for 30 percent of U.S. oil
production, according to the Energy Information Administration. </p>
<p>Drilling Pause </p>
<p>The drilling halt may cut oil production in the Gulf by as
much as 11 percent next year, said Paul Cheng, a Barclays
Capital analyst. </p>
<p>These executives need to explain to the politicians that
if you permanently shut us down in the deep water it''s going to
wreak havoc with energy production and put the United States
even more at the mercy of foreign oil producers, Sabino said. </p>
<p>Also scheduled to appear before tomorrow''s panel are Lamar McKay and Marvin Odum, the presidents of the U.S. units of BP
and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, respectively. </p>
<p>Lawmakers may ask Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell
to describe safety measures they have used offshore to avoid the
sort of disaster BP faced, said Bern, a former BP crude trader. </p>
<p>Exxon, which pumps more crude than every member of OPEC
except Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, abandoned an exploration
project known as Blackbeard in the Gulf of Mexico in 2007 rather
than risk a blowout. The company quit the project, which sought
to drill more than six miles (9.7 kilometers) beneath the
seafloor, after repeated pressure surges indicated the well was
unstable. </p>
<p>Controlling Macondo </p>
<p>BP engineers alerted federal regulators at the Minerals
Management Service that they were having difficulty controlling
the Macondo well six weeks before the disaster, according to e-
mails released by the Energy and Commerce Committee. </p>
<p>I don''t think this would have happened on Exxon''s
watch, Tom Bower, author of The Squeeze: Oil, Money and
Greed in the 21st Century, said in a June 11 Bloomberg
Television interview. They''d be much more careful and much
more conscious of the need to supervise subcontractors. </p>

reported stronger than expected first quarter growth. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley expects Latin America''s biggest economy to
expand 7.9 percent this year compared with a previous forecast

<p>Teun Draaisma, Morgan Stanley''s top-

the U.S. bank to start a hedge fund for investment company TT
International. </p>
<p>Following Draaisma''s departure, Graham Secker will head the
bank''s European equity strategy team, which also includes Ronan Carr, said Sebastian Howell, a London-based spokesman for Morgan
Stanley. Draaisma joined Morgan Stanley in 1997 and was voted
best European equity strategist in the 2009 Thomson Extel
survey. </p>
<p>In December, Draaisma was the only strategist among 16
surveyed by Bloomberg to forecast a retreat in European stocks
by the end of 2010. He raised his recommendation on the region''s
equities to overweight from underweight on May 10 to
take advantage of the recent weakness. The benchmark Stoxx
Europe 600 Index slumped 15 percent from this year''s high on
April 15 to May 25 amid concern that Europe''s debt crisis may
derail the economic recovery. </p>
<p>Draaisma was joint head of European strategy with Ben Funnell from 2003 until 2006, when Funnell moved to hedge fund
GLG Partners Inc. A call to TT International was referred to the
marketing department, where no one was immediately available to

<p>Electricite de France SA, Europe''s
biggest power generator, and other French utilities are ready to
start publishing forecasts for individual power-plant
availability by the end of the month. </p>
<p>The production outlook for the short- and medium-term for
power stations with capacities of more than 100 megawatts will
be disclosed by the end of June, said Soizic Hemion, deputy head
of the Union Francaise de l''Electricite, the trade organization
for power producers that includes EDF and GDF Suez SA. </p>
<p>Utilities are testing publication through the existing
power data website of the Reseau de Transport d'' Electricite,
she said. RTE is wholly owned by EDF. </p>
<p>At the end of 2010, information on unplanned outages at
power stations with capacities of more than 100 megawatts will
be disclosed within 30 minutes, Hemion said. </p>
<p>The two-stage plan to expand publicly available information
on power plants in France was announced by the trade group last
November following criticism of EDF by France''s energy regulator
for posting insufficient forecasts about power production. </p>
<p>Generation data is important because prices hinge on how
much power is being produced at any given time. Electricity,
unlike other commodities, can''t be stored, so unexpected supply
cuts in one country may mean soaring prices in another part of
Europe''s interconnected markets. </p>
<p>EDF now provides information about halts and restarts at
its 58 nuclear reactors, which provide more than three quarters
of the country''s power, on recorded messages on answering
machines at 19 plants. These are often updated weekly. The
utility has long resisted publishing real-time information on
the grounds that it is commercially sensitive. </p>

<p>Tesla Motors Inc., the maker of
electric sports cars that hasn''t posted a profit since its
founding in 2003, said it will seek to raise $178 million
selling a 12 percent stake in its initial public offering. </p>
<p>The producer of the $109,000 electric Roadster will offer
11.1 million shares at $14 to $16 each on June 29 and use the
proceeds to pay for factories and possible acquisitions, a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing and data compiled by
Bloomberg showed. Tesla filed in January to raise as much as
$100 million without disclosing how many shares it intended to
sell or the price range. </p>
<p>The automaker is pushing forward with its sale even after
the European debt crisis spurred at least 34 companies to
postpone or withdraw IPOs since the start of May. Tesla, which
has sold about 1,000 Roadsters while losing $290 million, is
using the share sale and a $465 million loan from the government
to help produce its second electric car, the Model S sedan. </p>
<p>Bringing a completely new type of vehicle to market can
cost $1 billion, and Tesla may be looking at that level of
expense, said Eric Noble, president of The CarLab, an
automotive consulting company in Orange, California. The
danger for the early investor is that if Tesla can''t find the
next section of funding, it''s a bridge to nowhere. </p>
<p>Tesla hired New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley and JPMorgan Chase  Co., along with Deutsche Bank AG in
Frankfurt, to lead the sale. </p>
<p>CEO Musk </p>
<p>Existing stockholders including Chief Executive Officer
Elon Musk will sell 1.1 million shares. He spent more than $70
million of his own money on Tesla before May 2009, when
Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler AG invested $50 million. </p>
<p>Musk, who co-founded PayPal Inc., the online payment
company now owned by San Jose, California-based EBay Inc., is
also the CEO of Space Exploration Technologies Inc., a
Hawthorne, California-based company that builds spacecraft. </p>
<p>Tesla has delivered more than 1,000 of its electric
Roadster sports cars since 2008 and intends to fill orders for
an additional 1,200. The Model S sedan is going into production
in 2012 in a former Toyota Motor Corp.-General Motors Co. joint
venture factory in Fremont, California, which the company is
buying for $42 million. </p>
<p>Tesla won loans from the U.S. Energy Department in 2009
worth as much as $465 million to get the Model S into production
and expand output of battery packs the company assembles. </p>
<p>Divorce Proceedings </p>
<p>Under terms of the federal loan, Musk and certain
affiliates must retain 65 percent of their capital stock in
Tesla for a year after completing the Model S project. Musk''s
divorce proceedings won''t result in him owning less than 65
percent or have a material impact on his ability to serve as
CEO, according to filings. </p>
<p>Toyota agreed last month to purchase $50 million in Tesla
shares. Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota and Tesla say they may
cooperate on electric-vehicle development, though they haven''t
signed agreements to do so, filings show. </p>
<p>The Toyota connection may help, said John Wolkonowicz,
an auto analyst at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,
Massachusetts. It depends on how involved Toyota becomes. </p>
<p>Tesla is also backed by investors including Mountain View,
California-based Google Inc.''s co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the government of Abu Dhabi, and Daimler, the world''s
second-biggest maker of luxury vehicles. </p>
<p>Relative Value </p>
<p>At its midpoint price of $15, Tesla is valued at 6 times
net tangible book value, a measure of shareholder equity that
excludes assets that can''t be sold in liquidation. That''s about
five times higher than the median ratio of 1.21 for 45
automotive companies globally, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>The last America auto company started from whole cloth
that had any record of success was Hudson Motors in 1909,
Wolkonowicz said. Maybe they''ve found a formula that works,
but history would argue against them. </p>
<p>GM of Detroit has also said that it may sell shares to the
public this year, while Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Zipcar
Inc., the car-sharing company that rents vehicles by the hour,
filed this month to raise as much as $75 million in an IPO. </p>

<p>The top six U.S. credit-card
lenders, led by JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp. and
Capital One Financial Corp., said overdue loans fell in May as
consumers avoided taking on new debt amid the economic recovery. </p>
<p>Loans at least 30 days late, a signal of future write-
offs, dropped to 4.22 percent in May compared with 4.4 percent
in the previous month and the lowest since last July, New York-
based JPMorgan said today in a regulatory filing. Write-offs of
loans deemed uncollectible, a lagging indicator, fell except at
Bank of America and Discover Financial Services. </p>
<p>The decline in overdue loans signals that the credit-card
industry continues to recover from a record $89 billion of
write-offs last year, when the U.S. unemployment rate topped 10
percent. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
of the U.S. economy, may remain muted as people focus on
deleveraging, according to Capital One Chief Executive
Officer Richard Fairbank. </p>
<p>What they''re really doing is choosing not necessarily to
go load up on some credit cards, but more to pay down debt,
Fairbank said at an investor conference earlier this month.
This deleveraging phenomenon hasn''t provided strength to the
economy. </p>
<p>American Express Co., the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases, said overdue loans fell to 2.9 percent last month
from 3.1 percent in April. Late payments dropped to 4.8 percent
from 5.07 percent at McLean, Virginia-based Capital One; 6.39
percent from 6.73 percent at Bank of America; 5.59 percent from
5.85 percent at New York-based Citigroup Inc., and 4.95 percent
from 5.2 percent at Discover, based in Riverwoods, Illinois. </p>
<p>Write-offs declined to 6.3 percent from 6.7 percent at New
York-based AmEx, the lowest for the group. They rose to 13.33
percent from 12.71 percent at Bank of America, based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, which posted the highest level of
losses. Discover increased to 8.82 percent from 8.42 percent. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., ConocoPhillips,
Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are as ill-prepared as
BP Plc to halt and clean up an offshore oil spill because they
all use carbon copy disaster plans, lawmakers said. </p>
<p>Eight weeks after a drilling rig leased by BP exploded in
the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 workers and triggering the worst
spill in U.S. history, executives from the companies sought at a
House Energy Committee hearing to distance themselves from BP''s
practices that lawmakers said put profits before safety. </p>
<p>Lawmakers faulted the four executives for disaster-response
plans that would halt oil leaks at the sea floor using the same
techniques that failed for BP at its Macondo well. The same firm
wrote the plans and included references to making sure crude
doesn''t injure walruses, which don''t live in the Gulf of Mexico. </p>
<p>The oil company response plans are great for public
relations but these plans are virtually worthless in the event
of a spill, said Representative Bart T. Stupak, a Michigan
Democrat. It could be said that BP is the one bad apple in the
bunch, but unfortunately, they appear to have plenty of
company. </p>
<p>Energy companies, rig operators and lawmakers in oil-
producing states have urged the Obama administration to lift or
shorten a six-month moratorium on deepwater exploration that has
idled more than two dozen drilling vessels and threatens
thousands of jobs. Lawmakers said today they''re not convinced
the industry takes safety seriously. </p>
<p>Magic Button'' </p>
<p>You can''t have a contingency plan that says cross your
fingers and hope the blowout preventer works, said
Representative Joe Barton of Texas, the committee''s senior
Republican. They pushed the magic button on the BP rig and it
didn''t work. </p>
<p>Exxon wouldn''t have used the well design, cement mixture or
testing procedures BP employed at the Macondo well, CEO Rex Tillerson told lawmakers today. The BP project faced a lot of
indications of problems in the weeks before the explosion,
Tillerson said. Shell''s U.S. president, Marvin Odum, and Chevron
CEO John Watson said they wouldn''t have drilled the well in the
same manner as BP. </p>
<p>Our internal review confirmed what our regular audits
have told us, Watson told the committee. Chevron''s drilling
and control practices for deepwater wells are safe and
environmentally sound. </p>
<p>Deliberate Deception'' </p>
<p>The CEOs testified a day after the committee released
internal BP documents that lawmakers said showed the company put
cost concerns ahead of safety in the days leading up to April
20. BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward is to appear before
a subcommittee June 17, his first congressional testimony since
the well exploded. </p>
<p>In a preview of questions Hayward may face, Markey asked
Lamar McKay, president of BP America Inc., today why BP''s
initial estimates of the spill''s flow rate turned out to be
several times less than the actual leak. The initial estimates
reflected either a deliberate deception or gross
incompetence, Markey said. </p>
<p>We are sorry for everything the Gulf coast is going
through, McKay said. </p>
<p>BP, the biggest Gulf of Mexico oil producer, made five
questionable decisions aimed at cutting costs and speeding
completion of an overdue project before the disaster, Democratic
Representatives Henry Waxman of California and Stupak wrote in a
letter to Hayward released yesterday. </p>
<p>Walruses in Plans </p>
<p>Markey pressed the CEOs on why their safety plans for a
Gulf spill described the effects on walruses. Two of the
companies also incorporated contact information for a Florida
marine researcher who died in 2005, Markey said. </p>
<p>The plan needs to be updated more frequently,
ConocoPhillips CEO James Mulva said. Obviously, it is
embarrassing. </p>
<p>It''s unfortunate that walruses were included, and it''s an
embarrassment, Tillerson said. </p>
<p>President Barack Obama plans to speak to the nation tonight
on the spill, and the administration is demanding that BP set up
an escrow account for damage claims. BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg has been called to the White House tomorrow. </p>
<p>Industry groups oppose the six-month ban, which Obama put
in place to give a presidential commission time to probe the
spill. Pressed by Louisiana Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu,
who said her state could lose 330,000 jobs from the moratorium,
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar last week said the ban may be
shortened. </p>
<p>Lost Jobs, Wages </p>
<p>We acknowledge the reasons for the president''s decision
to pause deepwater drilling, Shell''s Odum said in his prepared
remarks. But it is not without consequence: thousands of lost
jobs, and billions in lost wages and spending. And not only on
the Gulf Coast, but also in places like Alaska. </p>
<p>Seventeen House members from Gulf coast states including
Barton and Representative Ted Poe, a Texas Republican, today
called on Obama to end the drilling ban. The group will meet
Salazar tomorrow to discuss the impact of the moratorium. </p>
<p>Many offshore drilling companies and suppliers will not be
able to survive this six-month period and will either go out of
business or move their employees and assets abroad, the group
said in a statement. An extended suspension may cost more than
20,000 jobs in Gulf region, according to a statement. </p>
<p>Exxon''s Rigs Moving </p>
<p>Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, has drilled 262 deep-water
wells in the past decade, 35 of which were in the Gulf,
Tillerson said. The company will send deepwater drilling rigs to
other parts of the world during the administration''s moratorium,
he said. </p>
<p>We will redirect our human resources, the technical
talent, to other parts of the world where we''re allowed to work,
and we will redirect the equipment elsewhere, Tillerson said.
This stuff is too expensive to let them sit around. </p>
<p>When the moratorium is lifted and federal regulators allow
deepwater drilling to resume, there may be few rigs available
for the work, said Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire Advisory
 Research Inc. in Flossmoor, Illinois, which advises oil
companies on strategy and risk management. </p>
<p>Drilling vessels are steaming out of the Gulf for
assignments in the South China Sea and off the Indonesia coast,
said Bern, a former BP crude trader. Those vessels won''t be able
to return to U.S. waters for a year or longer, she said. </p>
<p>The moratorium will likely draw drilling rigs away from
the Gulf of Mexico to overseas basins, further delaying
development and negatively affecting crucial U.S. jobs that
support these operations, Watson said. Any extension of the
moratorium will only exacerbate the economic consequences. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd. Chairman
Stephen Roach said governments and central banks may be sowing
the seeds of a future crisis by keeping overly accommodative
monetary and fiscal policy stances for too long. </p>
<p>Policy makers are making a mistake by pretty much
maintaining policies in stimulative positions for too long,
Roach said today in a Bloomberg Television interview from Hong
Kong. It ends up setting the stage for the next crisis. </p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on June 10
that the U.S. recovery isn''t as strong as he would like and that
the impact of Europe''s sovereign debt crisis must be considered,
suggesting the central bank remains attached to its pledge to
keep interest rates at a record low for an extended period. </p>
<p>President Barack Obama''s administration is forecasting a
record annual budget deficit of $1.6 trillion. The shortfall is
projected to be $10 trillion over the next 10 years, with
interest payments on debt forecast by the Congressional Budget
Office to quadruple to more than $900 billion annually. </p>
<p>Excess sovereign debt is a problem that is endemic in the
developed world, Roach said. At this point in time, we still
have ample slack in the global economy and an absence of
inflation pressures, but with central banks likely to remain
excessively accommodative for an extended period of time, then
the current benign environment could give way to more serious
inflation further down the road. </p>
<p>Wild Card </p>
<p>The big wild card in the global economy is rising trade
tensions between the U.S. and China, Roach said. Chinese exports
rose 48.5 percent in May, helping yield a $19.5 billion trade
surplus for the month. </p>
<p>U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham said on June 11 that
legislation aimed at getting China to raise the value of its
currency has huge support in Congress, and Obama runs the
risk of being overridden if he vetoes it. </p>
<p>I''m fairly worried given the politics in Washington and
the relatively high unemployment in the U.S., Roach said.
The U.S.-China trade imbalance is large, but it''s important to
keep in mind America ran a trade deficit with 90 countries
last year. We have a multilateral trade problem because we
don''t save. You don''t fix that by forcing one of your partners
to achieve a bilateral currency adjustment. </p>
<p>Roach also said that India needs to raise interest rates to
stem a jump in prices. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley plans to increase the
number of private bankers in India by 50 percent within a year,
Amitava Neogi, executive director at Morgan Stanley''s Indian
wealth management unit, said in an interview yesterday. </p>
<p>The wealth in Asia and emerging markets is growing thanks
to economic growth, said Mumbai-based Neogi, who plans to add
20 advisers to the 40 employed in the South Asian nation.
India has favorable demographics, entrepreneurial spirit and a
growing young population with increasing purchasing power. </p>
<p>India''s economy expanded 8.6 percent in the three months
through March. The number of billionaires in the nation rose to
52 from 27, Forbes magazine said last year. </p>
<p>Wealth in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan, is
expected to rise at almost double the global rate, according to
an annual study by the Boston Consulting Group. </p>
<p>The region will increase its share of global wealth from 15
percent last year to almost 20 percent in 2014, with China and
India the engines of growth, according to the report released on
June 10. Together, the two countries will make up 75 percent, or
almost $9 trillion, of the increase in assets managed in the
region. </p>
<p>Asian billionaires including India''s Mukesh Ambani and Hong
Kong''s Li Ka-shing increased their wealth as the region''s rich
expanded their fortunes at the world''s quickest pace in the past
year, Forbes said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley plans to double its private bankers in Asia
over the next three years, Charles Mak, head of private wealth
management for Asia, has said. </p>
<p>The bank is competing with rivals including UBS AG,
Citigroup Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG to hire financial
advisers in a market with an estimated $7.4 trillion of private
riches. The combined wealth of Asia-Pacific millionaires will
increase 8.8 percent annually until 2018, compared with a global
average of 7.1 percent, according to a report by Capgemini SA
and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley currently manages about 1,000 family
accounts in India and expects the number to rise to between
2,000 and 3,000 accounts, Neogi said. </p>

<p>Federal investigators must determine
if BP Plc took risks beyond industry norms with the Gulf of
Mexico well that exploded and caused the worst U.S. oil spill,
Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said. </p>
<p>The April 20 disaster that killed 11 workers and sank
Transocean Ltd.''s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig represents a
dramatic departure from the track record of deep-water oil
explorers, Tillerson said in remarks prepared for a House Energy
and Commerce Committee panel hearing today. </p>
<p>Something went wrong at the BP project about 5,000 feet
(1,524 meters) below the sea surface that hasn''t happened at the
14,000 other deep-water wells drilled without incident worldwide,
Tillerson said. The catastrophe has damaged livelihoods and
coastal environments and will cause loss of public trust in the
oil industry, he said. </p>
<p>We need to know if the levels of risk taken went beyond
industry norms, said Tillerson, who oversees a company that
pumps more oil than every member of OPEC except Saudi Arabia,
Iran and Iraq. </p>
<p>Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, has drilled 262 deep-water
wells in the past decade, 35 of which were in the Gulf of Mexico,
he said. Proper well design, workforce training, redundant
safety systems and regular maintenance help mitigate the risks
involved in drilling miles below sea level, Tillerson said in
the remarks. </p>
<p>Questionable Decisions'' </p>
<p>BP, the biggest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico, made
five questionable decisions aimed at cutting costs and
speeding completion of an overdue project in the days and weeks
preceding the disaster, U.S. Representatives Henry Waxman of
California and Bart Stupak of Michigan wrote in a letter to BP
CEO Tony Hayward that was released yesterday. </p>
<p>Hayward is scheduled to testify before U.S. lawmakers on
June 17. David Nicholas, a BP spokesman, said in an e-mail it
would be inappropriate to comment ahead of Hayward''s testimony. </p>
<p>Exxon overhauled its safety procedures after the 1989
Valdez tanker spill off the Alaskan coast, Tillerson said in his
remarks. The Valdez incident, which Tillerson described as the
low point'' in Exxon''s history, was one of the worst U.S. spills
before the failure of BP''s Macondo well. </p>
<p>John Watson, chief executive officer at Chevron Corp., and
ConocoPhillips CEO James Mulva are scheduled to testify at
today''s hearing in Washington. Lamar McKay and Marvin Odum, the
presidents of the U.S. units of BP and Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
respectively, have also accepted invitations. </p>
<p>Increased Scrutiny </p>
<p>Shell follows well-drilling safety standards that lawmakers
have said were sidestepped by BP, Odum said in a May 14 letter
to Elizabeth Birnbaum, former director of the U.S. Minerals
Management Service, which oversees the offshore drilling
industry. Shell''s plans to explore for oil and natural gas off
Alaska''s coast face increased scrutiny as a result of the Gulf
oil spill. </p>
<p>Shell has design standards and practices that have
enabled us to successfully and safely drill many deep-water and
shallow-water wells worldwide, Odum said in the letter to
Birnbaum. Shell will rigorously apply an appropriate similar
level of standards in all well operations on the Alaska outer
continental shelf. </p>
<p>More than 30 deep-water rigs have been ordered to stop
drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for at least six months while
federal officials conduct a review of offshore safety practices.
The moratorium has forced Exxon, Shell and other major oil
companies to suspend their deepwater exploration plans in the
Gulf. </p>
<p>Rigs Leaving </p>
<p>The Gulf accounts for 30 percent of U.S. oil production,
according to the Energy Information Administration. </p>
<p>When the moratorium is lifted and federal regulators allow
deep-water oil exploration to resume, there may be few rigs
remaining in the Gulf of Mexico to do the work, said
Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire Advisory  Research Inc.
in Flossmoor, Illinois, which advises oil companies on strategy
and risk management. </p>
<p>Drilling vessels are starting to leave the Gulf to take up
assignments in the South China Sea and offshore Indonesia, said
Bern, a former BP crude trader. Those vessels won''t be able to

<p>This is a challenging time for everyone in the industry
because there''s some level of guilt by association going on,
Bern said. With oil continuing to spew out in the Gulf of
Mexico, the whole industry is going to be set back. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. was sued by
insurer Assured Guaranty Ltd. to recover all claims the
guarantor might have to pay on $378 million of coverage provided
for sewer bonds issued by Jefferson County, Alabama. </p>
<p>Assured, the top U.S. municipal debt insurer by volume,
said in a lawsuit filed today in New York State Supreme court in
Manhattan that New York-based JPMorgan concealed about $3
million in illegal payments to friends of county commissioners
to ensure it won business with the county. Some of the payments
were then funneled to the officials, the complaint said. </p>
<p>Had JPMorgan and the county not misrepresented and
concealed from Assured the true facts regarding the unlawful
payments that JPMorgan made to secure its position as lead
underwriter for the warrants and swap provider for the county,
Assured never would have issued the policies, the lawsuit
said. </p>
<p>Assured Guaranty is the second bond insurer to sue JPMorgan
over a $3 billion refinancing of sewer debt that collapsed
during the credit crisis and almost bankrupted the county.
Syncora Guaranty Inc. sued JPMorgan and thee county on April 29
alleging they fraudulently obtained more than $1 billion in
insurance coverage for the sewer bonds. </p>
<p>Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, didn''t immediately
return a call and e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>JPMorgan arranged the refinancing of the Jefferson County
sewer system in 2002 and 2003, converting the district''s fixed-
rate debt -- issued so the sewer system was able to comply with
a 1996 federal consent decree -- into floating-rate bonds. </p>
<p>The obligations were paired with more than $5 billion of
interest-rate swaps, meant to lock in lower borrowing costs. </p>
<p>Credit Ratings </p>
<p>The financing fell apart in 2008 when the companies
guaranteeing the debt lost their top credit ratings because of
losses on unrelated mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>In January 2008 Jefferson County''s interest costs soared
more than threefold to 10 percent. </p>
<p>Financial Security Assurance Holdings Inc., which was
acquired by Assured Guaranty in July 2009, provided insurance to
the county, which according to the lawsuit included $352 million
of the sewer bonds and a $26.4 million surety bond. Assured has
paid more than $4 million on the surety bond, the suit said. </p>
<p>Last year, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million settlement
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end a probe
into the sale of bonds and derivatives to Jefferson County. The
SEC sued two former JPMorgan bankers for making undisclosed
payments to friends of county commissioner who owned or worked
at local securities firms that didn''t do any work on the deals. </p>
<p>One of those friends, William Blount, the former chairman
of a Montgomery, Alabama, broker dealer, pleaded guilty to
paying $241,000 in bribes to former Jefferson County Commission
president Larry Langford. Langford, who later became the mayor
of Birmingham, is serving a 15-year sentence in a federal prison
in Kentucky after being convicted of on bribery and fraud
charges. </p>
<p>The case is Assured Guranty Municipal Corp. F/K/A/
Financial Security Assurance Inc., V. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,

<p>Former Walt Disney Co. Chief
Executive Officer Michael Eisner said in a 1999 e-mail that
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire was as important to Disney''s
ABC network as its National Football League deal. </p>
<p>Eisner, in a second 1999 e-mail also presented today at a
trial, estimated the value of the rights to the game show at
$1 billion and said it would turn ABC around. The e-mails were
introduced as evidence by lawyers for the show''s creator, which
accuses Disney, the world''s largest media company, of cheating
it out of its share of the profit. </p>
<p>Of course we own it and it costs almost nothing, Eisner
said in an Aug. 24, 1999, message, shown to the federal court
jury in Riverside, California, by Roman Silberfeld, a lawyer for
Celador International Ltd. Sometimes the entertainment
business is just wonderful. </p>
<p>Closely held Celador sued Disney six years ago, alleging
Disney''s Buena Vista Television unit broke an implied promise by
failing to negotiate a higher license fee with Disney''s ABC
television network after the show became a hit. That prevented
Buena Vista from making a bigger profit that it would have had
to share with the creators, according to London-based Celador. </p>
<p>Eisner''s e-mails were allowed as evidence because the
former CEO, who left Burbank, California-based Disney in 2005,
is out of the country and can''t testify at the trial. The
creators seek more than $200 million in damages for the network
run of Millionaire as well as $16 million for merchandising. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp.''s failure to deliver
a tablet-friendly version of Windows is forcing big computer
makers like Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc. to rely on rival
software to help them keep up with Apple Inc.''s iPad. </p>
<p>Windows 7, the most recent version of Microsoft''s operating
system, is too unwieldy for an iPad-like device, said David Daoud, an analyst at IDC. A lighter edition won''t be ready until
the fourth quarter, giving Apple almost a year''s head start in
the burgeoning market for tablets. </p>
<p>The Windows world needs to respond, said Daoud, whose
firm is based in Framingham, Massachusetts. They will have to
play catch-up. </p>
<p>The iPad''s success caught much of the PC industry by
surprise. Within two months of the April 3 release, Apple sold 2
million iPads -- more than IDC expected for the entire tablet
industry in 2010. To catch up, Dell and Hewlett-Packard are
turning to Google Inc.''s Android operating system. Taiwanese
manufacturers that build most of the world''s PCs said they''re
dissatisfied with Microsoft''s current lineup. </p>
<p>We don''t have any choice for now, said Joseph Hsu,
chairman and president of Taipei-based manufacturer Micro-Star
International Co., a maker of laptops and computer parts.
Windows 7 is too powerful and consumes too much energy from
batteries, he said. </p>
<p>The iPad, which can display books, videos and the Internet
on a thin touch screen, will reach sales of 5.5 million units
this year and jump to 13 million next year, according to
Macquarie Group Ltd. </p>
<p>Feedback Is Fair'' </p>
<p>John Kalkman, a vice president in the Microsoft division
that works with computer makers, said the feedback from PC
manufacturers is fair. Later this year, Microsoft will
release Windows Embedded Compact 7, which will require less
processing power and reduces the drain on batteries. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has tried for more
than a decade to build a market for tablet-sized personal
computers. Chairman Bill Gates predicted in November 2001 that
the tablet would become the most popular form of PC within five
years. </p>
<p>Demand for the Windows tablets currently sold by Hewlett-
Packard and Dell has been lackluster, according to IDC. Before
the iPad made its debut this year, the researcher had been
forecasting that sales of tablets would decline to less than 1
percent of the overall PC market in the U.S. IDC had predicted
total shipments of just 523,000 tablets. </p>

<p>OAO Mobile TeleSystems, Russia''s
largest mobile phone company, raised $750 million in the biggest
dollar-bond sale by an emerging-market company in almost two
months. </p>
<p>The 10-year notes were priced at par to yield 8.625
percent, or 531.7 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. That compares to a spread of
440 basis points for seven-year, 8 percent dollar bonds the
company sold in January 2005, the last time it tapped
international debt markets. The yield on MTS''s dollar bonds due
January 2012 surged 220 basis points to 6.116 percent between
April 16 and June 7. The bonds are yielding 5.601 percent today,
a monthly low. </p>
<p>The sale is the largest offering of dollar debt by a
Russian company since the government sold $5.5 billion of debt
two months ago to set a benchmark that would help develop the
corporate debt market. Yields on emerging-market bonds have
climbed since then on concern the European Union''s debt crisis
will spread. MTS is the first developing-market company to hold
a bond sale of more than $500 million since April, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Pocket of Cash'' </p>
<p>With longer-term financing unavailable on the domestic
market we believe a limited portion of our debt portfolio should
be in hard currencies providing longer tenure, Chief Financial
Officer Alexei Kornya said in an e-mailed response to questions
from Bloomberg. Any deal around $1 billion with tenure of 10
years extends the average maturity of our debt outstanding by
one year. The company seeks to limit the share of foreign-
currency debt to no more than 30 percent, he said. </p>
<p>MTS sold 60 billion rubles ($1.9 billion) of domestic bonds
between June 2008 and July 2009, according to Bloomberg data, in
a bid to limit its foreign-currency exposure. The company
earlier said the funds raised will be used to refinance its
debt, including a $400 million bond due in October. </p>
<p>There is still ample perception that Russia telecoms are
in a pocket of cash liquidity, which explains their easy access
to the markets, even under shaky risk aversion conditions,
said Luis Costa, an emerging market debt strategist at Citigroup
Inc. in London. There is hidden liquidity out there to invest
in cash-rich corporations. </p>
<p>Domestic Funding </p>
<p>The company''s debt is rated Ba2, two levels below
investment grade, by Moody''s Investors Service and an equivalent
BB at Standard  Poor''s. The bond sale was organized by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. </p>
<p>Russian companies are able to issue on international
markets again, but they are not in a rush given attractive
funding alternatives domestically said Mikhail Galkin, an
analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow. MTS will be a rare issuer of
dollar debt going forward as its financial strategy suggests
debt should be mainly in local currency. </p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange
Commission pressed JPMorgan Chase  Co. to tell investors more
about mounting demands to buy back defective mortgages, an
obligation that cost the four biggest U.S. lenders about $5
billion last year. </p>
<p>The SEC asked the New York-based company to disclose more
about reserves set aside to cover the cost of repurchasing bad
loans it sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other investors,
according to a Jan. 29 letter released today. The SEC also told
the bank to provide more details on when and how it recognizes
losses on mortgages that have been modified as well as on soured
credit-card debt. </p>
<p>What they''re asking for is a lot more than the banks put
out in the public domain right now, said Christopher Whalen, a
bank analyst at Torrance, California-based Institutional Risk
Analytics. This is going to make life uncomfortable for a lot
of the banks, because once they start mandating this kind of
disclosures, it''s going to stay. </p>
<p>Lenders that sell mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
have to provide warranties assuring that the loans conformed to
the agencies'' standards. With more loans going bad, the
government-sponsored companies are demanding that banks turn
over loan files so they can scour the records for missing
documentation, inaccurate data and fraud, information that can
be used to force loan buybacks. </p>
<p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, seized by federal regulators in
September 2008, asked the bank to repurchase $2.7 billion in
defective loans in 2009 and $1.4 billion in 2008, JPMorgan said.
The lender held $2 billion in reserves at the end of the first
quarter against future buyback requests. </p>
<p>Defective Loans </p>
<p>Of the total requested, JPMorgan repurchased $1.1 billion
in defective loans in 2009 and has offered more than 750,000
borrowers trial modifications to try to cure their
delinquent loans, JPMorgan said in a separate filing. About
127,000 received permanent repayment plans. The bank''s mortgage
portfolio swelled to $292.6 billion from $115.8 billion from
2006 through 2008. The company''s response to the SEC sheds new
light on the company''s worst-performing loans made during the
housing boom. </p>
<p>In requesting the information, SEC staff told JPMorgan
Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh that their comments and
the company''s response do not foreclose the commission from
taking any action with respect to the filing. The SEC
concluded its review of JPMorgan''s loan-loss disclosures, which
the bank included in a Jan. 15 securities filing, on May 3. SEC
spokesman John Heine and JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti
declined to comment. </p>
<p>More Demands </p>
<p>Before 2008, demands from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
weren''t significant, JPMorgan told the SEC in its March 2
response. However, beginning in 2008, JPMorgan Chase
experienced a higher volume of demands; these demand volumes
have steadily increased every quarter, Corporate Controller
Louis Rauchenberger told the SEC. </p>
<p>Washington-based Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in McLean,
Virginia, may ask U.S. banks to repurchase $17.2 billion in
faulty loans this year, Oppenheimer  Co. analyst Chris Kotowski
estimated. Kotowski said in a June 9 report that U.S. banks
could lose $6 billion this year when those loans are returned
and get marked down to their true value. </p>
<p>It is a problem that will continue to drag on the big
banks to the tune of several hundred million per quarter, but
it''s not a problem that is mushrooming out of control,
Kotowski said. </p>
<p>Third Parties </p>
<p>JPMorgan told the SEC that 75 percent of its current
repurchase requests stem from loans originated in 2007 and 2008
and that it is able to file claims against third-party
originators on 40 percent of all repurchase requests. </p>
<p>The SEC questioned the bank''s calculations for its
allowance for loan losses, relating to breaches in the
agreements it has with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other
mortgage investors. </p>
<p>Estimating the allowance is highly subjective, and is
further complicated by limited and rapidly changing historical
data and uncertainty surrounding numerous external factors,
JPMorgan said. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s painkiller Celebrex
causes less bleeding and fewer ulcers in the gastrointestinal
tract than a combination of generic pain pills and heartburn
drugs, a company-funded study found. </p>
<p>Arthritis patients taking Celebrex were four times less
likely to start bleeding anywhere from the stomach to the colon
than those given the generic pain drug diclofenac and
AstraZeneca Plc''s Prilosec, a heartburn medicine that reduces
acid production. The six-month study was presented today at the
Congress of the European League Against Rheumatism in Rome and
published in The Lancet. </p>
<p>Because chronic use of traditional painkillers is linked to
ulcers, doctors recommend either Celebrex or combination
treatment for arthritis patients who need regular treatment.
While previous studies showed they have similar effects on the
stomach, this is the first to examine the entire digestive
tract. The findings should be taken into account when
prescribing pain treatment for arthritis sufferers, the
researchers said. </p>
<p>The study has provided new data relevant to patients
requiring anti-inflammatory therapy, said the researchers, led
by Francis K.L. Chan from the department of medicine at Prince
of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>The results come from one of two studies New York-based
Pfizer is counting on to boost sales of Celebrex. The drug never
fully recovered after the product''s main rival, Merck  Co.''s
Vioxx, was pulled off the market because of its ties to heart
attacks in 2004. Celebrex sales peaked at $3.3 billion that
year. The drug generated $2.4 billion in 2009. </p>
<p>Too Short </p>
<p>The scientists tracked 4,484 patients with osteoarthritis
or rheumatoid arthritis who were at risk for developing ulcers
or other gastrointestinal problems. After six months, 0.9
percent on Celebrex and 3.8 percent given the pain and heartburn
combination developed bleeding, ulcers or anemia. More patients
getting the combination dropped out of the study because of side
effects. </p>
<p>The short duration of the study limits its usefulness,
since arthritis patients tend to take the drugs for years, Elham
Rahme and Sasha Bernatsky from McGill University Health Center
in Montreal, wrote in a Lancet editorial. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. faces a Texas trial over
its hormone-replacement drugs after a court overseeing lawsuits
over the medicines sent 200 cases back to their home courts. </p>
<p>A judge in Galveston, Texas, last week set a May 2011 trial
date for Karen Zahn''s claims against Pfizer''s Wyeth unit. Zahn
says in her suit that the Prempro menopause drug helped cause
her breast cancer. It''s one of the first of more than 8,000
lawsuits over the medicine consolidated in federal court in
Arkansas to be returned for trial, plaintiffs'' lawyers said. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Wilson in Little Rock,
Arkansas, is supervising pretrial proceedings in the cases
against Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn, another Pfizer unit. He
returned the 200 cases to their courts in March and told lawyers
to get another 400 ready to be sent back later this year. </p>
<p>Pfizer is now going to have to gear up and hire lawyers
all over the country to try these cases, said Carl Tobias, a
professor at the University of Richmond law school who teaches
classes on mass-tort law. That makes things more expensive and
may provide some incentive to settle. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took the menopause drugs to treat
symptoms such as hot flashes and mood swings before a 2002 study
highlighted their links to cancer. Wyeth''s sales of the
medicines, which are still on the market, topped $2 billion
before the Women''s Health Initiative study concluded they posed
an increased breast-cancer risk. </p>
<p>Menopause Medicines </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth''s estrogen-based drug, with Upjohn''s progestin-laden
Provera, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth later combined the two
hormones in its Prempro pill. </p>
<p>Officials of New York-based Pfizer said while Wilson has
sent back some cases, he refused plaintiffs'' requests to send
back all the suits at one time. </p>
<p>No decision has been made about how many additional cases
will be remanded or when, Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder said in
an e-mailed statement. It also isn''t clear how many of the
remanded cases will go to trial, he added. </p>
<p>For example, plaintiffs May 25 dismissed a case filed by
Linda Cardwell that Wilson sent back to a federal court in
Alexandria, Virginia, Loder noted. </p>
<p>Both sides still must exchange case-specific information on
the remanded claims, Loder said. Pfizer lawyers also may ask
judges to throw some cases out. </p>
<p>Wilson is overseeing cases as part of the multidistrict
litigation system, which allows suits filed in courts around the
U.S. to be consolidated before a single judge for pretrial
hearings. </p>
<p>Saving on Expenses </p>
<p>Once pretrial information exchanges are done, the cases are
sent back to the courts where they were originally filed for
trial. Consolidation cuts down on expenses for both sides. </p>
<p>Such consolidations often lead to so-called global
settlements of litigations over drugs. In 2000, Wyeth agreed to
a $3.76 billion accord to resolve suits over its fen-phen diet
combination after the cases were consolidated before a federal
judge in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>Loder refused to comment on whether Pfizer will seek to
settle the remaining Prempro cases before Wilson. The company
faces at least 8,000 Prempro claims, Wyeth officials said in a
2009 regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Pfizer will continue to vigorously defend its hormone
therapy medicines, he said in a statement. We do not comment
on the number of cases pending, nor do we comment on our legal
strategy. </p>
<p>13,000 Cases </p>
<p>Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer for women suing over the menopause
drugs, said she expects to have many of the 200 cases set for
trial within the next 12 months. She estimates there may be more
than 13,000 Prempro cases pending before Wilson and state court
judges in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>Most of the hard work has been done on these cases, and
it''s time for women to get their days in court, she said. </p>
<p>Littlepage represents Zahn, a retired school receptionist
from Manvel, Texas. The 57-year-old woman took Prempro for
almost three years starting in January 1999. She was diagnosed

Littlepage said. </p>
<p>Wyeth has lost seven out of the 11 jury trials over the
menopause drugs. The drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown
out at the post-trial stage and or had awards reduced. </p>
<p>3,000 Cases Dismissed </p>
<p>Pfizer also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases at
either the pretrial stage or after the cases have been set for
trials, Loder said. </p>
<p>A judge in Philadelphia refused last month to throw out a
$9.4 million jury award to a woman who blamed Prempro for her
breast cancer. The case is on appeal. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, completed its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth last year. It acquired Upjohn in 2003
as part of a $54 billion buyout of Pharmacia Corp. </p>
<p>Upjohn has lost all three cases juries have considered over
Provera. A Pennsylvania judge ruled last month the Pfizer unit
deserved a new trial in a 2007 case that ended with a $1.5
million jury award. </p>
<p>The case is In Re Prempro Products, 03-CV-015070-WRW, U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas (Little
Rock). </p>

<p>General Motors Co. board member Kent Kresa, who served as interim chairman during the automaker''s
bankruptcy, will retire as a director as soon as July, said two
people with direct knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Kresa, who joined the board in 2003, turned 72 in March and
will not stand for re-election, said the people, who asked not
to be identified revealing internal discussions. GM added a 13th
director, Cynthia Telles, an associate clinical professor at the
University of California at Los Angeles, in April and she will
take Kresa''s place when he retires, the people said. </p>
<p>The departure would leave four directors from the old
General Motors Corp. and eight who joined since the new GM
emerged from bankruptcy. That may help GM convince potential
investors its board has a fresh perspective as it prepares for
an initial stock sale, said Charles Elson, director of the John
L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of
Delaware. </p>
<p>New blood would probably make some sense, said Elson. </p>
<p>Kathryn Marinello, another director, tendered her
resignation from GM''s board after she left her last job as
chairman and CEO of Minneapolis-based human resources firm
Ceridian Corp. in January. GM''s corporate governance guidelines
state that when a director''s job changes from the position he
or she held when originally invited to join the board, the
director will tender a letter of resignation. </p>

<p>Five years ago, investors
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Carlyle Group put up
$500 million in seed money to hunt for oil in the deep waters
of the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. </p>
<p>After the BP Plc oil spill, smaller Gulf operators such
as the Goldman startup, Cobalt International Energy Inc., may
be swept up in a wave of consolidation as the regulatory
landscape tilts in favor of larger firms, said William Herbert, an analyst at Houston-based Simmons  Co. </p>
<p>Tougher rules are likely to boost costs and slow the
pace of drilling, said Scott Van Bergh, co-head of Americas
energy and power investment banking at Bank of America Corp.
Companies may also face higher liability caps and
requirements to post some clean-up costs in advance. That may
make drilling in the Gulf feasible for only the world''s
largest energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Total
SA, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Norway''s Statoil ASA and
Australian miner BHP Billiton Ltd. </p>
<p>The rules Congress enacts are likely to favor larger
operators over smaller ones, Van Bergh said. People are
thinking about who will want to exit, and who will want to
become consolidators. </p>
<p>BHP Firepower </p>
<p>Cobalt, founded in Houston in 2005 by the former
president of Unocal Corp., Joseph Bryant, operates in the
deep waters of the Gulf and the West African coast and went
public last year. The shares lost about 44 percent since the
spill on April 20, giving Cobalt a market value of about $2.8
billion. </p>
<p>Houston-based Plains Exploration  Production Co., with
a market value of about $3.3 billion, and Cobalt may be
targets for BHP, the world''s largest mining company,
according to a report last month by Deutsche Bank AG analysts. </p>
<p>BHP already has four operating energy projects in the
Gulf, three of which are joint ventures with BP. The
Melbourne-based company has the firepower to do enormous
things, J. Michael Yeager, the chief executive officer of
BHP''s petroleum unit, said on a May 24 conference call. </p>
<p>BHP is capable of spending as much as $20 billion to
acquire Gulf assets, including BP project stakes that may come
up for sale, Citigroup Inc. Sydney-based analyst Clarke Wilkins
said in an interview today. </p>
<p>Public Enemy'' </p>
<p>BP is public enemy number one in the U.S. at the moment,
and if there is any forced divestment of assets, BHP is in a
strong position to be able to pick them up, Wilkins said. </p>
<p>BHP, a partner with BP in the Atlantis, Mad Dog and
Gunflint ventures, may increase its stakes in those projects, he
said. BP''s share of those assets is worth $11 billion, Wilkins
estimated in a June 16 report. </p>
<p>Amanda Buckley, a spokeswoman for BHP, said the company
doesn''t comment on speculation. Cobalt spokesman Rich Smith
didn''t return a call seeking comment. Andrea Raphael of
Goldman Sachs declined to comment, as did a spokesman for
Riverstone Holdings LLC, which sponsors a fund with Carlyle
that invested in Cobalt. Spokespeople for Plains didn''t
return calls. </p>
<p>The oil and gas business is one of the busier sectors in
a slumping merger market this year, accounting for $68.8
billion of deals, or about 8.4 percent of the total across
all industries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Oil
and gas deals accounted for 5.9 percent of global takeovers
during the previous decade. </p>
<p>Buoyant Market'' </p>
<p>Energy mergers and acquisitions may produce a buoyant
market in 2010, according to Wood Mackenzie Consultants Ltd. </p>
<p>Still, it may be months or years before Gulf players get
a clear enough understanding of the new regulatory
environment to do deals, said Bank of America''s Van Bergh. </p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department has begun a probe into the
BP oil leak, and President Barack Obama put a six-month ban
on offshore drilling. Congress is also considering removing
the $75 million limit on economic losses from oil spills that
large companies must pay. BP agreed this week to set up a $20
billion fund to pay victims and the spill had cost it more
than $1.2 billion as of June 11. </p>
<p>Costs will go up to operate in the region and that
could make it quite difficult for smaller companies, said
Peter Chilton, an investment analyst at Sydney-based
Constellation Capital Management Ltd. </p>
<p>Anadarko, Noble </p>
<p>The changing economics of deep-water drilling have
prompted investor doubts about one $2.7 billion deal struck
just before the spill. Mariner Energy Inc. shares dropped
about 7.7 percent since the spill amid concern an agreed sale
to Apache Corp. may unravel. Apache is committed to
completing the deal and expects to do so after getting
regulatory and shareholder approval, probably in the third
quarter, said spokesman Bill Mintz. </p>
<p>It''s too early to say how the BP spill will affect
Total''s plans for exploration, said Phenelope Semavoine, a
spokeswoman for Total in Paris. Alan Jeffers of Exxon Mobil
and Paula Almada of Petrobras declined to comment. Ola Morten Aanestad, a Statoil spokesman, didn''t return a call for
comment. </p>
<p>Today the industry is focused very much on the spill
itself, but we believe that many are thinking about what the
longer-term implications will be as an operator in the deep-
water Gulf, said Bank of America''s Van Bergh. </p>
<p>Anadarko, Noble </p>
<p>Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Noble Energy Inc. are among
companies that may opt to sell their deep-water Gulf assets,
according to Simmons''s Herbert. Anadarko, which owns a stake
in BP''s leaking well, has dropped 43 percent since the spill.
Houston-based Noble, which got about 10 percent of 2009
production from the deep-water Gulf, is down 15 percent. </p>
<p>Anadarko said on June 3 it may shift capital spending to
projects outside the Gulf. The Woodlands, Texas-based company
got about a fourth of its production from the Gulf in 2009,
according to a regulatory filing. Spokesmen for Anadarko and
Noble declined to comment. </p>
<p>The risk premium for deep-water, highly pressured
reserves has gone up, Herbert said. It''s not a seller''s
market. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp., a sponsor of this week''s U.S. Open golf tournament, is
counting on Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and the rest of the
world''s top golfers to showcase its Web technology. </p>
<p>The company developed a smartphone app that lets users
track the tournament and players'' statistics. It even shows a
so-called heat map of the course in Pebble Beach, California,
revealing the most challenging holes. IBM also helps manage
security, video and other features for the U.S. Open''s website. </p>
<p>IBM''s strategy isn''t about reaching more golf-loving
consumers. Instead, it wants to show business customers how its
technology can handle a huge surge in traffic without breaking
the bank. While the number of people using the U.S. Open site
jumped from a year earlier, IBM was able to cut the cost per
user by 25 percent, said John Kent, program manager for the
company''s sponsorship marketing. </p>
<p>When we talk to our customers about that, they have the
very same issues, Kent said. </p>
<p>IBM declined to say how much it spends on the U.S. Open or
what kind of return it gets from the event. The Armonk, New
York-based company also sponsors the Masters Golf Tournament, as
well as the U.S. Open tennis match and Wimbledon. </p>
<p>IBM fell 83 cents to $130.15 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange trading. The shares are little changed this year. </p>
<p>IPad Version </p>
<p>This is the second year in a row that IBM has offered an
iPhone app for the U.S. Open. About 286,000 people downloaded
the software last year. This time around, it also runs on Apple
Inc.''s iPad and other smartphones such as the Droid. IBM already
had 150,000 downloads by the first day of play. </p>
<p>The software gives up-to-the-minute scores and data for
each competitor, and the map indicates whether players are
shooting above or below par on each hole. The website also has
high-definition coverage of the tournament. </p>
<p>IBM invites corporate customers to see its Web operations
up close by visiting a trailer near the course. A staff of more
than a dozen, supplied with Twizzlers and a mini-fridge filled
with energy drinks, monitors global Internet security threats
and viewership numbers. </p>
<p>Our clients love golf, said Rick Singer, IBM''s vice
president for client executive marketing. These relationships
are all about business, and how we can further the perception of
IBM, and really sell stuff. </p>
<p>On the first day of the tournament, the heat map showed the
difficulty of the Pebble Beach course, which is located about
two hours from San Francisco. Woods and Mickelson, the world''s
two best golfers, failed to make a single birdie -- a score
that''s one stroke under par -- during the opening round. </p>
<p>Inside IBM''s trailer, the heat map was displayed on a 52-
inch flat screen. Kent pointed to a red blob where players were
performing better than expected. </p>
<p>It looks like six is the only easy'' hole out there, he
said. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. will withdraw its blood
cancer drug Mylotarg after 10 years on the U.S. market because
studies didn''t prove it works and the treatment was linked to
deaths from liver and lung complications. </p>
<p>Mylotarg, for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia, is the first
medicine to be pulled off the market that was cleared through
the Food and Drug Administration''s accelerated approval program,
the agency said today in a statement. Pfizer volunteered to halt
sales after trial results raised safety concerns and the drug
failed to demonstrate clinical benefit, the FDA said. </p>
<p>Mylotarg was approved in 2000 based on preliminary data
showing improved remission rates, with a requirement for more
complete trials to prove it extended survival. Wyeth, which sold
Mylotarg before being purchased by Pfizer in October, didn''t
start mandated follow-up research until 2004 and didn''t provide
results until this year. </p>
<p>Accelerated approval still has a place in the approval
process but it''s also more important that we learn over the
years that the whole development plan be set up well in
advance, said Robert Kane, acting deputy director for safety
in the FDA''s Division of Hematology Products, in a phone
interview today. The trials should be planned and if possible
under way when the sponsor submits the application. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., the
world''s biggest payments networks, climbed more than 4 percent
as the U.S. Congress worked toward a compromise that would
protect transaction fees they charge to banks. </p>
<p>The House will seek to maintain the Senate''s proposed cap
on debit-card interchange, or swipe fees, according to
Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat leading
talks to produce a final regulatory overhaul bill. The plan from
Senator Richard Durbin would empower the Federal Reserve to set
fees charged to merchants that are reasonable and
proportional to the cost of processing debit transactions. </p>
<p>If the counter-proposal becomes law, Visa and MasterCard
still may have to cope with some business-model changes, but
these would likely be less than had been feared, Jason Kupferberg, an analyst at UBS AG in New York, said today in a
note to clients. </p>
<p>The compromise prevents the Fed from regulating network
fees that Visa and MasterCard charge to banks on each
transaction as long as the fees aren''t used to circumvent
interchange regulation, according to Durbin, the Illinois
Democrat and majority whip. Reloadable prepaid cards, including
those used to disburse government benefits, would be exempt. </p>
<p>The House version also would allow the Fed to consider
fraud-related costs in setting interchange rates. </p>
<p>We were able to reach an agreement which makes minor
changes to strengthen consumer protections and bring competition
to a market where there is none, Durbin said in a statement.
We''ve addressed the concerns of states regarding their ability
to provide services to the unemployed and the concerns of small
financial firms regarding their ability to provide services to
the unbanked. </p>
<p>Shares Rise </p>
<p>Visa rose 5 percent to $80.90 at 5:37 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard advanced 4.2 percent to $223.34. Shares of both
companies had fallen about 14 percent from May 3 through June 18
after Durbin said he would seek interchange limits. </p>
<p>The proposed compromise, which the payments industry
opposes, may fail to survive a bipartisan conference committee
that is scheduled to debate the interchange amendment tomorrow. </p>
<p>We continue to have concerns that the ultimate outcome of
this legislation would be the passing of merchant acceptance
costs to consumers at a time when Americans can least afford
it, MasterCard spokesman James Issokson said in an e-mailed
statement. Visa spokesman Will Valentine declined to comment. </p>
<p>$20 Billion in Fees </p>
<p>MasterCard and San Francisco-based Visa set interchange
fees and pass the money to card-issuers including Bank of
America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. Interchange is the
largest component of the fees U.S. merchants pay to accept Visa
and MasterCard debit cards. The fees totaled $19.7 billion and
averaged 1.63 percent of each sale last year, according to the
Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. </p>
<p>The Senate voted 64-33 on May 13 to include the debit-
interchange caps after Durbin agreed to exempt banks with assets
of less than $10 billion, or 99 percent of all U.S. lenders.
That failed to win the support of groups representing credit
unions and community banks, who said the exemption would make
their cards more expensive to accept than those issued by bigger
banks. </p>
<p>Severe Disadvantage'' </p>
<p>The proposed compromise falls far short of safeguarding
consumers'' best interests, Fred Becker, president of the
National Association of Federal Credit Unions, said today in a
statement. This legislation would still put credit unions at a
severe disadvantage compared to large credit-card issuers. </p>
<p>On June 16, after 131 House members signed a letter urging
the conference committee to strip the debit-cap amendment from
the bill, Durbin said he would work to exempt reloadable prepaid
cards used to distribute government benefits. At least 10 state
treasurers including Shane Osborn, a Nebraska Republican, had
said the legislation could hurt those government programs and
their beneficiaries. </p>
<p>The industry escaped previous attempts to regulate
interchange on credit cards, which average about 2 percent per
transaction, saying the fees are needed to compensate banks for
the risk of lending money. That argument isn''t relevant to
interchange on debit cards, which tap funds held in consumer
checking accounts. </p>
<p>Durbin said in a June 17 interview that he''s determined to
push through his amendment and counteract the unregulated
power wielded by Visa and MasterCard. The companies accounted
for 91 percent of global purchase transactions made with
general-purpose cards last year, according to the Nilson Report. </p>
<p>Network Competition </p>
<p>The compromise legislation would allow merchants to set
minimums and maximums for credit-card purchases and offer
discounts based on the form of payment. A provision that would
have allowed merchants to tailor discounts by card brand was
removed and replaced with a measure that directs the Fed to
issue rules preventing networks from requiring that their debit
cards can only be used on one network. </p>
<p>Merchants will have the choice of at least two networks
upon which to run debit transactions, Durbin''s statement said.
The measure provides additional competition to a previously
non-competitive part of the market. </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court rejected
Pfizer Inc.''s appeal of a verdict for an Arkansas woman who
blamed the company''s menopause drugs for her breast cancer,
leaving intact a $2.7 million award that may grow with punitive
damages. </p>
<p>The justices today let stand a lower court decision
upholding that award, which marked the first federal verdict
against Pfizer''s Wyeth unit over its Prempro hormone-replacement
treatment. </p>
<p>The appeal by Wyeth and Pfizer''s Upjohn unit sought to
leverage a different part of the appeals court ruling ordering a
new trial on punitive damages, which a jury had set at $27
million. Pfizer argued that the new trial should cover all
aspects of the case, including the jury''s finding that the drugs
helped cause Donna Scroggin''s cancer. </p>
<p>While we are disappointed with the court''s decision, it
does not change the prior ruling by the appeals court, which
affirmed the dismissal of punitive damages as to Upjohn and
ordered a new trial on punitive damages for Wyeth, Pfizer said
in a statement. </p>
<p>Scroggin was among 6 million women who took the pills to
treat menopause symptoms including hot flashes, night sweats and
mood swings. Wyeth faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the
medicines, which are still on the market. </p>
<p>Scroggin and other women contend company executives ignored
studies raising questions about the link between hormone-
replacement drugs and breast cancer to pump up sales of their
drugs. </p>
<p>Health Risks </p>
<p>The Supreme Court action validates our evidence that
shows Wyeth hid the health risks of this drug and the drugs
caused breast cancer in thousands of women, Jim Morris,
Scroggin''s lawyer, said in a telephone interview today. We are
looking forward to asking another jury to decide the extent of
Wyeth''s wrongful conduct. </p>
<p>Scroggin took three menopause drugs: Provera, a progestin-
laden treatment made by what is now Pfizer''s Upjohn unit;
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug made by Wyeth, and Prempro, a
combination of the two other drugs introduced by Wyeth in 1996. </p>
<p>Annual sales of Wyeth''s hormone-replacement drugs topped $2
billion before a 2002 study sponsored by the U.S. National
Institutes of Health suggested women using the medicines had a
higher breast cancer risk. New York-based Pfizer, the world''s
largest drugmaker, bought Wyeth last year in a $68 billion
transaction. </p>
<p>Jury''s Decision </p>
<p>The Supreme Court''s decision not to review the case isn''t
surprising since the appellate court left the jury''s decisions
on liability and actual damages undisturbed, said Carl Tobias, a
professor at University of Richmond Law School who teaches
classes on mass-tort law. </p>
<p>The denial is a good sign for plaintiffs going forward
with Prempro claims, Tobias said today in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Wyeth has lost seven of the 11 Prempro cases that have been
considered by juries since the cases began going to trial in
2006.
The drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown out at the post-
trial stage and or had awards reduced. </p>
<p>Pfizer also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases at
either the pretrial stage or after the cases have been set for
trials, said Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s appeal in the Scroggin case centered on the
Constitution''s Seventh Amendment, which guarantees the right to
a jury trial in federal civil cases. In a separate line of
argument, the company contended that the trial judge should have
excluded the testimony of an oncologist who testified that the
hormone treatments caused Scroggin''s cancer. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares fell 11 cents to $15.10 at 4:00 p.m. New York
time. After the headlines were published, Pfizer shares fell as
much as 2.4 percent, from an opening high of $15.38 to an
afternoon low of $15.01. </p>
<p>The case is Wyeth v. Scroggin, 09-1123. </p>

million euros ($124 million), said one of the people, who
declined to be identified before the acquisition is agreed. </p>
<p>AriaDSL, the Dutch parent of the Italian Wimax operator,
was declared bankrupt on March 2. The struggle for control of
the company began six months earlier after it hit a liquidity
shortage, according court papers filed in April by the
bankruptcy trustee, who is seeking a buyer for the company. </p>
<p>Officials for Goldman in London declined to comment. Davidi Gilo, founder of Gilo Ventures, also declined to comment. </p>
<p>In December, most shareholders agreed to short-term funding
through a convertible bond that would be sold in three stages.
The investment would have given the company access to a 75
million-euro bank loan, the court papers show, cash that would
have been invested to build more base stations, the people said. </p>
<p>Financing Fails </p>
<p>A conflict among shareholders led that shareholder
financing to fail, the court documents show. Only the first of
the three payments was made and a number of shareholders, which
the documents don''t identify, requested that AriaDSL pay back
the loan. The shareholders sought the bankruptcy after failing
to get their money back, the documents show. </p>
<p>Goldman and Icon''s interest Aria in began in 2008 when they
led a group that injected 55 million euros into AriaDSL to help
it fund a 48 million-euro purchase of six Wimax licenses, court
papers show. Goldman was involved through both its asset
management unit and its special situations group, which mainly
invests in distressed assets. </p>
<p>As part of the license agreement, Aria pledged to build 700
base stations by Nov. 1. To boost its reach, in June 2009 Aria
and Telecom Italia SpA said Aria would use Telecom Italia''s
Wimax frequencies in Italy''s central and southern regions. In
exchange, Telecom Italia agreed to sell Aria''s broadband
services to its own clients. By April, Aria had built only about
120 base stations and the company isn''t likely to meet its
licensing target, according to the court documents. </p>
<p>For Icon, Aria remains a long-term project. </p>
<p>We look at investments on a four-to-five year horizon and
the same here, said Icon''s Dmitriev. We have good experience
with Wimax in Russia and Ukraine, so we can use our scale of
operations to buy equipment cheaper. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. accused
Barclays Plc of misleading a federal judge when it bought Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.''s defunct brokerage in the falling
markets of September 2008, said a Lehman lawyer, citing a letter
from JPMorgan Chairman Jamie Dimon. </p>
<p>Barclays Group Chief Executive John Varley was asked by
Lehman lawyer Robert Gaffey in federal court in Manhattan today
about what he characterized as two big-time bankers in a very
big dispute. </p>
<p>Gaffey said Dimon wrote to Varley and Barclays President
Robert Diamond, saying the court was misinformed about the
Barclays deal. JPMorgan had asked Barclays to participate in an
accounting of the transaction and they declined, Dimon said in
the letter, according to Gaffey. </p>
<p>I could refute him point by point but he''s not here,
Varley said. I inwardly groaned when I read it because I knew
that there were a number of points on which Jamie Dimon and I
would disagree. </p>
<p>Varley was the second witness today in a U.S. Bankruptcy
Court trial over Lehman''s claim that the U.K.''s third-biggest
bank should pay it as much as $11 billion for an allegedly
undisclosed windfall on the deal for the brokerage. The
purchase was approved by Judge James Peck and closed a week
after Lehman''s Sept. 15, 2008, bankruptcy, the biggest in U.S.
history. </p>
<p>Custodial Account </p>
<p>JPMorgan around that time had taken $7 billion out of a
Barclays custodial account, according to Varley. </p>
<p>I was deeply unhappy that without our consent a large
amount of money had been taken out of our account, Varley
said. He interpreted the letter about misleading the court as a
device by JPMorgan to distract attention from the dispute over
money, he said. </p>
<p>Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
on the dispute, which was later settled. </p>
<p>Separately, Lehman in May sued JPMorgan to recover tens of
billions of dollars in lost value, accusing the bank of
precipitating its downfall and preventing it from winding down
in an orderly fashion. Evangelisti said the lawsuit was ill
conceived. </p>
<p>Earlier, Varley said the week when Barclays bought the
Lehman brokerage was the riskiest week of my life. </p>
<p>Markets were collapsing, he said. We needed to ensure
there was a buffer between assets and liabilities. We needed to
be able to look regulators in the eye and say the deal would be
capital accretive. </p>
<p>Protect Our Ratios </p>
<p>This was a time when there was a great deal of focus by
supervisors around the world, including the U.K. Financial
Services Authority and the Bank of England, on capital ratios,
and it was clear to me that the only circumstances in which I
could look our regulators in the eye, and indeed look our
shareholders in the eye, would be if we were able to protect our
capital ratios, Varley said. </p>
<p>To put it another way, were we not capable of doing that,
then I was not prepared to recommend that we should proceed to
the board of Barclays, he said. </p>
<p>Lehman lawyer Gaffey has tried to prove that Barclays made
a safe, or derisked acquisition, and took more assets out of
the defunct firm than it should have without telling the court. </p>
<p>You expected an immediate profit on the brokerage
purchase? Gaffey asked. </p>
<p>Yes we did, Varley said. That''s because we expected
the income we generated to exceed costs. </p>
<p>BofA Balked </p>
<p>Today''s first witness, Barclays President Diamond, said the
bank had qualms about acquiring Lehman''s brokerage after Bank of
America Corp. balked at buying it. </p>
<p>BofA walked away from an opportunity to do a deal with
Lehman at some distressed price, said Diamond, who runs
Barclays''s corporate and investment banking operations. But
they paid $50 billion for Merrill Lynch. That created real
concern for us. What had they seen? </p>
<p>Diamond was responding to questions from Barclays''s lawyer
David Boies about the bank''s concerns when it bought Lehman and
why it sought to buffer itself from risk by staking claim to
assets in the brokerage business. </p>
<p>BofA could have bought it for about $1 billion, Diamond
said. They walked away and paid $50 billion for Merrill. It
reinforced in Varley and myself and our board what a risky
environment we were working in. </p>
<p>Government Help </p>
<p>When JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns it got government
help, Diamond said. Barclays wasn''t able to get help. So it
was especially important to get the values and commitments we
had received or we couldn''t go forward. There were hours when we
were expecting not to execute on the deal. </p>
<p>Lehman, which wants money to pay off creditors, has accused
the London-based bank of making a secret asset raid on
Lehman that wasn''t disclosed to the court. The brokerage''s
trustee, James Giddens, has said changes were secretly inserted
in the sale contract without notice to him or Lehman''s lawyers.
He wants $6.7 billion from Barclays to pay hedge funds and other
institutional clients of Lehman. </p>
<p>Lehman''s lawyers are beginning to wrap up their case after
more than two weeks of testimony by former Lehman executives,
advisers and Barclays officials. </p>
<p>The U.K. bank''s lawyers have tried to show when questioning
Lehman''s witnesses that all the key facts of the deal were known
by the main players. They are scheduled to present Barclays''s
side of the story starting Aug. 23. Barclays, which announced a
gain on its purchase on Sept. 17, 2008, has said it owes Lehman
nothing and wants $3 billion that is being withheld by the
trustee. </p>
<p>Lehman spent $794 million on lawyers, advisers and managers
in 19 months through April, with $277.4 million going to Lehman
CEO Bryan Marsal''s restructuring firm, Alvarez  Marsal. Marsal
has said he will spend five years selling assets to pay
unsecured creditors as little as 14.7 cents on the dollar. Any
proceeds from litigation would add to the payout. </p>
<p>The cases are In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-
13555, and Giddens v. Barclays Capital Inc., 09-01732, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Jamie Dimon, the chief executive
officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co., named longtime associate Heidi Miller to the new post of president of JPMorgan International as
part of a management shuffle to groom an eventual successor. </p>
<p>Miller, 57, who had been executive vice president for
Treasury and Securities Services, will be replaced by Chief
Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh, 44. Doug Braunstein, 49,
head of Investment Banking Americas, will succeed Cavanagh as
CFO, the company said in a statement today. </p>
<p>Dimon, 54, said in March that he planned to rotate senior
executives across business lines as part of a succession plan.
Miller''s working relationship with Dimon spans about two
decades, including stints at Travelers Group Inc., Citigroup
Inc., Bank One Corp. and JPMorgan. </p>
<p>This is someone who has the capability of staring Jamie
Dimon down, so that''s obviously served her well, said Duff
McDonald, author of Last Man Standing: The Ascent of Jamie
Dimon and JPMorgan Chase. The fact that he''s chosen her to
take on this new and expanded role should surprise nobody. </p>
<p>The move gives Cavanagh, who has never run a business
division at JPMorgan, operational experience as a possible
successor to Dimon, McDonald said. Cavanagh worked with Dimon at
Primerica and Citigroup before joining Bank One, where Dimon had
become CEO, in 2000. He was named CFO of JPMorgan after Dimon
sold his lender to the bank in 2004. </p>
<p>Dealmaker </p>
<p>Braunstein has been one of JPMorgan''s most prolific
dealmakers for corporate clients. He is also Dimon''s go-to
banker for his own acquisitions after working across the
negotiating table from him during the Bank One sale. Braunstein
helped JPMorgan seal a deal to buy Bear Stearns Cos. during a
weekend of frenzied negotiating in 2008. The company said it
will announce Braunstein''s replacement soon. </p>
<p>He''s grooming multiple potential successors, said
Bradley Hintz, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein  Co. Jamie
hasn''t made a decision about who''s going to take over, and he''s
got time to see how they do in their new roles. </p>
<p>Since 2004, Miller has run JPMorgan''s Treasury  Securities
Services unit, which provides clients with payment-processing
and cash-management services. </p>
<p>Miller turned around the business and generated stable
returns throughout the economic crisis, Hintz said. JPMorgan
credited her with producing record increases in net revenue
and net income during her tenure at the unit, which processes
an average of $3.7 trillion in transfers daily and has $15.3
trillion in assets under custody. </p>
<p>Competing With Citigroup </p>
<p>As head of JPMorgan''s Global Corporate Bank, Miller will
lead the company''s expansion plans in emerging markets like
China, Brazil, India and Russia, regions where JPMorgan will
battle Citigroup for business, said Anthony Polini, a banking
analyst at Raymond James  Associates Inc. More than half of
Citigroup''s total revenue comes from overseas, compared with
about a quarter at JPMorgan, Polini said. </p>
<p>This is a key play to get a piece of the pie that Citi
has a bigger slice of right now, Polini said. The projected
growth rate for those economies are two or three times greater
than the projected growth rates of the U.S. </p>
<p>Shares of JPMorgan, which have fallen 6 percent this year
compared with a 3 percent advance in the SP 500 Financials
Index, were little changed as of 12:53 p.m. in New York trading
at $39.19. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable bank in Wall Street history, reduced its price
forecasts for crude oil because commodity markets are
fragile on concern growth in Europe and China will slow. </p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate oil, traded in New York, was
forecast at $100 a barrel in 2011, down 9.1 percent from its
previous prediction of $110, Goldman said in a report today. The
bank also downgraded prices for three-month, six-month and 12-
month crude and for Brent oil, traded in London. </p>
<p>Commodity markets are generally rebounding strongly off
their lows but sentiment remains fragile on European and Chinese
concerns, said analysts led by New York-based Allison Nathan.
Markets will remain fragile until there is further evidence
that sovereign pressures are stabilizing and global trend
economic growth remains intact. </p>
<p>Oil in New York has gained more than 10 percent so far in
June, set for the biggest monthly increase since October, amid
speculation global demand for fuels will recover as Europe
overcomes its debt crisis. Futures yesterday reached a six-week
high of $78.92 a barrel after China, the world''s second-largest
energy consumer, signaled an end to the yuan''s fixed rate to the
dollar, a move that may boost the country''s purchasing power. </p>
<p>We have lowered our three-month oil and base metals price
forecasts but to levels still above current prices, and maintain
a positive medium-term view of key commodities, the analysts
said. </p>
<p>Goldman said the market is overestimating any negative
impact of government policies on growth and has discounted
possible constraints on oil supply in the future. </p>
<p>Too Bearish'' </p>
<p>Sentiment is too bearish on both the sovereign-debt risks
as well as the effects of macroeconomic momentum slowing, the
analysts wrote. Despite some macro slowing, absolute growth
indicators are still firmly positive. </p>
<p>WTI, a low-sulfur crude, is the reference grade for futures
contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent is quoted
in oil contracts at the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. </p>
<p>Implied demand for key commodities has remained at
exceptionally high levels in the emerging markets, the Goldman
analysts said. Developed market demand has generally surprised
to the upside. </p>
<p>WTI contracts for December delivery have gained $3.40 a
barrel since a May 10 buy recommendation, according to the
report. </p>
<p>Global fuel consumption will increase 2 percent this year
to a record 86.4 million barrels a day, the International Energy
Agency predicted June 10. </p>

<p>Shanghai will have more than half of
Asia''s stock market liquidity in 2020 as China gradually moves
to full currency convertibility and opens yuan-denominated A
shares to foreign investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>As a financial centre, we expect Shanghai to develop more
along the lines of the New York model -- that is, primarily
dedicated to its domestic market -- rather than as a regional
financial centre like London or Singapore, Goldman Sachs
analysts Christopher Eoyang, Jason Lui and Sunil Koul said in a
research report released today. In many ways, we think
Shanghai may partially emulate the development of Hong Kong
during the 1980s and 1990s, when manufacturing was gradually
replaced by higher value added services. </p>
<p>Shanghai currently accounts for 25 percent of the region''s
daily cash equity and futures turnover, the analysts wrote. The
city will benefit disproportionately as China''s financial
markets grow deeper and more sophisticated, they said. </p>
<p>China''s central government has a goal of making Shanghai an
international financial center by 2020. The city''s economy,
which already surpassed Hong Kong''s in size last year, grew 8.2
percent in 2009. In comparison, New York City''s expanded 0.9
percent in the fourth quarter after seven straight quarterly
declines. </p>
<p>Daily Trading </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs report comes after the People''s Bank of
China pledged June 19 to make its currency more flexible, a move
that drove the yuan up by the most since July 2005. The Shanghai
Composite Index climbed 2.9 percent yesterday. U.S. President
Barack Obama said the policy action will contribute to a more
balanced global economy. </p>
<p>Goldman forecast that with a gradual liberalization, the
value of equities and futures traded daily in China could reach
$455 billion in 2020, about 70 percent of the regional total, up
from the current $58 billion, or 36 percent of the liquidity in
Asia, according to the report. </p>
<p>Under the same scenario, trading turnover in Shanghai could
increase to more than $350 billion per day in a decade from the
current $47 billion, Goldman Sachs estimated. That means
Shanghai would account for more than 75 percent of China''s
liquidity, and as much as 53 percent of Asia''s, they said. </p>
<p>Despite Shanghai''s image as a modern commercial centre
and its notable achievements, China''s equity capital markets are
relatively immature, the Goldman analysts wrote. Although
the government is on the path towards full currency
convertibility and the opening up of the domestic equity market,
the process will probably be very gradual, and this could
potentially benefit Hong Kong. </p>
<p>Ownership of yuan-denominated or A-shares is limited to
Chinese citizens and approved overseas investors under the
qualified foreign institutional investor, or QFII, program. The
analysts estimated current foreign ownership of A shares at
about 0.5 percent of market capitalization, compared to 25
percent in Japan and about 30 percent in Korea and Taiwan. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s biggest
drugmaker, said it suspended trials of its experimental pain
relief drug, tanezumab, for osteoarthritis after reports that
patients'' conditions worsened and led to joint replacements. </p>
<p>Pfizer, at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, isn''t recruiting any new patients or giving the
drug to patients already in 10 osteoarthritis trials or those
with the condition taking the drug in studies for other
diseases, the New York-based company said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Tanezumab would generate an estimated $100 million in
annual sales by the end of 2012, and $260 million by 2013,
according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The drug was one of
500 projects the company had preserved in a pared-down
development portfolio. Pfizer said in April 2009 that the drug
as a treatment for the pain of osteoarthritis in the knee had
moved into the third and final stage of testing usually needed
for regulatory approval. </p>
<p>The FDA asked the company to show data on potential effects
in clinical studies of the drug among patients with cancer pain,
interstitial cystitis, chronic low back pain and painful
diabetic peripheral neuropathy, Pfizer said. </p>
<p>The agency will then decide whether to halt Pfizer''s
remaining trials of tanezumab after reviewing company data.
Trials for other conditions haven''t reported similar adverse
events, MacKay Jimeson, a Pfizer spokesman, said in a telephone
interview. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp., Yahoo! Inc. and

<p>The technology companies are fighting for a chunk of the

Procter  Gamble Co. increasingly follow their customers online.
The Internet ranks second behind television as the most popular

<p>The ad agencies are a great driver of growth for

<p>General Motors Co. is preparing for
an initial public offering that may sell 20 percent of the
Treasury''s stake in the automaker and reduce the U.S. to a
minority owner, said two people familiar with the plan. </p>
<p>The aim is to sell a fifth of the government''s 304 million
shares, said the people, who asked not to be identified
revealing private discussions. That would reduce the Treasury
Department''s stake to less than 50 percent from 61 percent now.
Final decisions on which owners will sell how many shares
haven''t been made and may change, the people said. </p>
<p>A registration statement may be filed in August, aiming for
a November stock sale, said four people familiar with the plan.
The sale will probably raise $10 billion to $15 billion,
depending on the company''s performance, the strength of the
economy and the health of the IPO market, the people said. </p>
<p>An August filing means Detroit-based GM could have the IPO
ready around the time of the Nov. 2 congressional elections,
said the people. If Treasury can sell enough shares, President
Barack Obama could help other Democrats running for office by
arguing that his administration''s restructuring of GM is paying
off, said Joe Phillippi, president of AutoTrends Consulting. </p>
<p>The government wants a successful offering soon so they
can say that they took the company through bankruptcy, turned it
over to independent management and are taking it public, said
Phillippi, who is based in Short Hills, New Jersey. This would
be part of the campaign spin. </p>
<p>Other Sellers </p>
<p>The automaker may also issue new shares to raise cash and
sell shares owned by Canada and a union-led retiree health-care
trust, one of the people said. </p>
<p>Selim Bingol, a GM spokesman, declined in an e-mail to
comment on the matter. </p>
<p>GM has invited analysts, potential investors and
representatives of its current shareholders to Detroit for a
review of the business on June 29, said a spokeswoman, Renee Rashid-Merem. GM will also give the members of the financial
community a look at current and future models, she said. </p>
<p>The IPO will be managed by JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan
Stanley, people familiar with the matter have said. They will
collect fees of 0.75 percent of the sale, said a person briefed
on the matter. Such fees would be a quarter of the usual rate
for large stock sales. </p>
<p>JPMorgan had offered to accept payment in equity instead of
cash, though that idea was rejected by GM and Treasury, two
people said. </p>
<p>The U.S. will probably sell the remainder of its GM stock
over a few years, Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said
in a May 17 Bloomberg Television interview. </p>
<p>Equity Value </p>
<p>GM''s equity is worth $70 billion, according to a May 20
report by Eric Selle, a JPMorgan debt analyst who projects a
return of 47 cents on the dollar for holders of bonds issued by
GM''s predecessor, General Motors Corp., that will be converted
to stock and warrants in new GM. At today''s bond prices, GM''s
equity is worth about $51 billion. </p>
<p>Since 1999, four U.S. IPOs have exceeded $5 billion -- Visa
Inc.''s $19.7 billion deal in 2008, ATT Wireless Group''s
$10.6 billion offering in 2000, Kraft Foods Inc.''s $8.68 billion
deal in 2001 and United Parcel Service Inc.''s $5.47 billion sale

<p>Britain''s new bank levy will have a
minimal impact on U.S. investment banks with operations in
London, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. likely to pay only a sixth
of the bill it faces for the bonus tax. </p>
<p>International banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. may pay about a quarter of the 2 billion-pound ($3
billion) total levy a year, according to analysts at Seymour
Pierce Ltd. and Bank of America Corp.''s Merrill Lynch unit
today. The U.K.''s five biggest banks will pay about 76 percent
of the Treasury forecast for the bank tax, according to Mark Phin, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Ltd. </p>
<p>The impact will be minimal for U.S. investment banks,
said Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London
with an overweight recommendation on New York-based Goldman
Sachs. It could impact Goldman by about $100 million per year,
or about 1 percent of earnings. That assumes the industry in
general doesn''t pass on the cost to customers. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm in U.S.
history, has said the U.K.''s one-time bonus tax will leave it
with a $600 million bill. In December, the U.K. put a one-time
50 percent levy on bankers'' discretionary bonuses. </p>
<p>Spokeswomen for JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs in London
declined to comment on the bank levy today. </p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne told lawmakers
yesterday the tax will raise about 2 billion pounds annually as
other European governments consider similar taxes to tackle
budget deficits inflated by bank bailouts. The 0.07 percent levy
on wholesale liabilities is less than half the 0.15 percent rate
being considered by the U.S. government. </p>
<p>The six biggest U.K. banks will pay about 1.5 billion
pounds of the 2 billion pounds forecast, with the remaining 500
million pounds coming from building societies and foreign banks,
Bank of America said today in a note to clients. </p>

<p>Three of the five U.S. banks that
dominate swaps trading already perform most transactions outside
their depository institutions and would face minimal disruption
from a congressional proposal to reorder the derivatives
business, financial statements and banking records show. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup Inc. would be hit
hardest by the proposal, crafted by Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln, to wall off swaps desks from commercial banks. JPMorgan
had 98 percent of its $142 billion in current value derivatives
holdings inside its bank in the first quarter of this year while
Citigroup had 89 percent of $112 billion, the records show. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., each of which
entered the commercial banking business in 2008 in the midst of
the financial crisis, would be less affected. Morgan Stanley
kept just over 1 percent of its $86 billion in derivatives
holdings in its bank in the first quarter, and Goldman Sachs
Group''s held 32 percent of its $104 billion. Bank of America
Corp., which absorbed broker-dealer Merrill Lynch in 2009, had
33 percent of its $115 billion in its bank. </p>
<p>Lincoln, a Democrat, contends the swaps-desk measure would
reduce taxpayers'' exposure to risky banking activities. The
banking industry has been lobbying against the idea for weeks,
saying it would drive up costs and send business to foreign
lenders. The trading numbers call into question the extent of
the impact and whether the congressional action would favor one
business model over another. While JPMorgan and Citigroup might
have to spend billions to re-capitalize their trading desks, the
three others might have much smaller costs. </p>
<p>Pick and Choose'' </p>
<p>Any time that Congress tries to pick and choose what
parts of the genie to put back in the bottle, we''re going to be
creating some pretty strange creatures, said Bill Brown, a
Duke University law professor and former global co-head of
listed derivatives at Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has the vast majority of swaps trades in its bank,
though the percentage may be inflated due to the double counting
of a small amount of transactions in other parts of the its
businesses, according to a person familiar with the company''s
derivatives operations. </p>
<p>Spokespeople for Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America
and Goldman Sachs declined to comment for this story. </p>
<p>$615 Trillion </p>
<p>The swaps-desk provision is the most contentious of a
larger set of rules aimed at reducing risk in the system by
imposing for the first time a regulatory structure for the $615
trillion over-the-counter derivatives market. The changes would
also require standardized derivatives trades to be cleared
through a third party and traded on an exchange or so-called
swap-execution facility and would regulate the foreign-exchange
swaps market. </p>
<p>A committee of lawmakers reconciling the House and Senate
versions of financial-regulatory reform is scheduled to take up
derivatives language tomorrow. Lawmakers said they have left it
for the end of the debate because of its complexity. </p>
<p>The swaps-desk measure introduced in April by Lincoln, who
is chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has cleared
several hurdles in the legislative process while being
criticized by the banking industry, the administration of
President Barack Obama, the Federal Reserve and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. Last week, seven U.S. regional lenders,
including U.S. Bancorp and SunTrust Banks Inc., came out against
the measure. </p>
<p>Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who
is leading the House negotiations, said in May that he thought
the Lincoln provision goes too far. He has changed his
stance recently, telling reporters yesterday that the
essence of the Lincoln proposal would be in the final
legislation. </p>
<p>Certainly they will be totally insulated from any insured
deposits, Frank said. </p>
<p>Volcker </p>
<p>Last month Frank raised the idea that one way to achieve
Lincoln''s goals without unintended consequences could be to
expand the scope of another proposal in the bill -- the so-
called Volcker rule, a ban on proprietary trading by banks. That
notion has failed to gain traction in the talks, because the
majority of the swaps trading by the banks is executed for other
customers and might not be covered by a prohibition on banks''
trading for their own accounts. </p>
<p>Negotiations have been continuing on possible exemptions
for banks to the Lincoln proposal for certain types of customer-
driven derivatives products. Frank said yesterday Lincoln has
pushed back against those, including an exemption for desks that
serve as market-makers. </p>
<p>Senator Lincoln wants that to go outside the depository
institution, Frank said. And I think she''s going to win that
one. </p>
<p>Lucrative Business </p>
<p>Selling over-the-counter derivatives is among the most
lucrative businesses for the largest financial companies. U.S.
commercial banks held derivatives with a notional value of
$212.8 trillion in the fourth quarter, according to the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency. JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of
America, Goldman and Morgan Stanley hold 97 percent of that
total. </p>
<p>The calculation of derivatives holdings for the five
largest banks is based on a Bloomberg News analysis of the
financial records of the bank holding companies and their
subsidiaries, as well as records filed with federal banking
regulators and posted publicly by the Federal Financial
Institutions Examination Council. </p>
<p>Swaps and other derivatives are financial instruments based
on the value of another security or benchmark. Some instruments,
including contracts that insured mortgage-backed bonds, have
been blamed for fueling a financial crisis that led to the worst
recession since the Great Depression. </p>
<p>Fed Lending </p>
<p>Lincoln and her supporters argue that separating swaps
trading from commercial banking would protect depositors and
other small customers from potentially risky trading that could
bring down a firm. They also say it would prevent bailouts by
denying swaps traders the assistance that the government gives
to banks, such as access to emergency lending from the Fed or
deposit insurance from the FDIC. </p>
<p>We view this as an essential component of making the
system sound so that we can get back to where banks are lending
to businesses that are growing and creating jobs, said Heather
Slavkin, a senior legal and policy adviser at the AFL-CIO.
When banks use their resources to gamble in the derivatives
markets, they have less capital to invest in businesses that
will create good jobs for working people and grow the middle
class. </p>
<p>Substantial Cost </p>
<p>Analysts from Citigroup last week wrote that longtime
commercial banks would bear the brunt of the rule, noting that
they would have to give up the benefit of funding their
derivatives deals with funds from deposits. The June 16 report
concluded that while it is very difficult to determine how
much it would cost to capitalize a free-standing swaps desk, the
price tag is likely to be substantial. </p>
<p>It all comes down to the cost of funding and it''s always
easier inside the bank where the credit rating is going to be
higher, the source of funding is more stable and it''s cheaper,
said Brian Gardner, an analyst at investment firm Keefe Bruyette
 Woods. Can you do it in a broker-dealer? Yep. People have
done it before and if they have to, they''ll do it again. </p>
<p>Short-Term Disadvantage </p>
<p>While the swaps-desk rule, if adopted, would put JPMorgan
and Citigroup at a short-term disadvantage with their
competitors, the big dealers have been arguing on Capitol Hill
that the bigger concern is that U.S. banks will be put at a
competitive disadvantage with foreign counterparts. Large
dealers such as Credit Suisse AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays
Plc, would be even less affected by the requirement, analysts
said. </p>
<p>Neither the European Union nor Asian countries are looking
at requiring banks to wall off their derivatives trading as part
of their responses to the credit crisis. </p>
<p>I''m getting a lot of calls, hearing from a lot from folks
who do this for a living and they really think this is going to
drive the business away from U.S. banks, Representative Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, said in an interview. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, agreed to pay $102 million to settle claims
by Massachusetts that the firm financed and securitized unfair
residential loans, state Attorney General Martha Coakley said. </p>
<p>Of the $102 million, $58 million will be earmarked for more
than 1,000 Massachusetts homeowners, with other funds set aside
for the Massachusetts Pension Fund for investment losses and the
commonwealth''s general fund, Coakley said today at a press
conference in Boston. </p>
<p>This has become an all-too-familiar pattern in which the
deceptive practices of Wall Street devastated homeowners and
investors, and ultimately contributed to the collapse of our
economy, Coakley said. Our extensive investigation revealed
that Morgan Stanley not only backed loans for homeowners that
they should have known were destined to fail, they also caused
additional damage in the subprime marketplace. </p>
<p>The bank is barred from making unfair loans and will be
required to make additional disclosures going forward, Coakley
said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is pleased to resolve this matter in a way
that will help many Massachusetts homeowners stay in their
homes, Jennifer Sala, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
bank, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>New Century </p>
<p>Coakley claimed Morgan Stanley provided billions of dollars
to subprime lender New Century, which used those funds to target
low-income borrowers and lure them into loans that consumers
predictably couldn''t afford to pay. The loans often were
unsustainable, though they were profitable for the lenders, she
said. </p>
<p>The settlement fund for Massachusetts homeowners will be
overseen by an independent trustee, according to settlement
papers filed in Massachusetts state court. </p>
<p>The bundling of the riskiest type of mortgages into
securities played a role in turning the U.S. housing slump into
a global recession as foreclosures deflated bond values and
toppled Wall Street firms including Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. The Massachusetts attorney general reached a $60 million
settlement last year with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley fell 77 cents, or 3 percent, to $24.26 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp., the largest computer-services provider, sued a former
technology services manager to keep her from working at Oracle
Corp., saying the new position violates a non-compete clause. </p>
<p>Joanne Olsen, a 31-year veteran of IBM, left the company
this month to become a senior vice president at Oracle,
according to the suit, filed June 16. As a general manager in
IBM''s technology services division, Olsen knew about IBM''s
growth strategies and potential acquisitions, the company said. </p>
<p>As a long time general manager in our services business
and as a member of the company''s leadership team, Joanne Olsen
possesses valuable confidential information about IBM and our
operations, IBM spokesman Doug Shelton said today in an e-
mailed statement. </p>
<p>IBM trails only Oracle and Microsoft Corp. in software
sales. Oracle bought Sun Microsystems Inc. in January for $7.4
billion to enter the server-computer market, where they''ll also
compete with IBM. </p>
<p>Olsen signed a non-compete clause in July 2009, stating she
can''t join a competitor for a year after leaving, according to
the suit. At Oracle, she would become senior vice president of
on-demand services, managing the delivery of its applications
and reporting directly to Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison,
it said. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, fell $1.92, or 1.48
percent, to $128.19 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
today. The shares were little changed this year before today. </p>
<p>The suit comes one year after IBM tried to keep David Johnson, its former head of mergers and acquisitions, from
joining Dell Inc., another server-computer rival. A judge
dismissed the case, saying Johnson didn''t have knowledge that
would qualify as quintessential trade-secret information. </p>
<p>Olsen''s lawyer, Michael Delikat, of Orrick Herrington 
Sutcliffe, couldn''t be reached for comment. Oracle spokeswoman
Deborah Hellinger also didn''t respond to requests for comment. </p>

<p>Visa Inc., the world''s biggest
payments network, is to blame for a U.S. Senate proposal that
would cap fees merchants pay to accept debit cards, Discover
Financial Services Chief Executive Officer David Nelms said. </p>
<p>Visa has tremendous market power in this area, and that''s
how we ended up here, Nelms said in an interview today after
Riverwoods, Illinois-based Discover posted second-quarter
results. Visa raised prices quite a bit and, I think, took the
actions that have led to the legislation in the first place. </p>
<p>The measure pushed by U.S. Senator Richard Durbin as part
of the financial-overhaul bill would empower the Federal Reserve
to set swipe fees, or interchange, that are reasonable and
proportional to the cost of processing debit transactions. The
Illinois Democrat and majority whip also backs a provision that
directs the Fed to issue rules barring networks from requiring
that their debit cards can only be used on one network. </p>
<p>That non-exclusivity rule may create an opportunity for the
Discover-owned Pulse debit network and other competitors to gain
market share. San-Francisco-based Visa accounted for 73 percent
of U.S. debit purchase volume last year. </p>
<p>That opens up the prospect that Pulse or other debit
networks could no longer be excluded from those cards, and that
could be a pro-competitive outcome, Nelms said. Discover
opposes Durbin''s proposed debit-fee caps as government price
controls could be a negative for consumers, Nelms said. </p>

<p>"The Odds Are Increasing That Microsoft''s Business Will Collapse"</p>

<p>That''s a pretty good title if you (like Henry Blodget from Silicon Alley Insider, the writer of the article) are trying to grab eyeballs. It also provides a useful introduction to what I call the "Innovator''s Paradox."</p>

<p>Blodget''s article was provocative. He argued that Microsoft is in a no-win situation. It isn''t sitting on any idea that is on the cusp of turning into a multi-billion dollar business. The personal computer is losing its dominance to mobile devices and tablets. The company''s core profit drivers (Windows and Office) are under disruptive assault from Google''s freely available applications and operating system. At best, Microsoft will respond with its own free products and erode its profit margin.</p>

<p>The most telling thing in Blodget''s post was a chart that showed the sources of Microsoft''s profits over the past few years. Microsoft''s core business has continued  despite continued proclamations of the company''s coming demise  to throw off cash and to grow. But new growth businesses that were specks in 2006 (entertainment and devices and online services) remain tiny, and Microsoft hasn''t created any material new businesses over the past few years.</p>

<p>So the real problem isn''t what Microsoft is doing today. It''s what Microsoft did, or didn''t do, five, or even 10 years ago. At the time, its base business was a bastion of strength. Today''s threats were in their infancies. It would have been the perfect time to plant seeds that today would be blooming profit generators. </p>

<p>Why didn''t it? It''s The Innovator''s Paradox: When you don''t need the growth, you act in ways that lead to you not getting the growth you will need. And when you do need the growth, you can''t act in ways that deliver it.</p>

<p>Got that?</p>

<p>I use this chart to illustrate this point. It''s helpful to stimulate discussion among a company''s leadership team.</p>

<p>As the chart shows, when times are going great ("exploitation"), companies have ample resources to invest in growth. But because times are going great, innovation efforts tend to be undisciplined. New growth efforts get flooded with cash. Companies don''t worry about iterating to find a successful business model. Overpriced acquisitions occur.
Then, inevitably, maturation sets in. The need for new growth intensifies. But resources are harder to come by. Acquisition targets would rather join forces with the new kid on the block whose rapidly appreciating stock acts as a powerful acquisition currency. The acute need for growth gives an almost gravitational pull to large, existing markets. After all, that''s where the money is. But large, existing markets are an innovator''s fool''s gold; glimmery, shiny, but not of much value.</p>

<p>So what do you do about the Innovator''s Paradox? Consider what my colleague Clark Gilbert found in his doctoral research. He looked at how newspaper companies responded to the Internet, intersecting the disruptive innovation research of Clayton Christensen and the famous behavioral research of Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.</p>

<p>Some companies in Gilbert''s study viewed the Internet as a threat. That led to them committing resources to innovation efforts. However, they responded in very rigid ways (typically creating replicas of the newspapers online). Other companies viewed the Internet as an opportunity. That framing allowed for more expansive response strategies, but made it difficult to support serious resource allocation. Gilbert summarized this challenge by saying, "Absent a sense of threat, response to disruptive opportunities is inadequate; but with threat, the fully funded response is too rigid."</p>

<p>The trick, Gilbert argued, was to decouple the allocation of resources from the use of the resources. Breaking the Innovator''s Paradox requires similar logic. Companies have to recognize that their core business, no matter how great it seems today, has a limit. That recognition should drive consistent allocation of resources to new growth efforts, especially when times are good. But those resources can''t be burdened with a "bunker" mentality, or else they will struggle. As one friend told me, "No great growth business was built from a defensive crouch." Further, companies have to make sure they avoid the "curse of abundance" that can lead overly resourced growth efforts to struggle.</p>

<p>So, all you have to do is invest when you don''t need to, break psychological barriers that might unintentionally inhibit creativity, and somehow avoid the abundant resources that would seem to be your primary source of competitive advantage. </p>

<p>No one said this was going to be easy.</p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan
Stanley led bank stocks lower, and bearish option trades jumped,
on concern that financial-reform legislation due to be completed
as soon as today may reduce Wall Street revenue. </p>
<p>The SP 500 Financials Index, which includes 79 financial
firms, dropped as much as 2.2 percent as JPMorgan and Wells
Fargo  Co. fell as much as 3.8 percent. Morgan Stanley dropped
as low as $24.22, its lowest intraday level since May 2009.
Trading of puts to sell the Financial Select Sector SPDR
exchange-traded fund was 2.6 times the four-week average. </p>
<p>Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are
negotiating the final language of legislation that may limit
banks'' trading in over-the-counter derivatives as well as how
they invest their own capital. Some analysts say the proposed
laws have become tougher in recent weeks. </p>
<p>It''s starting to really cross over, quite clearly, not
into the area of financial regulatory reform but into punishment
of Wall Street, Brian Gardner, a former congressional staffer
who is now a Washington analyst for Keefe, Bruyette  Woods
Inc., said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television.
It''s become a net negative. </p>
<p>The House and Senate conferees are debating a ban on
proprietary trading, nicknamed the Volcker rule after former
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, as well as a provision
championed by Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln that would
require commercial banks to push out their swaps-trading
operations. </p>
<p>Analysts Cut Estimates </p>
<p>The legislation comes as analysts reduce their forecasts
for bank and securities firm earnings in the second quarter
because of a reduction in investment banking and deterioration
in markets in May and June. Barclays Capital analysts slashed
their estimates for Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s second-quarter
earnings per share 63 percent yesterday to $1.95 from an earlier
forecast of $5.35. </p>
<p>There''s so much uncertainty around it and that''s why
people are scared, said Kevin Nichols, vice president for ETF
strategy at Newedge Group in New York. It also has to do with
regulators coming in to an industry that''s facing a lot of other
headwinds like slower investment banking business, analysts
cutting projections and lower volumes in equities. </p>
<p>The SP 500 Financials Index was down 1.95 percent as of
11:42 a.m. and JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
dropped $1.16, or 2.98 percent, to $37.73. </p>
<p>Almost 485,000 puts to sell the financial ETF changed
hands, 18 times the number of calls giving the right to buy. The
ETF tracking 79 companies fell 1.7 percent to $14.27 as all but
two members retreated. </p>
<p>The most active contracts were August $13 puts, which rose
37 percent to 37 cents and accounted for almost a third of all
options trading. The ETF hasn''t closed below $13 since July. </p>

<p>Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co., the two largest U.S. banks, drove a measure of
financial stocks to the biggest daily gain in a month after
Congress agreed to ease proposed curbs on trading and investing. </p>
<p>Bank of America and JPMorgan each rose more than 3 percent,
in line with a 3.1 percent advance in the Standard  Poor''s
Diversified Financials Index, as the Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell. It was the financial index''s largest one-day
increase since May 27. </p>
<p>The market is sort of celebrating the fact that the
largest banks'' operations are largely left intact, said Nancy Bush, founder of NAB Research LLC in Annandale, New Jersey, who
covers JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo  Co. Even so,
future expansion of the biggest banks may be limited, she said. </p>
<p>The so-called Volcker rule to ban banks from investing in
hedge funds and private equity was watered down a bit,
allowing lenders to invest as much as 3 percent of their
capital, Deutsche Bank analysts Matt O''Connor and Michael Carrier said in a note to clients. </p>
<p>A ban on derivative-trading by commercial banks proposed by
Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas was amended to allow trades
on interest rates and foreign-exchange swaps, which made up
about 92 percent of their total notional trading volume in the
first quarter. Banks will have as many as two years to comply. </p>
<p>What Senator Lincoln wanted to do didn''t come to pass and
that''s a major win for the big banks, said Gerard Cassidy, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets. </p>
<p>20-Hour Session </p>
<p>Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, rose
2.7 percent to $15.42. JPMorgan, based in New York, advanced 3.7
percent to $39.44. </p>
<p>Lawmakers from the House and Senate worked through the
night in a 20-hour session to reach deals on a ban on
proprietary trading by banks and oversight of the derivatives
market. The legislation, which also seeks to protect consumers
from abusive lending practices, still needs to be approved by
the full House and Senate. Congressional leaders aim to hold
votes next week and send it for Obama''s signature by July 4. </p>
<p>Obama today praised lawmakers for agreeing on what he
called the toughest consumer reforms in history. </p>
<p>The bill is not as bad as it looks, FBR Capital Markets
analyst Paul Miller wrote in a report. The conference
committee avoided adopting the worst-case scenario. </p>
<p>For example, congressional negotiators removed language
that would have required banks to act as a fiduciary when
selling derivatives to states, municipalities and pension funds,
Miller said. Instead, a code of conduct was adopted. </p>

JPMorgan Chase  Co. said, revising an earlier call for the

<p>The Bank of Canada named Goldman
Sachs Canada Chief Executive Officer Timothy Hodgson as a
special adviser to Governor Mark Carney, who also worked at the
investment bank. </p>
<p>Hodgson will work on developing rules for trading repos and
over-the-counter derivatives, and regulations to ensure banks
have enough capital, the Ottawa-based central bank said in a
statement today. A repo is a short-term contract to sell and
repurchase a security, and derivatives are securities whose
value depends on the value of another asset, such as crude oil. </p>
<p>The bank is privileged that someone of his experience has
chosen public service at this critical time, Carney said in a
statement. Carney and Hodgson worked together at Goldman Sachs
in New York from 1998-2000, Bank of Canada spokesman Jeremy Harrison said. </p>
<p>Canada and other Group of 20 nations are crafting rules to
have derivatives traded more through clearinghouses with
standardized contracts, Carney said in a June 10 speech in
Montreal. The global credit crisis was caused in part by
questions about the solvency of banks that led to the breakdown
of trading in important financial markets, he said in Montreal. </p>
<p>Carney earlier today was named to lead a group at the Bank
for International Settlements that monitors global financial
markets. </p>
<p>Ivey Graduate </p>
<p>Hodgson will work for an 18-month term in Toronto starting
Sept. 1. He will serve on bank committees that review
developments affecting monetary policy and the health of the
financial system. </p>
<p>Hodgson was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and has a Master of
Business Administration degree from the Ivey School of Business
at the University of Western Ontario. He has served as the head
of Goldman''s Canadian unit since 2005, and joined the firm in
1990. </p>
<p>Jack Curtin will replace Hodgson at Goldman Sachs on July
1, the New York-based company said today in a staff memo. Curtin
was chief executive of the bank''s Canadian unit from 1995 to
2000, and became chairman in 2002. He joined the firm in 1976
and is based in Toronto. </p>

<p>General Motors Co., preparing for an
initial public offering as soon as the fourth quarter, said U.S.
consumers are paying more per vehicle than last year. </p>
<p>Customers in the U.S. are paying $3,000 more on average for
GM''s cars and trucks, Mark Reuss, president of GM North America,
said today in a conference call as part of a daylong
presentation to analysts and potential investors. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ed Whitacre and other
top executives gave a review of Detroit-based GM''s current
business operations, including restructuring in Europe, growth
in other markets and 85 percent capacity utilization in North
America. The U.S., which holds 61 percent of the automaker, may
sell 20 percent of its stake in the IPO, making it a minority
owner, said two people familiar with the plan. </p>
<p>We are not re-introducing GM, Whitacre told the
audience at the automaker''s technical center in Warren,
Michigan. We are introducing a new GM. </p>
<p>Chevrolet has 94 percent of the Uzbekistan market, said Tim Lee, GM''s president of international operations. The automaker
also plans to grow significantly in South Korea, he said. </p>
<p>GM is now positioned to break even during troughs in
demand, Whitacre said. The management team is executing well, he
said. </p>
<p>Equity Value </p>
<p>The automaker''s equity is worth $70 billion, according to a
May 20 report by Eric Selle, a JPMorgan Chase  Co. debt analyst
who projects a return of 47 cents on the dollar for holders of
bonds issued by GM''s predecessor, General Motors Corp., that
will be converted to stock and warrants in new GM. At today''s
bond prices, GM''s equity is worth about $47 billion. </p>
<p>GM, the maker of the GMC Terrain, Cadillac SRX and
Chevrolet Camaro, reported first-quarter net income of $865
million, helped by higher production and smaller discounts.
Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell on May 17 called the
profit a good, useful step toward an IPO. </p>
<p>The company''s first-quarter operating profit was $1.2
billion in the first three months of the year, and the company
generated $1 billion in free cash flow, GM said. Revenue rose 40
percent from the same period a year earlier to $31.5 billion. </p>
<p>GM''s Opel and Vauxhall operations in Europe lost $506
million in the first quarter. GM is restructuring the business
with plans to take out 20 percent of its production capacity and
cut 8,300 jobs. </p>
<p>Changing Culture </p>
<p>GM is changing its culture by cutting the bureaucracy that
made the company so slow, said Vice Chairman Steve Girsky. His
industry-analysis group used to prepare 94 reports a month, he
said, and now it does three. </p>
<p>The company also has been moving executives to other
operations within the company to bring different perspectives,
he said. </p>
<p>That allows people to ask the basic stupid question that
hasn''t been asked for 30 years, Girsky said. </p>
<p>Board members thought that managers had too many direct
reports, with some exceeding 20, Girsky said. </p>
<p>Someone with 15 is pretty hard to find now, he said. </p>
<p>GM has the opportunity to increase annual sales by about
2.6 million vehicles by 2014 if GM holds its market share in key
regions, Liddell said. He cited a forecast from Lexington,
Massachusetts-based research firm IHS Automotive that calls for
annual global auto sales to grow by 25 million vehicles by 2014. </p>
<p>GM has a massive global opportunity if we are successful
maintaining market share, Liddell said. </p>
<p>Reducing Debt </p>
<p>The automaker also needs to reduce its debt, Liddell said.
Debt, preferred shares held by the U.S. Treasury and underfunded
pension plans total $42.2 billion while GM has $30 billion in
cash, he showed in a slide presentation. </p>
<p>GM''s pension plans are underfunded by $26.8 billion, GM
said. It doesn''t have to put any cash in now, Liddell said. </p>
<p>The company will probably have to put cash into the pension
fund, while investments could take care of some of the
shortfall, Liddell said. </p>
<p>The pension plan is a huge continuing liability,
Liddell said. Almost certainly we will have to put cash in at
some stage. Once fully funded, we''ll change the investment
strategy to lock in. </p>
<p>GM will most likely rely on outside lenders to finance the
sale of cars to consumers and dealers, Liddell said. Banks and
other financial institutions have better access to cheap funds
than GM, which doesn''t have investment-grade credit, he said. </p>
<p>Rather than saddle GM''s balance sheet with banking assets,
the company will find lenders to handle different types of
loans. GM has AmeriCredit Corp. handling subprime lending and
U.S. Bank for leasing and Ally Financial Inc., formerly GMAC
LLC, handling the bulk of dealer financing and car loans to
consumers. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has been
more responsive to information requests from the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission since being subpoenaed and has made
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein available for an
interview, the panel''s leaders said. </p>
<p>Blankfein was interviewed recently by FCIC staff at
length, commission Chairman Phil Angelides said today in a
conference call with journalists. Angelides said on June 7 that
the panel had subpoenaed Goldman Sachs after the bank tried to
hinder a probe by overwhelming the commission with documents. </p>
<p>I have no question that New York-based Goldman Sachs
will now cooperate with requests, FCIC Vice Chairman Bill Thomas
said today on the call. It was the lack of specificity, or
even the acknowledgement that what we asked for was in the piles
of documents we got, that was cleared up. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs executives including Chief Financial Officer
David Viniar will testify at a two-day FCIC hearing beginning
tomorrow reviewing the role of derivatives in the recession.
Also scheduled to testify is Joseph Cassano, the former American
International Group Inc. executive whose bets on subprime
mortgages led the insurer to the brink of collapse in 2008,
requiring a U.S. bailout. </p>
<p>This hearing is focused on derivatives which is a subset,
obviously, of what Goldman does, and if you want to get some
answers that are useful and meaningful you''d probably ask the
people who were head of that subset, Thomas said. </p>
<p>$12.9 Billion </p>
<p>After AIG''s bailout, Goldman Sachs collected $12.9 billion
tied to contracts with the New York-based insurer, including
derivatives. </p>
<p>AIG sold credit-default swaps to firms including Goldman
Sachs, Societe Generale SA and Deutsche Bank AG protecting them
against declines in the value of mortgages. When the housing
market collapsed, AIG didn''t have enough funds to honor its
contracts and turned to the U.S. for a rescue that swelled to
$182.3 billion. Cassano was interviewed for about five hours. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was sued in April by U.S. regulators for
misleading clients who invested in collateralized debt
obligations. The Securities and Exchange Commission said that
investors weren''t told that the hedge fund led by John Paulson
helped pick the mortgages in the CDOs and was betting on them to
fail. Goldman Sachs has said the suit is unfounded. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the highest-paying and most profitable firm
in Wall Street history, has been criticized by lawmakers as a
symbol of greed and excess. AIG and failed securities firm Bear
Stearns Cos. are among companies hobbled by losses on
investments from Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Credit-Default Swaps </p>
<p>The commission is investigating the causes of the credit
crisis, which followed the collapse of the housing market
beginning in 2007 and sparked the worst recession since the
1930s and the loss of more than 8 million U.S. jobs. It will
report its findings to Congress and President Barack Obama by
December. </p>
<p>Derivatives such as credit-default swaps contributed to the
crisis, making it difficult for regulators to understand how
interconnected financial firms had become after the bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. opened its first
redesigned store in Montebello, California, today as part of a
six-year plan to make its 350 retail outlets worldwide more
entertaining for shoppers. </p>
<p>The media company will open revamped locations 20 in the
U.S. and Europe by November, the start of the holiday shopping
season, Jim Fielding, president of Disney Stores Worldwide, said
in an interview. </p>
<p>Disney has consolidated its retail business after taking
back control over U.S. and Japan operations. The new stores will
let customers build characters from Disney''s Pixar Studio movie
Cars, interact with a magic mirror and watch clips from film
and TV shows in a movie theater with a 12-foot (3.6-meter)
screen. </p>
<p>Today in retail you have to be a special destination or
very, very price conscious, Fielding said. We''re going for
special. </p>
<p>Disney will next open revamped stores in Madrid, then in
Portugal and Italy, before an outlet at Roosevelt Field mall in
Garden City, New York, at the end of July, Fielding said. A
store in Santa Monica, California, is slated for Aug. 8. </p>
<p>The Montebello store features 13-foot plastic trees on
which Disney videos are projected. The goal is to keep shoppers
entertained in the store for 30 minutes, Fielding said. </p>
<p>Disney, which owns movie studios, theme parks and the ABC
and ESPN television networks, got about 6.7 percent of its $36
billion in revenue last fiscal year from the consumer-products
unit, which includes retail stores, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 92 cents to
$32.30 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares are little changed this year. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s Richard Berliand, who helped combine Bear Stearns Cos.''s prime brokerage
unit into the firm, is retiring after 23 years at the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets. </p>
<p>Berliand will be replaced by Sandie O''Connor, JPMorgan''s
global head of financing and market products, who has also spent
more than two decades at the company, according to a memo sent
to employees today from Carlos Hernandez, JPMorgan''s global head
of equities. </p>
<p>Richard''s deep understanding of our markets businesses
and the regulatory environment has enhanced our ability to stay
ahead of the changes occurring in our industry, Hernandez
wrote. The memo was confirmed by spokesman Brian Marchiony.
Financial News reported the move earlier today. </p>
<p>Berliand ran several global divisions during his career at
New York-based JPMorgan, overseeing cash equities, futures and
options. As the global head of prime services, he oversaw the
bank''s prime brokerage, futures and options as well as
derivatives-clearing operations. Berliand, who wants to spend
more time with his family, will stay for a month while O''Connor
transitions to her new role, Hernandez said. </p>
<p>O''Connor will work with the global equities group to expand
JPMorgan''s prime services business in Europe, the Middle East

overseeing JPMorgan''s prime custody solutions group, which acts
as a custodian for hedge funds and other large institutional
investors. </p>
<p>She previously oversaw global securities lending, clearing,
collateral management, foreign exchange, depository receipts and
execution services. </p>
<p>Jeremy Barnum, 38, a managing director in the bank''s global
fixed-income group, will take over Berliand''s duties chairing

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc may consider bidding for BP Plc after the London-based
oil company lost more than half of its market value in the wake
of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, JPMorgan Cazenove Ltd. said. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil has the stronger balance sheet and proven
ability to integrate a large transaction, according to Fred Lucas, a London-based analyst at JP Morgan. It could make a cash
and share offer, valuing BP at 473 pence a share compared with
yesterday''s close of 308.25 pence, and including a $50 billion
spin-off of BP''s downstream assets, according to JPMorgan. </p>
<p>BP''s market value has collapsed by more than $100 billion
since the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig that killed 11 crew members and caused the leak.
The company has set aside $20 billion to pay for Gulf
restoration and compensation claims and said yesterday the cost
of battling the spill had reached $2.65 billion. </p>
<p>Any potential attempt to buy BP would have to be backed by
ruthless integration, JPMorgan said. BP has many high

<p>Microsoft Corp. scrapped the new Kin
social-networking smartphone because sales fell well short of
the company''s expectations, a person with knowledge of the
decision said. </p>
<p>The phone''s high price contributed to lackluster demand,
said the person, who declined to be named because the
discussions were private. Microsoft announced plans to end work
on the Kin earlier today, saying it would focus on Windows Phone
software. The device debuted less than two months ago. </p>
<p>Kin, sold through Verizon Wireless, marked Microsoft''s
first major foray into the hardware design of a mobile phone. It
was part of a dual strategy of developing its own phone while
working on new Windows software for other companies'' handsets.
Verizon''s price cuts of the Kin on June 28 may have come too
late to save the phone. </p>
<p>Sales weren''t going that well at Verizon, so better to
kill it than have it fester on, said Ken Dulaney, a Gartner
Inc. analyst in Redwood City, California. Verizon did a very
poor job advertising this thing. The price of the data plan was
a killer. </p>
<p>Verizon required an unlimited data plan for $29.99, plus a
voice plan. The phones were released May 6 online and went on
sale in stores May 13. Those models will remain available. </p>
<p>We will continue to work with Verizon in the U.S. to sell
current Kin phones, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said
in a statement. </p>
<p>Brenda Raney, a spokeswoman for Basking Ridge, New Jersey-
based Verizon Wireless, said the Kin is still an important
part of our portfolio. </p>
<p>Lower Price </p>
<p>Verizon cut the price of the Kin One to $29.99 from $49.99,
with a $100 discount and a two-year contract. The price of the
Kin Two, which has a larger screen and takes sharper photos, was
reduced to $49.99 from $99.99. </p>
<p>The Microsoft team working on the product has been folded
into the Windows Phone unit, the company said today. A planned
release of the devices in Europe has been canceled. </p>
<p>Microsoft will now focus its attention on its mobile
operating system, which has been losing market share to software
from Apple Inc. and Google Inc. Mobile-phone makers will begin
offering devices with Windows Phone 7, a complete overhaul of
the software, later this year. It''s critical that those phones
fare better than the Kin, Dulaney said. </p>
<p>The big bet is on Windows Phone 7 -- if they don''t get
that right, they''re in big trouble, he said. The Kin was a

<p>To me, it''s simple, Cohn, 49, told the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission today, responding to a question about what
basis the New York-based bank had for marks on its securities.
The legitimacy of marks are demonstrated by actual trades and
the fact that we were willing and aggressively willing to
liquidate our portfolio back to our clients at those prices. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street record for a U.S.
securities firm''s profits in 2007, is battling accusations from

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. made Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein available for an interview
with the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission and has been more
responsive to information requests from the panel, the FCIC''s
leaders said. </p>
<p>Blankfein, 55, was interviewed recently by FCIC staff at
length as part of its probe into causes of the 2008 credit-
market freeze, commission Chairman Phil Angelides said yesterday
in a conference call with reporters. Angelides said on June 7
that the FCIC subpoenaed Goldman Sachs after the bank tried to
hinder a probe by overwhelming the panel with documents. </p>
<p>I have no question that New York-based Goldman Sachs
will now cooperate with requests, FCIC Vice Chairman Bill Thomas
said on the call. It was the lack of specificity, or even the
acknowledgement that what we asked for was in the piles of
documents we got, that was cleared up. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs executives including Chief Financial Officer
David Viniar and President Gary Cohn will testify at a two-day
FCIC hearing beginning today reviewing the role of derivatives
in the recession. Also scheduled to testify is Joseph Cassano,
55, the former American International Group Inc. executive whose
bets on subprime mortgages led the insurer to the brink of
collapse in 2008, requiring a U.S. bailout. </p>
<p>This hearing is focused on derivatives which is a subset,
obviously, of what Goldman does, and if you want to get some
answers that are useful and meaningful you''d probably ask the
people who were head of that subset, Thomas said, when asked
about the choice of executives to appear before the panel. </p>
<p>AIG Chief Risk Officer Robert Lewis will also testify as
will Martin Sullivan, who was ousted as the insurer''s CEO in
2008 after the company was overwhelmed by losses on real estate-
related bets that he had projected would be manageable. </p>
<p>Dinallo, Gensler </p>
<p>Ex-New York Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo and Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
are also scheduled to appear. The FCIC tried to compel former
Office of Thrift Supervision Director John Reich to testify,
said Tucker Warren, a spokesman for the commission. </p>
<p>The subpoena wasn''t served to Reich because he is outside
the U.S., Warren said. Attempts to reach Reich for comment
weren''t immediately successful. The OTS is one of AIG''s
regulators. </p>
<p>After AIG''s bailout, Goldman Sachs collected $12.9 billion
tied to contracts with the New York-based insurer, including
derivatives. AIG sold credit-default swaps to firms including
Goldman Sachs, Societe Generale SA and Deutsche Bank AG
protecting them against declines in the value of mortgages. When
the housing market collapsed, AIG didn''t have enough funds to
honor its contracts and turned to the U.S. for a rescue that
swelled to $182.3 billion. </p>
<p>Joseph Cassano </p>
<p>Cassano, who oversaw an AIG unit managing $2 trillion in
derivative trades, was interviewed for about five hours by FCIC
staff. He had previously shied away from public statements while
regulators investigated his role in the swaps trades, which he
said in 2007 would be profitable. </p>
<p>He was a person with extraordinary knowledge of the inner
workings of that company and the relationships with others,
Angelides said. </p>
<p>The U.K. Serious Fraud Office said on May 26 that a
review of the business Cassano oversaw didn''t turn up any
criminal violations. U.S. prosecutors also won''t bring charges,
a person familiar with the investigation said last month. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was sued in April by U.S. regulators for
misleading clients who invested in collateralized debt
obligations. The Securities and Exchange Commission said that
investors weren''t told that the hedge fund led by John Paulson
helped pick the mortgages in the CDOs and was betting on them to
fail. Goldman Sachs has said the suit is unfounded. </p>
<p>Bear Stearns </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the highest-paying and most profitable firm
in Wall Street history, has been criticized by lawmakers as a
symbol of greed and excess. AIG and failed securities firm Bear
Stearns Cos. are among companies hobbled by losses on
investments from Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>The commission is investigating the causes of the credit
crisis, which followed the collapse of the housing market
beginning in 2007 and sparked the worst recession since the
1930s and the loss of more than 8 million U.S. jobs. It will
report its findings to Congress and President Barack Obama by
December. </p>
<p>Derivatives such as credit-default swaps contributed to the
crisis, making it difficult for regulators to understand how
interconnected financial firms had become after the bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. acquired Tapulous
Inc., a developer of music-related video games for Apple Inc.''s
iPhone and iPad, to expand its mobile business. </p>
<p>Disney anticipates growth on Apple''s platforms and mobile
devices, Steve Wadsworth, head of the company''s Internet unit,
said today in an interview. Terms weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>With the deal, Burbank, California-based Disney becomes one
of the biggest developers of games for Apple''s App Store.
Tapulous has 30 million users and is profitable, according to
its website. Tap Tap Revenge, a top-selling download at the
App Store, is played by tapping a screen to the rhythm of a
song. While the software is free, players must buy new songs. </p>
<p>This is an extremely high-growth industry, both mobile
games and mobile media, Wadsworth said. We are there and we
want to continue to be there in a very big way. </p>
<p>Tapulous founder and Chief Executive Officer Bart Decrem,
operating chief Andrew Lacy and the development team are joining
Disney''s mobile-games group, Wadsworth said. </p>
<p>Their ability to effectively monetize, in a very
efficient way, games on these devices is very attractive,
Wadsworth said. Their insight into how that works will be very
helpful as we grow on these platforms. </p>
<p>Disney Characters </p>
<p>Decrem said in an interview he will be head of Disney''s
mobile division, which will create new titles based on Disney
characters and intellectual property, as well as continue to
distribute the Tap Tap Revenge games. </p>
<p>The deal came together over the past three to four months,
Decrem said. Tapulous was considering whether to raise another
round of funding from investors when it decided to join Disney
instead. </p>
<p>It''s a huge opportunity, he said. </p>
<p>The acquisition was reported earlier by industry website
TechCrunch.com. </p>
<p>Tapulous investors include Salesforce.com Inc. CEO Marc Benioff and Sun Microsystems Inc. co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim,
according to the company''s website. Steve Jobs, Apple''s chief
executive officer, is Disney''s biggest shareholder and a
director. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s biggest media company, fell 1 cent to
$31.49 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares have declined 2.4 percent this year. </p>

Harrington" date="Jul 01, 2010  5:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-01/goldman-sachs-pressed-by-u-s-financial-crisis-panel-for-derivatives-data.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Pressed for Derivatives Data</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. refused a
request from the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission to reveal
how much it makes trading derivatives, saying the bank doesn''t
separate the figure from other businesses. </p>
<p>Some other firms have provided us with that data when
we''ve asked for it and Goldman Sachs hasn''t, Commissioner
Brooksley Born said today in Washington on the second day of a
hearing investigating the role of derivatives in the 2008 credit
crisis, which sparked the worst recession since the 1930s. It
makes one wonder why Goldman has the incentive or impetus to not
release this information. </p>
<p>Banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
derivatives dealer, have provided estimates to investors. The
top five U.S. commercial banks, including Goldman Sachs,
generated an estimated $28 billion in revenue from privately
negotiated derivatives in 2009, according to company reports
collected by the Federal Reserve and people familiar with banks''
income sources. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm in
history, is being questioned about credit-default swap trades
with American International Group Inc., the insurer bailed out
by the U.S. government after AIG was unable to meet collateral
demands from trading partners on the contracts. The swaps, used
by Goldman Sachs and other banks to hedge against declines in
the value of mortgage-linked debt, caused losses at AIG as
housing prices collapsed. </p>
<p>It''s Integrated'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar
testified today that the firm has no way of separating out its
derivatives data from trading in cash securities. </p>
<p>We don''t have a separate derivatives business, Viniar
told the panel. It''s integrated into the rest of our
business. </p>
<p>Commissioner Byron Georgiou said he doubted Goldman Sachs
was unable to provide the information. </p>
<p>When you tell us that you don''t know how much you make in
your derivatives business, nobody here really believes it,
Georgiou told Viniar. Nobody here believes that you don''t know
how much money you''re making on the various aspects of your
business, it doesn''t make any sense. </p>
<p>$49.1 Trillion </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs held a gross amount of $49.1 trillion of
derivatives contracts as of March 31, according to an Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency report last month. The bank
reported total trading revenue of $7.65 billion during the first
quarter. That follows total trading revenue of $23.2 billion in
2009, according to a filing with the Federal Reserve. </p>
<p>It''s kind of dangerous, don''t you think, to claim to the
FCIC that you don''t know the profitability of a major line of
business, said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the
University of Houston. How can you rationally allocate
capital, for instance, if you don''t know the return to that
capital? </p>
<p>Under a March 2008 amendment to derivatives accounting
standards, companies are exempt from breaking out gains or
losses on derivatives used as part of a trading book that also
includes cash securities, if other information on the trading
activities is provided, according to the Financial Accounting
Standards Board''s Statement No. 161. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is definitely capable of providing the data
that was asked for, but I can understand their fear of doing
so, said Brian Yelvington, head of fixed-income strategy at
broker-dealer Knight Libertas LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut, and
a former credit swaps trader. </p>
<p>Derivatives Revenue </p>
<p>There is a potential for such a number to vastly
overstate the amount of profit or loss captured by a particular
business because much of that business may be symbiotic with
another, Yelvington said. They may have made money on the
derivatives leg of a trade, for example, and lost it on the cash
leg. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said in February 2009 that about 8 percent of its
total revenue from 2006 to 2008 came from derivatives in its
investment-banking unit, according to a presentation made to
investors. </p>
<p>That breakdown and revenue figures from regulatory filings
imply that half of JPMorgan''s $31.2 billion in trading revenue
those years came from derivatives, according to Alexander Yavorsky, a senior analyst at Moody''s Investors Service in New
York. </p>
<p>Highly Imprecise'' </p>
<p>Reporting a revenue number, just the profit on
derivatives without looking at cash positions associated with
hedging those, is going to be a highly imprecise exercise,
Yavorsky said in an interview today. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was subpoenaed by the commission last month
after the New York-based firm sent more than a billion pages of
documents to the panel, a shipment so sizable that panel members
called it an attempt to hinder their probe. </p>
<p>We did not ask them to pull up a dump truck to our
offices and dump a bunch of rubbish, Chairman Phil Angelides,
who previously served as California''s treasurer, said June 7.
This has been a very deliberate effort over time to run out
the clock. </p>
<p>The commission, which will report its findings to Congress
and President Barack Obama by December, said June 29 that the
bank had been more responsive to information requests since
being subpoenaed. Separately, Goldman Sachs faces a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission fraud suit over sales of a
mortgage-linked security. The bank has said the SEC suit is
unfounded. </p>
<p>Born''s Warning </p>
<p>Born had warned in 1998, as chairman of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, that the unregulated over-the-
counter derivatives market posed a danger to the global
financial system. She moved to address changes in how swaps
based on interest rates, commodities or currencies were traded
and was stopped by then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,
who all argued the market could regulate itself. </p>
<p>Born said last year that the banks that caused the crisis
were trying to stop the congressional overhaul of the market. </p>
<p>Special interests in the financial-services industry are
beginning to advocate a return to business as usual, Born said
in May 2009 as she accepted a Profile in Courage award from the
John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, hired 100 bankers to offer more products such
as jumbo mortgages and structured loans to Morgan Stanley Smith
Barney clients and may quintuple their numbers by the end of
2011, a person with knowledge of the strategy said. </p>
<p>The firm is building a private bank to squeeze more revenue
from clients and encourage them to hold deposits at the company.
Morgan Stanley''s wealth management group had $191 million of
interest income in the first quarter, a fraction of the $1.1
billion at Bank of America Corp.''s Merrill Lynch unit. Private
bankers offer loans, savings products and sometimes investment
advice to a bank''s wealthiest clients. </p>
<p>There is always this hidden opportunity of cross-sell,
said Steve Stelmach, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets in
Arlington, Virginia. Merrill Lynch has been successful in
offering mortgage products to their retail customers, so the
precedent is there. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley joins Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. in trying to do more business with wealthy customers as the
weak economy and new regulations make it harder to earn money
from loans and investment banking. Bankers have pushed cross-
selling for decades, often with little to show for it, to expand
their business without having to sign up new customers. </p>
<p>Fed Approves Application </p>
<p>Every major financial firm has decided they are going to
grab a piece of wealth management, whether it''s private banking
or advisory, said Jeanne Branthover, head of the financial-
services practice at Boyden Global Executive Search in New York.
The combination of financial advisers working with the private
bankers is becoming more common. Ten years ago, they were
totally separate. </p>
<p>Private bankers are usually paid a salary and a bonus,
while financial advisers'' compensation is based on commissions,
Branthover said. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York today approved Morgan
Stanley''s application to create Morgan Stanley Private Bank N.A.
It''s headed by Cece Stewart, 52, whom Morgan Stanley hired in
2008 from Wachovia Corp., where she had risen to executive vice
president from branch manager over three decades. The firm
started hiring the private bankers last year. </p>
<p>Boosting Loan Balances </p>
<p>The private bank plans to as much as triple its loan
balances to between $50 billion and $60 billion by the end of
2014, said the person, who declined to be named because the
plans haven''t been made public. The bank now has about $19
billion in loans largely from its previous lending efforts,
which mostly focused on agency mortgages, the person said. </p>
<p>The private bank will also offer deposit products to
clients who hold more than $1.6 trillion of assets in the
brokerage. Morgan Stanley considered buying a banking franchise
before deciding to build its own private bank in the first half
of 2009, the person said. That was the same year that Morgan
Stanley formed its brokerage, which has more than 18,000
advisers, when it bought a controlling stake in the joint
venture with Citigroup. Merrill Lynch, by comparison, has about
15,000 financial advisers. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, said
today it named Barry Sommers to lead an effort to boost the
share of assets it holds for its wealthiest client to more than
the current 5 percent. Sommers was named CEO of Retail Affluent
and Investment Services, giving him responsibility for the
bank''s 2,700 financial advisers. </p>
<p>Citigroup''s Hires </p>
<p>The initiative could increase pretax profits by $500
million to $1 billion annually, Charlie Scharf, JPMorgan''s head
of retail financial services, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Citigroup has hired about 15 private bankers since March
and will add another 115 over the next several years, spokesman
Mark Costiglio said in an interview last month. </p>
<p>Bank of America is trying to persuade its 12 million
customers to move funds from rival brokers to Merrill Lynch and
wants Merrill Lynch clients to transfer some of the $500 billion
they have at other banks, according to a May 10 presentation.
Wells Fargo is focused on 3 million customers who keep more than
$250,000 for investments at other companies, according to Senior
Executive Vice President David Carroll. </p>
<p>It''s often difficult to gauge how successful efforts to
sell clients new products are because banks rarely provide data
on their cross-selling efforts, said Stelmach, the FBR analyst. </p>
<p>Jumbo Mortgages </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is now offering jumbo mortgages, home-equity
lines and securities lending, said Armando Cabo, a private
banker who joined from JPMorgan this year. The bank plans to
offer some commercial loans to clients later this year, Cabo
said. It''s offering mortgages of up to $5 million and home-
equity lines up to $2.5 million, spokesman Jim Wiggins said. </p>
<p>The private bankers will work with financial advisers to
arrange lending options for clients, with the advisers remaining
the primary contact. Cabo said he''s working with about 80 to 90
advisers. </p>
<p>The firm has been offering aggressive interest rates to
win clients, said Shawn Rubin, a Morgan Stanley Smith Barney
financial adviser in New York. Lending and managing clients''
liabilities will probably be the highest-growth revenue source
of his business this year, Rubin said. </p>
<p>The markets have been very challenging for a while, and
clients are sort of used to the markets not doing a whole lot
for their net worth, Rubin said. So they are really focused
on the other avenues of wealth management, whether that''s risk
management or liability management. </p>
<p>Home-Loan Rates </p>
<p>Record low home-loan rates may prompt some clients who had
loans with other banks, including Citigroup''s private bank, to
refinance, providing a chance for Morgan Stanley to gain market
share, Rubin said. Rates for 30-year fixed loans declined to
4.69 percent in the week ended June 24, mortgage-finance company
Freddie Mac said last week. That''s below the previous record of
4.71 percent, set in the week ended Dec. 3. </p>
<p>Jumbo mortgages are larger than the ones that government-
supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can finance, now from
$417,000 to $729,750 in high-cost areas. About 10.3 percent of
U.S. prime jumbo mortgages which backed securities were at least
60 days late in May, according to Fitch Ratings. That''s up from
10.2 percent in April, marking the 36th straight increase for
serious delinquencies. </p>
<p>Compensation Ratio </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s wealth-management unit had revenue of
$3.11 billion in the first quarter, down from $3.14 billion in
the fourth. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, who led the
unit before succeeding John Mack in January, said in a letter to
shareholders this year that the joint venture will play an
increasingly important role in our growth and profitability. </p>
<p>The effort is likely to lower the wealth-management unit''s
compensation ratio over time, according to two people briefed on
the matter. The division''s ratio of compensation costs to
revenue was 64 percent in the first quarter, compared with 41
percent in the institutional securities business, which includes
the trading and investment banking units. </p>
<p>We''re making huge investments on the lending front,
because Morgan Stanley did not do things like non-conforming
mortgages and structured or tailored loans, and we had that
through Citi''s private bank, Charles Johnston, president of
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, said in an interview in April.
There''s a huge opportunity there, and we''ve got that now,
we''ve built that. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank, named Barry Sommers to lead an effort to
boost the share of assets it holds for its wealthiest clients to
more than 5 percent. </p>
<p>Sommers, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Securities,
will become CEO of retail affluent and investment services,
JPMorgan said today in a statement from Business Wire. He''ll
report to Charlie Scharf, head of retail financial services. </p>
<p>Our initiative will help us serve customers better and
could increase pretax profits by $500 million to $1 billion
annually, Scharf said in the statement. </p>
<p>Banks including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and
Wells Fargo  Co. are encouraging wealthy customers to do more
business with them as the weak economy and new regulations make
it harder to earn money from loans and investment banking.
Morgan Stanley plans to hire as many as 500 bankers to build its
private bank, a person familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>The customers JPMorgan distinguishes as affluent typically
have at least $500,000 in investable assets, spokesman Thomas Kelly said in a telephone interview. JPMorgan Securities was
formerly known as Bear Stearns Private Client Services. </p>
<p>JPMorgan shares, down 15 percent this year compared with a
6.6 percent decrease in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials
Index, fell 3 percent to $35.48 as of 11:27 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, hired Frank Barron, a litigation partner at
Cravath, Swaine  Moore LLP, to replace Gary Lynch as chief
legal officer. </p>
<p>Barron, 59, will join the firm in New York after more than
30 years at Cravath, Morgan Stanley said today in a statement.
Lynch, 59, who announced in February that he would step down
from his post, will remain vice chairman and a member of the
firm''s operating and management committees. </p>
<p>Eric Grossman, the bank''s general counsel for the Americas
and global head of litigation, was appointed to Morgan Stanley''s
management committee, the New York-based firm said. Grossman was
a candidate for the chief legal position, a person briefed on
the matter said in February. </p>
<p>The partnership between Frank and Eric will provide
tremendous leadership on the legal and regulatory fronts in this
challenging period for the securities industry, Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman said in an internal memo obtained
today by Bloomberg News. Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Jeanmarie McFadden confirmed the memo''s contents. </p>
<p>Barron was among Cravath lawyers who advised Morgan
Stanley''s board on its conversion to a bank holding company and
on Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.''s $9 billion investment
in the firm as its stock plunged after Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.''s bankruptcy in 2008, according to the law firm''s website. </p>
<p>Represented Banks </p>
<p>Barron also represented National City Corp.''s board in its
2008 sale to PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and CSX Corp.,
the third-largest U.S. railroad, in its defense against activist
hedge funds seeking seats on its board. Barron has also served
banks including Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS
AG, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Barron, a Boston native, graduated from Harvard University
in 1973 and Harvard Law School in 1978. He joined Cravath that
year, rising to partner in 1985. </p>
<p>Lynch headed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission''s
enforcement division from 1985 to 1989 and led insider-trading
investigations of Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken. Former Morgan
Stanley CEO John Mack hired Lynch to work at Credit Suisse First
Boston in 2001 and then at Morgan Stanley when Mack moved there
in 2005. Mack stepped down as CEO at the beginning of this year
and remains chairman. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives
repeated their position that disputes with American
International Group Inc. over securities prices and collateral
in 2007 and 2008 reflected the firm''s typical risk-management
efforts. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer David Viniar and David Lehman, co-
head of the firm''s structured products group trading desk, are
scheduled to testify this morning before the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission in Washington. Their prepared testimony
replays comments made yesterday by President and Chief Operating
Officer Gary Cohn and Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick. </p>
<p>We established credit terms with AIG consistent with
those extended to other major counterparts, including collateral
arrangements that we tightly managed, Viniar said in prepared
remarks. As we do with many other counterparty relationships,
we limited our exposure to AIG through a combination of
collateral and market hedges. </p>
<p>The FCIC, led by Chairman Philip Angelides and Vice
Chairman William Thomas, today holds its second day of a two-day
hearing into the role that derivatives played in the credit
crisis, with a focus on the relationship between Goldman Sachs
and AIG, the insurer that had to be bailed out by the federal
government. Members of the committee repeatedly questioned
yesterday whether Goldman Sachs marked down the value of its
complex trades with AIG to force AIG to pay collateral. AIG
disputed Goldman Sachs''s marks as too low. </p>
<p>Clients Complained </p>
<p>The committee released internal e-mails yesterday that
showed Goldman Sachs employees discussing other clients such as
Tokyo-based AIOI Insurance Co. complaining that Goldman Sachs
was marking mortgage-backed securities at prices that were
more than twice as bad as the second worst dealer''s.
Angelides asked Goldman Sachs yesterday to provide information
about how the firm derived the prices it set on its trades with
AIG, and Cohn agreed to do so. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, whose record profits in 2007 were helped in
part by the firm''s negative bets on subprime mortgage-related
securities, is fighting accusations from regulators, members of
Congress and former clients that the firm designed securities it
knew would fail and bet on their collapse by buying credit-
default swaps, which pay out in the event of a default. Goldman
Sachs has denied any wrongdoing. Cohn said yesterday that the
firm had shorted just 1 percent of the mortgage-backed
securities and collateralized debt obligations the company
underwrote between December 2006 and June 2007. </p>
<p>Pricing Sources </p>
<p>In his testimony today, Lehman will say that the firm''s
prices were based on two main sources: the marks of comparable
transactions trading in the market and information obtained from
market participants through bid or offer prices for similar
securities or derivatives. </p>
<p>We would collect information generated by these
comparable transactions, Lehman says in his testimony. Then,
we would perform a variety of analyses on the collected
comparables in order to gain a sense of the market value of the
Goldman/AIG swaps from the pricing reflected in actual market
transactions in similar derivatives. </p>
<p>Viniar and Lehman will testify today alongside former AIG
Chief Financial Officer Steven Bensinger and other AIG
executives. </p>
<p>Lawmakers appointed the 10-member FCIC last July to
investigate the causes of the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression. The panel has until December to report its
findings to Congress. </p>

<p>Investors should bet that longer-term
interest rates will rise faster than short-dated ones as central
banks maintain low interest rates as the recovery takes hold,
according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Five-year notes will perform best, making the most
profitable trades to buy them against 10-year and 30-year bonds,
fixed-income strategists led by Jim Caron in New York wrote in a
research report dated yesterday. Five-year rates will fall
relative to two-year ones, they said. </p>
<p>Economic stability is an underpriced risk that we believe
will be the surprise for the market in the second half of the
year as it ignites an asset reflation trade, the strategists
said. Much of the double dip and deflation fears are already
priced. European sovereigns muddle along and the risk premium
assigned to them declines. This will allow the forces associated
with global growth to reassert themselves, producing higher
yields and steeper curves. </p>
<p>The premium that investors demand to hold 10-year U.S.
Treasuries over five-year notes narrowed one basis point to 115
basis points as of 9:37 a.m. in London. The so-called yield
spread was at 137 basis points on March 9. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. could have
done a better job managing reputational risks as it navigated
the credit crisis and has since reconsidered some decisions,
said President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn. </p>
<p>We''ve done a good job. Could we have done a better job?
Sure. Cohn, 49, said yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg
Television. With hindsight, I know a lot more today than I did
back then. </p>
<p>Cohn spoke after testifying before the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission, where he answered questions about the firm''s
derivatives business and particularly its interactions with
American International Group Inc., the insurer that was bailed
out by the U.S. government. Goldman Sachs''s reputation was
marred in April when the Securities and Exchange Commission sued
the firm for fraud over sales of a mortgage-backed security. The
bank has denied wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Based on all our internal data, we are doing fine, we are
doing well with our clients, Cohn said. We continue to be at
the center of all flows, we continue to be engaged with clients,
we continuously are winning business. </p>
<p>Financial regulatory reform legislation, which passed the
House of Representatives yesterday and still needs Senate
approval, will require New York-based Goldman Sachs to hold more
capital, to be less leveraged, and to abandon pure proprietary
trading, he said. He didn''t rule out the possibility that the
firm could give up its bank holding company status sometime in
the future. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. is talking with a
number of banks about setting up a revolving line of credit that
may be worth $5 billion or more, said two people with knowledge
of the plan. </p>
<p>The automaker could use the credit line to pay business
costs while using its cash to pay off more expensive debt, said
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
plan is private. GM also wants to get a line of credit to
establish relationships between the company and a variety of
banks, the people said. </p>
<p>The arrangements aren''t complete and the values may change,
both people said. </p>
<p>Noreen Pratscher, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based GM,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on GM seeking a
line of credit. </p>
<p>GM is also talking with several major banks to arrange more
options for customers'' car loans, one of the people said. GM
uses Ally Financial Inc., formerly GMAC LLC, for the bulk of its
auto lending. Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp handles leasing and
AmeriCredit Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas, does subprime lending
for GM''s customers and dealers. </p>
<p>GM Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said at an
investor conference June 29 that GM will look at a variety of
lending sources for consumer car loans rather than carrying the
assets and liabilities of an in-house lending business on its
own books. </p>

<p>General Motors Co.''s first-half sales
in China surpassed those in the U.S. for the first time as the
world''s fastest-growing major economy propelled global auto
demand. </p>
<p>Sales in China by GM and its joint ventures totaled
1.21 million vehicles in the six months ended June 30, topping
U.S. deliveries of 1.08 million, based on figures reported
separately by the Detroit-based company. This would be the first
time any overseas market has consistently outsold GM''s
domestic market in the carmaker''s 102-year-old history, said
Michael Albano, a Shanghai-based spokesman. </p>
<p>Surging demand among China''s 1.37 billion people is
speeding automakers'' recovery after a recession cut global auto
sales last year and forced GM''s predecessor, General Motors
Corp., into bankruptcy. GM is counting on expansion overseas to
bolster profit as it prepares for an initial public offering as
early as the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>China is one of GM''s bright spots globally, said John Zeng, a Shanghai-based automotive analyst at IHS Global Insight.
GM has done a better job in the Chinese market than other
American automakers. The huge potential in this market will
continue to fuel GM''s growth here. </p>
<p>Government stimulus measures helped China''s industrywide
vehicle sales jump 46 percent last year to 13.6 million,
surpassing the U.S. for the first time to become the world''s
largest national automobile market. U.S. auto sales fell
21 percent to 10.4 million, the fewest since 1982, as
unemployment rose amid the worst recession in six decades. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
growth forecast for China this year to 10.1 percent from 11.4
percent as government restrictions on lending and real estate
slow expansion in the world''s fastest-growing major economy. </p>
<p>Asian stocks fell after the report fanned concern that
slower growth in China will undermine the global recovery. Hours
after Goldman''s revision, China increased its estimate for last
year''s growth to 9.1 percent, signaling output almost matched
Japan''s as the world''s second-largest economy. </p>
<p>Goldman joins BNP Paribas, Macquarie Securities Ltd. and
China International Capital Corp. in reducing estimates as the
government tightens property restrictions to prevent overheating.
A third of China economists may cut overly bullish forecasts
for 2010 and 2011 in coming weeks, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
economist Lu Ting said in a June 30 note to clients. </p>
<p>China''s growth has been slowing down sharply and the
tightening measures we saw in April on property have been quite
aggressive, Isaac Meng, a Beijing-based economist at BNP
Paribas, said in a phone interview today. </p>
<p>The government won''t launch easing measures in the short
term as the major concerns, especially about the property bubble,
haven''t been fully addressed, Meng said. BNP this week reduced
China''s 2010 growth forecast to 9.8 percent from 10.5 percent. </p>
<p>Manufacturing in the nation, the world''s biggest maker of
computers and mobile phones, expanded at the slowest pace in 16
months, a survey of purchasing managers showed yesterday. Stocks
declined around the world this week on evidence that a cooling
China combined with austerity measures in Europe and slower
growth in the U.S. will hurt the global recovery. </p>
<p>Stocks Fall </p>
<p>The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.3 percent to 111.64 as
of 6:06 p.m. in Tokyo, the fourth straight decline. The gauge
has slumped 14 percent from its high this year on April 15. The
Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of China''s
stock exchanges, slid to its lowest level in 14 months this week. </p>
<p>Liao Qun, a Hong Kong-based economist at Citic Bank
International Ltd, today lowered his forecast for China''s growth
this year to 10.1 percent from 10.3 percent, citing the property
sector, the European crisis and the government''s 0.4 percentage
point upward revision to 2009 gross domestic product. </p>
<p>The adjustment put the value of last year''s GDP at 34.05
trillion yuan, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a
statement on its website. The figure translates to $4.98
trillion based on the average exchange rate between the yuan and
the dollar in 2009, suggesting Japan retained its position as
the second-largest economy with output of $5.07 trillion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>More Sustainable Pace </p>
<p>Analysts including Sun Mingchun at Nomura Holdings Inc. say
China''s moderation is a sign that the government is moving the
country to a more sustainable pace of expansion after a 4
trillion yuan stimulus package drove an 11.9 percent rebound in
the first quarter. </p>
<p>The June PMI data confirms that the manufacturing sector
still remains in a solid expansion stage, Sun, a Hong Kong-
based economist at Nomura, said in a note yesterday. If the
decline does not continue for too long, it should prove a
healthy correction that reduces the risk of the economy
overheating. </p>
<p>China''s economy is moving in the expected direction,
Premier Wen Jiabao said in meetings with businesspeople and
economists this week. Policy makers will further cement and
develop the positive economic trend amid an extremely
complicated domestic and global outlook, he said. </p>
<p>Macquarie cut its growth estimate for China to 9.5 percent
to 10 percent from a previous 10 percent to 10.5 percent last
month and CICC said in May that growth would likely ease to 9.5
percent from a previous estimate of 10.5 percent. </p>
<p>The momentum of growth has moderated as expected, but we
do not see a sharp slowdown in China, Liu Li-Gang, economist
at Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said in Hong Kong.
With this moderation, this will be a good thing for policy
makers that they don''t have to tighten excessively. </p>

<p>Electricite de France SA, Europe''s
biggest power generator, is facing demands to justify ballooning
cost estimates for extending the lives of French nuclear
reactors as the government opens the market to competitors. </p>
<p>Many decisions will hinge on the cost estimates,
including the rates rivals will pay for EDF electricity
supplies, Pierre-Franck Chevet, the top official at France''s
Energy Ministry, said in an interview. We will need some
estimates to set the rates next year, he said. </p>
<p>EDF will have to spend about 600 million euros ($750
million) on each of its 58 reactors to keep them in service for
longer, according to Chief Executive Officer Henri Proglio.
That''s 50 percent more than an estimate given earlier this year.
The utility will have to fork out almost 35 billion euros in 20
years to keep aging plants in working order, the CEO has said. </p>
<p>Cost estimates have taken on greater urgency as lawmakers
study a planned electricity market law that may force EDF to
sell about a quarter of the power from its nuclear reactors to
GDF Suez SA and others. The law, in the Senate after approval by
the National Assembly last month, follows probes by European
Union regulators into EDF''s dominance in the French market. </p>
<p>While the work on EDF''s reactors won''t start until the next
decade, the government needs rough cost estimates to calculate
the wholesale power rates the utility can charge rivals on what
may be as much as 100 terawatt-hours a year. The price will be
set by the government in consultation with the energy regulator
after the law is passed. </p>
<p>Explain Costs </p>
<p>The ministry has ordered state-owned EDF to spell out costs
to upgrade the French plants, which are on average 24 years old,
Chevet said. </p>
<p>Extending French reactor operations will be one of the
most important issues for the next two or three years, Chevet
said. I do not know the basis of the 400 million euros or the
600 million euros at this stage. </p>
<p>EDF''s 30-year-old French nuclear reactors are now
undergoing inspections by the Autorite de Surete Nucleaire,
France''s nuclear safety watchdog, to determine whether they can
operate for another decade. </p>
<p>Keeping them going for more than four decades would be
cheaper than building new ones, such as the EPR model the
utility is developing for 4 billion euros in Flamanville,
Normandy. </p>
<p>Precise Information </p>
<p>We want this examined in-depth, Chevet said. It''s
not simple, there are a lot of technical issues. Getting more
precise information could take at least a year and will depend
on how long EDF wants to operate the reactors. </p>
<p>Proglio has described the proposed power law as
expropriation and warned against the pillage of the
utility by setting the price too low. At a Senate hearing last
month, Proglio said the minimum price should be 42 euros a
megawatt hour, which should be progressively raised to 45
euros a megawatt-hour to include costs of extending the lives of
French reactors. </p>
<p>French regulated rates for households currently assume EDF
base power supply costs of about 34 megawatts an hour. EDF''s
rivals say that is about where the wholesale price should be set
to enable them to compete on that market. </p>
<p>GDF Suez, the former French gas monopoly which operates
seven reactors in Belgium, has estimated costs to extend the
lifetime of its reactors at about 400 million euros each,
although this has to be evaluated plant by plant and depends on
the extension, Chief Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet said
this week following a hearing at the French Senate. </p>
<p>Industrial Challenge </p>
<p>Extending the lives of nuclear reactors is an industrial
challenge and it''s to be expected that the wholesale price will
permit this when the time comes, and I repeat when the time
comes, Mestrallet told lawmakers. </p>
<p>Making rivals pay up front for the costs isn''t right, he
said. EDF''s share price could rise or fall by 1.50 euros for
each year the average lifetime of the reactors is extended or
reduced, according to Louis Boujard, an analyst at Aurel BGC in
Paris. </p>
<p>EDF must come up with a solid case, to justify the cost
estimates, Chevet said. The costs depend a lot on the extent
of the extension that is envisaged. </p>

<p>India''s current-account deficit may
remain high this year as economic growth boosts imports,
adding pressure on the rupee to weaken in the near term, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>There are near-term weakening pressures on the rupee
exacerbated by external uncertainties, Goldman Sachs
economists Pranjul Bhandari and Tushar Poddar wrote in a report
to clients yesterday. </p>
<p>The current-account gap, a measure of trade and investment
flows, widened to a record $13 billion in the quarter through
March, the central bank said June 30, sending the rupee headed
to its biggest weekly loss in a month. The currency slid 0.7
percent this week to 46.625 per dollar at 1:30 p.m. in Mumbai. </p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India yesterday said India has become
more vulnerable to slowdowns and financial crises abroad as
foreign trade plays a bigger role in the economy. Trade
represented 35 percent of gross domestic product in the year
ended March 31, 2008, from 21 percent a decade earlier,
according to the central bank. </p>
<p>Goldman economists expect the rupee to gain over a six-to-
12-month period as faster growth attracts foreign investments. </p>
<p>Goldman forecasts the rupee to touch 47.5 against the
dollar in three months, 46 in six months and 44.5 in a year,
according to the note. </p>
<p>India''s $1.2 trillion economy may expand 8.5 percent in the
year ending March 31, from 7.4 percent in the previous year,
according to the finance ministry. </p>
