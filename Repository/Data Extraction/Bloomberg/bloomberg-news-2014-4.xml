&lt;p&gt;Experimental breast cancer drugs from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) slowed or halted growth of advanced tumors in studies, potentially adding a new treatment option for patients and top-selling therapies for the companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s palbociclib doubled to 20.2 months the time in which patients&#8217; advanced breast cancer didn&#8217;t progress, the drugmaker said today. In an unrelated study, Lilly&#8217;s drug, bemaciclib, aided 61 percent of patients with metastatic, hormone-sensitive breast cancer, meaning the size of their tumors shrunk by 30 percent or didn&#8217;t increase for 24 weeks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors and investors have been awaiting results for the medicines, part of a class called cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors. The therapies offer a new treatment avenue for about 80 percent of patients whose breast tumors are hormone receptor-positive. Palbociclib is projected to sell $3.11 billion in 2020 as it expands to fight other cancers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We took a new drug and asked how it works in a specific set of breast cancers based on science,&#8221; said Richard Finn, an associate professor at the University of California at Los Angeles&#8217;s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, and co-principal investigator of Pfizer&#8217;s study. &#8220;This is really the type of benefit we&#8217;re aiming for, and it&#8217;s the type of benefit that results from a rational development program.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government Pension Investment
Fund revamped its 22.1 trillion yen ($214 billion) Japanese
stock portfolio, adding new managers and investment styles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest pension fund will reduce passive
investments that track the Topix index and add the JPX-Nikkei
400 Index among new benchmarks, according to an April 4
statement. Traditional active investments will be trimmed to
make room for smart-beta strategies, GPIF said. The JPX-Nikkei
400, a stock gauge that is the brainchild of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, started in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We aimed for an overhaul that would show just what kind
of stock investment GPIF is targeting,&#8221; Tokihiko Shimizu,
director of general of the research department at GPIF, said
April 4. &#8220;We made bold changes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new strategy comes amid pressure on GPIF, which has
more than half its 128.6 trillion yen of assets in Japanese
bonds, to achieve higher returns to cover pension payouts for an
aging population. A panel handpicked by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last year recommended that the fund move beyond passive
stock investments using the Topix as a benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;GPIF is changing in several ways, or at least I sense
their will to change,&#8221; said Kazuyuki Terao, Tokyo-based chief
investment officer at Allianz Global Investors Japan Co. &#8220;JPX-Nikkei 400 is designed to encourage investment in stocks with
high return on equity, which aims to change corporate governance
using the power of the market. Plus, they&#8217;re trying to boost
returns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPIF selected 14 active and 10 passive investment managers,
eight of which had existing mandates from the fund, according to
last week&#8217;s statement. It also said it will make passive and
active investments in Japanese real-estate investment trusts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund will introduce a performance-based fee structure
for active managers, it said. GPIF paid fees to domestic stock
managers equating to 0.04 percent of the assets they oversaw in
the year ended March 31, 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smart Beta &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart beta occupies a middle ground between passive funds
and active management. Designers of the benchmarks used in the
strategy build their own indexes or change existing ones, trying
to boost returns by ranking companies not by price, but by
measures such as volatility and dividend payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPIF&#8217;s three smart-beta managers will include Goldman Sachs
Asset Management Co., according to last week&#8217;s announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset&#8217;s benchmark is the SP GIVI Japan
index, which weights stocks based on their &#8220;intrinsic value&#8221;
calculated by assessing the value of each company&#8217;s assets and
their forecast earnings growth, according to the website of SP
Dow Jones Indices LLC, which created the gauge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPIF said it named Diam Co., Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank
Ltd. and Mitsubishi UFJ Trust  Banking Corp. to oversee passive
JPX-Nikkei 400 investments, with BlackRock Japan Co. using the
MSCI Japan Index and Mizuho Trust  Banking Co. investing based
on the Russell Nomura Prime Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shares Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPX-Nikkei 400 slid 6.3 percent this year through last
week, compared with a 6.6 percent decline for the 1,780 member
Topix and 7.5 percent for the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All shares were generally bought together in the past,
but that&#8217;s going to change, with some being chosen and others
not,&#8221; Allianz&#8217;s Terao said. &#8220;The government is trying to use
that to improve corporate governance and profitability. I hope
that&#8217;ll help improve Japan&#8217;s financial markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 4 (Bloomberg) -- Companies powered the U.S. job

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Andrew Zajac" date="Apr 07, 2014  7:34 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-07/disney-and-other-studios-sue-megaupload-over-copyright-claims.html"><headline>Disney, Movie Studios Sue Megaupload Over Copyright Claims</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Disney Enterprises Inc., Warner
Bros. Entertainment Inc. and four other movie studios accused
the closed file-sharing service Megaupload.com of massive theft
of intellectual property in a copyright-infringement lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While billing itself as a private data storage provider,
Megaupload.com functioned as a hub for uploading and downloading
copyrighted movies and TV shows, according to the complaint
filed today in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, which
names Megaupload Ltd., the owner of the Megaupload.com website,
company founder Kim Dotcom, a second company and two other
individuals as defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom was accused in an indictment unsealed in January
2012 of belonging to a global criminal organization prosecutors
called Mega Conspiracy that was involved in copyright
infringement and money laundering and generated more than $175
million in illicit proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When Megaupload.com was shut down in 2012 by U.S. law
enforcement, it was by all estimates the largest and most active
infringing website targeting creative content in the world,&#8221;
Steven Fabrizio, senior executive vice president and global
general counsel of the Motion Picture Association of America,
said in today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megaupload.com had &#8220;a business model designed to encourage
theft -- and make its owners very rich in the process,&#8221;
Fabrizio said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Bogus&#8217; Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The @MPAA repeats bogus DOJ claims that we induced
copyright infringement. No. 1 reward rule published on MU site:
&#8216;No copyright infringement,&#8217;&#8221; according to a post on Kim
Dotcom&#8217;s Twitter feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studios&#8217; lawsuit is a meritless re-hash of issues
raised in the criminal case, Ira Rothken, Dotcom&#8217;s San Rafael,
California-based attorney, said in a phone interview. &#8220;We will
vigorously defend against the claims,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megaupload.com built up its library of illicit offerings by
encouraging users to upload movies and other entertainment
through an &#8220;Uploader Rewards&#8221; program. Amounts paid through
the program were based on how often pirated material was
downloaded for viewing by others, according to the studios&#8217;
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megaupload.com made money by charging subscriptions
enabling faster downloads and by selling advertising on the
heavily trafficked website, the movie makers said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rewards Program &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothken said the rewards program was limited to files that
are far too small to transmit movies. The studios&#8217; assertion the
rewards program encouraged copyright infringement &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t
pass the giggle test,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom and two others named in the complaint, Mathias
Ortman, a German citizen, and Bram van der Kolk, a Dutch
citizen, are fighting extradition from New Zealand, according to
Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ortman and van der Kolk provided technological expertise to
Megaupload and are part-owners of it, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, a New Zealand appeals court ruled that search
warrants used in a 2012 raid on Dotcom&#8217;s home were valid,
bolstering the U.S. effort to extradite him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit also names Vester Ltd., a Hong Kong company of
which Dotcom is the sole shareholder. Vester is majority
shareholder of Megaupload Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the unit of Burbank, California-based Walt Disney (DIS)
Co., plaintiffs in the case include Paramount Pictures Corp.,
Universal City Studios Productions LLLP, Columbia Pictures
Industries Inc. and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Twentieth Century Fox v. Megaupload.com, 14-cv-362, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia
(Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Charles Mead" date="Apr 07, 2014  6:47 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-07/jpmorgan-deutsche-bank-said-to-manage-potential-greek-bond-sale.html"><headline>JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank Said to Manage Potential Greek Bond Sale</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Greece tapped JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
and Deutsche Bank AG to manage an expected debt offering as it
seeks a return to the capital markets, according to people with
knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms will underwrite the deal as the nation with the
worst jobless rate in the euro area attempts to sell bonds for
the first time since being shut out in early 2010, said the
people, who asked not to be identified, citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece&#8217;s Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras suggested last
week that the government would issue notes in the first half of
2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing confidence among officials on the prospect of
selling debt has risen as bond yields have fallen to a four-year
low. Their optimism rests on the premise of persuading investors
that Greece will shake off a six-year recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on Greek 10-year bonds has dropped below 6.2
percent from more than 30 percent in 2012. Greek securities have
returned 31 percent this year, the best performance among the 34
sovereign debt markets tracked by the Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany has welcomed the planned bond sale as evidence that
&#8220;confidence of the financial markets is returning&#8221; to Greece,
Nadine Kalwey, a spokeswoman for Germany&#8217;s Finance Ministry,
said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece&#8217;s financing situation has already benefited from a
budget surplus before interest costs of almost 3 billion euros
($4.1 billion), which the government expects the European
Union&#8217;s statistics agency to confirm this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, three officials said that the government planned
to sell 2 billion euros of bonds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biofarma Pharmaceutical Industry Co.&#8217;s owners hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to start the process of selling a stake in the Turkish drugmaker, Chief Executive Officer Serdar Sozeri said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman sent out so-called teasers, or invitation letters, to potential bidders for stock in the Istanbul-based company, which is owned equally by New York-based private-equity firm Rohatyn Group and another buyout investor group that Sozeri, speaking in a phone interview, identified as Spokane while declining to specify other details. He also declined to comment on the size of any holding that might be offered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citi Venture Capital International, a unit of Citigroup Inc. (C) that was sold to Rohatyn Group last year, and Partners in Life Sciences bought Biofarma, a generic producer of heart, respiratory and urinary-tract treatments, from its Turkish owners in 2006. A stake was sold to Greek private-equity firm Global Finance in 2007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An attempt to sell the drugmaker in 2011 failed over price, with a person familiar with the situation at the time estimating the drugmaker was valued at $600 million to $700 million. A spokesman for Rohatyn didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bayer AG, GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), Novartis AG (NOVN), AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) and Amgen Inc. are among more than 30 international drugmakers operating in Turkey, a medicines market that expanded 6.5 percent to 15.2 billion liras ($7.2 billion) in 2013, according to the website of the Istanbul-based Pharmaceutical Manufacturers&#8217; Association of Turkey. Biofarma&#8217;s revenue in 2010 totaled 160 million liras, according to Istanbul Chamber of Industry figures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Hugh Son" date="Apr 07, 2014 10:33 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-07/jpmorgan-s-pinto-shuffles-deputies-names-hernandez-unit-co-head.html"><headline>JPMorgan&#8217;s Pinto Shuffles Deputies, Names Hernandez Unit Co-Head</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) named Carlos Hernandez co-head of global banking with Jeff Urwin as corporate
and investment-banking chief Daniel Pinto overhauls the
division&#8217;s leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hernandez and Urwin, 58, will manage corporate banking,
investment banking and treasury services, according to a staff
memo today from Pinto. Hernandez previously led New York-based
JPMorgan&#8217;s investor-services team. Don McCree, 52, who was named
head of corporate banking and treasury services in a 2012
reorganization, is leaving the firm, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinto, 51, became sole investment-banking chief of the
biggest U.S. lender by assets last month after Mike Cavanagh,
48, left to join private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP. The
surprise departure forced Pinto to restructure reporting lines,
promoting veterans including Hernandez, who joined JPMorgan in
the 1980s and rose to head of global equities and other roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Horner, who managed the markets and investor-services
financing units, will succeed Hernandez as head of investor
services. Joyce Chang was named global head of research, filling
the position after Tom Schmidt asked for a new role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oversight of the bank&#8217;s remaining commodities operation
will be shared by James Kenny and Troy Rohrbaugh, who were named
co-heads of global rates, foreign exchange, commodities and
emerging markets, according to the memo. Blythe Masters, 45,
said last week she planned to leave the firm after helping
complete the $3.5 billion sale of its physical commodities unit
to Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. and the U.K.&#8217;s
Department for International Development will contribute a
combined $20 million to a private-equity fund investing in
startup businesses operating in East Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DFID&#8217;s Impact Fund, which is managed by CDC Group, a
development finance institution owned by the U.K. government,
will provide $15 million to Novastar Ventures and JPMorgan the
rest, the companies said today in an e-mailed statement. The
money will finance health care, education, housing, energy and
sanitation projects that are expected to reach as many as 2
million people over the next decade, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Private sector capital is crucial to economic growth in
East Africa,&#8221; Peter Scher, head of corporate responsibility at
JPMorgan Chase, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. &#8220;There
is a recognition that governmental and aid organizations cannot
do this alone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should accelerate investments to build
infrastructure in Africa and form public-private partnerships
that will help improve economic and social conditions, Kenyan
President Uhuru Kenyatta said on April 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It marks the first investment released from the 75 million-pound ($124 million) Impact Fund announced by the U.K. in 2012
to provide capital to companies and programs that will generate
returns in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novastar is focusing its investments on &#8220;early-stage
businesses that offer massive social benefits to low-income
households,&#8221; Managing Director Steve Beck said on April 5 by
phone from Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Novastar will accelerate the existing investment program
of SpringHill Equity Partners, an informal investor circle that
has been making venture investments in East Africa,&#8221; Beck said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novastar in March made its initial investment in Bridge
International Academies, which has built more than 250 schools
in Kenya, according to the statement. The Nairobi-based chain of
nursery and primary schools charges students an average of $5 a
month, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Market-based approaches, along with interested investors,
can attract the private sector capital necessary to create
change,&#8221; Scher said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private equity funds invested more than three times as much
in sub-Saharan Africa last year as they did in 2012 as the
number of deals during the period rose to 84 from 58, according
to the 2014 East Africa Private Equity Confidence Survey
released by Deloitte. In East Africa, the number of deals in
Kenya last year was 12, five in Rwanda, and three each in Uganda
and Tanzania, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sopra Group SA (SOP) and Groupe Steria
SCA (RIA), two of France&#8217;s oldest computer-services providers, are
planning to merge in an attempt to win business from rivals
including Atos and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), a
person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies&#8217; boards are meeting today to decide on a
combination, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the discussions are private. The companies have been
negotiating for six months, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A merger could help the companies offer a wider array of
services and reduce costs as they compete against larger peers
IBM and Accenture Plc (ACN) as well as local rivals Atos and Cap
Gemini SA. (CAP) Sopra, based in Paris, has a market value of about 1
billion euros ($1.4 billion), while that of Velizy, France-based
Steria is 522 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a good idea because for these kind of mid-cap
companies in IT services, critical size is very important for
winning contracts,&#8221; said Emmanuel Parot, an analyst at Gilbert
Dupont in Paris. The companies are complementary geographically,
he said. Sopra had 68 percent of revenue coming from France in
2012, while Steria got 40 percent of sales from the U.K. that
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) says now
may be a good time to cut holdings of Chinese high-yield bonds
after the longest winning streak in six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors should use the recent rally to reduce
overweight positions,&#8221; analysts led by Hong Kong-based Kenneth Ho wrote in a note dated April 4. &#8220;We believe that there will
be more headlines noises to come out of China and expect to see
further credit differentiation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar-denominated junk bonds from the nation gained 0.95
percent in the seven days through April 4 for the second
straight weekly advance, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. While recent improvement in emerging-market
sentiment and China&#8217;s announcement of stimulus last week fueled
the rally, better-quality issuers remain Goldman&#8217;s preferred bet
amid continued concern about the world&#8217;s second-biggest economy,
according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China unveiled a package of measures to support the economy
including railway investment and tax breaks last week, as the
government seeks to bolster slowing growth. Exports (CNFREXPY) likely rose
4.9 percent in March from a year earlier, according to the
median estimate of 37 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News before
trade data this week, after the biggest drop since 2009 in
February. Manufacturing contracted a third month in March, an
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics gauge showed last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sinopec Sells &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec Group and
parent of Asia&#8217;s largest oil refiner, sold $5 billion of bonds
on April 2, the biggest dollar-denominated sale by an Asian
issuer in a decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show. China Citic
Bank International Ltd. meets investors from today about a
possible offering of notes in the U.S. currency, a person
familiar with the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect China issuance to increase and to catch up in
the remaining quarters, especially given the improvement in
market sentiment in recent weeks,&#8221; wrote Ho. Offerings from the
nation slumped to $12.7 billion in the first three months of the
year, from $15.1 billion during the same period last year,
according to Goldman data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka plans to sell as much as $500 million of notes as
soon as today, a person familiar with the matter said. The
sovereign is marketing five-year bonds at about 5.5 percent, the
person said, asking not to be identified because the terms
aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan plans to price five- and 10-year dollar-denominated debt as soon as tomorrow, a separate person said.
Bangladesh&#8217;s Banglalink Digital Communications Ltd. is
considering a $300 million offering of five-year securities,
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service wrote in an e-mailed note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring Asian corporate and sovereign bonds
from default was little changed today, according to traders of
credit-default swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asia Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 124 basis points
as of 8:08 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia  New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The benchmark is holding at its lowest
level since April 2, when it touched a six-month low, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Australia index slipped 0.5 basis point
to 97.5 basis points as of 9:35 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. The gauge is on course for its lowest
close since April 2, according to data provider CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 83.5
basis points as of 8:40 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s main opposition party, which
leads in opinion polls ahead of federal elections, promised to
bring down one of Asia&#8217;s fastest inflation rates and expedite
foreign investment in most sectors except for multibrand retail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narendra Modi&#8217;s Bharatiya Janata Party said in its campaign
manifesto today it would create a price stabilization fund and
seek to &#8220;rationalize&#8221; interest rates for manufacturing. The
Hindu nationalist organization also said it would try to build a
temple on a disputed site, instill legal protections for cows
and pass a uniform civil code -- a step resisted in the past by
the country&#8217;s religious minorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The BJP will be voted to power,&#8221; Modi told reporters
today in New Delhi. &#8220;Over the next 60 months, we will deliver a
government that will reverse the growth slowdown and fulfill the
desires and aspirations of Indians.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls show Modi&#8217;s BJP will emerge as the largest
party while falling short of a parliamentary majority as voters
punish the ruling Congress party for rising vegetable prices,
graft scandals and the slowest economic growth in a decade.
Voting started today in the election and will continue through
May 12, with all ballots counted on May 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will bring back credibility and trust in government,
re-sowing confidence in the India story domestically as well as
internationally,&#8221; the manifesto said. &#8220;Through consistent,
long-term policies, we will not just spur the process of
economic growth, but also ensure that it is stable as well as
balanced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;National Market &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party said it would look to set up a national
agricultural market and take action against hoarders to bring
down inflation. It plans to give more power to states, create
consensus to implement a goods and services tax and develop
labor-intensive manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling Congress party, which is campaigning on the
party&#8217;s record of spending on programs ranging from cheap food
to guaranteed work in rural areas, promised in its manifesto to
give poorer voters a legal right to health care and housing.
Congress President Sonia Gandhi predicted her party would return
to power because opinion polls are unreliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi has promoted his image as a magnet for investment and
a record of stronger-than-average growth in the western state of
Gujarat, which he&#8217;s ruled since 2001. The state accounts for a
quarter of India&#8217;s exports and has attracted investment from
companies such as Ford Motor Co. (F) and Reliance Industries Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi has been attacked by opponents for failing to control
2002 riots in Gujarat. After Muslims set fire to a train,
killing Hindu activists, ensuing riots killed about 1,100
people, mostly Muslims, according to a government report by
Justice G.T. Nanavati and Justice Akshay Mehta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human rights groups including the Concerned Citizens
Tribunal say Modi failed to control the mob. Modi denies
wrongdoing and a panel appointed by India&#8217;s Supreme Court in
2012 found no evidence that his decisions prevented victims from
receiving help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
promised Congress a thorough investigation into whether high-frequency trading violates laws against insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holder made the comments in prepared remarks April 4 for a
Congressional oversight hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation has said its agents are
probing whether firms that conduct high-frequency trading get an
unfair jump on the competition by using computers and data lines
to gain access to non-public information. The bureau has taken
the unusual step of publicly appealing for traders and stock-exchange workers to blow the whistle on possible manipulation
tied to the super-fast computer networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice drew extensive media coverage last week with
the publication of &#8220;Flash Boys,&#8221; a book on the topic by
Michael Lewis, a columnist for Bloomberg View. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI&#8217;s inquiry stems from a multiyear crackdown on
insider trading that has led to 79 convictions of hedge-fund
traders and others. Other federal and state agencies also are
examining high-frequency trading, which relies on computers and
high-speed data connections to post and cancel orders in
fractions of a second to profit on slight price discrepancies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lapsed U.S. Tax Breaks for Wind, Corporations Revived in Senate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate Finance Committee voted to revive almost
all of the 55 tax breaks that expired Dec. 31, providing
benefits for wind energy, U.S.-based multinational corporations
and motor sports track owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While senators said they lamented the need to routinely
extend tax breaks, lawmakers continue the temporary revival
pattern. Making the breaks permanent would require accounting
for 10 years of forgone revenue. Lawmakers back provisions that
are particularly important in their home states and trade
support for other members&#8217; favored breaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IBM Pension Changes Breached Employee Rights, U.K. Judge Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) unfairly changed its
U.K. pension plan in a bid to reduce a deficit of 890 million
pounds ($1.48 billion), a judge in London ruled, handing a
victory to a group of employees who had opposed the move by the
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s &#8220;Project Waltz,&#8221; which cut benefits to 5,000
employees, breached the company&#8217;s duties to them, Judge Nicholas
Warren said in the 430-page ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court&#8217;s opinion acknowledges IBM&#8217;s right to make
changes in its U.K. pension programs,&#8221; said Ken Saunders, a
company spokesman. IBM disagrees with the decision and will
appeal, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Young, a lawyer for the employees, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to requests for comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is IBM United Kingdom Holdings Ltd., IBM United
Kingdom Ltd. v Stuart Dalgleish  Ors, High Court of Justice,
Chancery Division, HC10C01796. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SAC Capital Judge Urged by U.S. to Accept $900 Million Penalty &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAC Capital Advisors LP&#8217;s plea agreement to pay a $900
million penalty should be accepted, U.S. prosecutors told a
judge April 3 as they seek the biggest criminal fine ever
imposed for insider trading. The fine is part of a larger
settlement with the hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain is set to decide
April 10 whether she will accept the plea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAC pleaded guilty in November to securities fraud and wire
fraud for allowing eight employees to engage in illicit trading
dating back to 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. SAC Capital Advisors LP, 13-cr-00541, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The civil case is U.S. v. SAC Capital Advisors LP,

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. is going Hollywood with a cast including comedians Sarah Silverman and Seth Green, aspiring World Cup players and eerily human robots. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All are involved in shows that Microsoft&#8217;s new Xbox television studio plans to roll out globally starting in June. Helmed by former CBS Corp. honcho Nancy Tellem, who Microsoft hired 19 months ago to build a TV powerhouse from the ground up, the studio now has six series lined up -- including a science-fiction thriller called &#8220;Humans&#8221; about humanoid robot workers -- and more than a dozen projects in development. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s unfamiliar ground for the world&#8217;s largest software maker, which has zero experience in original TV programming and is wading into a crowded field where Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have generated hits such as &#8220;House of Cards.&#8221; Yet Microsoft is betting on the new studio to produce shows that will attract consumers to its Xbox game console, lure subscribers to its Xbox Live online service and eventually anchor a consumer home entertainment network that will tie the company&#8217;s devices together. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;TV, as the highest-reach form of entertainment you can find, is a critical part&#8221; of wooing consumers to Microsoft, said Phil Spencer, who was last week named head of the Xbox business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A project to double capacity of Colombia&#8217;s main coal railway is set to take another three years, according to the line&#8217;s operator, curbing government plans to boost exports of the fuel used by European power plants. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Environmental permitting delays and opposition from local communities have held up work, Pat Ross, acting president of Ferrocarriles del Norte de Colombia SA, or Fenoco, said in an April 7 interview at the company&#8217;s Santa Marta offices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Glencore Xstrata Plc and Drummond Co. are among companies that use the 246 kilometers (153 miles) of track to transport coal from northern mines to ports on the Caribbean coast, from where it&#8217;s shipped to Europe. A 46-kilometer stretch of single track still needs to be turned into double track, Ross said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The second quarter of 2017 is the deadline at the rate we&#8217;re going, unless it&#8217;s expedited,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As long as you have one kilometer of single track, the inability to optimize our resources remains.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, the railway transported 44 million metric tons of coal, with a capacity under current contracts of 66.5 million tons, according to Fenoco. &#8220;When the second line is completed the capacity will almost double,&#8221; Ross said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fenoco has spent $164 million since 2007 on an expansion that include a new high-tech signaling system, with a forecast total spend of $319 million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Drummond Catchup &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies working in the cement, oil and oil derivatives industries have expressed interest in using the upgraded line once it&#8217;s complete, Ross said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colombian Mines and Energy Minister Amylkar Acosta said Feb. 20 that completion of the second line would help Drummond partially recuperate lost exports after the Birmingham, Alabama-based company failed to install a mandatory direct-loading system at its Caribbean port by a Jan. 1 deadline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ministry didn&#8217;t reply to two e-mails and a voicemail seeking comment on the railway upgrade timeframe. Officials in the communications departments of Glencore&#8217;s Prodeco and Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Colombian Natural Resources declined to comment when contacted by phone on the railway expansion time line. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Juan Manuel Santos has earmarked mining as an engine for the country&#8217;s economy. Coal is Colombia&#8217;s main export after oil. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of 11 minerals identified as being strategically important, Colombia has the greatest potential in thermal coal, according to a study commissioned by the government&#8217;s mining and energy planning unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Colombia&#8217;s coal reserves are gigantic,&#8221; the unit&#8217;s director, Angela Cadena, said in a March 26 interview. &#8220;The reserve-production ratio is close to 100 years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri" date="Apr 08, 2014 11:47 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-08/pixar-chief-describes-crisis-with-growth-under-disney.html"><headline>Pixar Chief Chronicles Crisis as Disney Era Tests Studio</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Seven years after its acquisition by Walt Disney Co. (DIS), Pixar, the studio known for &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; and &#8220;Finding Nemo,&#8221; was facing three crises, according to a new book by its president, Ed Catmull. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cost of making animated films was rising, the DVD market was shrinking and there was a feeling among management that a tenet of the Pixar culture, employees&#8217; freedom to speak their minds, was faltering, Catmull says in &#8220;Creativity, Inc.,&#8221; released today by Random House. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After buying Pixar for $7.4 billion in 2006, Walt Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger put Catmull and Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter at the helm of both their studio and Disney&#8217;s animation unit. The wisdom of that decision has been evident in the unit&#8217;s success, including with the Oscar-winner &#8220;Frozen,&#8221; the top-grossing animated film of all time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Less well-known are what Catmull, 69, says were growing pains and soul-searching at Pixar. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;How, we all wondered, could we maintain Pixar&#8217;s sense of intensity and playfulness, beating back the creeping conservatism that often accompanies success while also getting leaner and more nimble?&#8221; Catmull writes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He quotes Lasseter as saying, &#8220;There&#8217;s a lightness and a speed at Disney that I want to see more of at Pixar.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Tough&#8217; Criticism &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Catmull and others in management assembled more than 1,000 employees in the atrium of its headquarters in Emeryville, California, for an event it called Notes Day in March 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Employees were asked in advance to share suggestions for topics, their complaints and ways for the company to improve. Lasseter received two-and-a-half pages of criticism. Among them were concerns he was so tightly scheduled that people wasted time overpreparing for meetings and that he carried his emotions from one meeting to the next, leaving some thinking he was mad at them when he wasn&#8217;t, according to the book. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those two-and-a-half pages were really tough to read,&#8221; Lasseter told employees that day, according to the book. &#8220;But it was so valuable for me to hear, and I&#8217;m already working to correct those things.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brian Ferguson, a former Disney animator who left last year and now teaches at the California Institute for the Arts in Valencia, said competition for Lasseter&#8217;s attention was an issue at the studio. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s like children fighting over their parents,&#8221; Ferguson said in an interview. &#8220;He was being spread awfully thin. Any time anybody had with him was precious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Biggest Payoff&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Catmull says in the book that one goal of Notes Day was figuring out how to cut costs by 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In November, Pixar fired about 5 percent of its 1,200 workers and closed a Vancouver, Canada, facility. The studio said at the time that it would delay the release of the film &#8220;The Good Dinosaur&#8221; until November 2015, making this the first year since 2005 that Pixar isn&#8217;t putting out a movie. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its last film, 2013&#8217;s &#8220;Monsters University,&#8221; grossed $738 million in theaters worldwide; its budget was $270 million, including the cost of distributing and marketing the film, according to Boxoffice.com. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Employees discussed 106 topics in 171 sessions during the the Notes Day event, according to the book. Afterward, they were treated to beer and hot dogs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I believe the biggest payoff of Notes Day was that we made it safer for people to say what they thought,&#8221; Catmull said in his book. &#8220;Notes Day made it OK to disagree.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.3 percent to $78.88 at 11:46 a.m. in New York. The stock had gained 3.6 percent this year as of yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael P.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s David Kostin has some good news, and some bad news. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, the bad news. There&#8217;s a good chance the U.S. stock market will see a 10 percent drop sometime during the next 12 months. Well, as far as precision goes, &#8220;good chance&#8221; is not good enough for a quant like Kostin, so he gives an exact probability: 67 percent odds of a 10 percent retreat from a peak in the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though quant work can be complicated, his rationale is actually quite simple -- the market has gone way too long without a so-called correction, or a drop of at least 10 percent from a peak. The biggest declines from highs this year and last year were about 6 percent, and it&#8217;s been 22 months since the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) saw a 10 percent drop. Mix in a little fancy math, and Kostin ends up with 67 percent odds we&#8217;ll see a correction in the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now for the good news, if you can call it that: He still expects the market to end the year higher, though not by much. Kostin is sticking with his year-end SP 500 forecast of 1,900, according to a note to clients dated yesterday. That implies a gain of less than 2.8 percent for the year and less than 3 percent from yesterday&#8217;s close. In other words, a relatively flat market given the ferocity of the gains seen in this bull run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next year will be better in Kostin&#8217;s view, with a gain of 11 percent to 2,100 from his 2014 forecast. The SP 500 will add another 4.8 percent on top of that to 2,200 in 2016, he predicts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ho Hum &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the year, Wall Street strategists have held firm to forecasts for a ho-hum market this year following last year&#8217;s 30 percent rally in the SP 500. The average projection on Jan. 3 called for a 5.8 percent gain to 1,955 in 2014, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. By April 1, the mean forecast had only moved up six points to 1,961. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s important to note in here that these oracles sort of missed the boat last year. The average estimate on Jan. 2, 2013, called for a 7.6 percent gain by the end of the year, while the SP 500 ended up jumping 30 percent to 1,848.36. Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Tobias Levkovich was closest at 1,615, still more than 200 points off. Kostin forecast a 2013 close of 1,575, almost 300 points off. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if Wall Street strategists were meteorologists, last year they called for a few inches of snow and the market ended up getting a blizzard. This year, they&#8217;re calling for a dusting and so far they haven&#8217;t been too far off -- no accumulation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Bloomberg News" date="Apr 08, 2014  5:52 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-08/china-approves-microsoft-nokia-deal-with-conditions-on-prices.html"><headline>China Approves Microsoft, Nokia Deal With Conditions on Prices</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Ministry of Commerce
approved Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s bid to take over Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s phone
business after winning pledges from both that the transaction
won&#8217;t mean higher fees for the nation&#8217;s smartphone makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft pledged not to raise fees for its patents after
the deal is complete, according to a statement posted on the
ministry&#8217;s website. Nokia pledged no large changes in its
current compensation structure for standard-essential patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese regulatory approval follows sign-off from the
European Commission, the U.S. Justice Department and other
jurisdictions and will allow the transaction to close this
month, Espoo, Finland-based Nokia said in a statement today.
Chinese phone makers including Huawei Technologies Co. had asked
China to set conditions on the deal, two government officials
with knowledge of the matter said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chinese regulatory approval has been the remaining hurdle
and now we expect the deal to close swiftly during April,&#8221; said
Sami Sarkamies, an analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Helsinki.
&#8220;China is a key mobile devices market representing already a
third of the global market volume.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No government authorities requested the company make
changes to its licensing or royalty terms, Nokia said in its
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft won&#8217;t ban Chinese phone makers from using patents
needed to comply with a technical standard, according to the
statement from the Chinese regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanna Li, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Microsoft, said
she didn&#8217;t immediately have information available on the
ministry&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia has said completion of the transaction will allow it
to unveil its new strategy and chief executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajeev Suri, the head its networks business, is among
candidates for the top job. The new CEO will try to revive 149-year-old Nokia, which is intensifying its focus on wireless-network equipment as it faces a new start without the mobile-phone business that made it famous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban&#8217;s re-election means
&#8220;unpredictable&#8221; policies that risk weighing on growth, as the
nation&#8217;s bonds suffer East Europe&#8217;s worst returns after Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government bonds lost 1.6 percent this year in dollar
terms, while the Bloomberg Emerging Market Local Sovereign Index
gained 1.6 percent. The forint weakened as much as 0.6 percent
from a two-month high and bonds dropped yesterday after Orban&#8217;s
Fidesz party won 67 percent of the seats in parliament in an
April 6 vote, according to preliminary results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Orban cut the biggest debt burden among former
communist European Union members, he roiled investor sentiment
in his last term by appropriating $13 billion of pension assets,
saddling banks with mortgage losses and driving out foreign-owned utilities. His &#8220;unpredictable style of policymaking&#8221;
will last as his past policies &#8220;weigh on Hungary&#8217;s growth
prospects,&#8221; Magdalena Polan, a London-based economist at
Goldman Sachs, said by e-mail April 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fidesz won&#8217;t really have an incentive to change its
economic policy after this victory,&#8221; Zsolt Kondrat, head of
research at MKB Bank Zrt., a unit of Bayerische Landesbank, said
by phone from Budapest yesterday. &#8220;And unless it does, there
won&#8217;t be much of a sustained gain in the forint or a drop in
yields.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Unambiguous&#8217; Mandate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MKB expects Hungary&#8217;s 10-year forint bond yield to rise to
6.2 percent by the end of the year from a close of 5.66 percent
yesterday and an average of 5.85 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fidesz secured an &#8220;unambiguous&#8221; mandate to continue the
policy course it started four years ago, Orban said in Budapest
yesterday. The Economy Ministry declined to respond to e-mailed
questions regarding the government&#8217;s future policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hungarian stocks underperformed peers in emerging markets
during Orban&#8217;s first term as his government changed the
constitution, levied extraordinary taxes on industries from
banks to telecommunications providers, and rejected concern over
the erosion of democracy as lobbying for foreign interests. The
BUX index tumbled 29 percent in the past four years compared
with a 3.2 percent retreat in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Riskless Returns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While gains of 39 percent on forint-denominated debt were
the best among the three major eastern European countries since
Orban took office in May 2010, those returns shrunk to a region-worst 6.6 percent when adjusted for price fluctuations,
according to the Bloomberg riskless return ranking. Polish debt
handed investors 9.4 percent and Czech securities 7.2 percent in
a risk-adjusted ranking of indexes from the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies in the period through the end of
last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orban&#8217;s cabinet &#8220;will continue to hold an unprecedented
degree of control over the direction of economic policies,&#8221;
Goldman&#8217;s Polan wrote. &#8220;The government will press on with its
plans to extend the state&#8217;s control over the economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier has used the proceeds from the pension takeover
and industry taxes to keep the budget deficit below the EU
ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product since 2011. GDP
grew 1.1 percent last year after contracting in 2012. Industrial
production increased 8.1 percent in February from a year
earlier, the biggest jump in three years, statistics office data
showed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hungary&#8217;s Eurobonds are attractive as the economy picks up
and the yields exceed peers such as Romania, Gyula Toth, who
oversees $550 million of assets as a money manager at Ithuba
Gapital AG in Vienna, said by e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extra Yield &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium investors demand to hold Hungary&#8217;s dollar bonds
over Treasuries widened two basis points to 266 today, compared
with 198 for Romania, according to indexes from JPMorgan Chase 
Co. The forint strengthened 0.3 percent to 305.7 per euro by
9:31 a.m. in Budapest while yields on the government&#8217;s 10-year
local-currency debt fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 5.61 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hungary&#8217;s public debt burden fell to about 78 percent of
GDP last year from 82 percent in 2010, data from the European
Commission show. The country&#8217;s current-account surplus also
reached a record 2.9 billion euros in 2013, the central bank
said March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Orban&#8217;s policies helped reduce Hungary&#8217;s budget gap,
domestic yields fell too low after 20 consecutive months of cuts
in the benchmark interest rate to a record 2.6 percent,
according to Lutz Roehmeyer, a money manager at Berlin-based LBB
Invest overseeing $1.1 billion of developing-nation debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Too Low&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Interest rates in Hungary are too low and politically
influenced by the new setup of the central bank,&#8221; he said by e-mail yesterday. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t pay to go into Hungarian risk,&#8221;
said Roehmeyer, who has an underweight position on the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gyorgy Matolcsy, the central bank&#8217;s president, was the
architect of much of Orban&#8217;s self-styled &#8220;unorthodox&#8221; policies
as the economy minister until March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election gave an opposition alliance headed by the
Socialist Party 19 percent of the parliament seats, while the
Jobbik party, which wants a referendum on EU membership, secured
12 percent. Jobbik&#8217;s showing may embolden Fidesz to pursue
similar or even more drastic policies than it did in its last
term, Nora Szentivanyi, a London-based economist at JPMorgan,
said in an e-mailed report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Potential for renewed confrontation with the EU and
increasingly nationalistic rhetoric are risks worth watching,&#8221;
Szentivanyi wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trial attorney from the Securities and Exchange Commission said his bosses were too &#8220;tentative and fearful&#8221; to bring many Wall Street leaders to heel after the 2008 credit crisis, echoing the regulator&#8217;s outside critics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;James Kidney, who joined the SEC in 1986 and retired this month, offered the critique in a speech at his goodbye party. His remarks hit home with many in the crowd of SEC lawyers and alumni thanks to a part of his resume not publicly known: He had campaigned internally to bring charges against more executives in the agency&#8217;s 2010 case against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SEC has become &#8220;an agency that polices the broken windows on the street level and rarely goes to the penthouse floors,&#8221; Kidney said, according to a copy of his remarks obtained by Bloomberg News. &#8220;On the rare occasions when enforcement does go to the penthouse, good manners are paramount. Tough enforcement, risky enforcement, is subject to extensive negotiation and weakening.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kidney said his superiors were more focused on getting high-paying jobs after their government service than on bringing difficult cases. The agency&#8217;s penalties, Kidney said, have become &#8220;at most a tollbooth on the bankster turnpike.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), seeking to reverse
the longest string of production declined in a decade, said oil
and natural gas output fell in the first two months of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. energy producer by market value
pumped the equivalent of 2.579 million barrels of oil a day
during January and February, according to a statement on its
website today. That compares with 2.645 million in the first
quarter of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Chevron reports results for the entire three-month
period on May 2, output is expected to come in at 2.61 million
barrels, based on the average of three analysts&#8217; estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is accelerating oil exploration from Argentina to
China to add reserves and revive output. Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Watson is spending almost $40 billion
this year to find, extract, transport and process oil and gas.
Watson&#8217;s strategy also calls for auctioning off $10 billion in
oilfields and other assets to hone the San Ramon, California-based company&#8217;s focus on the highest-profit projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has fallen 4.7 percent this year to $119.10, after
advancing 16 percent in 2013. In March, Watson cut the company&#8217;s
long-term production target by 6.1 percent to the equivalent of
3.1 million barrels a day in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s output fell for a third consecutive year in
2013, the longest streak of declines since the 2001-2004 period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. is the biggest U.S. energy company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is facing
&#8220;increasingly complex and more dangerous&#8221; cyberattacks and
some of the intruders may get through, Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is going to be a continual and likely never-ending
battle to stay ahead of it -- and, unfortunately, not every
battle will be won,&#8221; Dimon wrote today in his annual letter to
shareholders of the New York-based bank. The company will boost
spending on cybersecurity to $250 million this year from $200
million in 2012, with future efforts expanding
&#8220;exponentially,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global corporations have increased their focus on how to
repel hackers since breaches were revealed by retailers
including Target Corp. (TGT) JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by
assets, is building three cybersecurity operations centers in
regional headquarters to coordinate information and respond to
threats, Dimon wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators have pressed lenders to strengthen measures
against cyber intrusions, and Richard Davis, the CEO at U.S.
Bancorp, said in November that when a cyberattack does succeed
against a bank, the impact probably will be big. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     April 9 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, had a &#8220;tin ear&#8221; when dealing with
regulators before settling probes into mortgage lapses and
trading losses, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our response generally was, &#8216;We know what we&#8217;re doing,&#8217;&#8221;
Dimon wrote today in a letter to the New York-based bank&#8217;s
investors. &#8220;Well, we should have done more self-examination. We
need to be better listeners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon is seeking to improve relations with overseers after
lamenting in prior years that regulation could thwart growth.
JPMorgan&#8217;s earnings last year were marred by more than $20
billion in legal settlements that contributed to the first
quarterly loss under Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank missed signals when rivals faced scrutiny and must
&#8220;do a better job at examining critiques of others so we can
learn from other people&#8217;s mistakes, too,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go Daddy Operating Co., the website

JPMorgan Chase  Co. to manage an initial public offering this
year, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Daddy, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, is aiming to be
public in the fall, one of the people said, asking not to be
identified discussing private information. The size of the
offering hasn&#8217;t been determined, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which has raised its profile in recent years
with an advertising campaign featuring celebrities like race-car
driver Danica Patrick and Israeli model Bar Refaeli, is enjoying
high levels of customer retention and strong subscriber growth,
according to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. Chief Executive Officer
Blake Irving said in a July interview that sales could reach $5
billion in two or three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Daddy&#8217;s sales in the year through June were about $1
billion, Moody&#8217;s said. Irving said in the interview that Go
Daddy could approach public markets as soon as this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment firms KKR  Co., Silver Lake Management LLC and
Technology Crossover Ventures bought a stake in Go Daddy in July
2011, in a deal valuing the company at $2.25 billion, a person
familiar with the matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Amazon.com Didn&#8217;t Infringe Rovi TV Guide Patents, Court Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rovi Corp., a provider of data and technology for on-screen
television listings, lost a patent-infringement case against
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) over interactive programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com&#8217;s Instant Video and IMDB Video didn&#8217;t infringe
two patents owned by Rovi&#8217;s TV Guide for electronic program
guides, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington said in an opinion posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rovi, which licenses data for television guides, has
agreements with companies such as Sony Corp. and Google Inc. (GOOG) The
Santa Clara, California-based company has had mixed results when
companies balk at paying royalties on its technology. In
November, it lost a lawsuit over Netflix Inc&#8217;s software-development kits after a U.S. trade agency said other Rovi
patents weren&#8217;t infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rovi pledged to pursue other claims against the online
retailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is United Video Properties Inc. v. Amazon.com

&lt;p&gt;Lacoste SA, the French polo-shirt manufacturer, was given
authorization to register &#8220;L.12.12&#8221; as a trademark in
Singapore over the objections of Carolina Herrera Ltd., the
Straits Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Herrera tried to block the registration,
saying the mark was too similar to its &#8220;212&#8221; marks used with
fragrances, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Lacoste uses &#8220;L.12.12&#8221; with a fragrance,
Singapore authorities said there was &#8220;no visual, aural or
conceptual similarity&#8221; between the marks, the Times said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DHX Objects to Event With Same Name as Children&#8217;s TV Program &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After receiving a cease-and-desist notice from counsel for
Canada&#8217;s DHX Media Ltd. (DHX), a U.K. promoter dropped &#8220;The Night
Garden&#8221; as the name for an event set in a London cafe, the
Hackney Gazette reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHX produces &#8220;In the Night Garden,&#8221; a children&#8217;s
television program airing on the U.K.&#8217;s child-oriented CBBC
network, and didn&#8217;t want the name to be associated with an event
where alcohol would be sold, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alistair Siddons, the event promoter, told the Gazette he
hadn&#8217;t intended any association with the TV program and felt
bullied into changing the name of the event to Star Garden. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Malibu Media Says No Defendant Passed Polygraph Examination &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malibu Media LLC, a producer of adult films, said in an
April 16 court filing that in the first three months of 2014, at
least 175,000 U.S. residents infringed its copyrights through
the use of the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that same filing, the company said it has been using
polygraph examinations and has agreed to dismiss infringement
cases against any defendants who pass such a test. So far,
Malibu Media said, no defendant has passed a test and all
polygraph examinations have led to a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing was made in one of 268 cases Malibu has filed in
federal court in Chicago. Malibu claims that each defendant
infringed, on average, 17.9 copyrighted works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation told Boston-area
technology companies to be wary of joint ventures with Russian
venture-capital firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an opinion piece published in the Boston Business
Journal, Lucia Ziobro, assistant special agent in charge of the
FBI&#8217;s Boston division, said the agency believes the true motive
of some venture-capital firms funded by the Russian government
is industrial espionage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warning was also directed toward research facilities
and Boston-area universities, the FBI said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials from two Russian venture-capital firms -- Russian
Venture Co. and Rusnano OAO&#8217;s Rusnano USA -- said they were
doing nothing wrong and the FBI&#8217;s allegations were unfounded,
the Boston Globe reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former Maker Studios Inc. chief
executive officer who last year accused the board of ousting him
and taking control of the company through fraud is seeking to
delay a shareholder vote on the acquisition by Walt Disney Co. (DIS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danny Zappin and three other co-founders of Maker yesterday
asked California state court judge in Los Angeles to block the
April 15 vote because, they said, the notice to shareholders is
misleading. They had sought a hearing as early as today. No
hearing was held today, according to court staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney will pay as much as $950 million for the supplier of
video content for Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube, the Burbank,
California-based entertainment company said last month. With
more than 55,000 channels, 380 million subscribers and 5.5
billion views a month on YouTube, Maker is one of the top
online-video networks for young audiences, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Certain Maker directors illegally issued shares to
themselves and diluted the common stock for their own financial
gain to the detriment of other Maker shareholders and take
control of Makers&#8217; board so that they could rapidly create a
liquidity event,&#8221; Zappin said in yesterday&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Spiegel, a lawyer representing Culver City,
California-based Maker, and Dean Kitchens, a lawyer representing
the company&#8217;s board members, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to phone

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world&#8217;s third-largest oil company, signed an accord with Argentina&#8217;s YPF SA to
invest $1.6 billion this year in shale development and become
the country&#8217;s largest foreign producer of shale oil and natural
gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron and state-run YPF plan to drill 170 wells in a
96,000-acre area this year in Argentina&#8217;s Vaca Muerta formation,
the world&#8217;s second-largest shale gas deposit and fourth-largest
shale oil reservoir, both companies said today in separate
statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner&#8217;s
government expropriated a 51 percent stake in YPF from Spain&#8217;s
Repsol SA (REP) in April 2012 after saying the Spanish oil company
hadn&#8217;t invested enough in exploration. Repsol&#8217;s board agreed in
February to accept $5 billion in compensation for Argentina&#8217;s
expropriation of the unit. Ending the two-year international
dispute may help attract investors to the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a significant step in our subsidiaries&#8217; joint
efforts with YPF to develop one of the most exciting shale plays
in the world today,&#8221; Chevron Vice Chairman George Kirkland said
in the company&#8217;s statement. &#8220;Vaca Muerta could become an
important contributor to Chevron&#8217;s long-term production
growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pilot Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest investment follows an initial $1.24 billion
pilot investment financed by Chevron and paves the way for a
total plan of $15 billion. The joint venture partners are
targeting daily output of 50,000 barrels of shale oil and 3
million cubic meters of shale gas by drilling 1,500 wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaca Muerta, Spanish for dead cow, may hold 23 billion
barrels of oil equivalent, according to a report by independent
auditor Ryder Scott released in February 2012 by YPF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF&#8217;s American depositary receipts were little changed at
$30.65 at 11:52 a.m. in New York Chevron fell 1.2 percent to
$117.64. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron late yesterday said it is on track to post its
lowest first quarter production in eight years after bad weather
disrupted operations in Central Asia and North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is the third most valuable oil producer after Exxon
Mobil Corp., and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koch Industries Inc. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s (GS) private-equity unit agreed to buy Flint Group
from CVC Capital Partners Ltd. to add chemicals and additives
used in the printing and packaging industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction, which adds 137 sites, is expected to be
completed in the second half, the companies said today in a
statement, without giving financial terms. Flint, based in
Luxembourg, generates annual sales of about 2.2 billion euros
($3 billion). The asset fetched just over 2 billion euros,
according to people with knowledge of the situation who declined
to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by Koch and Goldman Sachs to invest in the
business coincides with growing demand for packaging and
increased demand for newspapers in emerging markets. Flint,
along with DuPont Co. (DD) and MacDermid Group Inc., have been
gaining ground with flexographic printing plate technology for
packaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Flint is uniquely positioned to capture growth in its
attractive printed packaging markets while at the same time
continuing to benefit from strong and resilient performance of
its print media business,&#8221; said Matthias Hieber, head of
corporate equity investing for German-speaking operations at
Goldman Sachs Merchant Banking Division, in the statement.
&#8220;With a significantly improved capital structure, Flint is best
positioned to pursue its ambitious growth plans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale marks the end of a years-long attempt by CVC to
exit Flint which became a market leader in the printing and
packaging additive industry via acquisitions. CVC shelved an
initial public offering in 2010 and abandoned another exit
attempt in 2012 after private-equity firms withdrew from a
bidding process, people close to the talks said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenhill  Co. advised CVC and Flint in the transaction
with Koch and Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Management &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC built the asset from two European ink companies bought
in 2004 from BASF SE and Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA) and merged with Flint Ink
Corp. in the U.S. a year later to form the enlarged group. The
private equity company installed new management, appointing Akzo
Nobel executive Antoine Fady as chief executive in 2011, and
Steve Dryden as finance head last year from U.K. packaging
company DS Smith Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Koch, the purchase ties in with its ownership of
Georgia-Pacific LLC, which brings insight into the needs of
packaging makers. Koch, led by billionaire brothers Charles and
David Koch, is one of the largest closely held companies in the
U.S., with interests ranging from energy to fertilizers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors in high-yield bonds from
China, the majority of which come from the real estate industry,
aren&#8217;t being paid enough for assuming the risk of economic
slowdown and defaults, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For China high yield, we do not think there is sufficient
premium to compensate for these risks, especially given the
potentially high correlation risks in the real estate sector,&#8221;
analysts at the New York investment bank including Hong Kong-based Kenneth Ho wrote in a report today. &#8220;There is better
value in investment grade.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar bonds from issuers in China returned 2.24 percent
since Dec. 31, tied with South Korea for third-worst performer
in 15 Asian markets tracked by JPMorgan Chase  Co. The
country&#8217;s policy makers have set a 7.5 percent growth target for
this year, which would be the slowest expansion since 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports and imports unexpectedly fell in March,
underscoring the depth of China&#8217;s slowdown. Overseas shipments
declined 6.6 percent from a year earlier, the customs
administration said in Beijing today, attributing the drop
partly to distortions from inflated data in early 2013. Imports
fell 11.3 percent, leaving a trade surplus of $7.71 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern about non-payment in the real estate industry is
mounting after Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate Co., a builder in a
city south of Shanghai, collapsed with 3.5 billion yuan ($564
million) in liabilities last month. The nation&#8217;s credit default
swaps rose to 87 basis points on April 9 from as low as 64 in
November, after Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science 
Technology Co. on March 7 became the first company to default on
corporate bonds in its home market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JBS SA (JBSS3), the world&#8217;s largest beef
producer, hired units of JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Banco Bradesco
SA for a 3 billion-real ($1.3 billion) initial public offering
of its poultry and processed food unit, according to two people
with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also hired Banco Itau BBA SA, Banco Santander
SA (SAN), Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11) and Banco do Brasil SA to underwrite the
share offering of JBS Foods, the people said, asking not to be
identified because negotiations are confidential. The timing of
the sale will depend on market conditions, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exame magazine reported the hiring of the banks on April 10.
JBS, Banco do Brasil, Santander, JPMorgan, Itau BBA, Bradesco
BBI SA and BTG declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JBS Foods, the second-largest producer and exporter of
poultry and pork in Brazil, was formed after JBS agreed to buy
Seara food processing assets from Marfrig Global Foods SA for
5.85 billion reais in June 2013. Seara sales totaled 7.1 billion
reais in 2012, according to Marfrig regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPO would help unlock value by separating the unit from
the parent company, a third person said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SodaStream International Ltd (SODA), the
Israeli maker of home soda machines, dropped to the lowest level
in two months after Stifel Financial Corp. said competition from
larger rivals will erode the company&#8217;s profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Lod, Israel-based SodaStream fell 3 percent to
$38.71 in New York, the lowest level since Feb. 7. Coca-Cola
Co. (KO)&#8217;s partnership with Keurig Green Mountain Inc. (GMCR) to introduce a
system for producing single-serve cold drinks will result in
&#8220;loss of shelf space,&#8221; a group of Stifel analysts including
Jim Duffy, said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in Green
Mountain, a company developing a make-your-own, single-serve
product similar to SodaStream&#8217;s, on Feb. 5 for about $1.25
billion. The announcement added to concern competition will
weigh on margins while Chief Executive Officer Daniel Birnbaum
said Feb. 26 that he expects &#8220;headwinds&#8221; to remain after poor
holiday sales prompted the company to offer discounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Additional promotion and higher marketing expense is the
only defense suggesting a structural challenge for SodaStream
margins,&#8221; Duffy, who has a sell rating on the stock, wrote in a
report dated yesterday. &#8220;SodaStream is unlikely to be viewed as
a key strategic partner to a major beverage player.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Coca-Cola&#8217;s decision to purchase a 10 percent stake
in Waterbury, Vermont-based Green Mountain spurred speculation
rival PepsiCo Inc. would partner with SodaStream to counter the
threat, the company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi said
on a Feb. 13 conference call that it hasn&#8217;t committed to an at-home beverage technology yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yonah Lloyd, SodaStream&#8217;s chief corporate development and
communications officer, didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mailed request
for comment sent after normal business hours in Israel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. won&#8217;t issue a visa for an Iranian diplomat linked to the group that took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979, President Barack Obama&#8217;s spokesman said today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have informed the United Nations and Iran that we will not issue a visa&#8221; to Hamid Aboutalebi, who was Iran&#8217;s choice for its next ambassador to the UN, White House press secretary Jay Carney said. &#8220;The selection was not viable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. refusal brings to a head the standoff over Iran&#8217;s UN envoy, which comes amid delicate negotiations over the Islamic Republic&#8217;s nuclear development program. Carney said the decision won&#8217;t affect the nuclear talks with Iran, which also involve Russia, China, U.K., France and Germany. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hamid Babaei, spokesman for the Iranian mission to the UN, in an e-mail called the U.S. decision &#8220;regrettable&#8221; and said it was &#8220;in contravention of international law, the obligation of the host country and the inherent right of sovereign member states to designate their representatives to the United Nations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He didn&#8217;t elaborate on further steps Iran may take. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. decision follows votes by the House and Senate to bar Aboutalebi from the U.S. The decision on the visa is up to the executive branch, and Carney declined to say whether Obama would sign the legislation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are reviewing the legislation and will work to address any issues related to its utility and its constitutionality,&#8221; Carney said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Posing Threat &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bill doesn&#8217;t mention Aboutalebi by name. Instead, it urges denial of admission to the U.S. &#8220;to any representative to the United Nations who has engaged in espionage activities against the United States, poses a threat to United States national security interests, or has engaged in a terrorist activity against the United States.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aboutalebi, who previously served as Iran&#8217;s ambassador to Belgium and Italy, has been tied to a student group that led the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The U.S. responded to the takeover by breaking diplomatic ties with Iran. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carney and State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki refused to say explicitly why the visa was denied. However, Carney said that the issues raised in the congressional legislation and reports about Aboutalebi &#8220;reflect our views.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;President&#8217;s Authority &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the U.S. is obliged to grant entry visas to representatives of member states under the United Nations Headquarters Agreement Act approved by Congress in 1947, the U.S. president can deny visas to individuals deemed to pose a security threat to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agreement says that the terms are applicable &#8220;irrespective of the relations existing between the Governments of the persons referred to in that section and the Government of the United States.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the same legal questions came up in 2005 when Iran applied for a visa for then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to address the UN. The Department of Homeland Security initially found Ahmadinejad ineligible for a visa to enter the U.S. because of suspicions that he, too, participated in the embassy seizure, only to have the State Department grant it months later after interviewing former hostages. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since Iran doesn&#8217;t have an embassy in the U.S., its UN envoy is its most senior diplomat in the country. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Previous Cases &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the U.S. has previously denied visas for diplomats seeking short-term visits to attend meetings at UN headquarters in New York, UN officials and diplomats said they do not recall the U.S. barring entry for an envoy appointed to head a mission at the international body. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Iran&#8217;s Fars News Agency reported on Sept. 22, 2012, that the U.S. denied entry visas for 20 Iranian officials seeking to attend a session of the UN General Assembly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1988, the U.S. denied a visa for Yasser Arafat, then-chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who wanted to speak before the UN General Assembly on the Palestinian issue. The U.S. government barred Arafat&#8217;s entry because he &#8220;knows of, condones and lends support&#8221; to acts of terrorism. The General Assembly session was moved to Geneva, Switzerland, where such visa issuance constraints do not exist. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Iran have been inching toward repairing ties broken after the embassy takeover. Obama phoned his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, when the Iranian president was in New York last year for the opening of the UN General Assembly. It was the first direct contact between the leaders of the U.S. and Iran in decades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Nuclear Agreement &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the major goals of Obama&#8217;s foreign policy has been getting an agreement that would curb Iran&#8217;s nuclear development program. The U.S. and its allies contend Iran is moving toward the capability to build a nuclear weapon, which Iran denies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told a Senate panel this week it would take Iran two months to produce enough fissile material for one nuclear weapon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A six-month interim agreement reached between the so-called P5+1 and Iran ends in July. Diplomats have been meeting in Vienna on the next stage agreement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the issues being discussed are how sanctions on Iran would be lifted under a prospective accord. The international sanctions regime has been crippling Iran&#8217;s economy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jody Shenn and Zeke Faux" date="Apr 11, 2014  3:04 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-11/bond-traders-from-jpmorgan-to-rbs-said-placed-on-leave.html"><headline>Bond Traders From JPMorgan to RBS Said Placed on Leave</headline><body>

Other banks including New York-based JPMorgan received requests for information from U.S. officials about mortgage-bond trading after Litvak&#8217;s arrest, people briefed on the matter said in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Asset-Backed Alert, an industry newsletter, reported earlier today that Morganstein and Siegel had been placed on leave. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Norton, Morganstein and Siegel declined to comment when reached by phone.

&lt;p&gt;Onex Corp. (OCX), Canada&#8217;s largest buyout
firm, paid Chief Executive Officer and founder Gerald Schwartz
$85.3 million in 2013 compensation, higher than payouts for the
top executives of Walt Disney Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Visa Inc.
combined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, 72, received an annual salary of $1.3 million, a
bonus of $24.4 million and $59.6 million in stock options -- his
first stock-option award in a decade --  the Toronto-based firm
said in an April 7 filing with Canadian regulators. By
comparison, Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger was paid $34.3 million
in annual compensation, while Visa&#8217;s top executive Charles Scharf received $24.2 million and Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent got
$20.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The committee and the board are of the view that stock
options are an integral part of executive compensation and are
fundamental to the alignment of interests and the
incentivization of future performance,&#8221; Onex said in its
filing, as an explanation for awarding Schwartz 3,950,000
options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A message left with Onex spokeswoman Emma Thompson wasn&#8217;t
immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz&#8217; pay is more than any executive in the Standard
and Poor&#8217;s 500 Index this year, including Tim Cook, who received
compensation of $4.3 million as chief executive of Apple Inc.,
the U.S.&#8217;s biggest company by market value, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The data ranks the highest-paid
executives as reported in the summary compensation table for SP
500 companies with a fiscal year-end of Sept. 1, 2013 or later,
and have filed proxy statements for 2013 as of the market close
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paid Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onex said in its filing that Schwartz last received options
in early 2004 and exercised those last year, shortly prior to
their expiry. As a result, Schwartz ceased to hold any options
to buy Onex shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onex has gained 26 percent over the past 12 months,
compared with a total return of 18 percent for the SP/TSX
Composite Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz also received $28.5 million in carried interest
payments, or his slice of investment profits, as well as $12.5
million from co-investments made with Onex, the filing said. He
also received about $2.8 million in dividend payouts from owning
20.1 million shares, according to calculations by Bloomberg.
That would lift Schwartz&#8217;s total from pay, investments and
dividends to about $129 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP chief Steve Schwarzman received $374.5
million last year in pay and cash dividends, according to a Feb.
28 company filing. Schwarzman was paid a $350,000 salary and got
$21.6 million in carried interest. He received $352.5 million in
cash distributions during the year from ownership of partnership
units in the New York-based firm he co-founded in 1985 as a
leveraged-buyout group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onex awarded stock options to senior managing directors due
to an &#8220;evolution&#8221; in the company&#8217;s management structure. The
firm last year appointed four senior managing directors -- Ewout Heersink, Robert Le Blanc, Seth Mersky and Anthony Munk -- along
with Schwartz to a newly formed executive committee, to help the
CEO guide the strategic direction of the firm. Le Blanc, Mersky
and Munk received a one-time grant of 850,000 options to buy
subordinate voting shares, the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These option grants do not represent a routine practice
of the committee or the board, but rather were intended to
acknowledge an expectation as to the senior managing directors&#8217;
future contribution to growth and management of the firm,&#8221; the
filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Munk&#8217;s Pay &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Blanc&#8217;s total compensation was $23.3 million, while Munk
was paid $19 million and Seth Mersky received $17.3 million, the
filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary compensation tables are mandated by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission and show some awards in the
year they&#8217;re granted rather than for the year they&#8217;re earned.
Some awards are restricted, vesting and paying out over a set
time frame, and the receipt of others may depend on future
performance goals. The summary compensation table also counts
changes in pension and the value of perks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), a lightning rod
for environmental activists since the Valdez oil spill a
quarter-century ago, is appeasing some of its harshest critics
by agreeing to disclose internal risk and cost assessments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders of the world&#8217;s second-largest corporation by
market value will vote on just one environmental resolution on
May 28, according to a proxy filing today. That&#8217;s after Irving,
Texas-based Exxon convinced activist investors to withdraw two
proposals dealing with greenhouse gas restrictions and hydraulic
fracturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmentalists and corporate-governance activists from
groups including the Sisters of St. Dominic and Arjuna Capital
have made Exxon&#8217;s annual meeting a focal point for objecting to
everything from drilling shale to producing motor fuels linked
to climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the company sought to head off criticism by
striking deals with some of its opponents after months-long
negotiations. On March 20, Exxon agreed to provide details on
oilfields and other assets whose value may be threatened by
carbon limits; two weeks later, the producer promised to
disclose risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exchange, resolutions on both issues were withdrawn by
their proponents. Exxon satisfied the first agreement on March
31 by issuing a report that said its oil and natural gas
reserves won&#8217;t lose value because demand for energy will trump
efforts to curtail climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Binary Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fracking report will be released later this year, Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, said in an April 3 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disclosure agreements haven&#8217;t been enough to silence
all of Exxon&#8217;s critics. Mark Lewis, an analyst at investment
bank Kepler Cheuvreux SA in Paris, said the company still hasn&#8217;t
faced up to the risk that high-cost, carbon-intensive reserves
such as the tar sands in western Canada could deter some
investors who find it socially unacceptable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon&#8217;s view of climate risk appears naively binary,&#8221;
Lewis said in a blog post the day after Exxon issued its
reserves-threat report. &#8220;The reality is much more nuanced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environmental resolutions brought before investors at
last year&#8217;s annual meeting failed to garner enough votes to
succeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proposal calling on Exxon to disclose risks associated
with shale drilling was supported by 30 percent of shareholders,
unchanged from 2012. A separate item on greenhouse gases
gathered 27 percent of the vote, also little changed from a year
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil
into Alaska&#8217;s Prince William Sound, devastating wildlife and
local businesses. Victims of the spill sued Exxon and won a $5
billion punitive damage award in 1994 that was cut to $507.5
million in 2008 by a divided U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. is the biggest corporation by market value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) tumbled as much as 5 percent, the most in 17 months, after reporting first-quarter profit that fell short of analysts&#8217; estimates on lower revenue from fixed-income trading and mortgages. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, declined 3.2 percent to $55.59 at 10:32 a.m., after dropping to $54.55 earlier today. Excluding one-time items, profit at the New York-based company was $1.35 a share, David Konrad of Macquarie Group Ltd. said today in a note, falling short of the $1.46 average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earnings slumped in every major division at JPMorgan, the first of the top U.S. banks to post results for the period, amid a 42 percent drop in mortgage revenue and a 21 percent slide in fixed-income trading. The results fell short of analysts&#8217; estimates by the most since Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, took over at the start of 2006, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was not the usual upside surprise&#8221; for JPMorgan, said Jeff Morris, head of U.S. equities at Standard Life Investments, which manages $305 billion in assets. &#8220;Mortgage was under pressure and, despite the company warning about trading revenues in February, the 17 percent year-over-year drop in markets revenues feels softer than many were expecting,&#8221; Morris said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank, said first-quarter profit fell 19 percent on lower revenue from fixed-income trading and mortgages, themes that may be repeated across Wall Street next week. The shares declined 2.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income dropped to $5.27 billion, or $1.28 a share, from $6.53 billion, or $1.59, a year earlier, according to a statement today from New York-based JPMorgan. Ten analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated $1.46 a share on average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the first of the top U.S. banks to post results for the period, said profit fell in every major division, amid a 42 percent drop in mortgage revenue and a 21 percent slide in fixed-income trading. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, warned investors in February that trading had fallen 15 percent for the first two months of 2014, a decline analysts including David Konrad of Macquarie Group Ltd. blamed on a reduction in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s bond purchases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achilles Macris, a former JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) executive who oversaw the unit where a trader known
as the London Whale caused $6.2 billion in losses, won the
chance to respond to allegations he misled regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macris won a ruling that he should have been allowed to
provide comments to the Financial Conduct Authority before the
regulator published a report on Bruno Iksil&#8217;s losses. While
Macris wasn&#8217;t named, he had third-party response rights because
his identity could be determined, a finance tribunal in London
found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macris, who led the international chief investment office
at the bank, challenged the regulator over its findings in
October. The FCA found in September that the &#8220;conduct of CIO
London management deliberately misled the authority about the
situation,&#8221; according to the regulator&#8217;s notice on the fine. He
wasn&#8217;t mentioned by name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macris &#8220;looks forward to challenging the findings made
against him in the final notice, which fail to take proper
account of the actions he took and mischaracterize his dealings
with the FCA,&#8221; a spokesman for his lawyers at Clifford Chance
LLP said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator is seeking permission to appeal the ruling,
it said in a statement today. If the request is rejected or
Macris wins on appeal, then he&#8217;ll be able to dispute the FCA&#8217;s
findings against him at the tribunal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bad Bets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings &#8220;clearly identify and criticize him,&#8221; his
lawyers said in a statement in October. &#8220;Macris strenuously
denies the assertions made by the authority in the final notice
as being factually wrong. Those assertions fail to take proper
account of the actions he took and mischaracterize his dealings
with the authority at the relevant time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil&#8217;s bad bets led to $920 million in penalties from
regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
and the FCA, which levied a 138 million-pound ($231 million)
fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javier Martin-Artajo, a former JPMorgan banker fighting
extradition to the U.S. from Spain over the trading losses, is
also challenging the FCA at the finance tribunal. Martin-Artajo,
who oversaw synthetic credit trading at the CIO in London, filed
the case last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo was indicted in Manhattan federal court in
September for allegedly helping to hide the losses caused by
Iksil. The SEC said in a parallel lawsuit that Martin-Artajo and
Julien Grout, a trader who worked for him, engaged in a scheme
to enhance the portfolio&#8217;s apparent performance and thereby
curry favor with supervisors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;United Nations officials and
diplomats expressed concern that the Obama administration&#8217;s
denial of a visa to an Iranian diplomat linked to the 1979
American embassy takeover means the U.S. is less committed to
its role as host to the world organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House said yesterday that Hamid Aboutalebi won&#8217;t
get the visa he needs to enter the U.S. and serve at the UN
headquarters in New York. His selection by President Hassan Rouhani as the next Iranian ambassador to the UN was &#8220;not
viable,&#8221; said Jay Carney, President Barack Obama&#8217;s spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Iranian mission to the UN called the move
&#8220;regrettable,&#8221; and said it contravenes international law and
violates U.S. agreements with the UN and nations&#8217; sovereign
right to designate their representatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three UN diplomats and two UN officials, noting the Iranian
statement, said Aboutalebi&#8217;s case may make way for the U.S. to
use its authority more often to influence diplomatic
appointments to the UN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standoff over Iran&#8217;s UN envoy comes amid delicate
negotiations over the Islamic Republic&#8217;s nuclear development
program. While Carney said the decision won&#8217;t influence the
multilateral nuclear talks with Iran, the diplomats and
officials said this move affects the UN&#8217;s standing as a neutral
body and member states&#8217; right to appoint envoys as they see fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney and U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki
refused to say explicitly why the visa was denied. However,
Carney said that the issues raised in congressional legislation
condemning Aboutalebi&#8217;s appointment &#8220;reflect our views.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security Threat &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. House and Senate have passed a bill urging denial
of admission to the U.S. to any UN representative &#8220;who has
engaged in espionage activities against the United States, poses
a threat to United States national security interests, or has
engaged in a terrorist activity against the United States.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney declined to say whether Obama would sign the
legislation, which cedes final decision on the visa to the
executive branch and doesn&#8217;t mention Aboutalebi by name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aboutalebi, who previously served as Iran&#8217;s ambassador to
Belgium and Italy, has been tied to a student group that led the
takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52
Americans hostage for 444 days. The U.S. responded to the
takeover by breaking diplomatic ties with Iran, and since then
Tehran&#8217;s UN envoy has been its most senior diplomat in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government is obliged to grant entry visas to
representatives of member states under the United Nations
Headquarters Agreement Act approved by Congress in 1947. Even
so, the U.S. president can cite domestic laws to deny visas to
individuals deemed to pose a security threat to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UN Expectations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are no international mechanisms that require
the U.S. to uphold its agreement with the UN over its domestic
laws, there is an expectation for the U.S. to adhere to
international accords, said the two UN officials who asked not
to be identified due to sensitivity of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two officials said they see limited legal footing for
the U.S. argument that an incident decades ago still poses a
national security threat. One of the officials said if Iran were
to file an official complaint to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, that Ban would have to take a forceful stance to prevent
this incident from setting a precedent for the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Western diplomat, who also asked not to be named due to
sensitivity of the matter, echoed the UN officials&#8217; argument,
while adding that the visa refusal could be justified if there
were concrete intelligence on how sinister Aboutalebi&#8217;s role in
the hostage crisis was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Downplaying Participation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aboutalebi played down his involvement in the initial
occupation of the embassy in an interview he gave to the
Khabaronline news website in Iran. However, his photograph is
displayed on Taskhir, the website of the Muslim Students
Following the Imam&#8217;s Line, a group that took part in the embassy
takeover. Taskhir can mean both capture and occupation in
Persian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Mohammad Hashemi, one of the students who led
the embassy occupation, Iran&#8217;s revolutionary government sent
Aboutalebi and Abbas Abdi, another architect of the occupation,
as emissaries to Algiers. The Algerian capital at that time was
a meeting point for third-world liberation movements, including
the Palestine Liberation Organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. has previously denied visas for diplomats
seeking short-term visits to attend meetings at UN headquarters
in New York, UN officials and diplomats said they do not recall
the U.S. barring entry for an envoy appointed to head a mission
at the international body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arafat&#8217;s Visa &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1988, the U.S. denied a visa for Yasser Arafat, then-chairman of the PLO, who wanted to speak before the UN General
Assembly on the Palestinian issue. The U.S. government barred
Arafat&#8217;s entry because he &#8220;knows of, condones and lends
support&#8221; to acts of terrorism. The General Assembly session was
moved to Geneva, Switzerland, where such visa issuance
constraints do not exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran&#8217;s Fars News Agency reported on Sept. 22, 2012, that
the U.S. denied entry visas for 20 Iranian officials seeking to
attend a session of the UN General Assembly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Iran have been inching toward repairing ties
broken after the embassy takeover. Obama phoned his Iranian
counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, when the Iranian president was in
New York last year for the opening of the UN General Assembly.
It was the first direct contact between the leaders of the U.S.
and Iran in decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major goals of Obama&#8217;s foreign policy has been
getting an agreement that would curb Iran&#8217;s nuclear development
program. The U.S. and its allies contend Iran is moving toward
the capability to build a nuclear weapon, which Iran denies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told a Senate panel this
week it would take Iran two months to produce enough fissile
material for one nuclear weapon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A six-month interim agreement reached between the so-called
P5+1 and Iran ends in July. Diplomats have been meeting in
Vienna on the next stage agreement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ING Groep NV is the only bank left
predicting a 2014 interest-rate cut in South Korea. There may be
none soon as the call is reviewed after a Bank of Korea meeting
that prompted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to pull its forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank kept its benchmark rate at 2.5 percent at
an April 10 policy meeting and Governor Lee Ju Yeol said the
decision was unanimous. A recent slowdown in inflation was
mostly due to temporary factors and the monetary authority may
consider raising borrowing costs as price pressures build, Lee
told a press briefing that day. The bank lifted its 2014
economic growth estimate to 4 percent from 3.8 percent, and cut
its inflation projection to 2.1 percent from 2.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&#8217;s bonds have handed investors the second-lowest
returns in Asia excluding Japan this year, beating only the
Philippines, and the outlook for the securities may dim as rate-cut predictions are axed. Goldman described Lee&#8217;s tone as
&#8220;hawkish&#8221; and said April 10 it was no longer expecting a 25
basis point reduction in the benchmark rate this year. Of 26
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, 13 forecast the rate will be
raised at least once in 2014, while ING still sees a 25 basis
point cut in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are reviewing our current forecast for a possible
change,&#8221; Prakash Sakpal, a Singapore-based strategist for ING
Bank, said in an April 11 interview. &#8220;Governor Lee&#8217;s comments
after the policy meeting indicated the possible next move in the
benchmark rate would be up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Swap Strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should pay South Korea&#8217;s 10-year interest-rate
swap to &#8220;position for expectations of higher rates,&#8221; Ashish Agrawal, a Singapore-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG,
wrote in an April 11 research note. The contracts, which
exchange fixed payments for the three-month certificate of
deposit rate, fell six basis points last week to 3.29 percent in
Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The three-month
rate was steady at 2.65 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week&#8217;s Bank of Korea meeting was the first since
Governor Lee Ju Yeol replaced previous chief Kim Choong Soo
whose term ended March 31. Lee has 35 years&#8217; experience at the
central bank, which he left in April 2012 when a three-year term
as senior deputy governor ended. The latest announcements showed
the monetary authority sees inflation as a bigger risk than an
economic slowdown, Kwon Goohoon, Seoul-based economist for
Goldman Sachs, wrote in an April 10 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Hawkish Stance&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The press conference confirmed Lee&#8217;s hawkish stance,&#8221;
Hwangbo Youngok, a Seoul-based director for Korea Investment 
Securities Co., one of the nation&#8217;s 21 bond primary dealers,
said in an April 11 interview. &#8220;Still, the actual rate increase
will only happen after data matches Bank of Korea&#8217;s
expectations.&#8221; Hwangbo predicts borrowing costs will be left
unchanged this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer-price gains quickened to 1.3 percent in March from
February&#8217;s 1 percent, while remaining below the central bank&#8217;s
target band of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent. Export (KOEXTOTY) growth
accelerated to 5.2 percent from 1.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Park Geun Hye unveiled in February a three-year
plan to boost the country&#8217;s growth potential through
deregulation and innovation. That signaled authorities seek to
support the economy through broader reforms instead of monetary
policy adjustments, according to ING&#8217;s Sakpal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on South Korea&#8217;s 10-year government debt fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, this year to 3.53
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. South Korea&#8217;s won
appreciated 1.9 percent to 1,035.35 per dollar, touching
1,031.55 on April 10, the highest since August 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rate Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year yield, which climbed 43 basis points in 2013,
will rise to 3.9 percent by year-end, according to a Bloomberg
survey of analysts. That would mark the first back-to-back
annual increases in Bloomberg data going back to 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc recommends entering one-year interest-rate
swaps to position for an increase in borrowing costs. The
contracts declined two basis points this year to 2.69 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Expectations for rate increases aren&#8217;t reflected in the
interest-rate market yet as the market is still unsure of the
timing of monetary-policy normalization,&#8221; Rohit Arora, a
Singapore-based strategist at Barclays, said April 11. &#8220;We
expect the Bank of Korea to begin normalizing rates in the third
quarter, and see room for one-year interest rate swaps to rise
40 basis points in the next six months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond yields haven&#8217;t yet risen on bets of potential policy
tightening by the central bank because ample cash supply in the
financial system is fueling demand, according to Moon Hong Cheol, a fixed-income analyst at Dongbu Securities Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors still unsure of an economic recovery are
parking money in money-market funds and cash-management
accounts,&#8221; which buy short-term bonds, Seoul-based Moon said.
&#8220;We see continued demand for mid- to long-term sovereign debt
from insurers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount managed by money-market funds and cash-management accounts rose to 76.5 trillion won ($74 billion) as
of March 31 from 68.7 trillion won at the end of 2013, according
to central bank data. &lt;/p&gt;

While A+E Networks, a joint venture between Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and Hearst Corp., isn&#8217;t seeking immediate acquisitions, it wants to create new networks out of its less-watched channels, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the pay-TV business evolves, with more people viewing programming on the web, Dubuc was seeking a finance chief who could offer strategic advice, said the person. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Granville-Smith, A+E Networks is gaining an executive who has worked on large media deals. At JPMorgan, he advised A+E Networks on the repurchase of a stake held by Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s NBCUniversal in 2012. He also represented Madison Square Garden Inc. (MSG) on the sale of its Fuse TV network. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hiring requires the approval of A+E Network&#8217;s board, which is scheduled to meet in a couple weeks, said one of the people. Granville-Smith is expected to start in July. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael Feeney, a spokesman for New York-based A+E Networks, declined to comment, as did Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan. Granville-Smith didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gerard Gruosso, who has been A+E Network&#8217;s finance chief since 2002, announced his retirement two months ago, according to an internal company memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Gruosso is remaining through a transition period. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A+E Networks operates the AE, History and Lifetime channels, which carry the popular &#8220;Duck Dynasty&#8221; and &#8220;Pawn Stars&#8221; series. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Agnieszka Troszkiewicz and Luzi Ann Javier" date="Apr 14, 2014  1:47 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-14/nickel-rises-to-14-month-high-as-goldman-sachs-see-more-gains.html"><headline>Nickel Extends Longest Rally in 42 Months After Goldman Forecast</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Nickel prices rose, extending the
longest rally in 42 months, as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
price is poised climb an additional 12 percent because of
limited supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the London Metal Exchange, nickel for delivery in three
months jumped 2.2 percent to settle at $17,790 a metric ton at
5:53 p.m. Earlier, the price reached $17,917, the highest since
Feb. 19, 2013. The commodity climbed for the 11th straight
session, the longest advance since Oct. 6, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price may climb as high as $20,000 a ton, Goldman said
in a report dated yesterday. Nickel gained 28 percent this year
after Indonesia, the world&#8217;s top producer from mines, barred
exports of raw mineral ores in January. Russia, home to OAO GMK
Norilsk Nickel, the leading producer of refined metal, might
face more sanctions from the U.S. and Europe amid turmoil in
Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been bullish on nickel since the start of the
year, but prices have risen more quickly than in our base
case,&#8221; Jeff Currie, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in the
report. &#8220;The price rally predominantly reflects the ongoing
Indonesian ore export ban&#8221; and &#8220;concerns about the potential
impact of any sanctions on Russian commodity exports.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. raised its 2015 estimate by 13 percent to
$21,500 a ton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shortfall Looms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the market expects inventories in China, the largest
consumer, to last from eight to 12 months after the export ban,
most of those supplies are concentrated in the hands of the
larger nickel pig-iron producers, and smaller ones may begin to
run out of higher-grade Indonesian-sourced ore as soon as the
end of this month, Citigroup said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nickel open interest rose to a record 297,642 contracts as
of April 10. In March, the contracts outstanding jumped 18
percent, the most since September 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market &#8220;remains in an artificially induced squeeze,
one that could propel prices even higher from current levels,&#8221;
Edward Meir, an analyst at INTL FCStone Inc. in New York, said
today in a report. The tension between Russia and Ukraine
&#8220;continues to merit increased attention, as it has the
potential to destabilize the markets, should it spiral out of
control,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc, lead and tin gained in London, while aluminum and
copper dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Comex in New York, copper futures for May delivery
rose 0.2 percent to $3.0475 a pound. Stockpiles monitored by the
LME dropped for the 13th straight session to the lowest since
November 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relativity Media, producer of &#8220;The Social Network,&#8221; made a $1.1 billion offer for YouTube video supplier Maker Studios Inc., a person with knowledge of the matter said, countering Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s $950 million bid. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Relativity, the studio led by Ryan Kavanaugh, sent a letter to Maker Studios&#8217; board today detailing its bid, said the person, who wasn&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity. Terms include $525 million in cash and Relativity stock, $500 million more in cash and stock if performance targets are met, and $75 million in shares for key Maker executives, said the person, &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last-minute proposal may lead to a protracted battle for Maker, a supplier of video content to YouTube and one of the top online networks for young audiences. The deal is further complicated by a lawsuit filed by Danny Zappin, a former chief executive of Maker Studios, and three co-founders, who are trying to stop a shareholder vote set for tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Relativity made an initial bid yesterday, offering as much as $1 billion, and amended it today, the person said. The Wall Street Journal reported on the proposal earlier today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dena Cook, a spokeswoman for Maker, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The offer includes a &#8220;substantial opportunity for Maker&#8217;s talent and employees to directly and significantly participate in the long-term growth of Relativity,&#8221; said David Shane, a spokesman for Relativity, which is based in Beverly Hills, California. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, agreed on March 24 to acquire Maker, a supplier of content for Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube video-sharing site, for $500 million, plus as much as $450 million more if performance targets are met. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Maker Vote &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maker has scheduled a vote on Disney&#8217;s offer for tomorrow. The company has more than 55,000 channels, 380 million subscribers and 5.5 billion views a month on YouTube, Disney said at time of its purchase announcement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zappin and three other co-founders of Maker asked a state court judge in Los Angeles to block the April 15 vote on the Disney offer, saying the notice to shareholders was misleading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Certain Maker directors illegally issued shares to themselves and diluted the common stock for their own financial gain to the detriment of other Maker shareholders and take control of Makers&#8217; board so that they could rapidly create a liquidity event,&#8221; Zappin said in a filing last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Katia Porzecanski" date="Apr 14, 2014 11:51 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-14/jpmorgan-names-luis-oganes-as-head-of-emerging-markets-research.html"><headline>JPMorgan Names Luis Oganes as Head of Emerging Markets Research</headline><body>

&lt;p&gt;Oganes was promoted from head of Latin America research to

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) helped
regional Japanese banks sell the most dollar-denominated
convertible debt since at least 1999, as the lenders took
advantage of a stock-market rally to fund overseas expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest underwriter of the notes helped to
arrange three of the firms&#8217; five U.S. currency sales in the last
12 months. It co-managed deals by Yamagata Bank Ltd., Bank of
Iwate Ltd. and Shizuoka Bank Ltd., whose convertible offering
last April was the first by a Japanese company since 2002,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman had only
underwritten seven Japanese convertible-note sales in the decade
prior to 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Convertible bonds have established themselves as one
funding tool, so all regional lenders have no choice but to
consider them to some extent,&#8221; Hiroyuki Sugiura, a vice
president at Goldman&#8217;s investment banking division at the
company&#8217;s Japanese unit in Tokyo said in an April 11 interview.
They offer the regional lenders cheaper funding, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abe&#8217;s stimulus program to overcome 15 years of deflation
has spurred a stock market recovery that has allowed banks to
get favorable terms on their convertibles, with the three
lenders all selling zero-coupon notes. The regional institutions
will use the funds to lend to clients expanding overseas as a
shrinking domestic population curtails growth prospects at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quickest Proposal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs underwrote $330 million of the $1.3 billion
of dollar convertible bonds sold by regional banks over the past
12 months, a figure exceeded only by Nomura Holdings Inc. Morgan
Stanley, the next biggest overseas manager, managed $120
million, Bloomberg-compiled data show. Nomura, Japan&#8217;s largest
brokerage, arranged $585 million in debt, including an issuance
by Yamaguchi Financial Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman was the quickest in bringing us a proposal,&#8221;
Katsunori Nakanishi, the president of Shizuoka Bank, said
yesterday in an interview. &#8220;After looking at the success of our
deal, it became easier for other regional banks to follow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of convertible notes, which combine a fixed-income
security with an option to buy stock, have surged since Abe&#8217;s
stimulus program sparked a 51.5 percent gain in the Topix
benchmark index last year. While the index is down 13 percent
since the start of this year, it&#8217;s still higher than at any
point from 2009 to 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for Japanese convertibles has been 10 to 15 times
more than the amount of notes on offer since the beginning of
2014, Takashi Masuda, head of equity linked products at Goldman
in Tokyo, said in the same interview. Outstanding issuances have
fallen to about 1.5 trillion yen ($14.8 billion) from about 10
trillion yen in 2000, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bond Returns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese exchangeable-note returns fell 3.9 percent this
year, following a 35 percent gain in 2013 which was their best
performance since 1999, data from UBS AG show. While the bonds
have insulated investors somewhat from stock-market declines,
they&#8217;re underperforming the 2.4 percent gain in convertible debt
globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Japanese companies including Joyo Bank Ltd. sold $900
million in dollar convertibles so far this year, compared with
$1 billion for all of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are more than 100 companies in Yamagata with
overseas operations and we will use the money to help meet their
funding needs,&#8221; said Nobuhiro Konno, the manager of the general
planning and coordination division at Yamagata Bank, based in
northern Japan. &#8220;Since the sale of dollar convertibles by
Shizuoka, Iwate and Yamaguchi Financial, a lot of brokerages
came to explain the product, and that was the catalyst for our
sale.&#8221; The bank sold $100 million of five-year convertible
debentures this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yen Convertibles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other regional banks including Nagano Bank Ltd. and Daisan
Bank Ltd. have issued yen-denominated convertibles this year,
with financial institutions accounting for the biggest amount of
sales by sector after industrials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shizuoka Bank&#8217;s dollar notes due 2018 can be exchanged for
shares at $13.46, or 18 percent above the closing stock price on
April 9 in dollar terms. The stock was at the equivalent of
$9.38 yesterday. Shares in Yamagata Bank closed at $4.01 April
14, compared with a conversion price of $5.09 on its 2019 debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s cheap dollars, and all the larger regional banks are
trying to increase their U.S. dollar lending as their clients
increasingly venture overseas,&#8221; Graeme Knowd, an associate
managing director who overseas financial institutions at Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service in Tokyo said in a phone interview. &#8220;Given
they lend to Japanese corporates, they probably need to fund as
cheaply as possible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abe Stimulus &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abe came to power in December 2012 calling for fiscal
spending, deregulation and Bank of Japan monetary easing to
raise the inflation rate to 2 percent. BOJ stimulus has helped
weaken the yen more than 14 percent against the dollar since the
end of 2012, bolstering the overseas earnings of Japanese
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen traded at 101.61 per dollar as of 5:22 p.m. in
Tokyo yesterday, while the benchmark 10-year bond yield was at
0.605 percent, the world&#8217;s lowest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-yen-denominated lending by Shizuoka Bank rose 91
percent to the equivalent of 414.4 billion yen at the end of
last year, compared with a 5.5 percent increase in total loans
to 6.98 trillion yen. The bank said yesterday it will seek to
boost lending at overseas branches to $3 billion by March 2019
from an estimated $1.72 billion for the fiscal year just ended
as part of a medium-term plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biggest Underwriter &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been the biggest manager of global
convertible bonds for the last three years, underwriting about
$14 billion in 2013 including notes sold by Yahoo Inc., Tesla
Motors Inc. and Air France-KLM, Bloomberg-compiled data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank hasn&#8217;t underwritten any yen-denominated convertible bonds since it helped manage Sony
Corp.&#8217;s 150 billion yen issue in November 2012. Prior to that
Goldman helped manage one convertible bond deal each in 2009,
2008 and 2007, by Japanese issuers, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convertible sales this year may exceed last year, said
Goldman&#8217;s Masuda, adding the bank is looking to underwrite both
yen and dollar-denominated deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If issuance continues to climb, we&#8217;re confident of taking
market share,&#8221; Masuda said. &lt;/p&gt;

KKR will keep a minority stake in the company, according to a

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects
commodity prices to decline this year even after precious metals
and crop prices rallied on Ukraine tension and weather concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index may drop 4 percent in
the next 12 months from a 4.3 percent decrease predicted in
February, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report dated
yesterday. Precious metals will decline 15 percent, compared
with a 14 percent retreat forecast in February, it said.
Agriculture prices will drop 10 percent, from February&#8217;s
estimate of a 9 percent loss, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold rose 10 percent in 2014, rebounding from the biggest
drop since 1981, as unrest in Ukraine and concerns the global
recovery may be uneven boosted demand for a haven. Tensions in
Ukraine also contributed to corn&#8217;s 20 percent jump this year on
speculation supply may be disrupted and dry weather in the U.S.
pushed wheat 12 percent higher. The six-month rolling
correlation of commodities and equities returns has averaged 23
percent this year, the lowest since 2008, Goldman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since the beginning of the year, transient events
including cold weather, Chinese credit concerns and tensions in
Crimea have driven commodity prices,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;Although
these drivers are transient in nature, they are idiosyncratic,
which has helped to drive down the correlations not only with
other asset classes but also within the commodity space itself,
reinforcing the diversifying component of the strategic
investment case for commodities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gold Forecast &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullion&#8217;s recent rally was spurred by poor U.S. data
probably linked to the weather and rising tension in Ukraine,
Goldman said, maintaining a year-end forecast of $1,050 an
ounce. With the tapering of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s bond-buying
program, U.S. economic releases will return as the driving force
behind lower prices, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn will drop to $4 a bushel in 12 months on expectations
U.S. plantings will be higher than the U.S. Department of
Agriculture forecasts, increasing stockpiles, Goldman said.
Wheat will decline to $5.75 a bushel on production prospects in
Europe and the Black Sea, and normalization of U.S. rains, it
said. Soybeans may drop to $10.50 a bushel on record South
American output, slowing Chinese imports and as U.S. acreage
reaches an all-time high, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nickel may climb to as much as $20,000 a metric ton should
Indonesia&#8217;s ore export ban remain in place after its July
presidential election, according to Goldman. Prices in London
surged 28 percent this year as Indonesia, the largest miner of
nickel, curbed ore exports to spur local processing. Copper will
drop to $6,200 a ton over the next 12 months, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy prices are set to decline 2.5 percent in the next 12
months, from a 3.5 percent drop forecast in February, Goldman
said today. Livestock will retreat 2 percent, from a February
forecast of unchanged prices, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Isis Almeida" date="Apr 14, 2014  7:52 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-14/sanctions-on-russian-energy-are-unlikely-goldman-citi-say.html"><headline>Goldman Says Russian Energy-Export Sanctions Are Unlikely</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Western nations probably won&#8217;t
impose energy export-related sanctions on Russia amid escalating
tensions in Ukraine as Europe has little alternative to Russian
gas, according to Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe could displace Russian gas imports for eight weeks
before prices need to rise to attract supplies of liquefied
fuel, Goldman analysts led by Jeff Currie in London said in an
e-mailed report dated yesterday. Spare capacity available on the
Nordstream pipeline from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea
wouldn&#8217;t cover lost volumes if Ukraine transit was disrupted,
Citigroup said in a separate report dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia, the world&#8217;s biggest energy exporter, called for an
emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council after
Ukrainian security forces clashed with pro-Russian gunmen in the
eastern town of Slovyansk. Ukraine is key to Europe&#8217;s energy
security because pipelines crossing the country carry Russian
gas making up about 15 percent of the region&#8217;s supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the worst-case scenario where energy flows are
disrupted, we would expect the European natural gas market to
tighten significantly,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;The global crude oil
market becomes better supplied with U.S. and OPEC ramping up
production on top of ample reserves today, suggesting a
deflationary rather than inflationary impact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camouflaged gunmen fired on Ukrainian government forces
near Slovyansk, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) from the
Russian frontier, Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said.
&#8220;Henchmen&#8221; of the government in Kiev are organizing attacks
with the backing of Western nations, Russia&#8217;s Ambassador to the
United Nations Vitaly Churkin said at an emergency session of
the Security Council in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gas Storage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. natural gas futures extended their biggest weekly gain
since 2011, paring their decline for the year to 23 percent
after the mildest winter in seven years cut demand and left
inventories brimming. Prices have been &#8220;relatively
unresponsive&#8221; to the tensions between Russia and Ukraine and
significant disruptions in Russian gas supply to Europe are
unlikely, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas stockpiles in Europe were 48.1 percent full yesterday,
compared with 20 percent at the same time last year, according
to data on the website of Gas Infrastructure Europe, a Brussels-based lobby group. Contracted supplies have continued to flow
&#8220;healthily&#8221; to western Europe from its two main suppliers,
Russia&#8217;s gas-pipeline monopoly OAO Gazprom and Norway&#8217;s Statoil
ASA, according to Citigroup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue Source &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A stoppage of Russian oil and gas flows to/via Ukraine or
to Europe as a whole could be hugely impactful for oil and gas
prices, especially if it is long-lasting,&#8221; said Citigroup
analysts including Edward Morse. &#8220;A disruption of gas flows in
the short run would be muted by current high storage in Europe
due to the recent mild winter and the upcoming seasonal slowdown
in demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas exports to Europe are &#8220;an important source&#8221; of
revenue for Russia, making reductions unlikely, according to
Goldman Sachs. While Ukraine&#8217;s refusal to accept Russian gas
until prices are discounted has raised the risk of cut-offs, a
resolution is expected &#8220;in the near term&#8221; given the
consequences it could have for all parties, Citigroup said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European gas prices may need to fall further to boost usage
in the power sector at the expense of coal, which could start to
happen when prices fall below 45 pence a therm ($7.53 a million
British thermal units), according to Citigroup. Front-month gas
on the National Balancing Point hub rose 2.1 percent to 53.2
pence a therm at 12:41 p.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that U.K. NBP prices are not likely to be
unduly pressured,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;We still expect northwest
European gas markets to remain well supplied this year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a switch to gas may happen this summer, winter gas
prices will make burning coal more advantageous, Citigroup said,
forecasting U.K. prices at 56 pence a therm this year and 55
pence in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold will resume a decline as U.S.
economic growth accelerates, according to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., which reiterated a forecast for the metal to end the year
at $1,050 an ounce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullion&#8217;s rally this year was spurred by poor U.S. data
probably linked to the weather and rising tension in Ukraine,
analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report, describing the
reasons as transient. With the tapering of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s
bond-buying program, U.S. economic releases will return as the
driving force behind lower prices, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold&#8217;s 12-year bull run ended in 2013 as the Fed prepared
to reduce monthly bond-buying that fueled gains in asset prices
while failing to stoke inflation. Prices rose 10 percent this
year even as the Fed cut purchases, with Russia&#8217;s annexation of
Crimea and mixed U.S. economic data boosting haven demand. Last
year, Currie described gold as a &#8220;slam-dunk sell&#8221; for 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would require a significant sustained slowdown in U.S.
growth for us to revisit our expectation for lower gold prices
over the next two years,&#8221; Currie wrote in the report, dated
yesterday. &#8220;While further escalation in tensions could support
gold prices, we expect a sequential acceleration in both U.S.
and Chinese activity, and hence for gold prices to decline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold for immediate delivery traded 0.3 percent higher at
$1,322.01 an ounce at 7:43 p.m. in Singapore, according to
Bloomberg generic pricing, after the United Nations Security
Council met to address the Ukraine crisis. Bullion last traded
below $1,050 an ounce in February 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullion is the least preferred commodity among metals as
prices resume a decline this year on the outlook for rising U.S.
interest rates and low inflation expectations, Morgan Stanley
said in a report on April 8. Average prices are expected to drop
for the next four quarters, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stronger U.S. growth this year and next will help the world
economy withstand weaker recoveries in emerging markets,
according to the International Monetary Fund. The world&#8217;s
largest economy will expand 2.8 percent this year and 3 percent
in 2015, unchanged from forecasts in January, the IMF said in
its World Economic Outlook report last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) named Bo Zethraeus as head of investment banking for Sweden as dealmaking
picks up in the Nordic region, replacing Johan Lustig, who left
to join Bank of America Corp. (BAC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zethraeus, who was the New York-based bank&#8217;s head of equity
capital markets for the Nordic countries, has more than 25 years
of experience as an investment banker in Sweden and  built
relationships with companies, private-equity firms and the
government, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman confirmed the contents of the memo and said
Zethraeus will report to Jake Donavan, senior country officer
for the Benelux and Nordic nations. The memo was written by
Donavan as well as Klaus Hessberger and Achintya Mangla, co-heads of the equity capital markets team in Europe, the Middle
East and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zethraeus joined JPMorgan from Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken AB (SEBA) in 2001. JPMorgan plans to announce his replacement as
head of Nordic equity capital markets soon, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan advised Nets Holding A/S on its sale to Advent
International Corp., Bain Capital LLC and Danish pension fund
ATP last month, as well as Jyske Bank A/S on its acquisition of
BRFkredit A/S for about $1.36 billion in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America hired Lustig to be head of global corporate
and investment banking in the Nordic region, according to a memo
to the bank&#8217;s staff on April 7. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Lynne Ng Su Ling, an independent director at LionGold Corp., traded
lawsuits in London over payment demands after shares owned by Ng
and held by the bank as debt collateral plunged in an October
stock rout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Goldman Sachs units are seeking $17.5 million from Ng,
money the bank says she owes after it sold her shares, according
to a countersuit by the bank filed March 24 and made available
over the weekend. In a complaint served on Goldman Sachs in
February, Ng says the bank failed to use reasonable efforts to
get the best price available when it sold her stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ng&#8217;s portfolio with Goldman Sachs totaled S$113 million
($90 million) including shares in Asiasons Capital Ltd. (ACAP), Blumont
Group Ltd. (BLUM) and LionGold, as of Sept. 30, according to court
papers. She is the third client Goldman has sued over unpaid
debts related to a stock crash over three days in October that
wiped $6.9 billion off the market value of LionGold, Blumont
Group Ltd. and Asiasons Capital Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sudden declines prompted the city&#8217;s central bank and
white-collar crime agency to probe suspected stock-trading
irregularities around the tumble. Banks and brokers are seeking
to recover at least $230 million from the stock rout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Gross just can&#8217;t catch a
break. As investors flock to funds designed to make money even
if interest rates increase, Gross&#8217;s Pacific Investment
Management Co. is alone among the biggest bond managers in
suffering withdrawals from the strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a category that&#8217;s been the most popular choice for
fixed-income investors this year, the Pimco Unconstrained Bond
Fund (PUBAX) has lost $2.7 billion to redemptions. Similar offerings
from Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
BlackRock Inc. have seen a surge of deposits from investors
seeking to avoid potential bond-market losses. The Pimco fund
has trailed a majority of peers over the past three and five
years, and has lagged behind most rivals over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pimco has kind of shot themselves in the foot here,&#8221;
said Steve Roge, a money manager with Bohemia, New York-based
R.W. Roge  Co., where he helps oversee $225 million. &#8220;In a new
category where there are other choices, why is someone going to
look at a fund that has been a bottom performer?,&#8221; said Roge,
who owns several Pimco funds but has no money in Pimco
Unconstrained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The redemptions from the fund are particularly painful for
Pimco because bond managers are counting on the flexible
strategy to attract money as investors flee traditional funds in
anticipation of the end of a bull market in bonds. Gross&#8217;s Pimco
Total Return Fund (PTTRX) suffered record redemptions last year after
the 70-year-old manager misjudged the impact of the Federal
Reserve&#8217;s move to scale back its bond-buying program -- a
mistake echoed by the Unconstrained fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-traditional funds attracted $12.6 billion in the first
three months of 2014, with offerings from Goldman Sachs,
JPMorgan and BlackRock collecting a combined $10.7 billion
through March, according to data from Chicago-based Morningstar
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, $24.3 billion Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund was
Pimco&#8217;s best-selling mutual fund as investors added $8.7
billion. Industrywide, unconstrained or flexible funds as a
group collected $55 billion last year. Intermediate funds, the
biggest category of bond funds, which includes Pimco Total
Return, saw withdrawals of $79 billion, Morningstar data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The redemptions over the past year mark a new phase for
Pimco, which has more than doubled assets since 2008 as
investors fled to the perceived safety of bonds following the
financial crisis. As that rally has come to an end, Gross and
the Newport Beach, California-based company he co-founded in
1971 have faced their share of challenges this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;El-Erian Departure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, Gross&#8217;s heir apparent, Mohamed El-Erian,
unexpectedly announced his resignation as chief executive
officer and co-chief investment officer. His departure was
followed by reports of tension between the two. Gross lashed out
at El-Erian in a June meeting as performance stumbled and
withdrawals continued, two people familiar with the matter said
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco Total Return suffered record redemptions of $41.1
billion last year and lost its title as the world&#8217;s biggest
mutual fund. Clients pulled an estimated net $3.1 billion from
the fund and $7.3 billion from all of Pimco&#8217;s U.S. mutual funds
in March, according to Morningstar. Pimco&#8217;s assets under
management declined to $1.94 trillion as of March. 31, from a
peak of $2.04 trillion last March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco Unconstrained&#8217;s former manager, Chris Dialynas, said
in December that he was going to take a sabbatical. Gross took
over the management of the fund, highlighting the importance of
the strategy to the firm. Dialynas, who joined Pimco in 1980,
had run the fund since it was created in June 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gross Overhauls &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Gross took over management, he made changes including
extending the effective duration, or sensitivity to interest
rates, as well as jettisoning 30-year Treasuries (USGG30YR) and most of the
agency mortgage bonds. The duration of the fund more than
doubled to 4.1 years in December before falling back to 2.1
years as of March 31, Pimco&#8217;s website shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange County Employees Retirement System voted Jan. 29 to
put the Unconstrained strategy on a watch list for change in key
personnel after investment consultant NEPC LLC said it had
&#8220;elevated&#8221; concerns following the management change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible funds can buy anything in the fixed-income realm,
from emerging market debt to credit default swaps, and they also
have the ability to bet against rates, which means they make
money if rates climb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Wide Net&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can cast a wide net, long or short,&#8221; said William
Eigen, manager of the $26.3 billion JPMorgan Strategic Income
Opportunities Fund, (JSOAX) which passed Pimco Unconstrained in March to
become the biggest of what are considered non-traditional bond
funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Unconstrained Bond fund has the flexibility to
navigate across the fixed-income spectrum, it wasn&#8217;t able to
avoid losses last year because, along with other Pimco funds, it
is guided by the firm&#8217;s world view on everything from the global
economy to interest rates. Gross, in a December interview posted
on Pimco&#8217;s website, said a model portfolio established by the
firm&#8217;s investment committee is the driving force behind the
positioning of its funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unconstrained Bond fund was hurt last year by holding
intermediate and long-dated bonds when former Fed Chairman Ben
S. Bernanke in May hinted that the central bank might scale back
its bond-buying program. The subsequent increase in interest
rates caused those bonds to lose value. The fund also suffered
losses in its holdings of emerging-market debt, according to a
December regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trailing Peers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco Unconstrained fell 2.6 percent last year, lagging
behind 84 percent of peers, Morningstar data show. The fund&#8217;s
assets have declined 16 percent since July 31, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco Unconstrained has had &#8220;unexciting,&#8221; results, Eric Jacobson, an analyst for Morningstar, wrote in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s also possible that the recent drama at Pimco is
having some effect,&#8221; said Jacobson, referring to the departure
of El-Erian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabrina Callin, the product manager for Pimco&#8217;s
Unconstrained Bond strategy, which has $46 billion in assets,
said it is not a surprise that some rival funds have done
better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shunning Credit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many of the funds in this universe are very credit-oriented, especially high-yield credit,&#8221; said Callin in a
telephone interview. &#8220;People who have had that risk exposure
have done well.&#8221; Credit generally refers to corporate debt,
which is sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco Unconstrained has never been focused on corporate
credit or other risk assets, she said. It is designed instead to
preserve capital and limit losses in falling markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. high-yield bonds returned 7.4 percent in 2013,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The Pimco
fund had 2 percent of its money in junk bonds as of Dec. 31 and
had a bet against the bonds as of Sept. 30, according to data on
Pimco&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Eigen said his fund had more than 40 percent of
its money in high-yield bonds at the beginning of 2013. He cut
that allocation to 25 percent as of Feb. 28, according to the
fund&#8217;s website, as the bonds rallied. JPMorgan Strategic Income
Opportunities Fund climbed 2.8 percent in 2013, ahead of 74
percent of rivals, according to Morningstar data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Beats &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $20.7 billion Goldman Sachs Strategic Income Fund (GSZAX),
which gained 6.1 percent last year to beat 97 percent of peers,
was generally bullish on corporate bonds in 2013 on the
assumption the debt would do well in an improving economy,
Jonathan Beinner, manager of the fund said in a telephone
interview. The fund had 5.1 percent of its money in high-yield
bonds as of Dec. 31, data from Goldman&#8217;s website show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $14.8 billion BlackRock (BLK) Strategic Income Opportunities
Portfolio, which rose 3 percent last year, had a 21 percent
allocation to bonds rated BB or lower, below investment grade,
as of Dec. 31, a blend of high-yield bonds, bank loans and
emerging-market debt, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pimco fund has also had a different take than rivals on
the maturities of bonds it prefers. Last year, the fund held
intermediate and long-term bonds. This year, according to
Pimco&#8217;s website, the fund has invested at the front-end of the
yield curve, usually defined as bonds with maturities of 1-5
years, and has bet against longer-dated bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the fund has advanced 1.3 percent, with the
second-best returns of the four biggest flexible funds, trailing
only the BlackRock fund. In March, shorter-term bonds fell as
the Federal Reserve suggested it could begin raising interest
rates in 2015. The bonds have rallied in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rieder&#8217;s Approach &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Rieder, manager of BlackRock Strategic Income, took
the exact opposite approach to Pimco&#8217;s. He avoided longer-term
debt in 2013, which helped his performance, he said in a
telephone interview. He bought those bonds this year, another
plus, and bet against bonds with between 3 years and 7 years of
maturity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are not a lot of cheap assets out there so you have
to be nimble,&#8221; said Rieder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman and JPMorgan funds are both wagering that rates
in general will climb this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are believers in an economic rebound, and you have to
think rates will normalize as is the economy does,&#8221; said Eigen.
Goldman expects rates to rise in the U.S., and the United
Kingdom, said Beinner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Low Inflation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross has argued the Fed will be in no rush to raise rates
because inflation remains well below the central bank&#8217;s target
of 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Pimco, Callin said the goal of the Unconstrained Bond
fund is to produce good risk-adjusted results over the long
haul. In the past three years, the fund&#8217;s risk-adjusted results
were the lowest among the four funds, according to the Bloomberg
Riskless Return Ranking. The BlackRock fund ranked first,
followed by the Goldman fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pimco may not get every call right every day or every
year,&#8221; said Callin. &#8220;But we have a good long-term record of
getting things right for investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent can exhale now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest soda maker today showed signs of a
rebound in the first three months of the year, easing the
concerns that arose when the company unsettled investors with
surprisingly sluggish global sales in the fourth quarter.
Earnings met estimates, sales volume in North America halted its
slide, and sales gains were strong in markets such as China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the fourth-quarter report, Kent promised improvement
and implemented a cost-cutting program that&#8217;s already showing
some progress. Global sales volume rose 2 percent, and an
emphasis on new package sizes helped boost pricing by 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add it all together and profit excluding some items was 44
cents a share in the three months ended March 28, Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola said today in a statement. That matched the average of
18 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income fell
7.5 percent $1.62 billion, or 36 cents a share, from $1.75
billion, or 39 cents, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t think this is a great result, but satisfying as
one step in the right direction to restore momentum,&#8221; Kent said
during a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume in North America was little changed in the first
quarter, compared with a 1 percent decline in the fourth
quarter. Sales on that basis strengthened in emerging markets,
including a 12 percent gain in China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella touted new products at an event in San Francisco for the third time in as many weeks, part of an effort to re-establish the software maker as an innovator. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella, who took the top job in February, unveiled new tools and software for sifting through large amounts of data to identify trends and patterns at a meeting with developers today at the Bentley Reserve Building. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company has been rolling out products for corporate clients that are seeking to manage Web-linked devices and crunch the information they generate. Nadella, who took the top job in February after leading the cloud and enterprise group, is working to remake Microsoft for an era where mobile gadgets have become central, corporations run software from remote servers and household electronics get more connected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The most imporant thing is to create a data culture,&#8221; Nadella said at the event. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analytics tools are in demand as a greater number of hardware devices, from personal-fitness monitors to thermostats to industrial equipment, connect to the Web, generating a sea of data. By 2020, the amount of information created may reach 5,247 gigabytes per person, according to Microsoft. That&#8217;s twice as many bytes of data than liters of water in the world&#8217;s oceans, the Redmond, Washington-based company said last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s yet another boost to the volume of data,&#8221; said Dan Vesset, an analyst at researcher IDC, referring to the surge in smart devices. &#8220;That&#8217;s another reason why they should be, and are, investing more in this space.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sorting Data &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Analytics Platform System is the latest of Microsoft&#8217;s efforts to beef up its products for storing and sorting through all the information produced by connected devices, known as Big Data. On April 1, Microsoft released its SQL Server 2014 database software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think Microsoft has an advantage in here,&#8221; Andrew Snodgrass, an analyst at researcher Directions on Microsoft, said in an interview. &#8220;If you take a look at the databases out there, they are already Microsoft anyway. What they are saying is, they want companies to do more with their data, while they still are using its databases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A number of technology companies -- Microsoft, Oracle Corp. (ORCL), and International Business Machines Corp. among them -- are competing in the Big Data market, which reached $13 billion last year and will grow at a compounded annual rate of 27 percent through 2017, according to IDC. That includes software, hardware and services. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now we are into real investment,&#8221; Vesset said. &#8220;There&#8217;s more and more evidence that having this technology can make a difference from the competitive perspective, or increase productivity. There&#8217;s demand out there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sangwon Yoon" date="Apr 15, 2014  1:34 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-15/iran-complains-about-u-s-visa-refusal-for-envoy.html"><headline>Iran Complains About U.S. Visa Refusal for Envoy</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Iran filed a complaint to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressing &#8220;serious concern&#8221; over the Obama administration&#8217;s refusal to grant a visa to an Iranian diplomat tied to the 1979 takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ghollamhossein Dehghani, the acting head of the Iranian UN mission, submitted a letter yesterday requesting that the UN General Assembly take up the matter, mission spokesman Hamid Babaei said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dehghani will meet Ban&#8217;s legal adviser, Miguel de Serpa Soares, today in New York, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said by phone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. refusal is &#8220;in breach of their legal obligations under international law&#8221; and its accord with the UN, Dehghani wrote, according to excerpts of his correspondence provided by Babaei. &#8220;This decision of the U.S. government has indeed negative implications for multilateral diplomacy and will create a dangerous precedence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The complaint came three days after President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration said that Hamid Aboutalebi won&#8217;t get the visa he needs to enter the U.S. and lead the Iranian delegation at UN headquarters in New York. Efforts to improve strained ties between the U.S. and Iran have been damaged by the standoff over Iranian President Hassan Rouhani&#8217;s choice of Aboutalebi amid multinational negotiations over the Islamic Republic&#8217;s nuclear program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;International Law &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Iran asked Ban to help resolve the dispute and gain U.S. admission for its designated envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the official Islamic Republic News Agency earlier yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aboutalebi, who previously served as Iran&#8217;s ambassador to Belgium and Italy, has been linked to the student group that led the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The U.S. responded by breaking diplomatic ties with Iran, and since then Tehran&#8217;s UN envoy has been its senior diplomat in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Refusing a visa to &#8220;a representative of a UN member-state is in contravention of the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, including the principles of sovereign equality of states and respect for their sovereignty and political independence,&#8221; Dehghani said in the letter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dehghani urged that the issue be addressed in an &#8220;extraordinary and urgent manner&#8221; by the General Assembly&#8217;s Committee on Relations with the Host Country, a 19-member group that manages UN diplomats&#8217; immigration, security and visas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8217;Security Threat&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The committee will hold a meeting on April 22 where the Iranian delegation will brief members on the matter, the UN&#8217;s Dujarric said, citing information provided by Nicholas Emiliou, Cyprus&#8217;s ambassador to the UN who is chairman of the committee. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1988, the U.S. denied a visa to Yasser Arafat, then-chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who wanted to address the UN General Assembly because he &#8220;knows of, condones and lends support&#8221; to acts of terrorism. The General Assembly session was moved to Geneva, where such visa constraints don&#8217;t exist. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following a formal appeal to the committee by the PLO, the UN&#8217;s legal office ruled that the U.S. was required to grant the visa under its 1947 agreement with the UN. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;U.S. Law &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The accord &#8220;does not contain a reservation of the right to bar the entry of those who represent, in the view of the host country, a threat to its security,&#8221; according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Congress in 1947 approved the Headquarters Agreement Act, which obligates the American government to grant visas to UN diplomats. Even so, a U.S. president can cite domestic laws to deny visas to individuals deemed to pose a security threat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While there are no international mechanisms that require the U.S. to uphold its agreement with the UN over its domestic laws, there is an expectation for the U.S. to adhere to international accords, said two UN officials who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Alaa Shahine" date="Apr 15, 2014  6:03 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-15/jpmorgan-targeting-gulf-leaps-to-no-2-for-bonds-arab-credit.html"><headline>JPMorgan Targeting Gulf Leaps to No. 2 for Bonds: Arab Credit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. is gaining
ground in the debt markets of Gulf Cooperation Council states
after the biggest U.S. bank helped manage this month&#8217;s Islamic
bond sale by Saudi Arabia&#8217;s utility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the biggest bond underwriter after HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) in the six-nation GCC in 2014, its best start to a
year since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
New York-based lender advised on six deals, including Saudi
Electricity (SECO) Co.&#8217;s $2.5 billion sukuk sale on April 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its jump from sixth place in the rankings at the end of
2013 partly reflects the rise of Islamic finance, which will
become a $2.7 trillion market by 2017, according to
PricewaterhouseCoopers. Sukuk made up more than 70 percent of
total bond issuance this year in the GCC, which supplies one-fifth of world oil, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Islamic finance now has the biggest slice of the bond
market,&#8221; Samer Mardini, a vice president of fixed income at SJS
Markets Ltd. in Dubai, said in a phone interview yesterday.
&#8220;Issuers are more comfortable with big names like JPMorgan.
They can act as market-makers and bookrunners to ensure a
successful issuance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan hired former UBS AG banker Hussein Hassan last
year to head global Shariah-compliant financing. It has also
&#8220;intensified its focus on corporate clients&#8217; needs in the Gulf
region over the past few years,&#8221; Hani Deaibes, head of Middle
East and North Africa debt capital markets at the bank, said in
an e-mailed response to questions yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rate Clarity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This effort, combined with more market certainty, has
better positioned us to assist them in raising funding across
the international and domestic markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International bond-market conditions have become
&#8220;conducive&#8221; since the start of the year as the U.S. Federal
Reserve provided more clarity on interest rates, encouraging
companies to raise long-term funding, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Electricity raised $1 billion in 30-year sukuk and
$1.5 billion in 10-year securities. HSBC and Deutsche Bank AG
also worked on the transaction. Deutsche Bank is the region&#8217;s
third-biggest underwriter this year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GCC has become a battleground for international banks
as other parts of the Middle East and North Africa struggle to
recover from political turmoil following a series of popular
uprisings that first erupted in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic growth in the oil-rich Gulf region is set to
accelerate to 4.4 percent this year, compared with 2.8 percent
for non-oil producers, according to HSBC forecasts released in
January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sales Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s performance has come even as bond sales dropped
almost 50 percent this year to $8 billion as some regular
issuers, such as cash-flushed banks, refrain from tapping the
market and offer cheaper loans to companies, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan said Hassan, previously global head
of Islamic structuring for UBS, is focusing on clients in
countries including Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, according to an
e-mailed statement at the time of his appointment in January
2013. Malaysia hosts the world&#8217;s biggest market for Islamic
bonds, or sukuk, while Saudi Arabia boasts the world&#8217;s biggest
share of Shariah-compliant assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Saudi borrowers may still issue debt after Fitch
Ratings upgraded the kingdom one level in March to AA, the
third-highest investment grade, according to John Sfakianakis,
chief investment strategist at MASIC in Riyadh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The recent sovereign upgrade should also help issuers who
are looking for more competitive pricing,&#8221; he said in an e-mailed response to questions yesterday. Economic growth in Saudi
Arabia may accelerate to 4.2 percent in 2014, from 3.8 percent a
year earlier, according to economists&#8217; estimates provided to
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has helped arrange bond sales for Saudi Arabia&#8217;s
National Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC, Qatar
National Bank QD, as well as Kuwait Projects Co., data compiled
by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the end of the day, it&#8217;s all about being competitive
in pricing against the rest,&#8221; Sfakianakis said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
only way it can be done in a market that is price sensitive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cencosud SA dollar bonds fell to a
two-week low after JPMorgan Chase  Co. lowered the debt of
Latin America&#8217;s third-largest retailer to hold, saying a
downgrade to junk would force some funds to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities due in 2023 dropped 0.47 cent to 96.38 cents
on the dollar at 4:40 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The yield rose seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 5.40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reduced its recommendation on Cencosud&#8217;s bonds
maturing in 2021 and 2023 to the equivalent of hold, citing the
possibility that Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings may
lower their ratings on the Santiago-based company from Baa3 and
BBB-, just one level above junk. The ratio of adjusted net debt
to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
is 4.1, compared with 3.5 or less for an investment-grade
company, according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is worth taking profits given the higher uncertainty
around a potential downgrade,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts Daniela Savoia
and Julio Arantes said in an e-mailed research note to clients.
A rating cut below investment grade would require some funds to
sell the securities and &#8220;drive spread widening in the short
term,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s total debt rose to $7.4 billion at the end of
2012 from $1.3 billion at the end of 2006 during an acquisition
spree in Peru, Brazil and Colombia. Total debt decreased to $5.6
billion at the end of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch affirmed today its rating for Cencosud at BBB- and
maintained a negative outlook, as the company&#8217;s capital
structure remains weak amid an economic slowdown in Chile and
Brazil, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cencosud&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Daniel Rodriguez pledged
on an April 1 conference call to sell drugstores and service
stations, or &#8220;noncore&#8221; assets, to reduce leverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deal to sell a controlling stake in its credit card
operations to Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) fell apart when the
Brazilian bank decided to focus on a takeover of Chile&#8217;s
Corpbanca SA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) was sued by Iusacell SA, Mexico&#8217;s third-biggest mobile-phone provider, for $2.5 billion in lost profits tied to a 2010
deal that failed. IBM claims the lawsuit is intended to avoid
arbitration over the contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell consulted with IBM in connection with a multiyear
plan to increase market share and revenue, the company said in a
heavily redacted complaint filed today in Manhattan federal
court. Iusacell alleged IBM made fraudulent misrepresentations
that caused it to suffer damages and lose profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM both knowingly misrepresented and wrongfully
concealed from Iusacell material facts both before and during
the parties&#8217; relationship,&#8221; Iusacell said in the complaint. The
public version of the filing doesn&#8217;t explain the alleged
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said today that Iusacell and IBM Mexico entered into a
&#8220;long term contract under which IBM Mexico made significant
investments in Iusacell&#8217;s business operations&#8221; that resulted in
&#8220;major improvement to Iusacell&#8217;s information technology
infrastructure and growth in Iusacell&#8217;s revenues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter is in arbitration, said Doug Shelton, a
spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell, co-owned by billionaire Ricardo Salinas and by
Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the country&#8217;s largest broadcaster, has
struggled to compete with larger rivals such as America Movil
SAB (AMXL) and Telefonica SA. (TEF) The company had 8 million subscribers at
the end of 2013, or about 8 percent of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa recorded a fourth-quarter loss from joint ventures
of 4.74 billion pesos ($363 million), mostly to write down the
value of Iusacell. It acquired its 50 percent stake in the
company from Salinas for $1.6 billion in 2012 and invested an
additional 1.59 billion pesos last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salinas is Mexico&#8217;s fourth-richest person and No. 129 on
the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a net worth of $9.1
billion. He has sued to block Mexico&#8217;s stock exchange from
removing his retail company from the benchmark index and the
government&#8217;s plans to auction off wireless airwaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan McCosh, a spokesman for Salinas&#8217;s group of companies,
declined to immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Iusacell SA de CV v. International Business
Machines Corp., 14-cv-02697, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RedBird Capital Partners LLC, co-founded by a former leader of the private-equity business at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is seeking $400 million for a debut
fund to help back entrepreneurs and business owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerald Cardinale, 46, the former co-head of Americas
private-equity funds at Goldman Sachs, and Earl Rotman, 58, are
targeting a first close of about $150 million within weeks, said
a person with knowledge of the fundraising, who asked not to be
named because the information is private. The two started the
firm last year and will mainly invest in media and
entertainment, sports, communication-infrastructure and
consumer-goods companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardinale spent most of his career at Goldman Sachs, where
he managed more than $6 billion in investments, including a
stake in Yankees Entertainment  Sports Network, which was
founded in 2001 to broadcast the games of the New York Yankees
baseball team and New Jersey Nets basketball team. In 2007, he
worked with Yankees third-baseman Alex Rodriguez to help
negotiate a new contract, people familiar with the matter said
at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrian Maizey, chief operating officer at New York-based
RedBird, declined to comment on fundraising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardinale and Rotman worked together for the first time in
2006, when Goldman Sachs&#8217;s private-equity unit and CanWest
Global Communications, which was led by Leonard Asper, looked to
purchase Canadian media company Alliance Atlantis
Communications. Cardinale helped structure the deal, while
Rotman represented the Asper family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leaving Goldman &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Cardinale, known as Gerry, along with two other
senior employees of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s merchant bank left as the
bank prepared for regulations that would limit its investments
in private-equity funds to 3 percent. Cardinale joined merchant
bank BDT Capital Partners, where he decided he wanted to back
entrepreneurs and business owners so left the firm and teamed
with Rotman to form RedBird, said the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotman had built a business before, when he co-founded
Genuity Capital Markets in 2005, which merged with Canaccord
Financial Inc. in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debut RedBird fund will make equity and structured
equity investments of $30 million to $80 million, according to a
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. It will target
companies with $25 million to $50 million of earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, said the person,
and will also make lifestyle, hospitality and gaming
investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RedBird is gathering commitments as first-time funds find
it harder to attract capital. Debut pools raised $5 billion in
the first quarter, the lowest amount in that period since the
financial crisis, according to London-based researcher Preqin
Ltd. Investors have been narrowing the number of managers they
want to back, making the environment more competitive for fund
managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Nicole Gaouette" date="Apr 16, 2014 10:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-16/jpmorgan-aids-u-s-agency-with-market-based-foreign-aid.html"><headline>JPMorgan Aids U.S. Agency With Market-Based Foreign Aid</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Foreign aid has long been one of
the most unpalatable dishes on the federal plate. Why should
U.S. taxpayers give billions of dollars to ungrateful countries
that will waste it and whose people don&#8217;t like America anyway? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quietly, though, the U.S. Agency for International
Development has been undergoing a market-oriented sea change
that has attracted fans such as Amy Bell, an executive director
of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), and hundreds of Wall Street veterans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re really showcasing the power of business to do
well and do well in a prudent way,&#8221; said Bell, the head of
principal investments for JPMorgan&#8217;s Social Finance unit in New
York, in a telephone interview. &#8220;I think they&#8217;ve done a
remarkable job.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government&#8217;s global anti-poverty agency backs a
private equity fund that Bell&#8217;s JPMorgan unit runs for African
agriculture businesses. It helped General Electric Co. (GE) secure
$10 million in local financing for small maternal-health clinics
in Kenya. It&#8217;s supported loans by Root Capital, a social-investment fund, to help coffee farmers in Latin America supply
Starbucks Inc. (SBUX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a sea change for an agency that for years simply gave
out money. The program, called the Development Credit Authority,
was begun in 1999 under President George W. Bush with authority
from Congress to provide loan guarantees, but in the 10 years
before 2011 it backed only $2.2 billion in credit. Since 2011,
the authority has issued $1 billion in guarantees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shrinking Funding &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s still a fraction of the aid agency&#8217;s effort. AID has
seen its funding shrink from $22.5 billion in fiscal year 2010
to $20.4 billion in fiscal 2014, not adjusted for inflation. The
Obama administration has asked Congress for $20.1 billion in
fiscal 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our developmental objectives -- ending extreme poverty in
15 years, ending preventable child death, ending large-scale,
widespread child hunger -- will only be achieved if we can
effectively harness and deploy massive amounts of private
investment against those goals,&#8221; said Rajiv Shah, the agency&#8217;s
administrator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Shah and Ben Hubbard, former director of the credit
authority, arrived in January 2010, they saw an underutilized
asset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t look at these problems and say, &#8216;How do we get
the appropriations budget to solve this?&#8217;&#8221; Hubbard said in an
interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s, &#8216;How do I attract the private sector to get
this done, because it&#8217;s inherently more sustainable?&#8217; Rather
than building and paying for solar power plants, we can attract
private capital to pay for them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Former Bankers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency&#8217;s credit authority, with a few dozen &#8220;private
sector, deal-oriented&#8221; former bankers and financial analysts,
has brought tools from Wall Street to hone a model that Shah
said he hopes will transform not only development work, but also
the thinking in his agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2011, the credit unit has leveraged private capital
to help companies expand while assisting some of the world&#8217;s
most vulnerable people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit authority guaranteed an $8 million loan by New
York-based JPMorgan to the African Agricultural Capital Fund,
which helped attract equity investors and boost the Uganda-based
fund to $25 million. The arrangement allowed the bank to
experiment with a new market, lending to the small- and medium-sized businesses that are the engine of economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Republican Applause &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private-sector approach has drawn applause from critics
of foreign aid such as Republican Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who&#8217;s praised the credit agency&#8217;s &#8220;proven
track record of significantly leveraging private financing in
support of development aid,&#8221; even as she&#8217;s called for cuts to
other parts of the foreign aid budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development credit agency works in a number of ways.
Most often, it encourages banks in developing countries to loan
to smaller businesses, usually in underserved sectors such as
farming that align with U.S. development goals, by sharing the
risk if there&#8217;s a default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of wealth in these banks, but they&#8217;re risk-averse,&#8221; said Hubbard. &#8220;We don&#8217;t take out all the risk, so
they have skin in the game, but we lower it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Nereus Capital LLC was struggling for funds, the
credit authority partnered with U.S.-based institutional
investors to help raise a $100 million investment in the Mumbai-based company&#8217;s fund for clean-energy projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deploying Wealth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Learning how to deploy that wealth to tackle development
challenges, environmental challenges in India, is how we will
solve extreme poverty and its consequences of child hunger and
child death there,&#8221; said Shah, 41, who earned a medical degree
from the University of Pennsylvania and previously was chief
scientist for the U.S. Agriculture Department and worked for the
Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit authority&#8217;s default rate has been 1.89 percent,
with the aid agency paying out $11.6 million in claims since
1999 and collecting $14.1 million in bank fees. It also provide
credit enhancement to companies such as Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Root Capital, which identified a gap in
financing for farmers&#8217; cooperatives that were too large for
microcredit loans and too small for bank loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cooperatives use the funding to help small farmers
improve their yields, reduce post-harvest losses -- enhancing
food security -- and earn more by selling collectively to
companies such as Seattle-based Starbucks, the world&#8217;s largest
operator of coffee shops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loan Guarantees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the president has asked Congress to raise the
annual cap on the credit authority&#8217;s loan guarantee program to
$2 billion from $1.5 billion. It&#8217;s an idea whose time had come,
Hubbard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, change is sometimes difficult, Shah acknowledges.
The aid agency, created in 1961 by an executive order from
President John F. Kennedy, has 9,421 people worldwide who are
steeped in a culture of giving money away, not raising it. Now,
Hubbard said, overseas missions are being held accountable to
targets for attracting private capital to fund their programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a huge amount of enthusiasm and excitement, and
also resistance in any system to doing things in new and
innovative ways,&#8221; Shah said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution has been to recruit Wall Street veterans to
the government aid agency, with almost 1,000 joining since the
end of the Bush administration, Hubbard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons for signing up vary, said Hubbard, who has left the
agency to start a firm funding businesses in Africa. &#8220;Some lost
their jobs because of the financial crisis and found purpose in
our mission,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Others could command a bigger salary
elsewhere, they just didn&#8217;t have a lot of purpose and meaning in
those positions.&#8221; As a group, he adds, they&#8217;re &#8220;very counter-cultural inside the agency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Flowers, the former chairman
of Co-Operative Bank Plc, was charged with possession of
cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine, almost a month after the
lender said it would post a full-year loss of as much as
1.3 billion pounds ($2.2 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flowers, 63, is scheduled to appear at a criminal court in
Leeds, England, on May 7 to face the charges, the U.K. Crown
Prosecution Service said in a statement today. Flowers, who was
arrested in November as part of a drug investigation after he
was filmed buying crack cocaine by a U.K. newspaper, was
released on bail, West Yorkshire Police said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it
is in the public interest to charge Paul Flowers with possession
of Class A and Class C drugs relating to an incident on Nov. 9,
2013,&#8221; prosecutor Clare Stevens said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulatory and government probes are also in the works
after the Mail on Sunday newspaper reported Nov. 17 that Flowers
bought crystal meth and crack cocaine. Flowers, a Methodist
minister, was Co-Op Bank&#8217;s chairman from March 2010 until June
of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-Operative Group Ltd., the bank&#8217;s parent, ceded control
of the lender to bondholders in October to help plug a 1.5
billion-pound capital shortfall. The bank said last month it
will raise an additional 400 million pounds after discovering a
capital shortfall tied to mounting legal and restructuring
costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Stupid and Wrong&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Flowers&#8217; arrest and the parent company ceded control
of the bank, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne ordered
an independent inquiry. The investigation won&#8217;t start until it&#8217;s
clear it won&#8217;t prejudice any probes by the U.K. Prudential
Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Masters, a spokesman for the bank, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to a request for comment. Flowers&#8217; lawyer also didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a request for comment on the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flowers apologized for his conduct in a statement after his
arrest last year, saying there had been a death in the family
and pressures related to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the lowest point in this terrible period, I did things
that were stupid and wrong,&#8221; Flowers said in the November
statement. &#8220;I am sorry for this, and I am seeking professional
help, and apologize to all I have hurt or failed by my
actions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ketamine, also known as Special K, has pain-killing and
stimulant properties and causes users to become detached from
themselves, according to charity DrugScope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second defendant in the case, Gavin Woroniuk, was charged
with four counts of offering to supply a controlled drug and one
count of possessing criminal property, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) executives said
consumers who listen to ESPN radio and interact with the sports
channel&#8217;s websites spend triple the amount of time with the
company as those who just watch the TV network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fans who take part in ESPN.com&#8217;s fantasy football or use
the Watch ESPN app are with the company 17 hours a month on
average, versus five hours for people who only watch TV. The
data demonstrate that online and mobile offerings boost
engagement with ESPN, as well as the potential for ad sales,
executives told analysts today at ESPN&#8217;s offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s exploded the misconception that digital media would
cannibalize television,&#8221; Arthur Bulgrin, ESPN&#8217;s senior vice
president of global research and analytics, said at the investor
event in Bristol, Connecticut. &#8220;The overall time spent with
ESPN media more than triples and at the same time TV viewing
goes up. It&#8217;s a rising tide that floats all boats.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, is using
the event to showcase ESPN, one of the company&#8217;s most profitable
businesses, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new studio ESPN plans to begin using next month for its
flagship &#8220;SportsCenter&#8221; news show is a &#8220;great example of us
investing in the value of a franchise, investing not only to
continue to protect it but to continue to grow its value,&#8221; Iger
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN&#8217;s online offerings attract larger audiences than Yahoo
Sports, Bleacher Report and NFL.com, Bulgrin said. Mobile use by
customers also exceeds the time spent on desktop computers, he
said. Watch ESPN&#8217;s typical user is 29 years old, compared with
age 47 for the traditional TV viewer. The median income of
$74,000 is 54 percent more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changing Habits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV networks, which accounted for more than half of Disney&#8217;s
profit, face challenges from new video options, the migration of
ad sales to online media and escalating costs for sports rights,
ESPN President John Skipper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deal Disney signed last month that lets Dish Network
Corp. (DISH) create a Web-based service with its programming will
attract customers who don&#8217;t have pay TV now, rather than ones
who trade down from an existing service, Skipper said. He
expects more such deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pay television is going to remain a large business,
though it will exist in a more complicated and dynamic
atmosphere, which will require some evolution of our current
business model,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 1.3 percent to
$79.99 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 4.7
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri" date="Apr 17, 2014 11:21 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-17/disney-offers-obama-minimum-wage-to-florida-park-workers.html"><headline>Disney Offers Obama Minimum Wage to Florida Park Workers</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) has offered to
raise starting pay at its Florida theme parks by 25 percent to
$10 an hour over two years, almost matching the federal minimum
wage sought by President Barack Obama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney presented the proposal yesterday to the Service
Trades Council, a consortium of six labor groups, the company
and union representatives said. They are scheduled to resume
bargaining over a contract on May 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unions, which represent more than 30,000 employees at
Walt Disney World near Orlando, asked for at least $10.10 an
hour, the amount congressional Democrats and Obama propose as a
new U.S. minimum. Starting pay at the Florida parks is now $8.03
an hour, according to Burbank, California-based Disney. That
would reach the rate Disney is offering by July 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased,&#8221; Ed Chambers, president of the
council, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re well on our way
to getting a deal done.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract being negotiated covers full-time hourly
employees at the world&#8217;s most-popular theme-park complex. Disney
reported record profit of $6.6 billion on revenue of $45 billion
last year from its TV networks, parks, studios and consumer
products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is more generous than they have been in the past,&#8221;
said Donna-Lynne Dalton, secretary-treasurer of the council.
&#8220;It comes at a cost.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney also told the unions it wants to stop offering
pensions to new hourly employees starting in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New hires would be offered a 3 percent company match to a
401(k)-style retirement plan, said Dalton. The company doesn&#8217;t
currently contribute to that plan, which is available to
employees from bell staff to costumed entertainers, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Union Opposition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chambers said the union would oppose the pension change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This offer reflects our appreciation and care for our
cast members and our commitment to providing a leading
employment package,&#8221; Kim Prunty, a Disney World spokeswoman,
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We look forward to working with
the union and engaging in constructive negotiations to finalize
and reach a collective bargaining agreement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s last contract with the council took effect in
October 2010, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The pact
included annual raises of 3 percent to 4 percent for workers who
hadn&#8217;t already reached the top of their pay scales, as well as
$650 one-time bonuses for non-tipped, full-time employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s parks and resorts business, the company&#8217;s second-largest division after television, generated operating income of
$2.22 billion last year on sales of $14.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Iger, Disney&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer,
said at the annual meeting in March the company has good
relations with its unions and doesn&#8217;t expect that to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is our intention to behave very responsibly and fairly
with all of our cast members and compensate them in ways that
reflect the value that they create for the company and for our
customers,&#8221; Iger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose 0.7 percent to $79.53 at 11:18 a.m. in New
York. The stock had gained 30 percent in the past year through
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will seek
to have a $1 billion lawsuit by the Libyan Investment Authority
thrown out before trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank will ask a London judge to decide whether the case
has a realistic chance of success and issue a so-called summary
judgment, according to court documents released this week.
Libya&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund says Goldman made about
$350 million selling investments that turned out to be
worthless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LIA said in a statement it &#8220;considers this application
to be misconceived and looks forward to full and proper
determination of all issues by the English court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund is one of dozens of small
companies and government agencies that have sued lenders over
deals the investors claim were too complicated to understand. It
also sued Societe Generale SA (GLE) in a $1.5 billion lawsuit, saying
that the French bank paid about $58 million to a friend of the
Qaddafi family to secure investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiona Laffan, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LIA must convince a judge that its claim has some
chance of success to defeat the summary judgment application.
The case has been put on hold until the court decides on whether
it can continue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is The Libyan Investment Authority v. Goldman
Sachs International, case no. 14-310, High Court of Justice,

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) digital chief
Gavin Michael, who joined the firm a year ago, has a certain
disdain for some competitors&#8217; staid mobile-banking apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While functional, the apps aren&#8217;t intuitive or personalized
enough. So when it came time for the New York-based company to
update its app, with a new iPhone version available today,
Michael, 49, said he studied software produced by technology
startups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;How do I make this simple, human, cohesive? How do we
change the principles we&#8217;re chasing?&#8221; he said in an April 15
interview. &#8220;We looked at what a lot of the startups are doing,
whether it&#8217;s Seamless and the way I order takeout food, or Uber
and the way I catch a cab, or OpenTable and the way I book
restaurant reservations, or the way Apple iOS is shaped.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders including JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by
assets, are leaning on mobile and online offerings to win
loyalty while lowering the cost of retail services. The firm&#8217;s
mobile users rose 24 percent from a year ago to 16.4 million.
Bank of America Corp., the No. 2 U.S. lender, said mobile
customers increased 19 percent to 15 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael, who reports to consumer-banking chief Gordon Smith, joined JPMorgan from consulting firm Accenture, where he
was head of technology innovation. He has since hired executives
from outside finance, including Tim Parsey, a former senior vice
president of design at Yahoo! Inc. and Josh Klenert, a former
designer for the Huffington Post. Both are based in San
Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior versions of the bank&#8217;s mobile app for the iPhone drew
3 1/2 out of five stars on Apple Inc.&#8217;s App Store as of late
yesterday. Bank of America&#8217;s had a similar rating. Apps from San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and New York-based Citigroup
Inc. both had three stars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Greetings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s redesigned app for the iPhone has a simpler
login and location-based greetings to give users a more
personalized experience, Michael said. The background photo
shown to a customer in New York may feature the Brooklyn Bridge,
for example, while a client in San Francisco sees streetcars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People work on an emotional level before they go to the
rational level,&#8221; Michael said. &#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do with
banking is create that emotional experience inside the way which
images are used, the way we greet and the way we understand how
customers bank with us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future versions will probably detect users&#8217; location to
tailor their experience and ease transactions including in-store
purchases and pulling cash from automated teller machines, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cutting Branches &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When I&#8217;m near an ATM, how do I get the two to work so I
can preload transactions?&#8221; Michael said. &#8220;We want a cohesive
experience across our digital and live interactions. So things
should work together and feel like they belong together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile technology has helped firms including Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America reduce bank branches.
Customers &#8220;effectively carry a branch in their pocket,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan, 54, said yesterday on a
conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, branches will remain a key fixture for lenders,
Michael said. They are evolving into places where customers seek
financial advice, while performing routine activities like
depositing checks with mobile phones or ATMs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It changes the relationship you have with the branch, as
opposed to replacing it,&#8221; Michael said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. banks can remain entangled with each other now that global regulators have loosened proposed limits on the financial web that led to investor panic in 2008 and prompted bailouts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which set out a year ago to block banks from relying too heavily on each other, changed course last week, opting to let firms preserve most derivatives and repurchase agreements among themselves. The panel revised formulas for evaluating exposure and used a broader definition of capital. Those tweaks spare about $1 trillion in deals at seven of the biggest U.S. banks that would have exceeded proposed limits, according to a November study by the Clearing House, an industry group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Basel panel of regulators from 27 countries has bowed to industry pressure before to weaken new rules. Liquidity standards and leverage ratios also were altered so the largest firms came much closer to being in compliance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That seems to be the name of the game, fighting every rule to the ground,&#8221; said Anat Admati, a Stanford University finance professor. &#8220;The fact that the banks were so concerned with counterparty limits and fought them so hard shows how interconnected they are. That makes them too big to fail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, held informal, now-discontinued talks with
AstraZeneca Plc about buying the London-based maker of asthma 
and heart drugs, said two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies aren&#8217;t currently negotiating, said the
people, who asked not to be identified. One said the talks
happened several months ago and there are no plans to resume.
The discussions were first reported yesterday by London&#8217;s Sunday
Times, whose unnamed bank and industry sources said New York-based Pfizer made a tentative approach about a takeover valuing
AstraZeneca at more than 60 billion pounds ($101 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If revived, such an acquisition would be among the largest
ever in the industry. Pfizer has reorganized its business over
the past three years, shuttering some research projects and
emphasizing others. A deal with AstraZeneca (AZN) would add early-stage drugs in a field of cancer treatments that use the body&#8217;s
own immune cells to recognize and attack cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t comment on market speculation or rumors,&#8221; said
Andrew Topen, a Pfizer spokesman, in an e-mail. Esra Erkal-Paler, am AstraZeneca spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American depositary receipts for AstraZeneca gained 8.8
percent to $69.10 at 4 p.m. New York time. Pfizer rose 2 percent
to $30.86. The stock has increased about 37 percent in the last
two years as Pfizer benefited from the revamping that focused it
into three units: two for new drugs, and one for older products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AstraZeneca Treatments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca in January announced an agreement with
Immunocore Limited to develop the new cancer treatments that use
the body&#8217;s own immune cells, and it also has several of its own
immune-based drugs being tested in multiple cancers. The
company&#8217;s shares in London have risen about 34 percent over two
years, even as sales have fallen from $33.6 billion in 2011 to
$25.7 billion last year, with further losses projected by some
analysts as drugs lose patent protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a deal would be highly accretive through cost
cutting, Pfizer shareholders may have doubts about AstraZeneca&#8217;s
pipeline as well as its eroding revenue, said Mark Schoenebaum,
an analyst with ISI Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The consensus AstraZeneca model is hugely dependent on
pipeline assumptions, as the base business will deteriorate
massively by 2020 as several key products go off patent,&#8221; he
said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mega-Mergers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A merger of this reported size would top Pfizer&#8217;s 2000
purchase of Warner-Lambert Co. for $87 billion, the industry&#8217;s
largest deal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pfizer
has been at the center of the biggest drugmaker mega-mergers,
making up three of the 10 deals worth more than $30 billion in
the last two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also provide a use for Pfizer&#8217;s cash from profits
that have been stashed overseas instead of being brought back to
the U.S., where they would be taxed at a higher rate. Pfizer had
$69 billion in untaxed cash overseas as of last month, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A purchase of AstraZeneca could also potentially allow
Pfizer to move its tax domicile to the U.K. through a so-called
inversion transaction, a move that has allowed other U.S.
drugmakers to lower their tax bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca shares in London rose 0.6 percent to close at
3,781.50 pence on April 17, giving the company a market value of
47.7 billion pounds. The London stock market was closed for a
holiday April 18 and today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Merger Comments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since taking over in 2010, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read&#8217;s answers to whether or not he would pursue a mega-merger such as a deal with AstraZeneca have shifted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a January conference call in 2012 he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m very
disinclined to be looking at any possibility of another mega-acquisition. You never say never, but we have all of the science
we need.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2013, when Read was asked on another conference
call about the size of deals he might pursue, he replied:
&#8220;We&#8217;ll look at any type of acquisition -- never say never to a
larger acquisition that made sense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schoenebaum said there were signs Pfizer could pursue a
large target. &#8220;Pfizer has been signaling since last summer
that, in theory, the company would not be opposed to a larger
MA deal if the numbers made sense,&#8221; Schoenebaum said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Greg Stohr" date="Apr 21, 2014  9:36 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-21/exxon-rejected-by-court-on-105-million-new-york-award.html"><headline>Exxon Rejected by Court on $105 Million New York Award</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court rejected
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s appeal of a $105 million jury verdict it was
ordered to pay for contaminating underground water in New York
City with a gasoline additive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irving, Texas-based oil and gas company argued
unsuccessfully that any award was premature because the city
isn&#8217;t planning to use the disputed wells in southeastern Queens
for another 15 to 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon used the additive, methyl tertiary butyl ether, to
comply with a 1990 federal law that required an increase in the
oxygen content of gasoline in the smoggiest parts of the
country. New York later banned MTBE, as the additive is known,
because of contamination concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York sued Exxon Mobil and other oil companies in 2003,
alleging that they knew MTBE would pollute groundwater. A New
York-based federal appeals court last year upheld the 2009 jury
verdict against the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Supreme Court, Exxon Mobil argued that the Clean Air
Act shields oil companies from liability for using the safest,
most feasible means of complying with the oxygen requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is one of scores across the country by
municipalities, states and individuals against oil refiners,
distributors and retailers over MTBE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Exxon Mobil v. City of New York, 13-842. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nestle SA (NESN) offered to lift obstacles
to rivals that make knockoff capsules for Nespresso coffee
machines in France, aiming to end a probe by the competition
regulator in the largest market for the iconic brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest coffee maker proposed giving
competitors three months&#8217; notice about technical changes to its
machines and promised it won&#8217;t discourage consumers against
copycats or automatically revoke warranties on Nespresso
machines if compatible capsules are used, according to a
statement April 17 from the French Competition Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling &#8220;was the first of its kind,&#8221; Alain-Sebastian
Oberhuber, an analyst at MainFirst, said in a note. &#8220;Nestle
faces the risk of more such antitrust investigations in other
markets,&#8221; which could hurt sales and profit, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nespresso, the biggest maker of single-serve coffee in
Europe, has been losing market share to capsules made by
companies including D.E Master Blenders 1753, Mondelez
International Inc. (MDLZ) and Ethical Coffee Co. as some of its patents
have expired. Nespresso has been adding espresso varieties and
expanding into areas like the U.S. to boost sales as growth has
slowed in past years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initiatives &#8220;demonstrate the company&#8217;s commitment to
fair and open competition,&#8221; Diane Duperret, a Nespresso
spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Diller Goes Big in U.S. High Court Gamble on Aereo&#8217;s Future &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment billionaire media mogul Barry Diller joined
the board of Aereo Inc. in 2012, he had a date with the U.S.
Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aereo, the streaming-TV startup challenging the economics
of the television industry, goes before the court tomorrow to
fight copyright claims from broadcasters including CBS Corp. (CBS) and
Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC. Aereo&#8217;s Internet service lets customers
in 11 cities watch live and recorded broadcast programs for $8 a
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case marks the culmination of a two-year court fight
stemming from Aereo&#8217;s bid to forge a technological route around
the broadcasters&#8217; copyrights and from Diller&#8217;s hope to transform
an industry he once embodied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcasters say an Aereo victory might create a blueprint
that would let cable and satellite providers stop paying
billions of dollars in retransmission fees each year to carry
local programming. While Aereo questions that assessment, Diller
says his goal is nothing short of upending the TV distribution
system so consumers can buy programming they want, rather than
the packages offered through cable and satellite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Supreme Court now set to rule by early July, the
broadcasters say they are confident the gamble will fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances for a definitive ruling rose last week when Justice
Samuel Alito indicated he will take part. Alito didn&#8217;t
participate when the court agreed in January to hear the
dispute, raising the prospect that the court might divide 4-4.
The court&#8217;s online docket on April 17 said Alito is &#8220;no longer
recused&#8221; from the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is American Broadcasting Companies v. Aereo,
13-461. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pandora Sued by Record Companies Over Music Made Before 1972 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandora Media Inc., (P) the biggest Internet radio service, was
sued by major record labels for failing to pay for using music
recorded before 1972. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies, including Capitol Records LLC and Sony Music
Entertainment, filed the copyright-infringement lawsuit in New
York State Supreme Court in Manhattan April 17 because federal
law doesn&#8217;t protect recordings made before Feb. 15, 1972. New
York courts have enforced ownership rights stemming from before
that date, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labels accused the Oakland, California-based music
streaming service of &#8220;massive and continuing unauthorized
commercial exploitation&#8221; of thousands of recordings including
iconic songs such as the Beatles&#8217; &#8220;Hey Jude,&#8221; Bob Dylan&#8217;s
&#8220;Like a Rolling Stone&#8221; and Marvin Gaye&#8217;s &#8220;I Heard It Through
the Grapevine.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandora has been fighting in court over how much it has to
pay to stream music. In a ruling that sets a precedent for
future rate battles, a federal judge in Manhattan last month
said the company must give 1.85 percent of revenue to a group
representing songwriters and music publishers, rejecting
Pandora&#8217;s request for a lower rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pandora is confident in its legal position and looks
forward to a quick resolution of this matter,&#8221; Will Valentine,
a spokesman for the company, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandora had sued the 470,000-member American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers in 2012, saying that the fees
charged at the time made sustained profitability impossible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint follows a similar suit filed last year
against New York-based Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI) in state court in
California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Capitol Records LLC v. Pandora Media Inc.,
651195/2014, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Patent &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teva Rejected by Justice Roberts on Generic Copaxone Delay &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Supreme Court justice rejected Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (TEVA)&#8217;s bid to block generic versions of its Copaxone
multiple-sclerosis drug while the court hears the company&#8217;s
appeal in a patent clash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rebuff by Chief Justice John Roberts on April 18 leaves
Teva open to generic competition as soon as next month. Mylan
Inc., Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA) and Novartis AG&#8217;s Sandoz are
positioned to start selling generic Copaxone in late May,
although they would risk having to pay damages if Teva
ultimately wins its patent-infringement case. Momenta and Sandoz
are working together on a generic version of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Teva will continue pursuing its appeal in the Supreme
Court and defending its intellectual property for Copaxone,&#8221;
according to a statement April 19 from the Petach Tikva, Israel-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva can ask another justice to intervene. By custom, that
application would then go to the full court for consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a one-paragraph opinion April 18, Roberts said a court-ordered delay was unnecessary because Teva could recover damages
for infringement if it wins the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased with the chief justice&#8217;s decision, and we
look forward to introducing the first generic Copaxone treatment
for multiple sclerosis patients in the U.S. at market
formation,&#8221; Mylan Chief Executive Officer Heather Bresch said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copaxone brings in $3.2 billion in annual U.S. sales and
accounts for more than half of Teva&#8217;s profit. A delay would give
Teva more time to switch patients from the 20-milligram dose
that is the subject of the legal fight to a 40-milligram dose it
says is covered by other patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Teva v. Sandoz, 13-854. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Stafford, the chief executive
officer of American Home Products Corp. who sold units to focus
on pharmaceuticals and made three attempts to merge before
changing the company&#8217;s name to Wyeth, has died. He was 76. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He died on April 18 at his home in Essex Fells, New Jersey,
where he had lived since 1976, Carolyn Stafford Stein, his
daughter, said today in a telephone interview. The cause of
death was prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stafford, who was CEO from 1986 to 2001 and chairman from
1986 to 2002, boosted investment and research in American Home&#8217;s
pharmaceuticals division while spinning off non-related units,
such as Brach&#8217;s candy, household goods and agricultural
chemicals. With brands such as Anacin aspirin, Dristan cold
medicine and Premarin estrogen treatment, then the most-prescribed drug in the U.S., annual revenue almost tripled to
$14.6 billion under his leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former lawyer also courted SmithKline Beecham Plc and
Monsanto Co. in failed merger attempts before a $58 billion deal
with Warner-Lambert Co. to create the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker
fell apart in 2000 in a takeover battle won by Pfizer Inc. (PFE)
Stafford also presided over the $9.7 billion acquisition of
American Cyanamid Co. in 1994 that included its Lederle
Laboratories unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock Gain &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002, American Home changed its name to Wyeth, which was
bought by Pfizer seven years later. By the time he stepped down
as CEO, the shares had increased sixfold during his tenure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Stafford is credited with moving American Home Products
from a diversified manufacturer of consumer health products into
a major pharmaceutical company,&#8221; according to a Harvard
Business School profile. &#8220;He did so while consistently
achieving impressive financial returns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Home&#8217;s attempts to merge with Warner-Lambert, the
maker of the cholesterol treatment Lipitor, followed its removal
of two diet pills and one painkiller from the market and a $3.75
billion settlement of diet-pill litigation in 2000. Warner-Lambert was purchased by Pfizer in a hostile takeover that left
American Home with a breakup fee of $1.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve made it on our own since 1926,&#8221; Stafford said in a
March 2000 interview with the New York Times after losing the
bid for Warner-Lambert. &#8220;We&#8217;re in a better position now than
we&#8217;ve been in sometime in terms of our pipeline and balance
sheet. There is no question that we can compete.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Settlement Reserve &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits over the diet drugs, known as fen-phen and
recalled in 1997, led to the settlement reserve being increased
to $21 billion after Stafford&#8217;s retirement. Former users of the
appetite suppressants claimed the pills caused an often-fatal
lung disease and that the company hid the health risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Rogers Stafford was born on Oct. 24, 1937, in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. His father, Paul Stafford, was a civil
engineer, and his mother, Gladys Sharp, was a homemaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He attended Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania,
before earning a law degree at George Washington University, in
Washington, D.C., where he edited the law review. Stafford then
practiced law for four years at the Washington-based firm
Steptoe  Johnson before joining the health-care company
Hoffmann-La Roche in Nutley, New Jersey, as a lawyer in 1966. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1970, Stafford moved to American Home Products as
general counsel and was named vice president two years later. He
became a director in 1980 and president the following year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Employee Care &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was tremendously proud, and rightfully so, with what
he could do with AHP,&#8221; his daughter said. &#8220;The way they tried
to take care of their employees was one thing he was
particularly proud of.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Stafford, American Home moved its headquarters in the
early-1990s from midtown Manhattan to Madison, New Jersey, where
it built a child-care center and gymnasium on site for
employees. Workers were also granted equal time off for adoption
as for maternity leave, his daughter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1959, Stafford married the former Inge Paul, a
psychologist, whom he met at Dickinson College. She died in
April 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His survivors include their four daughters, Carolyn Stein,
Jennifer Farrow, Christina Chapin and Charlotte Stafford; 13
grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. He also is survived
by a brother, P. Gordon Stafford. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large deals make sense for Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), even if not with each other. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the talks between Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, and $87 billion AstraZeneca have fizzled, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. expects Pfizer to approach the company again, or AstraZeneca could opt to merge with another peer such as Amgen Inc. (AMGN) as a defense tactic. Pfizer&#8217;s backup plan could be to acquire Dublin-based Shire Plc, Albert Fried  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both companies face stalling growth over the next few years, with Pfizer needing new products to replace drugs that lost patent protection and AstraZeneca&#8217;s promising cancer treatments still years from hitting the market. At the same time, smaller rivals are scooping up assets and building their presence as drug takeovers surged to a five-year high, led by Actavis Plc&#8217;s $21 billion bid for Forest Laboratories Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

Right now, Pfizer&#8217;s probably coming to the conclusion that it needs to have a &#8216;buy&#8217; mentality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week before Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)
Chairman Peter Munk retires, his successor John Thornton is
emerging as a dealmaker as the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
banker pursues a bid to combine the two biggest gold miners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations between Barrick and Newmont Mining Corp. broke
off last week amid minor disagreements while leaving open the
possibility that discussions could still resume, two people with
knowledge of the matter said April 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal under discussion would have seen Thornton become
executive chairman of the combined company while the chief
executive officer would have been Gary Goldberg, who currently
leads Newmont, the people said. Toronto-based Barrick&#8217;s CEO
Jamie Sokalsky would have led a smaller gold producer spun off
from the merged company, according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed tie-up and its management reshuffle confirm
Thronton&#8217;s elevation as Barrick&#8217;s most senior executive. The 60-year-old, who had no role in the mining industry until he joined
the company&#8217;s board just over two years ago, is set to succeed
Munk, Barrick&#8217;s 86-year-old founder, as chairman at the annual
shareholders meeting next week. Leading a successful acquisition
of Newmont (NEM), in what would be the biggest gold takeover, would
set up Barrick to do further deals, including ones involving
other commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long-Term Strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think if anybody has the skill to drive this
transaction through, whether or not it is successful from an
operational standpoint, I think he certainly has the
leadership,&#8221; said Michael Sprung, president of Toronto-based
Sprung Investment Management Inc., which owns Barrick shares.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a merger to set them up for bigger, future MA deals
which may in fact include an element of diversification.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Barrick and Newmont both declined to comment
on last week&#8217;s talks. Newmont&#8217;s shares closed little changed at
$25.04 in New York, while Barrick rose 1.8 percent to C$19.37 in
Toronto. Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1,284.58 an ounce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thornton spent 23 years at Goldman before departing in
2003. He joined Barrick as an independent director in February
2012 and was hired as co-chairman in June of that year, just as
the company fired CEO Aaron Regent following a decline in its
share price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slumping gold prices and rising mining costs eroded
Barrick&#8217;s margins, raised concerns about its debt and spurred
the company to start selling higher-cost mines. Those
divestments have improved the company&#8217;s financial flexibility
and will reduce its borrowings, Goldman Sachs said today in a
note. Goldman raised its recommendation on the stock to buy from
hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;McKinsey Review &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of Barrick&#8217;s senior management, Thornton has helped
oversee its long-term strategy. He has looked at establishing
partnerships with Chinese companies including China Investment
Corp., people familiar with the matter said in December.
Thornton&#8217;s role also involves developing and maintaining
relationships with governments, according to Barrick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thornton was behind a decision to bring in management
consultant McKinsey  Co. to help evaluate the mining company&#8217;s
direction, one of the people said in December. While he sees
Barrick&#8217;s top priority to remain as the leading gold producer,
he&#8217;s open to rethinking the whole business, which may involve
acquiring mining assets in other minerals, such as copper, the
people also said. Barrick already produces copper in Chile and
Zambia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spinoff Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen him put a stamp on the company yet,&#8221;
said Michael Siperco, a Toronto-based analyst at Macquarie
Capital Markets. &#8220;Obviously, the combining of Barrick and
Newmont would be a meaningful step in that direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Barrick and Newmont operate on five continents and
have a combined market value of about $33 billion. Before talks
broke off April 18, the companies had agreed to an all-stock
merger in which Barrick was to offer Newmont shareholders a
premium of 13 percent more than Newmont&#8217;s average share price
over the latest 20 trading days, one of the people with
knowledge of the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies had agreed to all terms not related to a
spinoff of Asia Pacific assets and had identified $1 billion a
year in cost savings, the people said. The companies, which have
tried to merge several times in the past, still have interest in
getting a deal done, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the cost savings would come from Nevada, where
Barrick and Newmont both produce more than a third of their
gold. They operate in close proximity in the state, from which
they originally built out their respective businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Contender &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Sokalsky is a 20-year veteran of Barrick, Thornton
and Goldberg are both relative newcomers to gold mining at a
tumultuous time for the industry. Goldberg worked in various
roles at diversified miner Rio Tinto Group before joining
Newmont as chief operating officer and became CEO in March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newmont was considering acquisitions in both gold and
copper and was adding in-house capacity to assess copper supply
and demand trends, Goldberg said in a September interview.
Taking on more copper was a &#8220;logical&#8221; step after gold
companies began to lose the valuation premium that they used to
attract, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at Goldman, Thornton was seen as a top contender to
succeed Henry Paulson as CEO in the early 2000s, according to
&#8220;Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World&#8221;
(2011) by William D. Cohan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Placer Dome &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving the bank, he headed to China, helping to
start up a business leadership program at Beijing&#8217;s Tsinghua
University. He sits on the board of China Unicom (Hong Kong)
Ltd., the country&#8217;s second-largest mobile phone carrier, and is
a member of China Investment Corp.&#8217;s international advisory
board. He&#8217;s also chairman of the board of trustees of the
Brookings Institution, where he helped establish the John L.
Thornton China Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munk, a Hungarian immigrant who escaped the Nazis as a
teenager, founded Barrick as an oil and gas company, later
shifting his focus to gold. The company expanded through
acquisitions, with at least 29 completed since 1994, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Barrick surpassed Newmont as the
industry leader when it bought Placer Dome Inc. in 2006 for
about $10.2 billion including net debt, a record for a gold
takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ultimate goal is to, in my case, to be the biggest,&#8221;
Munk said at a May 2011 conference organized by Bloomberg in
Toronto. &#8220;Why would you be happy with halfway?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has offered tech support by phone for decades, from guiding business customers through a tricky Windows installation to making sure grandmas successfully locate Solitaire on the Start menu. But this month, the company launched a new kind of hotline in India to help entrepreneurs navigate the minefield of starting their own business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a novel move, Microsoft Ventures, the company''s startup investment and accelerator arm, opened JumpStart, a toll-free number where support specialists will field calls from Indian entrepreneurs. Microsoft insists there are no restrictions on the type of questions an entrepreneur can ask, but expects its dedicated call center staff to be mostly advising customers on legal, funding or marketing issues. Microsoft says workers will walk callers through the processes of registering a company, preparing taxes, tracking down an accountant and finding a good lawyer. They''re also happy to suggest technology solutions. (Microsoft Azure, perhaps?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, dial-in tech support seems old-fashioned to say the least, but Indians could use whatever help they can get. It&#8217;s one of the toughest countries to start a business in, according to the World Bank. Part of that can be attributed to the 2012 "startup tax" that treats Indian investments as income, essentially penalizing companies that raise money locally. Amid complaints of over-regulation, last year was also the worst for Indian technology IPOs in more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; movie to be
made under Walt Disney Co. (DIS) has begun shooting in Abu Dhabi,
according to Alan Horn, chairman of the company&#8217;s film division,
who said the casting will be announced soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horn spoke at a Bloomberg Business of Entertainment event
today in New York, before heading to the U.K. with other Disney
executives overseeing the project. Filming thus far has involved
secondary scenes, he said. The U.K.&#8217;s Pinewood Studios will be
the primary site, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have to give it that &#8216;Star Wars&#8217;-ian look,&#8221; Horn
said. &#8220;So we need to go to different places that give us the
right look and feel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie, to be released in December 2015, will be the
seventh &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; picture from Lucasfilm, purchased in 2012
by Disney in a $4.05 billion bet on the franchise created by
George Lucas. Lucas is a consultant on the film, Horn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s studio chairman emphasized the importance of the
faster-growing international box office in approving projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The challenge is to have pictures that can travel,&#8221; Horn
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve learned that these tentpole movies are most
desired all around the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horn has led a revival of the Walt Disney Studios, which
include the company&#8217;s original live-action and animation
businesses, along with Marvel and Pixar. Since his arrival in
June 2012, two Disney films have topped $1 billion in worldwide
ticket sales: &#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; and &#8220;Frozen.&#8221; &#8220;Captain America:
The Winter Soldier,&#8221; the latest Marvel superhero movie, has led
the box office for three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Baseball Feature &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month, Disney is scheduled to release the baseball
movie &#8220;Million Dollar Arm,&#8221; starring &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; actor Jon Hamm. The film is testing &#8220;extremely well,&#8221; Horn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8221; film is possible, Horn
said. While he hasn&#8217;t seen a screenplay he&#8217;s ready to approve,
he&#8217;s &#8220;very confident&#8221; Disney will get one. The four pictures
produced thus far generated worldwide ticket sales of $3.73
billion, according to Box Office Mojo, an industry researcher &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Disney, Horn was president of Time Warner
Inc.&#8217;s Warner Bros. for 12 years, where he co-lead the studio
that made the &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; and &#8220;Dark Knight&#8221; franchises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horn indicated Disney may revert to a May release for the
two additional &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; films that are planned as part of
the latest trilogy. The current production will have a &#8220;big
tentpole movie budget,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such films typically cost $175 million to $200 million,
give or take, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to give the audience, essentially, a full meal in
return for their affection and devotion and love for these
properties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) joined JPMorgan Chase  Co. in recommending investors stop buying shares in Deutsche Bank AG, saying the company may delay efforts to cut costs and build capital. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;UBS cut Deutsche Bank to neutral from buy and lowered its price estimate for Deutsche Bank&#8217;s shares to 33 euros from 47 euros, analysts including Daniele Brupbacher and Mate Nemes in Zurich said in an e-mailed report today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank is contending with a global slowdown in trading revenue as clients hold off investing amid uncertainty over monetary policy and geopolitical crises. The company is among banks that have shrunk assets to allay investor concern about capital levels and to meet stricter regulatory requirements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The weaker than expected year-to-date revenue environment is particularly relevant for Deutsche Bank,&#8221; UBS said. &#8220;In order to protect the bottom line, Deutsche could push out the non-core clean-up as well as restructuring by about one year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christian Streckert, a spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, declined to comment on the UBS report by telephone today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stock rose 0.3 percent to 31.98 euros at 11:41 a.m. in Frankfurt. Before the UBS downgrade, twenty-one of 45 analysts recommended buying Deutsche Bank&#8217;s shares with 17 saying hold and seven saying sell, according to Bloomberg data. The average price estimate was 41.3 euros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) rose the most in
more than three years after reports over the weekend that Pfizer
Inc. (PFE) discussed acquiring the London-based drugmaker in informal,
now-discontinued talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca climbed 8 percent to 4,085.5 pence at 8:06 a.m.
in London. The intraday increase of as much as 8.5 percent was
the biggest since June 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and AstraZeneca aren&#8217;t currently negotiating, said
two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be
identified. One said the talks happened several months ago and
there are no plans to resume. The discussions were first
reported April 20 by London&#8217;s Sunday Times, which said New York-based Pfizer made a tentative approach about a takeover valuing
AstraZeneca at more than 60 billion pounds ($101 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If revived, such an acquisition would be among the largest
ever in the industry. Pfizer has reorganized its business over
the past three years, shuttering some research projects and
emphasizing others. A deal with AstraZeneca would add early-stage drugs in a field of cancer treatments that use the body&#8217;s
own immune cells to recognize and attack cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and AstraZeneca both declined to comment.
Separately, Novartis AG said today it agreed to buy
GlaxoSmithKline Plc&#8217;s cancer-drug business for as much as $16
billion, form a consumer-health venture with Glaxo and sell its
animal-health operation to Eli Lilly  Co. for $5.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s Congress party is claiming credit for a stock-market rally that sent the SP BSE Sensex index to record highs. Much of the evidence suggests the real catalyst is Narendra Modi, the leader of the opposition party projected to win the national elections. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Sensex has advanced 16 percent since Sept. 13, when the Bharatiya Janata Party named Modi as its prime minister candidate, the only advance among equity indexes in the four largest emerging markets. A gauge of companies based in Modi&#8217;s home state of Gujarat, including Adani Enterprises Ltd. (ADE), has more than doubled in the period. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stock market rally is due to Modi,&#8221; said Mahendra Chheda, a 52-year-old who trades shares for a living from the suburbs of Mumbai and has doubled his allocation to the market in the past six months. &#8220;The BJP will get credit and goodwill from it,&#8221; said Chheda, who plans to vote for the BJP today after siding with Congress in 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Finance Minister P. Chidambaram points to Congress measures since September 2012 that pared the budget shortfall, narrowed the current-account deficit and removed barriers to foreign capital, investors say those efforts have been eclipsed by expectations that a Modi-led government would do even more to boost economic growth. The BJP said this month it plans to construct 100 new cities, build high-speed railway lines and a national fiber-optic network. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;General elections began on April 7 and votes will be counted on May 16. People in Mumbai, India&#8217;s financial capital, cast their ballots today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Bull Market&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brokerages including Macquarie Group Ltd. and Deutsche Equities India predicted further gains for the Sensex (SENSEX) in a Bloomberg survey this month. Rakesh Arora, head of research at Macquarie in Mumbai and the most accurate forecaster for the stock gauge in 2013, said his year-end Sensex target of 23,900 may &#8220;prove conservative&#8221; if Modi comes to power next month. The gauge climbed to a record 22,876.54 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Global investors bought $4.9 billion of Indian shares this year, the second-most after Taiwan among 18 nations tracked by Bloomberg. Stocks are in a &#8220;massive bull market&#8221; and a strong government will boost the rally&#8217;s &#8220;intensity,&#8221; B.P. Singh, chief investor officer for equities at Pramerica Asset Managers Pvt. in Mumbai, said in an April 16 interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The BJP and its allies may win 275 of 543 parliamentary seats, three more than they need for a majority, according to a Hansa Research survey for the NDTV channel released April 14. The Congress looks set for its worst-ever performance as graft cases, Asia&#8217;s fastest inflation and sputtering economic growth erode support. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Volatility Climbs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Demand for protection against swings in shares is still climbing as some investors weigh prospects for a surprise outcome. The India VIX, which gauges the cost of options on the 50-stock CNX Nifty Index, rose to 34.4 on April 21, the highest level since October 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opinion polls have had a poor record forecasting election outcomes in India. The Congress party won in 2004, even after surveys predicted the BJP would keep power. In 2009, after polls forecast a close fight, Congress emerged with the largest tally in 20 years, lifting the Sensex by a record 17 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The results can throw a surprise, and no one wants to be caught on the wrong side,&#8221; R.K. Gupta, managing director of Taurus Asset Management Co., which oversees about $585 million, said by phone from New Delhi on April 16. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors are betting a win by Modi will allow him to fast-track public works projects, an ability that&#8217;s helped the state of Gujarat expand 10 percent a year on average since he took office in 2001. Modi&#8217;s focus on how he will revive growth has helped neutralize criticism over his handling of 2002 riots in the state that killed about 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Adani Rally &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gujarat lured 1.3 trillion rupees ($22 billion) of planned foreign and local investment, about 22 percent of India&#8217;s total, in the year ended March 31, 2012, according to the most recent industry ministry data. That compares with 103 billion rupees in 2002, when Gujarat took 11 percent of the country&#8217;s investment, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shares of Adani Enterprises, which operates the state&#8217;s biggest private port, have had a 52-fold increase since 2002, gaining about nine times more than the Sensex. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This rally will continue if a government led by Modi, as opinion polls show, comes to power,&#8221; Shishir Bajpai, a Mumbai-based director at IIFL Wealth Management Ltd. with $8 billion under management and advisory, said in a phone interview on April 22. &#8220;Over the past five years India has suffered due to poor execution of infrastructure projects. If Modi is able to revive that, then the economy will be back on the growth path. Execution is the key.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Construction Approvals &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Projects worth $230 billion are awaiting clearance as lawmaking stalled in the Congress-led coalition, data from the Cabinet Committee on Investment show. A $12 billion steel mill planned by South Korea&#8217;s Posco has been held up for nine years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s government is claiming success for stemming last year&#8217;s rout in the rupee and pushing foreign reserves higher, helped by Raghuram Rajan&#8217;s stewardship of the central bank. Since Rajan became governor in September, the currency has been a world beater and holdings have climbed back above $300 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Congress party must get &#8220;some credit for bringing back the economy when other emerging markets are facing problems,&#8221; Telecommunications Minister Kapil Sibal said in an interview on April 21. D.S. Malik, a spokesman for the Finance Ministry, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rajan, who spurred dollar inflows by offering discount currency swaps to banks and reining in inflation, said April 11 that Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy is now prepared for potential fallout should the Federal Reserve raise rates in the coming year. The rupee has rallied 13 percent from a record low of 68.845 per dollar in August, the biggest gain among 78 global exchange rates tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This government can&#8217;t take credit for the last few months&#8217; recovery, unless they also take credit for bringing it down,&#8221; Ajit Dayal, chairman of Mumbai-based Quantum Asset Management Ltd., said in an interview on April 1. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Noah Buhayar and Laura Marcinek" date="Apr 23, 2014  2:28 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-23/coca-cola-wins-compensation-vote-overcoming-winters-opposition.html"><headline>Coca-Cola Wins Compensation Vote, Overcoming Winters&#8217;s Fight</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) won investor approval
for its plan to award employees with stock, overcoming an
argument from money manager David Winters that lavish pay
packages are diminishing returns for shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty-three percent of votes cast supported the equity
plan, according to preliminary results in an e-mailed statement
today from the company. The annual meeting was held in Atlanta,
the city where Coca-Cola is based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winters had waged a campaign since March to persuade
investors to reject the soft-drink maker&#8217;s proposal. The new
plan, in addition to ones already enacted, could transfer $29.8
billion to the managers, he said. Investors such as the Ontario
Teachers&#8217; Pension Plan and Calvert Investments had sided with
Winters, who runs the firm Wintergreen Advisers LLC. Coca-Cola
said its board was pleased with the vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company&#8217;s compensation programs are performance-based
and the equity plan is fair, competitive and consistent with
shareowners&#8217; interests and our pay for performance philosophy,&#8221;
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In making his case, Winters appealed directly to Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett, who
controls the biggest stake in Coca-Cola. Buffett, the world&#8217;s
third-richest person, used to be on Coca-Cola&#8217;s board, and his
son is a director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Extraneous Factors&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;His fiduciary duty is to all of the Berkshire
shareholders,&#8221; Winters said in an interview yesterday. Buffett
shouldn&#8217;t vote based on &#8220;any other extraneous factors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has said that stock repurchases, including $4.8
billion of buybacks in 2013, cushion the dilution tied to
employee awards. Dilution related to equity plans has been less
than 1 percent annually over the past three years, &#8220;and is
expected to be in this range going forward,&#8221; the company said
in a presentation. Coca-Cola also said that the link of the pay
to performance means that all the potential awards may not be
earned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola said a separate advisory vote on executive
compensation won 90 percent support. Investors also voted
against a measure that called for an independent board chairman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), seeking to revitalize hardware sales, introduced a new Power Systems server with an open platform that gives programmers more flexibility to develop uses for the device. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM spent $2.4 billion in more than three years to create the hardware, which is used in data centers. The system has more than 11 miles (18 kilometers) of copper wiring, which helps the servers process large amounts of data, the company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new offering comes after a 22 percent decline in first-quarter sales for Power Systems, a unit which Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter this month said the company is &#8220;aggressively repositioning.&#8221; The new products are designed to address growing areas like cloud computing and data analytics, helping IBM counter weak demand for older hardware that has dragged down total revenue for eight straight quarters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM Tries to Adapt. Again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are thinking differently about how to help clients transform their business with the right infrastructure,&#8221; Tom Rosamilia, IBM&#8217;s senior vice president for systems and technology, said in an interview. &#8220;This is leveraging a lot of the things we&#8217;ve done with open systems before but never really around the hardware.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, got advice in building the servers from fellow members of the OpenPower Foundation -- a 25-member group of companies that support open-source technology. Members of the group, which includes Google Inc. and Nvidia Corp., are working with IBM and on their own on other technology based on the same Power8 processor chip that the new Power Systems servers use. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new IBM systems will sell for around $8,000, which is about $2,000 less than past models, Rosamilia said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Bei Hu" date="Apr 23, 2014 12:01 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-23/goldman-sachs-said-to-lose-seven-asia-prime-brokerage-staff.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Lose Seven Asia Prime-Brokerage Workers</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
largest prime broker in Asia, lost seven of its employees on the
regional team this year, said a person with knowledge of the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departures include Alain Bordoni, a former managing
director, and Mark Wittet, who was an executive director, said
the person, who asked not to be identified as the information is
private. Most of the jobs vacated have been filled with internal
transfers and new hires, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connie Ling, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the New
York-based bank, declined to comment. Bordoni&#8217;s Goldman Sachs
license was removed Jan. 28, according to information posted on
the website of Hong Kong&#8217;s Securities and Futures Commission.
Wittet&#8217;s was removed April 5, it showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was ranked by London-based trade journal
AsiaHedge as the region&#8217;s largest prime broker, with an
estimated 179 mandates and $24.6 billion of assets as of April
2013. Global hedge-fund capital hit $2.7 trillion in March, the
seventh consecutive quarterly record, according to Chicago-based
Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the healthy state of the hedge-fund industry, the
major service providers to hedge funds are likely facing a
harder time competing for specialized talent, both versus rivals
as well as versus hedge funds themselves,&#8221; said Daniel Celeghin, Asia head at Casey Quirk  Associates LLC, a Darien,
Connecticut-based adviser to asset managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime brokers provide services such as stock and cash
lending, trade clearing for hedge funds, as well as linking them
with potential investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Joining Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia-based hedge funds oversee a combined $79.7 billion of
assets, having recovered by 41 percent from the April 2009
trough, according to Singapore-based data provider Eurekahedge
Pte. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks like Goldman Sachs have been trying to balance
regulatory pressure to tie compensation to long-term performance
with shareholders&#8217; desire for flexibility to cut pay costs, if
needed. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein cut
compensation to 37 percent of revenue last year, the second-lowest portion since the company went public in 1999 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of Bordoni, the other Goldman Sachs
prime-brokerage departures in Asia were executive directors or
lower-level employees, said the person. Some left to join
rivals, others have been hired by funds, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bordoni couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached, while Wittet
didn&#8217;t reply to a message seeking comment sent through social
media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs counts as its clients some of the largest
regional hedge funds, including ones led by alumni such as
Azentus Capital Management Ltd. founded by Morgan Sze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 14th annual Asia hedge-fund event in
Singapore in October attracted the likes of Azentus as well as
Asia teams of Fortress Investment Group LLC, Och-Ziff Capital
Management Group LLC and Highbridge Capital Management LLC,
according to a document seen by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett owes it to shareholders of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) to vote against Coca-Cola Co.&#8217;s executive-compensation plan, said David Winters, a money manager who controls stakes in both companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winters has waged a campaign since March to persuade investors to reject the soft-drink maker&#8217;s proposal, which comes to a vote today. The new plan, in addition to ones already enacted, could transfer $29.8 billion to the managers, he said. He wants the plan withdrawn, calling it a &#8220;raw deal.&#8221; Investors including the Ontario Teachers&#8217; Pension Plan and Calvert Investments have sided with him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winters appealed directly to Buffett, who controls the biggest stake in Atlanta-based Coca-Cola and has criticized companies that offer lavish stock awards to managers. The billionaire chief executive officer used to be on the board of the world&#8217;s biggest soda maker, and his son is a director. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;His fiduciary duty is to all of the Berkshire shareholders,&#8221; Winters said of the billionaire in an interview yesterday. Buffett shouldn&#8217;t vote based on &#8220;any other extraneous factors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winters said his letters to the Berkshire CEO on the matter have been met with &#8220;radio silence.&#8221; Buffett, 83, didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment sent to an assistant. Petro Kacur, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, declined to comment on the stance of its largest shareholder. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fresh Look&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Irrational and excessive comp practices will not be materially changed by disclosure or by &#8216;independent&#8217; comp committee members,&#8221; Buffett wrote in a 2007 letter. &#8220;Reform will only occur if the largest institutional shareholders -- it would only take a few -- demand a fresh look.&#8221; He has shunned handing out stock as compensation at his own company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buffett has rarely clashed in public with the managers of the businesses in which Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire owns stock. He described his equity-investing strategy as &#8220;passive&#8221; in a letter to shareholders this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola listed terms of the compensation plan last month in a proxy statement. Numbers in the filing show that the company could grant 340 million shares and options under the new proposal, according to calculations from Winters&#8217;s firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That would be in addition to the 388 million outstanding equity awards and 3.6 million additional &#8220;holdback shares&#8221; from prior plans. Coca-Cola said it granted long-term equity compensation to about 6,400 employees in 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winters calculates that existing shareholders will be diluted by 16.6 percent. That represented $29.8 billion of Coca-Cola&#8217;s market value as of yesterday&#8217;s close in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Proposal Criticized &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no gray area,&#8221; said Winters, whose firm Wintergreen Advisers LLC held about 2.5 million shares of the soft-drink maker&#8217;s stock and 1.2 million Class B shares of Buffett&#8217;s company at the end of December. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bad plan. It&#8217;s bad for Coca-Cola. It&#8217;s bad for Berkshire.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola said stock repurchases, including $4.8 billion of buybacks in 2013, cushion the dilution tied to employee awards. Dilution related to equity plans has been less than 1 percent annually over the past three years, &#8220;and is expected to be in this range going forward,&#8221; the company said in a presentation. Coca-Cola also said that the link of the pay to performance means that all the potential awards may not be earned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System, the biggest U.S. public pension, is among investors who have supported the equity plan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Industry Norms&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winters said he likes Coca-Cola because of the value of its brand and popularity of its namesake beverage. The soft-drink maker, led by CEO Muhtar Kent, has returned 120 percent over the last five years, including dividends. That compares with 148 percent for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company said that its board &#8220;fully stands behind&#8221; the plan and that it links the interests of employees and shareholders. &#8220;The new proposal is consistent with prior equity plans and industry norms,&#8221; Coca-Cola said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alan Johnson, a managing director at compensation consultant Johnson Associates, said the compensation plan provides an incentive for employees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Would you rather them be paid in cash, which is gone today, or to be paid in some kind of stock or stock option, which is linked to the success of the company,&#8221; he said in a phone interview. &#8220;What Coke is saying is, &#8216;We allocate a lot of the pay we need to offer people in stock, and we think that&#8217;s a good idea.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Berkshire&#8217;s Coca-Cola holding has climbed more than 12-fold since Buffett began accumulating the stake in the 1980s. It&#8217;s now valued at $16.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The annual meeting is scheduled to begin at 12:30 p.m. in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jodi Xu and Cotten Timberlake" date="Apr 24, 2014  7:25 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-24/elizabeth-arden-said-to-hire-goldman-to-contact-pe-firms.html"><headline>Elizabeth Arden Said to Hire Goldman to Contact PE Firms</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Arden Inc. (RDEN), after

private-equity firms and other potential buyers, a person

&lt;p&gt;While Elizabeth Arden is running a sales process, no deal

&lt;p&gt;LG Household, which makes WHOO Hwanyugo skin-care products,
perfumes and toothpaste, is looking at &#8220;big deals&#8221; locally and
overseas, including one for Elizabeth Arden, Lee In Ick, a

Arden, based in Miramar, Florida, makes fragrances including
Elizabeth Taylor and Britney Spears brand perfumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported the Goldman Sachs hiring earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman at New York-based Goldman

&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Arden shares rose 13 percent to $36 at the close

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall
Street bank that once generated millions of dollars in fees from
its Global Alpha hedge fund, is turning to beta strategies for
growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which oversees $30 billion
in such products, agreed this week to buy Westpeak Global
Advisors LLC, without disclosing terms. Westpeak, which
supervises just $300 million of assets, can help spur growth in
the firm&#8217;s beta products, which are drawing more interest from
clients, Armen Avanessians, head of GSAM&#8217;s quantitative
business, said in an interview. Beta refers to how much an
asset&#8217;s price moves in relation to the broader market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many indexes are weighted based on market
capitalization, Westpeak develops so-called active beta
strategies by investing in groups of stocks using other
characteristics. The idea is to offer the low fees and liquidity
that have drawn investors to passive exchange-traded funds,
while providing more value than a proxy for the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anyone who wants to be in the passive space has already
shifted into that space, and they enjoy a certain degree of
liquidity and transparency,&#8221; said Avanessians, a partner and
29-year veteran of New York-based Goldman Sachs. &#8220;The question
is, &#8216;Can they do something more than just slavishly follow the
market cap?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which has avoided large mergers throughout
its history, has made several purchases in the past two years to
grow an asset-management business that saw outflows in three
straight years ended in 2012. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, said in May that he&#8217;s devoting a &#8220;very high
percentage&#8221; of his attention to improving the division&#8217;s
performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assets Increase &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, assets under supervision topped $1 trillion for
the first time and pretax profit climbed 20 percent to $1.11
billion. The division produced $1.57 billion of revenue in the
first quarter, a 20 percent increase from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avanessians, 54, declined to set a growth target for the
advanced beta strategies business. He said only that it can get
&#8220;much bigger&#8221; and will help the bank attract a bigger slice of
clients&#8217; portfolios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see it as being purely additive to our business,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shut Global Alpha in 2011 as clients pulled
money from what was the firm&#8217;s biggest hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Noah Buhayar" date="Apr 24, 2014  9:32 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-24/jpmorgan-to-help-oversee-12-billion-for-resolution-life.html"><headline>JPMorgan to Help Oversee $12 Billion for Resolution Life</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) won a contract
to help manage about $12 billion in bonds for Resolution Life
Holdings Inc., a startup insurer that plans to acquire policies
from other U.S. carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The partnership represents a comprehensive investment
management relationship that includes fixed-income portfolio
management, asset-liability management and product hedging,&#8221;
according to a statement today from Resolution. It will also
cover &#8220;asset-allocation strategy and investment accounting and
reporting support.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution said last month that it plans to initially
invest $2 billion to build a "lasting, sizable and
differentiated" insurance company in the U.S. comprised of
businesses that are no longer adding new clients. The
announcement followed its agreement to buy Lincoln Benefit Life
from Allstate Corp. (ALL) in July. Insurers including Hartford
Financial Services Group Inc. have been looking to sell U.S.
life operations as low interest rates pinch profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution Chairman Clive Cowdery pursued a similar
strategy in the U.K., where he amassed a personal fortune
consolidating the industry. Over the last decade, his Resolution
Group bought 25 insurers, comprising more than 10 million
policyholders and $200 billion in policy assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers including New York-based JPMorgan, BlackRock
Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have been vying to win
contracts with insurance clients to boost fee income. Insurers
have sought Wall Street investment expertise to diversify their
portfolios and meet regulatory requirements. Outsourcing also
allows the insurers to focus on underwriting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said March 31 that its Highbridge Principal
Strategies LLC will manage funds for Watford Re Ltd., a Bermuda-based reinsurer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that
the case for holding commodities remains strong, bolstering the
rationale for investments in oil and metals even as other banks
exit the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities still offer a way to diversify holdings
together with equities and bonds, and are best suited as a hedge
against inflation, analysts led by Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report dated yesterday. The appeal of holding
commodities will improve as global growth picks up in the next
few years, they wrote, without giving a forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While returns from commodities lagged behind those from
shares and bonds over the past five years, the case for
retaining an allocation in a portfolio over the long term
remains, the Goldman analysts wrote. Barclays Plc, JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley are leaving parts of their
commodities businesses, boosting speculation that Goldman will
be able to increase its market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Having commodities will be a very useful diversifier for
most portfolios,&#8221; said Jason Wang, chief executive officer at
Singapore-based Stamford Management Ltd., which had about $300
million under management at the end of 2013 after returns of
more than 20 percent from its Iridium Alpha Fund. &#8220;Even within
commodities, it&#8217;s so heterogeneous that it&#8217;s possible to have
diversification within the sector itself.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin
said Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) will lose market share in
Russia after they blocked some transactions because of U.S.
sanctions on individuals and banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t see any steps to punish unconscionable partners,
but they are undermining trust, hence will lose market share for
sure,&#8221; Putin said on Rossiya-24 state television in St.
Petersburg today, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putin said Visa and MasterCard are &#8220;very susceptible to
political influence and pressure,&#8221; and Russia will continue to
create its own national payments system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard stopped processing cards for Bank
Rossiya last month after the U.S. placed the lender on its
sanctions list because of Russia&#8217;s takeover of Crimea. SMP Bank,
which also had its cards blocked by the two biggest card
networks, said March 23 that services would resume soon. SMP
Bank&#8217;s co-owners, Arkady Rotenberg and brother Boris, were also
hit with sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., which
in March agreed to buy JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s physical commodity
unit for $3.5 billion, reported the largest increase in annual
revenue among big closely held commodity-trading houses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuria&#8217;s 2013 revenue rose 14 percent to $112 billion,
according to an update on the Geneva-based company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That beats a 10 percent increase to $133 billion reported
by Trafigura Beheer BV for its fiscal year ended Sept. 30.
Annual revenue at Vitol Group, the world&#8217;s largest independent
oil trader, rose 1.3 percent to $307 billion, the company said
last month. Gunvor Group Ltd. said last week that 2013 sales
fell to $91 billion from $93 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show Mercuria, which was founded in 2004 by
former Goldman Sachs (GS) traders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, is
growing its trading business faster than competitors. In the
past three years, revenue has more than doubled as Mercuria
expanded beyond oil into metals, concentrates and agricultural
commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s 2013 trading volumes rose 7 percent from a
year earlier to 195 million metric tons of oil or oil
equivalent, the company said on the website. Mercuria didn&#8217;t
disclose a profit figure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income in 2012 was $343 million, according to a copy of
the company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements obtained by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Staff &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunvor, which is also expanding into non-oil commodities,
said April 16 that its 2013 net income rose to $308 million from
$301 million the year before as trading margins improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2011 to 2013, Mercuria hired 570 people, including
executives from investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and
Barclays Plc. That boosted staff to 1,200 from about 10 in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After agreeing to purchase JPMorgan&#8217;s unit on March 19,
Mercuria is now deciding which employees will be offered
positions. The unit has about 500 staff. Blythe Masters, the
head of the bank&#8217;s global commodities operations, will leave
once the sale is completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit will give Mercuria gas and power trading
operations on both sides of the Atlantic, physical assets
spanning 40 locations in North America, an oil-trading book with
a supply and offtake contract at the largest refinery on the
U.S. East Coast, and 6 million barrels of storage leases in the
Canadian oil sands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) will add technology from its Watson supercomputer, known
for beating humans on &#8220;Jeopardy!,&#8221; to its federal health unit
before the Pentagon seeks bids on a $11 billion health-records
project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest computer services provider also is
hiring Keith Salzman, a former chief medical information officer
at the Army hospital in Tacoma, Washington, where the Pentagon
plans to test the new health records project, for its U.S.
federal team. Salzman will become the division&#8217;s chief medical
officer, IBM said in a news release today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, whose U.S. agency contracts have slipped over the past
two years, is making the changes as companies prepare to compete
to deliver a new electronic medical-records system for the
Defense Department. The lifecycle cost of the project may be as
much as $11 billion, Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary of
defense for health affairs, said in testimony before a U.S.
House appropriations subcommittee this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have to bring a lot to the table in federal health
care,&#8221; Andrew Maner, IBM&#8217;s managing partner for its U.S.
federal division, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Watson is not
going to implement an electronic medical-records solution, but
it can be used to make clinicians better or more efficient.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York-based company, which had $1.2 billion
in U.S. agency contracts during the fiscal year that ended Sept.
30, was the government&#8217;s No. 51 supplier, according to a
Bloomberg Government ranking of the top 200 vendors released
April 22. It slipped six spots from the prior year, when it had
about $1.5 billion in U.S. contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Jeopardy&#8217; Success &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM will offer technology from its Watson Group to
aggregate and study clinical information for U.S. health
agencies, according to the press release. Watson, an artificial-intelligence system best known for its success on the
&#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; television quiz show, can analyze large amounts of
data. That may help cut costs, speed medical research and
improve care, the company said in its release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maner declined to comment on whether IBM would compete for
the records project or include Watson technology in a potential
bid. It wants to see the government&#8217;s solicitation for the work
first, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If IBM does bid, &#8220;you need to show up with everything,&#8221;
Maner said. That includes the right commercial and federal
experience, the best bidding partners, as well as &#8220;innovative
technology,&#8221; such as Watson, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information technology services companies such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), based in Palo Alto, California; Leidos Holdings
Inc. (LDOS), based in Reston, Virginia; and IBM are likely to bid on
the Pentagon health records work, said Brian Friel, a Bloomberg
Industries analyst. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) has named
Christopher Conoscenti a managing director in its oil and gas
group, as the investment bank builds up its energy team in the
Americas, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conoscenti, who was previously at JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
will join Credit Suisse&#8217;s Houston office in July reporting to
Tim Perry and Brian McCabe, co-heads its oil and gas team for
the Americas, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Credit Suisse spokesman confirmed the contents of the
memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conoscenti, who focuses on mergers involving U.S.
exploration companies, first joined JPMorgan in 2001, according
to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. He helped advise
Concho Resources (CXO) Inc. on its purchase of Three Rivers Operating
Co.&#8217;s oil and gas assets in 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse in December hired McCabe, a pipeline merger

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) fell 5 percent, the most
since July, after the world&#8217;s biggest bank-card network said
economic sanctions against Russia could crimp profit this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares tumbled $10.47 to close at $198.93 in New York,
the worst performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Visa
is the biggest component of the 30-company (INDU) index, which slid 0.8
percent. The sanctions may trim &#8220;several pennies&#8221; per share
from fiscal 2014 earnings, Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt
said yesterday after the firm reported quarterly results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. imposed sanctions on more than two dozen
individuals and St. Petersburg-based OAO Bank Rossiya, prompting
Visa and MasterCard Inc. (MA) to stop processing payments for some
banks. Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the
sanctions by recommending that his country create its own
payments system and change its laws. He said the two companies
will lose market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The geopolitical situation will create additional risk
for Visa and MasterCard in coming months,&#8221; Christopher Donat,
an analyst at Sandler O&#8217;Neill  Partners LP, said today in a
note to clients. &#8220;Pending Russian law could be negative for
earnings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, the second-biggest U.S. network, also dropped 5
percent, the most since January. The Purchase, New York-based
company is scheduled to report quarterly results May 1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) completed the
takeover of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s phone business, ending a seven-month
wait to renew its assault on the mobile market and leaving the
Finnish company seeking growth in wireless networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final price may be &#8220;slightly higher&#8221; than the 5.44
billion euros ($7.5 billion) announced in September, Nokia said
today. About 30,000 employees are transferring to Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft as part of the transaction, which was
delayed amid regulatory scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, is gaining a
device business that it&#8217;ll rely on to catch up with Apple Inc. (AAPL)
and Google Inc. (GOOG) in the tablet and mobile-phone markets. Nokia is
left seeking a turnaround for its network-equipment business and
is said to consider the division&#8217;s head, Rajeev Suri, as chief
executive officer to challenge rivals such as Ericsson (ERICB) AB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The deal alone doesn&#8217;t immediately solve the problem for
either company,&#8221; said Sami Sarkamies, an analyst at Nordea Bank
AB in Helsinki. &#8220;Now, they have to roll up their sleeves and
starting working to play catch-up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase of the unprofitable division makes Microsoft
the world&#8217;s second-largest maker of mobile phones with about 14
percent of the market, according to researcher IDC. Samsung
Electronics Co. is the market leader. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s half-brother joined rival Narendra Modi&#8217;s Bharatiya
Janata Party, a blow to the incumbent Congress party that&#8217;s
projected to lose power in nationwide opinion polls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daljeet Singh Kohli joined the BJP yesterday at an election
rally in Amritsar, Punjab, in the presence of party&#8217;s prime
ministerial candidate Modi. Although it&#8217;s not clear what role
the businessman would play in the final two weeks of elections,
voters in the majority Sikh state could view the move as an
indictment of Singh&#8217;s decade as prime minister in a coalition
headed by the Congress party, said Subrata Mukherjee, a retired
professor of political science at Delhi University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest ever election will enter its final
three phases in May, including critical swing states of Uttar
Pradesh and Bihar. Opinion polls, which show the BJP ahead,
suggest Congress&#8217; lead campaigner Rahul Gandhi is struggling to
shed the party&#8217;s image of policy paralysis which led to double-digit inflation and the slowest growth rate in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While Kohli himself isn&#8217;t an important figure, he could
symbolize a shift in support from the Congress to the BJP in the
eyes of voters,&#8221; Mukherjee said in an interview today. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
smart political tactic, but I&#8217;m sure Kohli will be an
insignificant player in a BJP-led government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Political Significance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress party Spokesman Satyavrat Chaturvedi said Kohli
never played a role in Singh&#8217;s government and his joining the
BJP wouldn&#8217;t affect Congress party&#8217;s electoral prospects.
Singh&#8217;s Spokesman Pankaj Pachauri didn&#8217;t answer two calls made
to his mobile phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve never heard his name before yesterday, that is his
political significance,&#8221; Chaturvedi said in a phone interview
from Delhi today. &#8220;This is nothing more than a joke and an
effort to convince voters of this false Modi wave.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi, donning a traditional headgear worn by Sikhs,
welcomed Kohli while campaigning for Arun Jaitley, the leader of
the opposition in the upper house of parliament. He said the
Gandhi family had wasted opportunities for improving growth,
especially in trade and technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Jawaharlal Nehru, Rahul Gandhi&#8217;s great-grandfather,
became prime minister after British rule ended in 1947, the
Gandhi family has led India&#8217;s government for nearly 38 of its 67
years as an independent nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Opinion Polls &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s brother Daljeet
Singh joins the BJP, which will only strengthen us,&#8221; Modi told
voters. &#8220;We are not a membership party, we form blood bonds
which cannot be broken.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest opinion poll released on April 14 by Hansa
Research for the NDTV television channel predicts BJP and its
allies taking 275 seats, three more than needed for a majority.
Other polls show the BJP-led group falling short of 272 seats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has seen record turnout during the first six of the
election&#8217;s nine phases, according to the Election Commission of
India. Turnout has averaged 66 percent, up from 58 percent in
2009, the commission estimates. The last round of voting will
take place on May 12, with all votes counted on May 16. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. may have opened the door
for Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s $98.7 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), the
country&#8217;s second-biggest drugmaker, with a tax policy designed
to draw research investment from abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the U.K. tightened takeover rules following Kraft
Foods Inc.&#8217;s hostile bid for candy maker Cadbury Plc, the
country has created incentives for drugmakers to increase
research and capital investments. A program implemented last
year enables companies to apply a lower corporate tax rate to
profits from patents. That encouraged GlaxoSmithKline Plc,
AstraZeneca&#8217;s larger British rival, to build its first U.K.
factory in almost four decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Britain would lose AstraZeneca if Pfizer pulls off
the biggest-ever U.K. takeover, the nation would become the
domicile of the world&#8217;s biggest pharmaceutical company and
receive a $100 billion boost to its economy, Pfizer Chief
Executive Officer Ian Read said on a conference call with
reporters yesterday. A spokesman for U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said there were rules in place governing acquisitions,
and declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Pfizer incorporate in the U.K., you&#8217;re bringing in
inward investment,&#8221; said Dan Mahony, who helps manage about $12
billion at Polar Capital Holdings Plc in London. &#8220;You could
argue that government policy has driven that, in which case,
they&#8217;re hardly going to try to nix the deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) erasing an earlier slide, as Internet and smaller companies pulled back from a selloff amid optimism over merger activity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. added 4.2 percent after proposing to buy AstraZeneca Plc for about 58.8 billion pounds ($98.7 billion). Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. rallied more than 2.4 percent, leading gains among the largest technology companies. Bank of America Corp. dropped 6.3 percent after suspending its planned buybacks and dividend increase because of an error in its capital planning. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 0.3 percent to 1,869.43 at 4 p.m. in New York, reversing an earlier loss of 0.7 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 87.28 points, or 0.5 percent, to 16,448.74. The Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP) declined less than 0.1 percent after tumbling as much as 1.5 percent, and the Russell 2000 Index of smaller companies slid 0.5 percent. About 7.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 9.3 percent above the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s remarkable how volatile the market can be on an intraday basis,&#8221; John Carey, a Boston-based fund manager at Pioneer Investment Management Inc., which oversees $220 billion worldwide, said by phone. &#8220;Most of the companies that have reported so far have exceeded expectations and there&#8217;s MA that&#8217;s bubbling along and that could be causing some optimism, with big deals and restructuring.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. equities began higher as large companies rallied on optimism about merger activity. Stocks turned lower as the U.S. and European Union imposed new sanctions on Russia, while selling in Internet and small-cap stocks spread to the broader market. Major indexes recovered in the afternoon, turning positive during the final hour of trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Technology Selloff &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5 percent last week, including a 1.8 percent tumble on April 25, as disappointing results from Amazon.com Inc. triggered a selloff in technology shares and tensions over Ukraine intensified. The technology-heavy gauge has fallen in four of the past five weeks amid concern valuations have outpaced estimates for earnings growth. Nasdaq companies trade at 34 times reported earnings, about double the level of SP 500 members. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The frequency of selloffs has increased even as technology makers are forecast to post the second-fastest profit growth in the SP 500 this year and members of the Nasdaq 100 Index are beating analyst estimates by almost 10 percent this earnings season. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft, IBM &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Increases among larger stocks helped push technology companies in the SP 500 higher as a group. Microsoft surged 2.4 percent to $40.87 and Apple climbed 3.9 percent to $594.09 to extend its three-day rally to 13 percent, the most since 2009. International Business Machines Corp. added 1.9 percent to $193.14. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones Internet Index (VIX) fell 1.9 percent, extending a 4.1 percent decline on April 25. The index has dropped 18 percent from a 13-year high on March 5. Only four of 41 members in the gauge rose today. Yahoo! Inc. dropped 1.4 percent to $33.99. Amazon slumped 2.4 percent to $296.58. Netflix tumbled 2.4 percent to $314.21. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A report by the National Association of Realtors showed contracts to purchase previously owned U.S. homes climbed in March by the most in almost three years, showing residential real estate was starting to stabilize entering the spring selling season. The pending home sales index rose 3.4 percent, the first gain in nine months, after a 0.5 percent drop in February that was smaller than initially reported. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Economic Data &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A busy calendar this week will give investors more clues about the strength of the economy and the pace of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s stimulus program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s initial tally of first-quarter gross domestic product on April 30 may show the slowest expansion in a year. Federal Reserve policy makers, who on the same day conclude their third meeting of the year, will probably reduce the pace of assets purchases designed to stoke the economy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three rounds of monetary stimulus have helped fuel economic growth, sending the SP 500 surging as much as 180 percent from its 2009 low. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Payroll growth probably accelerated in April as companies remained upbeat about the economy&#8217;s prospects after a setback in demand caused by snowstorms and colder temperatures earlier this year. Employers added 215,000 workers, the most since November, economists project a May 2 report from the Labor Department will show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ukraine Crisis &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors are also watching developments in Ukraine. The Obama administration imposed sanctions on seven Russian officials and 17 companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s inner circle involved in banking, energy and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sanctions, announced by the White House today, are being imposed in conjunction with the European Union, which said today it is adding 15 names to its list of previously sanctioned individuals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a gauge of options prices on the SP 500, dropped 0.6 percent for its first loss in four days. The gauge jumped 5.6 percent on April 25. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consumer-staples and phone companies had the biggest gains among 10 groups in the SP 500, climbing more than 1.1 percent. Financial and raw-materials shares declined the most, dropping at least 0.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pfizer, GE &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer added 4.2 percent to $32.04. The world&#8217;s largest drugmaker is still interested in a deal after AstraZeneca spurned its earlier offer. Pfizer proposed buying the London-based company on Jan. 5 for 46.61 pounds a share in cash and stock, and AstraZeneca declined to pursue negotiations, the New York-based company said in a statement today. The bid was about 14 percent above AstraZeneca&#8217;s closing price on April 25. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;General Electric Co. gained 0.7 percent to $26.78 after Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt met with France&#8217;s President Francois Hollande over the company&#8217;s offer for Alstom SA. Immelt may be moving closer to pulling off his largest-ever acquisition, even after French officials over the weekend urged Alstom to consider a rival offer from Germany&#8217;s Siemens AG. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government doesn&#8217;t oppose GE&#8217;s proposal, and the meeting in Paris today focused on protecting jobs and maintaining the independence of France&#8217;s nuclear industry, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions. The state doesn&#8217;t favor either bid, the person said, asking not to be named as the talks weren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Newmont, Barrick &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. soared 7.3 percent to a record $17.20. American Realty Capital Properties Inc., the largest owner of single-tenant U.S. buildings, is interested in acquiring NorthStar for about $20 a share, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. That&#8217;s a premium of 25 percent to NorthStar&#8217;s closing price of $16.03 last week and would value the New York-based company at about $6.5 billion. American Realty fell 3 percent to $12.62. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Newmont Mining Corp. dropped 6.7 percent to $24.67. Barrick Gold Corp. said Newmont ended discussions about a takeover, which would have combined the world&#8217;s two largest gold producers. Talks between Newmont and Toronto-based Barrick broke down on April 18 over a disagreement about a proposed spinoff of some of the combined company&#8217;s assets, people familiar with the situation said the following day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America lost 6.3 percent to $14.95. The bank said it will suspend its planned buybacks and dividend increase because of an error in its capital planning. The lender will resubmit its proposal to the Federal Reserve, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said in a statement. The company said it incorrectly adjusted for cumulative realized losses on structured notes issued by Merrill Lynch. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Drew Armstrong and Oliver Staley" date="Apr 28, 2014  4:19 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-28/pfizer-confirms-proposing-98-7-billion-astrazeneca-deal.html"><headline>Pfizer Still Wants AstraZeneca After Bid Rejected</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is back in the megamerger game. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. drugmaker proposed buying AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) for about 58.8 billion pounds ($98.7 billion) in what would rank as the industry&#8217;s biggest-ever takeover, surpassing Pfizer&#8217;s $64 billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009. AstraZeneca spurned the offer as too low, and Pfizer said it&#8217;s considering its options. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If AstraZeneca eventually agrees, a deal would create a company incorporated in the U.K. for tax purposes and run from New York. London-based AstraZeneca&#8217;s operations would be sewn into Pfizer&#8217;s three new business units. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

The proposal is about 14 percent above the April 25 close for AstraZeneca. The stock today climbed above that price, gaining the most in more than two decades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, Pfizer is still trying to draw AstraZeneca into talks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We tried to get a mutual announcement to say we were in preliminary discussions,&#8221; Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said on a conference call today. &#8220;AstraZeneca rebuffed that, which is why we were forced to make the announcement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LightSquared Inc.&#8217;s plan to
reorganize will improperly benefit lenders including JPMorgan
Chase  Co., which will own all of the wireless-spectrum
company&#8217;s assets after bankruptcy, Dish Network Corp. (DISH) Chairman
Charles Ergen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was devised in talks where LightSquared&#8217;s
controlling shareholder, Philip Falcone, &#8220;made it clear that he
was interested in using the plan to enrich himself and equity
holders,&#8221; Ergen said yesterday in a bankruptcy court filing in
Manhattan. Falcone stated that he wanted to protect three
parties: his investment firm Harbinger Capital Partners LLC,
Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) and JPMorgan, Ergen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP Special Opportunities Inc., an Ergen fund that invested
$1 billion in LightSquared debt, made the allegations following
an eight-day trial on whether LightSquared can reorganize under
a plan that puts Ergen&#8217;s debt behind other lenders and equity
holders to be repaid. In yesterday&#8217;s filing, the fund dissected
how much JPMorgan, Fortress, Harbinger and another investor,
Melody Capital Advisors LLC, stand to benefit compared with what
money they put at risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Falcone made it clear in numerous e-mails that the
primary purpose of the plan and its subordination or
disallowance of SPSO&#8217;s claims was to enrich Mr. Falcone and
Harbinger,&#8221; Ergen said. Closing arguments in the trial are
planned for May 5 and 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falcone has said he had a fiduciary duty to advocate for
Harbinger&#8217;s investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Affiliate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan (JPM) affiliate SIG Holdings Inc. currently holds all of
LightSquared&#8217;s series B preferred stock. The New York-based bank
also has put $360 million into LightSquared through operating
loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investments may be worth &#8220;hundreds of millions of
dollars,&#8221; and JPMorgan will own all of LightSquared&#8217;s equity
and assets after the bankruptcy, Ergen said. JPMorgan also may
benefit from LightSquared tax-loss benefits estimated at more
than $2 billion, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LightSquared, based in Reston, Virginia, sought court
protection after the Federal Communications Commission blocked
the company&#8217;s wireless service, saying it might interfere with
global-positioning-system navigation equipment. The company
listed assets of $4.48 billion and debt of $2.29 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-bk-12080, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;If Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is successful in its
$98.7 billion takeover of London-based AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), there is
one big potential loser: the U.S. Treasury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed deal&#8217;s structure, the combined company
would be owned by a new U.K. parent. That doesn&#8217;t mean any of
New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s executives would need to move abroad:
Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has said the drugmaker would be
run from the U.S. It does mean, however, that Pfizer is joining
a wave of U.S. companies using mergers as ways to slash income
tax bills by shifting their head office overseas -- often on
paper only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is basically an opportunity to go outside the U.S.
and still sell in the U.S. and strip the tax base,&#8221; said H.
David Rosenbloom, an attorney at Caplin  Drysdale in Washington
and director of the international tax program at New York
University&#8217;s school of law. &#8220;If we ever had a legislature in
the United States, we could do something about this, but I don&#8217;t
expect to live that long.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. law seeks to stop companies from avoiding income taxes
by simply ditching their home residence. Those rules only
prevent companies from getting the tax benefit of an overseas
merger if their existing shareholders still own 80 percent or
more of the company&#8217;s stock after the deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is rushing to fix a
security flaw in its Internet Explorer browser that is already
being used in &#8220;limited, targeted attacks,&#8221; as antivirus firms
and the U.S. government advise switching to alternate products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take over a user&#8217;s personal computer through the
browser&#8217;s vulnerability, a hacker would have to persuade that
person to click on a link to view a malicious website, Microsoft
said in an advisory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Explorer security concerns come just weeks after the
public discovery of Heartbleed, a flaw in the design of an
encryption tool that runs on as many as two-thirds of all active
websites. Some edition of Internet Explorer runs on 58 percent
of all desktop PCs, according NetMarketShare, compared with 18
percent for Google Inc.&#8217;s Chrome, the No. 2 browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
could gain the same user rights as the current user,&#8221; Microsoft
said in the advisory, issued on April 26. &#8220;On completion of
this investigation, Microsoft will take the appropriate action
to protect our customers, which may include providing a solution
through our monthly security update release process, or an out-of-cycle security update, depending on customer needs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Windows XP &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaw exists in Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11,
which means it will affect users of Windows XP, the operating
system that Microsoft stopped supporting with security updates
earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symantec Corp., the biggest maker of PC-security software,
advised customers to switch to another browser until Microsoft
releases a software patch to fix the vulnerability and to use a
security mitigation tool kit that Microsoft recommended and that
will work with Windows XP. The U.S. Department of Homeland
Security&#8217;s Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued similar
advice today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability was found on April 26 by researchers at
security firm FireEye Inc. (FEYE), who also discovered the related
attacks and named the campaign &#8220;Operation Clandestine Fox.&#8221;
FireEye, in a statement on its blog, declined to provide details
of the campaign except to say that it was targeted at Internet
Explorer versions 9 through 11, which account for about a
quarter of the total browser market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zero-Day Threat &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of security flaw is known as a zero-day threat
because there is no time between the discovery of the weakness
and attacks attempting to exploit it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, researchers disclosed discovery of the
Heartbleed bug, a flaw in OpenSSL encryption software.
Researchers pushed out a fix for the vulnerability, which could
have enabled hackers to gain access to user names, passwords and
other sensitive information, and users were urged to change
their website passwords. Companies such as BlackBerry Ltd.,
Cisco Systems Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. were affected by the bug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer-data breaches at Target Corp. and Neiman Marcus
Group Ltd. in recent months and the spying scandal involving the
National Security Agency have also raised concerns about the
security of networks and private information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), one of two
banks that dominate clearing in the $1.8 trillion tri-party
repurchase agreement market, said it curtailed daily credit risk
that regulators blamed for fueling the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All clients have been moved to a system that includes
rolling settlement, simultaneous exchange of cash and collateral
and creation of a secured committed clearance advance facility,
JPMorgan said today in a statement. Collectively, the changes
provide the bank with more protection against losses while
reducing the need of Wall Street dealers for intraday loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve has been urging JPMorgan and Bank of
New York Mellon Corp. to speed improvements in repo markets,
which are used by the Fed&#8217;s primary dealers for short-term
funding. The system neared collapse in 2008 amid the demise of
Bear Stearns Cos. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Bankers had
pledged to finish upgrades by 2016, prompting the Fed to say
industry-led efforts were too slow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every new piece of functionality introduced over the last
four years has allowed us to reduce materially the systemic risk
previously created by over-reliance on clearing-bank credit,&#8221;
Michael Albanese, head of JPMorgan&#8217;s U.S. tri-party repo
clearing and collateral management, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon, the industry leader, and JPMorgan act as
middlemen to process repo transactions and keep charge of
collateral. The role required the two New York-based banks to
temporarily extend hundreds of billions of dollars in credit for
several hours during the day, which puts their safety at risk if
the market breaks down before the deals are unwound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Curbing Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed&#8217;s goal was to curb the need for the lenders to
finance the deals, people familiar with the plans have said. The
market is the biggest source of financing for primary dealers,
the 22 firms that act as counterparties for the central bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon is &#8220;fully on track for practically eliminating
intraday credit risk this year and enabling market participants
to continue to efficiently and effectively fund their
operations,&#8221; Kevin Heine, a spokesman for the company, said in
an e-mailed statement. The lender, which handles about 80
percent of the transactions, expects to have the final pieces of
its upgrade in place by the end of this year, according to the
firm&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed&#8217;s chairman during 2008, told the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that a breakdown of the tri-party market in 2008 almost created a &#8220;black hole&#8221; as
financial firms lost access to cash for daily operations. The
commission in a report cited structural flaws in the market as
one of the biggest causes of the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The love fest between little girls
and the film &#8220;Frozen&#8221; helped Walt Disney Co. (DIS) maintain its
domination of the U.S. licensed toy industry last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsa dolls and other &#8220;Frozen&#8221; merchandise sold better
than any other licensed toys in the first three months of the
year, according to NPD Group Inc. The animated movie, released
in November, has generated more than $1.1 billion in ticket
sales, according to Box Office Mojo. That&#8217;s made it the highest-grossing animated film of all time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Disney, the &#8220;Frozen&#8221; surge is helping continue its
winning streak in toy licensing. The company had four of the top
five toy franchises in the first quarter, including Disney
Princess, Mickey  Friends and Star Wars. The lone non-Disney
franchise was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, owned by Viacom Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cars,&#8221; another Disney property, led the list last year,
when retail sales of from licensed toys climbed to $5.3 billion,
according to Port Washington, New York-based NPD. The toy
industry is increasingly relying on entertainment franchises to
spur sales. While total U.S. toy sales declined 1 percent last
year, revenue from licenses rose 3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, also dominated the
list of fastest-growing licenses last quarter with three titles:
&#8220;Frozen,&#8221; &#8220;Planes&#8221; and &#8220;Sofia the First.&#8221; The top spot
went to toys based on &#8220;Despicable Me,&#8221; owned by Comcast
Corp.&#8217;s Universal Pictures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a painful time to be a junk-bond skeptic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may seem inevitable that the riskiest corporate debt will lose value, since investors are getting paid about the least ever to own such bonds. Yet after bearish wagers on the biggest junk-bond exchange-traded funds surged to a record last month, the market just keeps on rallying. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Will the search for yield come to tears?&#8221; JPMorgan Chase  Co. strategists led by Jan Loeys wrote in an April 25 report. &#8220;Eventually, yes.&#8221; But not, at least, until probably next year, according to the strategists, who are sticking to a positive outlook for now on U.S. speculative-grade debt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The volume of borrowed shares -- usually used for short selling -- on BlackRock Inc.&#8217;s $13.3 billion ETF (HYG) soared to an all-time high of almost $3.6 billion on March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For State Street Corp.&#8217;s similar fund, the bets approached $1.3 billion, also a record. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How did the market respond? BlackRock&#8217;s ETF has gained 0.3 percent this month, while State Street&#8217;s (JNK) is up 0.4 percent. Yields on the debt as measured by a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index dropped to 6.02 percent, about the same rate buyers were paid to own 10-year Treasuries (USGG10YR) during the past three decades. Investors have since pared their bearish ETF wagers a bit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hating Junk &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aversion to the market was on display at a hedge-fund conference last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We hate high-yield -- we&#8217;re actually short high-yield,&#8221; Andrew Rabinowitz, Marathon Asset Management LP&#8217;s chief operating officer, said March 19 on a panel at the Absolute Return Symposium 2014 in New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s trading at dangerous levels.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DoubleLine Capital LP&#8217;s Jeffrey Gundlach trimmed allocations to the debt earlier this year, saying last month that &#8220;if they start to suffer losses, you really wonder who&#8217;s going to buy them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As investors have learned over the past five years, it hasn&#8217;t paid to fight Federal Reserve stimulus, which is still supporting values that by any historical measure seem expensive. There&#8217;s a growing sense that the tide will turn. Many are losing confidence that the time is now. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Charles Mead" date="Apr 28, 2014  9:44 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-28/walter-bonds-jump-following-debt-for-equity-swap.html"><headline>Walter Bonds Jump Following Debt-for-Equity Swap</headline><body>

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court ended a
lawsuit that accused Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) of illegally protecting its
Windows computer operating system from competition 20 years ago
by undercutting a rival word-processing program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declining to take up a lingering antitrust case stemming
from Microsoft&#8217;s software dominance in the 1990s, the justices
today rejected without comment an appeal by Novell Inc., which
once made the WordPerfect application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell was looking to revive a lawsuit that accused
Microsoft of anticompetitive conduct during development of its
Windows 95 operating system in 1994. Novell said that, late in
the rollout process, Microsoft withheld software components
known as namespace extensions so competing developers would have
trouble making their programs run smoothly on Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell said the move slowed the development of WordPerfect,
a word-processing program that posed a threat to Microsoft&#8217;s
Word. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In throwing out the lawsuit, a Denver-based federal appeals
court said &#8220;antitrust laws rarely impose on firms -- even
dominant firms -- a duty to deal with their rivals.&#8221; The ruling
upheld a federal trial judge&#8217;s opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell, now part of privately held Wizard Parent LLC,
argued in its appeal that Microsoft &#8220;made its own operating
system less attractive to consumers in order to crush
competition and protect its operating system monopoly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case bore some similarities to the 1998 Justice
Department lawsuit that at one point produced a court order that
would have split Microsoft into two companies. An appeals court
overturned that order, and the company later settled the case by
agreeing to let computer makers promote rival software products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts didn&#8217;t take part in the Supreme
Court action. He was involved as a lawyer in the Justice
Department&#8217;s antitrust case against Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Novell v. Microsoft, 13-1042. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan&#8217;s job will be safe if the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party comes to power in elections ending May 16, Piyush Goyal, the organization&#8217;s treasurer, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Just because he&#8217;s been appointed by someone else doesn&#8217;t mean we have an agenda to remove him,&#8221; Goyal, a lawmaker who is on the standing committee on finance, said in New Delhi yesterday, referring to Rajan. &#8220;No government can dictate to the central bank. It&#8217;s an autonomous body and he holds a constitutional position. We don&#8217;t have any likes or dislikes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most polls show Narendra Modi&#8217;s BJP winning enough seats to form a coalition government as voters look to end 10 years of Congress party rule amid the slowest economic growth in a decade. Rajan this month dismissed talk of any differences with the BJP as &#8220;speculation&#8221; that was invented by the press. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goyal distanced himself from comments he made in February to the Economic Times newspaper, which quoted him saying that &#8220;Governor Rajan is only aggravating the problems and making it worse by increasing interest rates.&#8221; Goyal said he meant that RBI governors under Congress rule have been forced to increase rates due to ineffective policy implementation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Lousily Managed&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Reserve Bank is fulfilling its duty to make an effort to reduce inflation, but sadly the government has been so lousily managed in the last few years,&#8221; Goyal said. &#8220;A government led by Modi will repress the concerns of any central bank leader.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;India: Reshaping the World''s Biggest Democracy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s consumer-price inflation quickened in March for the first time in four months to 8.31 percent from a year earlier, keeping pressure on the central bank to keep interest rates elevated. Rajan left the repurchase rate unchanged in the last review on April 1 after raising it by 75 basis points since September, and said further tightening isn&#8217;t anticipated if price gains stay on path to hit 8 percent in January 2015 and 6 percent a year later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goyal said the BJP has &#8220;zero tolerance for inflation&#8221; and would move to prevent hoarding of fresh produce, which has exacerbated food prices during supply shortages. It would seek a price stabilization fund to support farmers during supply gluts and procure imports when there are shortages, he said, without saying how much it would cost. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;BJP Worries &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Government pressure on Rajan to change his policy focus &#8220;would be perceived as shooting themselves in the foot because Rajan has been the source of credibility in India and you don&#8217;t want to destroy that,&#8221; said Benoit Anne, London-based head of emerging-market strategy at Societe Generale SA. &#8220;The best thing that they can do is to leave him alone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 1934 Reserve Bank of India Act says the federal government may give direction to the central bank on what it considers the public interest. The provision has never been used and doesn&#8217;t mention monetary policy, Chakravarthy Rangarajan, a former RBI governor who is chairman of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Economic Advisory Council, said in an Oct. 9 interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s rupee has been the best performer among emerging markets since hitting an all-time low on Aug. 28, surging 14 percent in that time as Rajan offered discounted swaps for dollars raised by banks and on optimism that a Modi government will boost economic growth. The benchmark SP BSE Sensex has climbed 15 percent since Sept. 13, when the BJP named Modi as its prime minister candidate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fiscal Deficit &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reducing the fiscal deficit and fighting corruption would give space for interest rates to come down, Goyal said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ruling Congress party saw the fiscal deficit rise to a peak of 6.5 percent of gross domestic product in the 2010 fiscal year. It will narrow to 4.1 percent of gross domestic product by March 31, 2015 from an estimated 4.6 percent in the previous fiscal year, lower than an earlier target of 4.8 percent, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s subsidy bill rose fivefold in the past decade under Singh&#8217;s ruling Congress party to 2.6 trillion rupees ($43 billion) a year. In the same period, the Indian economy has only doubled in size, according to the International Monetary Fund. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;India has seen record turnout averaging 66 percent through six of nine rounds of voting, according to the Election Commission of India. More than two-thirds of seats among the 543 up for grabs have already been decided. The last round of voting will take place on May 12, with all votes counted on May 16. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Rabil and Alex Barinka" date="Apr 29, 2014  4:29 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-29/ibm-increases-quarterly-dividend-by-16-to-1-10-a-share.html"><headline>IBM Boosts Quarterly Dividend by 16% as Buybacks Slow</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) raised its quarterly dividend by 16 percent to $1.10 per share as Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty tries to appease shareholders while the company shifts businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM announced the increase from 95 cents a share in a press release today before the start of its annual meeting. The new dividend is more than the $1.05 a share projected, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 15-cent increase will cost Armonk, New York-based IBM about $625 million a year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, IBM reported its eighth straight quarterly decline in revenue as it shifts its business from hardware to cloud computing and data analysis. Rometty is banking on a strong comeback in the coming quarters as she aims to deliver on a forecast for adjusted earnings of at least $18 a share this year. The larger-than-expected dividend boost comes as IBM plans to reduce its pace of stock buybacks following an $8.2 billion splurge in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement reinforces our commitment to delivering value to shareholders,&#8221; Rometty said in the statement. &#8220;We will continue to invest aggressively in our strategic growth areas including cloud, big data analytics, social, mobile and security to position the company to drive growth and higher value for our clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Swiss units of Goldman Sachs
Group (GS) Inc. and Morgan Stanley (MS) are among 106 banks seeking U.S.
non-prosecution agreements after saying they had reason to
believe they helped Americans violate tax laws, according to
three people familiar with the banks&#8217; actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley applied to a Justice
Department program that requires banks to disclose how they
helped Americans hide assets, hand over data on undeclared
accounts and pay penalties, according to the people who asked
not to be identified because they weren&#8217;t authorized to discuss
the matter publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain non-prosecution deals, banks must pay 20 percent of
the value of accounts not disclosed to the Internal Revenue
Service on Aug. 1, 2008, 30 percent for such accounts opened
between then and February 2009 and 50 percent for accounts
opened afterward. Banks submitted letters of intent by Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, and Wesley
McDade, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voluntary disclosure program, offered last year to more
than 300 Swiss banks, is part of the U.S. crackdown on offshore
tax evasion. It wasn&#8217;t open to 14 institutions already under
criminal investigation, including Credit Suisse Group AG, the
second-biggest Swiss bank; the Swiss unit of HSBC Holdings Plc;
Julius Baer Group Ltd., Switzerland&#8217;s third-largest wealth
manager; and Zuercher Kantonalbank, the largest state-owned
regional bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is considering strategic options for its
Swiss private bank, including a sale or wind-down, a person
briefed on the discussions said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Undeclared Accounts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those under criminal investigation are known as Category 1
banks, while those seeking non-prosecution agreements are called
Category 2. If no undeclared U.S. accounts are found, banks can
apply as Category 3. Category 4 banks are those with mainly
local clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks seeking non-prosecution agreements must disclose the
total number of U.S. accounts since 2008, their highest dollar
value, and the employees who managed them. The banks also must
use independent examiners to certify findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Keneally said in January
that the department is reviewing the letters of intent to see if
applicants qualify as Swiss banks. Some banks are still
reviewing records, and some may withdraw, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 33 banks announced that they will join the program
in Category 2, including Cie. Lombard, Odier SCA, Geneva&#8217;s
oldest bank, and BSI Group, the Swiss private bank owned by
Italy&#8217;s Assicurazioni Generali SpA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks that said they will participate include: Union
Bancaire Privee, the Geneva-based bank founded by Edgar de
Picciotto in 1969; Edmond de Rothschild Group, owned by Baron
Benjamin de Rothschild; and EFG International AG, controlled by
Greek billionaire Spiro Latsis and his family. Another 15 banks,
mainly regional lenders, declared they will opt for Category 3
or 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Category 3 banks seek Justice Department letters saying
they&#8217;re not a target of a criminal probe. In return, an
independent examiner must confirm the bank broke no laws. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies looking for lower tax bills are heading for the exits, and Congress is doing nothing to stop them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is the latest corporation to consider reducing its tax bill by moving its legal address outside the U.S., proposing an acquisition of London-based AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) that would allow Pfizer to reincorporate in the U.K. while top executives remain in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer would join at least 19 other companies making or contemplating similar transactions, including Chiquita Brands International Inc. (CQB) and Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC), the largest U.S. advertising firm. A stalled proposal from President Barack Obama to limit such deals would raise $17 billion over a decade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers have responded with little outrage and no plans for a quick law to limit the transactions, known as inversions. Instead, they cite the deals as fuel for a revamp of the tax code that&#8217;s probably years away. That inaction gives companies a window to look for offshore mergers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Members of Congress are not swayed as easily nowadays by all the rhetoric about corporate tax cheats and companies being traitors because they&#8217;re moving to Ireland,&#8221; said Herman Bouma, a Washington-based senior tax counsel at Buchanan, Ingersoll  Rooney P.C. &#8220;There doesn&#8217;t seem to be that many members upset about the inversions happening. They&#8217;re more upset about the way their tax code is, that causes companies to want to do that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrea Ponti, JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)&#8217;s vice chairman of global health-care investment banking, is
preparing to leave and set up an investment firm targeting the
industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakesh Patel and Cathrin Petty will continue to run
JPMorgan&#8217;s health-care investment banking business in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa, according to a memo from Laurence Hollingworth, head of EMEA coverage, that was obtained by
Bloomberg News. The contents of the document were confirmed by a
spokeswoman for the bank in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ponti joined New York-based JPMorgan in 2008 from Goldman

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil (XOM) Corp., Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) have the capacity to bid for BG
Group Plc (BG/) after Chief Executive Officer Chris Finlayson resigned
yesterday, said RBC Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finlayson&#8217;s sudden departure has started speculation that
the U.K.&#8217;s third-largest oil company may become a target as bids
for European companies including drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) and
Alstom SA (ALO) show an increased appetite for deals. BG, which has
oil assets in Brazil, gas discoveries in Tanzania and a gas-export plant in Australia, has a market value of 39.6 billion
pounds ($66.7 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Changing CEO after 15 months and review of operating,
investment and portfolio management plans raises questions on a
possible takeover,&#8221; Peter Hutton, a London-based analyst at
RBC, said in a note yesterday. Exxon Mobil, Shell and Chevron
have &#8220;the capacity to pursue a cash acquisition&#8221; and may need
to offer a 20 percent premium to the current share price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BG, trading &#8220;at a materially greater&#8221; discount to its
peer group, may also examine plans to sell some assets in Brazil
or Tanzania, Deutsche Bank AG said in a note e-mailed today. The
company shares dropped 14 percent on Jan. 27, when Finlayson
unveiled project delays, and haven&#8217;t recovered yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Permanent Successor &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in Reading, England, yesterday said that
the CEO resigned for personal reasons after a little more than a
year in the job. He has been replaced by Chairman Andrew Gould
until a permanent successor is found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BG yesterday also ditched an output forecast for 2015
that&#8217;s just three months old. At the same time, the directors
reiterated their commitment to the company&#8217;s strategy presented
by Finlayson in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a &#8220;strange announcement,&#8221; Neill Morton, a
London-based analyst at Investec Bank Plc, wrote in an e-mailed
report yesterday.  Directors &#8220;seems happy to usher&#8221; the CEO
&#8220;through the exit&#8221; while staying committed to his strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BG rose as much as 2.4 percent to 1,174 pence in London
trading today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For three years, Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief
Executive Officer Ian Read has been firing people, trimming
research initiatives and shedding businesses in a less-is-more
strategy designed to cut back the excesses from a decade of
megamergers. No more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s announcement that Pfizer is seeking to buy
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) in a new $100 billion megamerger is putting the
industry on notice that a company that was once the world&#8217;s
biggest drugmaker is seeking to quickly reclaim its title. A
consummated deal would generate more than $75 billion in
combined yearly revenue, based on current sales. It may also
offer new growth opportunities and tax advantages for Pfizer,
and reopen a door on a promising family of cancer medications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &#8220;palatable aspects&#8221; to the deal, said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., in a note
to clients. Yet &#8220;doing yet another big merger can certainly be
viewed as a potential failure of sorts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s offer, quickly rebuffed by AstraZeneca as too low,
was revealed after a pair of experimental drugs thought to have
billion-dollar potential for Pfizer, Eliquis and Xeljanz,
fizzled in their starts and a third, the breast cancer treatment
palbociclib, will soon face a potent competitor in Eli Lilly 
Co.&#8217;s experimental drug bemaciclib. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vevo LLC&#8217;s four owners are close to hiring Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to explore sale options for the music video-hosting service, according to three people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sale of a majority stake is being considered among those options, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the process is private. Vevo is co-owned by Vivendi SA&#8217;s Universal Music Group, Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s Sony Music Entertainment, Google Inc.

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) paid $23.9 million in
fees to underwriters led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) for the iPhone maker&#8217;s $12 billion bond
offering this week, a year after the banks led its record-setting offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which underwrote 64 percent of the sale
according to a regulatory filing, would get $15.3 million if
commissions are divided in proportion to firms&#8217; involvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fees amount to 0.199 percent of the funds raised, down
from the 0.313 percent charged on the company&#8217;s $17 billion
offering last year. The fee is less than half the average 0.461
percent paid this year on offerings of investment-grade U.S.
corporate bonds, excluding self-led deals, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank managed 20 percent of the offering, according
to the filing. That would entitle the Frankfurt-based lender to
about $4.8 million of a proportionally divided fee pool. Other
banks in the April 29 deal were JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. (C) and Wells Fargo 
Co., the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s share was reduced from 72 percent in last
April&#8217;s deal, where it collected about $38.3 million in fees,
and Deutsche Bank&#8217;s piece was increased from 17.5 percent,
according to a filing at the time. Apple maintained the same
roster of underwriters compared to its last sale, with the
exception of adding Wells Fargo and dropping Standard Chartered
Plc. Fees totaled $53.3 million on the 2013 deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Mayura
Hooper, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, declined to comment on the
fees. A call after regular business hours to Ashia Razzaq, a
spokeswoman at Standard Chartered, wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British lawmakers mobilized against
Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s attempt to buy AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), demanding Business
Secretary Vince Cable secure assurances on jobs and research
investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrian Bailey, chairman of Parliament&#8217;s cross-party
Business Committee, said April 29 it is likely to summon Pfizer
executives to give evidence on their intentions. Yesterday,
Julian Huppert, from Cable&#8217;s junior coalition Liberal Democrat
Party, submitted a motion calling for ministers to &#8220;act as
necessary to protect employment and skills in the U.K.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron has in the past praised
Britain&#8217;s open economy, suggesting he would be reluctant to
intervene in the proposed $99 billion deal. Still, the
government has mechanisms by which it could try to prevent a
takeover. Pressure from Parliament and Liberal Democrats in the
government could make that more likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a great deal at stake here,&#8221; Huppert said in a
statement. &#8220;This would be the largest takeover of a British
firm. I want to make sure AstraZeneca retains its position in
the U.K. It is extremely important for those people employed by
the company and our economy generally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read met with U.K.

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. named
Argentine economist Vladimir Werning as the head of Latin
America research amid a leadership overhaul in the global
banking division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Werning will replace and report to Luis Oganes, who was
promoted earlier this month to global head of emerging-markets
research, according to bank spokeswoman Veronica Navarro Espinosa. Oganes, who will move to London in August, succeeded
Joyce Chang after she was named global head of research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Ramsey, Franco Uccelli, Gabriel Lozano and Iker Cabiedes will keep their current responsibilities as Latin
America economists and report to Werning, who will continue to
cover the economies and fixed-income markets of Argentina and
Chile, according to Espinosa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Werning started as an economist at JPMorgan&#8217;s Buenos Aires
office in the late 1990s after teaching at Torcuato Di Tella
University, where he studied economics. He moved to the bank&#8217;s
New York office in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promotions come after JPMorgan&#8217;s corporate and

&lt;p&gt;MasterCard Inc. (MA)&#8217;s approach to making bank-card transactions more secure could give it a competitive edge, analysts said after Target Corp. (TGT) awarded its portfolio to the company yesterday over larger rival Visa Inc. (V) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Target, which suffered a data breach during the holiday season, said its co-branded cards and in-house REDcards would use MasterCard&#8217;s network and technology instead of Visa&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard have given retailers and banks until October 2015 to adopt so-called EMV technology or assume liability for bogus transactions. Merchants and lenders can use chip cards that require a signature or a personal identification number. While Visa&#8217;s approach doesn&#8217;t distinguish between the two, MasterCard&#8217;s emphasizes PIN, which could improve its prospects with retailers who prefer that method. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were not anticipating the EMV shift could be catalyst for portfolio movement from Visa to MasterCard and this shows that there are some opportunities,&#8221; David Darst, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC, said of Target&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Target said it would accelerate its move to chip-card technology after tens of millions of credit- and debit-card accounts were breached late last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer said yesterday that upgrade would include chip-and-PIN. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Target is very publicly broadcasting that they are an early adopter of EMV and it&#8217;s not just EMV, it&#8217;s also chip-and-PIN,&#8221; said Darrin Peller, a Barclays Plc analyst. &#8220;That gives room to someone like MasterCard to gain market share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Nice Win&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the largest U.S. retailer, chose MasterCard to handle transactions for its store-branded credit cards, ending a nine-year relationship with Discover Financial Services. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Target&#8217;s deal with Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is a &#8220;nice win,&#8221; the revenue boost should be &#8220;fairly negligible,&#8221; according to Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette  Woods in New York. Target cards currently are co-branded with Foster City, California-based Visa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal may boost MasterCard&#8217;s annual revenue by about $13 million, or 1 cent a share, Sakhrani said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MasterCard rose 0.7 percent to $72.55 at 12:03 p.m. in New York and Visa was little changed at $202.72. The shares have slid 13 percent and 8.9 percent, respectively, this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EMV -- a technology named for founders EuroPay International, MasterCard and Visa -- is standard in Europe and much of the rest of the world and makes it more difficult for hackers to clone card data. EMV has been slower to catch on in the U.S. in part because it cost merchants and issuers more than cards with magnetic strips. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Held Accountable &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Target is in a position where they need to show how they are changing,&#8221; said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. &#8220;By switching to MasterCard -- and going with that perception that MasterCard is more oriented toward PIN -- they can communicate that they are making a change to become more secure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Requiring a PIN adds security that protects against fraud involving lost or stolen cards. While MasterCard&#8217;s strategy allows for either PIN or signature, it supports a hierarchy that holds whichever party -- issuers or merchants -- offering the least secure method liable when cards are compromised. Visa doesn&#8217;t have a similar pecking order. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whatever verification method is adopted is the choice of our merchant and financial institution clients and we will support whatever verification method they prefer,&#8221; said Paul Cohen, a Visa spokesman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;More Competitive&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Target choosing MasterCard also means that the company may have more opportunity to gain debit-card market share, according to Barclays&#8217;s Peller. Visa currently has the majority of the U.S. signature debit-card market, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It makes the landscape more competitive for debit,&#8221; as more PIN technology is introduced, Peller said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Groups including the National Retail Federation have also said they prefer chip-and-PIN cards. As the industry continues its conversion, it&#8217;s possible MasterCard may win more business from merchants advocating for PIN technology, according to Guggenheim&#8217;s Darst. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are different times when there could be portfolio or market share movement from Visa to MasterCard,&#8221; Darst said. &#8220;This is one of them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="Apr 30, 2014 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-30/microsoft-xbox-one-console-rolls-out-in-china-in-fall.html"><headline>Microsoft Xbox One Console Rolls Out in China in Fall</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will begin selling its Xbox One video-game console in China in September after a 13-year ban on such equipment was lifted in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The device will be sold through Microsoft&#8217;s partnership with BesTV New Media Co. (600637), a unit of Shanghai Media Group Inc., the company said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Microsoft didn&#8217;t provide details on game titles for the Chinese market, except to say the venture will invest &#8220;to establish an innovation program that will enable creators and developers to build, publish, and sell their games on Xbox One in China.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s video-game industry will generate about $10 billion in sales next year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and the rule change has set off a flurry of activity. TCL Multimedia Technology Holdings Ltd. said this month it will make a game player, and ZTE Corp. announced plans for its Fun Box in March. Sony Corp. and Nintendo Co. are also weighing Chinese entries. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;China took over as the No. 1 consumer of TVs in the world ahead of the U.S. last year,&#8221; said P.J. McNealy, analyst and CEO at Digital World Research in Natick, Massachusetts. &#8220;Having an entertainment console attached to follow those coattails makes a lot of sense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To succeed, Microsoft will have to lower the Xbox One&#8217;s $499 price for the Chinese market and line up game titles between now and September, McNealy said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Challenges &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hands down the two biggest challenges for Microsoft are content and pricing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Right now they don&#8217;t have a clear value proposition of what content they are going to sell on the gaming front, the music front, the TV front or the movie front.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft formed the $79 million venture with BesTV in September to enter the Chinese market. Microsoft will make an official announcement tomorrow in China about the Xbox debut. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consoles such as the Xbox, Nintendo&#8217;s Wii U and Sony&#8217;s PlayStation were banned under a 2000 rule to protect youths from the perceived corrupting influence of video games. China announced last year that the ban would be lifted within the Shanghai free-trade zone, which opened in September. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In January, China&#8217;s ruling State Council temporarily suspended the ban for the entire country and said it will draft new rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BesTV invested $40.3 million for a 51 percent stake in the joint venture, while Microsoft put in $38.7 million for the rest, according a September filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Xbox One, which went on sale in November, has been outgunned in U.S. sales by Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 4 for three consecutive months, according to market research firm NPD Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sales of the $399 PlayStation 4, also released in November, have surpassed 7 million units worldwide through April 6, Sony said in an April 16 statement.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. is preparing to sweeten its bid for AstraZeneca Plc to more than 63 billion pounds ($106 billion) in an attempt to lure the U.K.&#8217;s second-biggest drugmaker to the negotiating table, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The offer may value AstraZeneca at more than 50 pounds a share and include a larger cash component, and could come as early as next week, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. The London-based company rejected a cash-and-stock proposal of 46.61 pounds a share. Pfizer will report its earnings on May 5. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new bid and its timing aren&#8217;t final and may change, two of the people said. After speaking with some AstraZeneca shareholders, Pfizer sees an offer in the low 50 pound-per-share range gaining their support for the companies to hold talks, two people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Ian Read is on a charm offensive in the U.K. this week and would prefer to negotiate a friendly deal. Buying AstraZeneca would give Pfizer a lower tax rate and a portfolio of experimental cancer drugs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca rose 3.2 percent to 4,815 pence a share in London today, giving it a market value of 60.8 billion pounds. Pfizer fell 0.4 percent to $31.15. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The companies have several large investors in common, including BlackRock Inc., Wellington Management Co. and Vanguard Group Inc. Pfizer&#8217;s top-20 shareholders collectively own 27.6 percent of AstraZeneca, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Government Meetings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Until we see something officially, there is no comment we can provide,&#8221; said Esra Erkal-Paler, an AstraZeneca spokeswoman. Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s earlier offer, made in January, valued AstraZeneca at 58.8 billion pounds. The proposed deal would be the largest ever in the drug industry and the biggest of a U.K. company, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read met with U.K. government ministers April 29 to discuss a potential takeover, according to a person familiar with the meetings. The CEO emphasized the American company&#8217;s plans to carry out research, development and manufacturing in the U.K. as well as the appeal of the British tax system, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Global Company &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;British lawmakers this week mobilized against Pfizer&#8217;s attempt, demanding Business Secretary Vince Cable secure assurances on jobs and research investment. Part of Pfizer&#8217;s pitch to British skeptical officials and media is that AstraZeneca is a global company and has substantial operations and people outside the country, said one of the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 40 percent of AstraZeneca&#8217;s revenue in 2013 came from North America, and another 34 percent from outside of Europe, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson said the drugmaker will return to growth as an independent company and listed the reasons for rejecting the Pfizer offer, in a video today. The bid &#8220;significantly undervalued&#8221; the company and it&#8217;s concerned that the offer was too heavily weighted in stock. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s pursuit of AstraZeneca is eclipsing a deal announced April 22 by Novartis AG of Basel, Switzerland, and GlaxoSmithKline Plc. Novartis agreed to buy Glaxo&#8217;s cancer business for as much as $16 billion, form a consumer-health joint venture with Glaxo, sell its veterinary unit to Eli Lilly  Co. for $5.4 billion and sell most of its vaccines business to Glaxo for as much as $7.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By C&#233;cile Daurat" date="May 01, 2014  5:26 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-01/profits-beat-from-mastercard-to-exxon-as-economy-recovers.html"><headline>Profits Beat From MasterCard to Exxon as Economy Picks Up</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard Inc. (MA), Cigna Corp. and Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) all posted profits that topped analysts&#8217; estimates
today, as consumer spending surged and the labor market improved
in an otherwise anemic quarter for the U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beating predictions wasn&#8217;t enough for professional-networking service LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD), whose stock sank in late
trading after its second-quarter sales forecast disappointed.
Expedia Inc. (EXPE) and Wynn Resorts Ltd. also came in higher than
anticipated, leaving the pace at which Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index first-quarter earnings exceeded estimates at 75 percent
for the season so far, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer spending rose in March by the most in almost five
years as warmer weather brought shoppers back to auto-dealer
lots and malls, a sign the U.S. economy is snapping back after
growth stalled during a harsh winter. Job data released
yesterday also point to a recovery, while manufacturing expanded
in April by the most this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our tone has been fairly optimistic about the labor
market in the U.S.,&#8221; said Jan Siegmund, chief financial officer
at Automatic Data Processing Inc., the private payroll-processing company known as ADP. Job creation is &#8220;solid and
broad-based.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figures from the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research
Institute yesterday showed that companies added more workers in
April than at any time in the previous five months. Among the
bright spots were the South and the oil industry, Siegmund said
in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LinkedIn, Avon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology stocks like LinkedIn, which are valued based on
their growth potential, have taken a hit as investors question
whether the companies can keep up their revenue expansion.
Twitter Inc., among the most expensive Internet stocks, has
declined 39 percent this year and this week reported a slowdown
in user growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two-thirds of SP 500 companies have now reported.
Viacom Inc. (VIAB), ConocoPhillips (COP) and Yelp (YELP) Inc. topped predictions
today, while Avon Products Inc. (AVP) fell short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the Irving, Texas-based oil company, posted
profit that fell less than analysts anticipated as international
sanctions against Russian interests clouded efforts to tap some
of the world&#8217;s largest crude reserves. Meanwhile MasterCard, the
second-biggest payments network, benefited from an increase in
customer spending and New York-based Viacom gained from channels
including Comedy Central. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yelp Inc.&#8217;s quarterly loss was smaller than analysts
anticipated and the service for online restaurant and local
business reviews boosted its full-year revenue forecast. The
shares surged 9.8 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies downgraded expectations coming into the season
and two weeks ago analysts predicted that SP 500 earnings
gained just 0.7 percent last quarter while sales rose 2.6
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As the
reporting season progressed, they raised their estimates back to
3.4 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, as of April 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow&#8217;s main earnings include Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,
Chevron Corp., CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) and Estee Lauder Cos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) posted higher-than-expected profit as international sanctions against Russian
interests clouded the U.S. oil explorer&#8217;s efforts to tap some of
the world&#8217;s biggest crude reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income was $9.1 billion, or $2.10 a
share, compared with $9.5 billion, or $2.12, a year earlier, the
Irving, Texas-based company said in a statement today. Per-share
profit exceeded all 20 estimates from analysts in a Bloomberg
survey and surpassed the average by 22 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s oil and gas riches are key to Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Rex Tillerson&#8217;splans for reviving output at
the world&#8217;s biggest energy explorer by market value. Exxon&#8217;s
global production has fallen in 10 of the past 11 quarters and
net income is in the midst of the longest slide since the
worldwide financial crisis of 2008-2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson, 62, slashed spending on drilling and
acquisitions outside the U.S. by 41 percent to $5.2 billion and
almost tripled asset sales to amass cash. The balance-sheet
measures helped offset a larger-than-expected 5.6 percent drop
in oil and natural gas production exacerbated by lower crude
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cash flow looks good and their projects are proceeding on
schedule, so all in all it was a good quarter,&#8221; Brian
Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Sons in St. Louis, said
in a telephone interview today. Cost-containment and the absence
of major deals akin to last year&#8217;s $3.1 billion Celtic
Exploration Ltd. purchase in Canada were a boon, he said. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
Gas prices are displayed as cars drive past an Exxon Mobil Corp. station in Cincinnati.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer (PFE) Inc.&#8217;s $106 billion bid for
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) faces increased resistance as the unwilling
target&#8217;s chairman listed the reasons the offer was rejected and
British lawmakers began efforts to block the buyout attempt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer &#8220;significantly undervalued&#8221; AstraZeneca,
Chairman Leif Johansson said today in a video posted to the
company website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the biggest U.S. drugmaker, offered 46.61 pounds a
share in cash and stock in January, and London-based AstraZeneca
declined to pursue negotiations. On April 28, Pfizer made the
offer public and said it wanted to restart discussions.
AstraZeneca was also concerned that the offer was too heavily
weighted in stock, and about the proposed tax structure of the
new entity, Johansson said in the four-minute video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;AstraZeneca has a clear innovation-based strategy,
focused on achieving scientific leadership and returning to
growth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The board is also confident in our ability
to successfully execute that strategy as an independent
company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal may run into barriers set by U.K. officials
worried about the loss of jobs and research investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer executives likely will be summoned before
parliament&#8217;s Business Committee to explain their intentions,
Adrian Bailey, the committee&#8217;s chairman, said April 29.
Yesterday, Julian Huppert, a Liberal Democrat member of
parliament, submitted a motion calling for ministers to &#8220;act as
necessary to protect employment and skills in the U.K.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Largest Takeover &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a great deal at stake here,&#8221; Huppert said in a
statement. &#8220;This would be the largest takeover of a British
firm. I want to make sure AstraZeneca retains its position in
the U.K. It is extremely important for those people employed by
the company and our economy generally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of Pfizer&#8217;s offer, a deal would create a
company incorporated in the U.K. for tax purposes and run out of
New York, where Pfizer is based. The U.S. company has until May
26 to make an offer for AstraZeneca, or say that it won&#8217;t bid,
under U.K. takeover rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a conference call with reporters, Pfizer Chief Executive
Officer Ian Read said he wouldn&#8217;t commit to preserving British
jobs, although he added the U.K. was an attractive jurisdiction
in which to do business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca shares have climbed 32 percent since Jan. 1.
That growth shows that shareholders have endorsed the company&#8217;s
strategy, Johansson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock rose 1.1 percent to 4,715.50 pence at 11:37 a.m.
in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pfizer Meeting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read met with U.K. government ministers April 29 to discuss
a potential takeover, according to a person familiar with the
meetings. Read emphasized the American company&#8217;s plans to carry
out research, development and manufacturing in the U.K. as well
as the appeal of the British tax system, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s reputation in Parliament isn&#8217;t helped by its 2011
decision to close a research hub in the coastal town of
Sandwich, southeast England, with the loss of 2,000 jobs.
AstraZeneca is moving to a new global headquarters and research
center in Cambridge, which is represented by Huppert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey&#8217;s committee will discuss on May 6 whether to hold
hearings with executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I view it with great concern,&#8221; Bailey, who is a Labour
lawmaker, told reporters. &#8220;We have a company which closed its
operations in Sandwich for tax purposes and now says it&#8217;s buying
a British company for tax purposes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the bid goes ahead and is subject to a European
Commission investigation, the U.K. may ask for it to be referred
back on public interest grounds, at which point ministers could
block it. Or the government could try to amend the Enterprise
Act, which allows ministers to intervene to protect national
security, media plurality and the stability of the financial
system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean-Christophe Gray, spokesman for Prime Minister David
Cameron, called AstraZeneca&#8217;s research center in Cambridge &#8220;a
significant part of the U.K.&#8217;s developing science skill base.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Would you expect senior figures in government to take
close interest? Of course,&#8221; Gray said in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joseph Ciolli and Lu Wang" date="May 01, 2014  4:45 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-01/dow-gets-back-to-record-as-caterpillar-joins-ibm-in-rally.html"><headline>Dow Jones Index Reaches Record as Caterpillar, IBM Rally</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) crawled back to a record, helped along by last year&#8217;s worst-performing stocks: International Business Machines Corp. and Caterpillar Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four months after reaching its previous closing high of 16,576.66, the 30-stock gauge eclipsed the level yesterday, rising 0.3 percent to 16,580.84. It was the index&#8217;s third straight increase, coming after the Federal Reserve said it would continue to trim the pace of bond purchases as the economy gains momentum. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Caterpillar, which boosted its full-year profit outlook last week on improved expectations for construction, and IBM, the computer services provider that raised its dividend this month, are both up 14 percent since the Dow bottomed on Feb. 3. Armonk, New York-based IBM fell 2.1 percent and Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar added 1.3 percent in 2013, when the Dow had its best rally in 18 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are getting into the more blue-chip, unloved and overlooked areas of the market that have more value in an environment where growth is lacking,&#8221; Todd Lowenstein, a fund manager who helps manage $16 billion at Highmark Capital Management Inc. in Los Angeles, said in a phone interview. &#8220;You&#8217;re seeing a massive rotation from the frothy, speculative glamor areas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Equity Valuations &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Dow&#8217;s gain of 45.47 points yesterday bought its April advance to 0.8 percent, a third straight monthly gain that capped a 7.9 percent rally from its Feb. 3 low. The index sank 7.3 percent in the first five weeks of this year after surging 27 percent to close 2013 at the record. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dow futures gained 14 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 16,525 at 9:44 a.m. in London today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP) of technology stocks sank 2 percent last month, adding to a 2.5 percent slide in March that was its steepest since 2012, as investors sold the biggest winners from the five-year bull market on concern that valuations have outpaced earnings growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stocks in the Dow index trade for an average of 15 times reported earnings, while the higher-growth members of the Nasdaq index are valued at 35 times profit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Caterpillar climbed 0.1 percent yesterday to $105.40, up from a 2014 low of $86.17 on Jan. 24. The world&#8217;s largest maker of construction machinery said sales in that segment rose 20 percent in the first quarter while earnings tripled. IBM increased 0.7 percent to $196.47, compared with a low of $172.84 on Feb. 4. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The blue-chip record came amid broader equity gains today after the Fed concluded its two-day policy meeting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Growth Pickup &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply,&#8221; the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement following a meeting in Washington. &#8220;Household spending appears to be rising more quickly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Policy makers committee pared monthly asset buying to $45 billion, its fourth straight $10 billion cut, and said further reductions in &#8220;measured steps&#8221; are likely. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Fed seems to be putting aside the weakness in the first quarter that the market reacted to this morning,&#8221; Walter Todd, who oversees about $975 million as chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates LLC, said in a phone interview. &#8220;The statement seems business as usual, and perhaps if you&#8217;d seen the Fed react more dovish to a weaker first quarter, that would&#8217;ve been more negative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;SP Recovery &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fed decision pushed the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to within seven points of its all-time high reached on April 2. The gauge rose 0.3 percent to cap a 0.6 percent gain in April, its third straight monthly advance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500&#8217;s 8.2 percent recovery from a low of 1,741.89 on Feb. 3 has been led by a 14 percent rally energy stocks and increases of 11 percent each in industries least tied to economic growth: utilities and home-product makers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fed Chair Janet Yellen is winding down record stimulus as the economy shows signs of rebounding from a first-quarter standstill. At the same time, the Fed repeated that it&#8217;s likely to keep the benchmark interest rate near zero for a &#8220;considerable time&#8221; after bond purchases end. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This announcement is really no news is good news. No surprises here,&#8221; Kristina Hooper, a U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors in New York, said in a phone interview. The firm oversees $475 billion. &#8220;The market will have a positive reaction, might be muted, but it&#8217;s positive because this announcement is more of the same in terms of underscoring that Fed is going to remain very accommodative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Barely Grew &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data today showed the U.S. economy barely grew in the first quarter as harsh winter weather chilled investment and exports dropped. The expansion stalled even as consumer spending on services rose by the most in 14 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product grew at a 0.1 percent annualized rate from January through March, compared with a 2.6 percent gain in the prior quarter, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in Washington. The median forecast of 83 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 1.2 percent increase. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pullback in growth came as snow blanketed much of the eastern half of the country, keeping shoppers from stores, preventing builders from breaking ground and raising costs for companies including United Parcel Service Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies in the U.S. boosted payrolls by 220,000 in April, figures from the ADP Research Institute in Roseland, New Jersey, showed today. The median forecast of 45 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an advance of 210,000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Jobs Reports &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ADP numbers come before data from the Labor Department on May 2. The government&#8217;s report may show employers added 215,000 workers in April, the most since November, according to economists&#8217; projections. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some 75 percent of the 310 SP 500 (SPX) members that have reported earnings this season have posted profit that exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show. About 52 percent beat sales projections, according to the data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Profits for members of the index climbed 3.4 percent in the first quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. They had predicted an increase of 0.7 percent as recently as April 17. Revenue probably rose 2.8 percent in the quarter, the projections show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Hugh Son" date="May 02, 2014  8:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-02/jpmorgan-sees-20-drop-in-second-quarter-markets-revenue.html"><headline>JPMorgan Sees 20% Drop in Second-Quarter Markets Revenue</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the world&#8217;s
biggest investment bank by revenue, said Wall Street&#8217;s trading
slump has deepened and could last through the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income and equities trading revenue will drop about
20 percent from a year earlier at the New York-based company
amid &#8220;a continued challenging environment and lower client
activity levels,&#8221; JPMorgan said yesterday in its quarterly
regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, was the first head
of a major U.S. bank to warn investors this year that trading
was down, saying in February that revenue had fallen 15 percent.
Continued weakness has spurred analysts including Chris Mutascio
of Stifel Financial Corp.&#8217;s KBW unit to ponder whether the drop
in fixed-income trading might persist through 2014 and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s an industry phenomenon, and other banks allow
JPMorgan to grease the skids for them so there can be a gentle
letdown process,&#8221; said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales
Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 20 percent revenue slide from the $5.37 billion JPMorgan
posted in last year&#8217;s second quarter would mean results of $4.3
billion this period. That figure, along with the first quarter&#8217;s
$5.06 billion, would mark the bank&#8217;s worst first half in trading
since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2010, four months before
then Prime Minister Gordon Brown&#8217;s election defeat, Kraft Foods
Group Inc.&#8217;s takeover of candy maker Cadbury Plc was used by the
Conservative opposition to portray a government that was out of
touch with the British people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in power and facing his own general election within the
year, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron is seeking to
avoid opening himself to a similar charge over Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s bid
for London-based AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as Pfizer&#8217;s 63.1 billion-pound ($106.5 billion)
sweetened offer for AstraZeneca was rejected, the government
said it was pressing Pfizer for assurances on jobs and the
U.K.&#8217;s place as a center for the life-sciences industry. The
government will carefully weigh Pfizer&#8217;s proposals to see
&#8220;whether they offer sufficient protection of our priorities,&#8221;
Cameron&#8217;s office said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron&#8217;s Conservative-led coalition is trying to strike a
balance between leaving the decision to the companies&#8217;
shareholders without government interference and securing
safeguards for jobs and U.K. science. In doing so, it is being
reminded of Northfield, Illinois-based Kraft&#8217;s reversal of a
pledge to keep open a Cadbury plant in Keynsham, southwestern
England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether Pfizer&#8217;s commitments are binding &#8220;is a real
issue,&#8221; Science Minister David Willetts said in an interview.
&#8220;After the way in which Labour mishandled Kraft&#8217;s takeover of
Cadbury, we&#8217;re very much aware of it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Electoral Pressure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AstraZeneca takeover bid is all the more sensitive to
Cameron less than three weeks before his party contests local
and European elections at which securing jobs will play a role.
With a U.K. general election due in May 2015, the opposition
Labour Party has upped the political pressure, accusing the
premier of being &#8220;in league&#8221; with Pfizer, which its business
spokesman, Chuka Umunna, referred to as &#8220;the beast.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Labour will try to get as much advantage out of it as
possible but would be doing similar things if they were in
power,&#8221; Steve Fielding, who teaches politics at the University
of Nottingham, said in an interview. That said, &#8220;if people
start losing their jobs, then Labour will say &#8216;we did warn
you,&#8217;&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron&#8217;s office yesterday welcomed a letter to the prime
minister from Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read,
describing it as &#8220;a positive sign with significant undertakings
on research, jobs and investment.&#8221; In it, Read pledged to set
up the company headquarters in the U.K., complete a planned
AstraZeneca science hub in Cambridge, eastern England, and
protect jobs in Britain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plant Pledge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Cadbury agreed to be sold to Kraft for 11.7
billion pounds, creating the world&#8217;s largest confectionery
company. Business Secretary Peter Mandelson was accused by the
opposition of failing to stand up for British workers after
Kraft went back on its pledge to keep open a Cadbury plant with
400 workers in Keynsham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kraft&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Irene Rosenfeld said in
September 2009, at the beginning of the unsolicited takeover,
that she believed the Keynsham plant could be kept open, only to
announce seven days after her company&#8217;s offer was made
unconditional, that it would close. The U.K.&#8217;s takeover panel
reprimanded the company for misstating its plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Luff, a Conservative lawmaker and then chairman of
the House of Commons Business Committee, said at the time he was
&#8220;left with the uncomfortable feeling that politicians in these
circumstances can&#8217;t do anything except talk.&#8221; He compared
Mandelson to Shakespeare&#8217;s King Lear,&#8220;fulminating against the
winds but without any control over those winds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benevolent Employer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded by John Cadbury in 1824 in Birmingham, central
England, Cadbury built a reputation as a benevolent employer
after John&#8217;s sons Richard and George opened a &#8220;factory in a
garden&#8221; in 1879 and provided housing, education facilities and
sports fields for their staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenfeld, in a letter to Mandelson, pledged to &#8220;proceed
with sincere respect for Cadbury&#8217;s heritage and identity,&#8221;
Mandelson told lawmakers on Luff&#8217;s committee in January 2010. He
rejected calls from lawmakers in his then governing Labour Party
for new powers to stop such mergers and said he would meet with
Kraft to &#8220;hear how Kraft will fulfill the commitments they made
to Cadbury and its workforce.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cameron&#8217;s favor is the fact that AstraZeneca, while it
is Britain&#8217;s second biggest pharmaceutical company, does not
enjoy the same household status as Cadbury, maker of chocolate
Creme Eggs and Dairy Milk bars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people in the U.K., Cadbury &#8220;was an issue that
had a resonance because they&#8217;d heard of the product,&#8221; said
Fielding. &#8220;AstraZeneca is not a name people talk about down the
pub.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ted Wang, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s
co-head of equities trading for the Americas, is retiring after
18 years at the company and will become an advisory director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang also was global co-head of the One Delta trading unit,
according to an internal memo from trading co-heads Isabelle Ealet, Pablo Salame and Ashok Varadhan. Michael DuVally, a
Goldman Sachs spokesman, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the top equity-trading bank last year,
posted a 6 percent decline in first-quarter revenue for that
business from a year earlier, the biggest drop among its U.S.
peers. The firm said it had challenges in market-making in Japan
and certain emerging-markets amid falling prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ted has played an integral role in the growth of our
market-leading equities franchise and has been at the center of
many of our most significant transactions,&#8221; Ealet, Salame and
Varadhan wrote in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So-called delta-one desks provide clients with strategies
to hedge holdings or bet on directional moves in markets using
derivatives or baskets of securities, which can be cheaper to
trade than obtaining all of the stocks involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang joined Goldman Sachs in 1996 and became a partner in
2006, according to the memo. He took on his most recent role in
2012, after leading convertibles trading and the Americas One
Delta business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter D. Selman is the other co-head for the Americas
equities business, while Brian T. Levine serves as co-head of
One Delta. DuVally declined to comment on whether new co-heads
would be named. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to joining Goldman Sachs, Wang co-founded Xeotron
Corp., a company that specialized in DNA biochips, according to
a biography on the website of the Committee of 100, a
nonpartisan group of Chinese Americans seeking to encourage
positive relations between the two nations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) rejected Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s (PFE) sweetened takeover proposal, saying the 62.6 billion-pound ($105.6 billion) offer fails to appreciate the value of the promising medicines under development by the U.K.&#8217;s second-biggest drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cash-and-stock offer, which values AstraZeneca at about 50 pounds a share based on today&#8217;s closing price for Pfizer, also still relies too heavily on equity, London-based AstraZeneca said in a statement. AstraZeneca earlier rejected a proposal of 46.61 pounds a share, announced April 28. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer&#8217;s proposal would dramatically dilute AstraZeneca shareholders&#8217; exposure to our unique pipeline and would create risks around its delivery,&#8221; AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson said in the statement today. &#8220;As such, the board has no hesitation in rejecting the proposal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;
Pfizer-AstraZeneca Deal Threatens Spending on New Drugs
U.K. Signals It Won&#8217;t Block Pfizer&#8217;s Bid for AstraZeneca
Pfizer Planning to Raise AstraZeneca Bid Above $106 Billion
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca may not get much help from the government of U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron in fending off Pfizer. The government today signaled it wouldn&#8217;t interfere, rebuffing calls from members of other political parties to step in to protect jobs in the country&#8217;s science base. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca declined less than 1 percent to 48.08 pounds in London. Pfizer fell 1.3 percent to $30.75 in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;CEO Meetings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer raised its bid after Chief Executive Officer Ian Read met with AstraZeneca shareholders and government officials in the U.K. In a letter to Cameron, New York-based Pfizer pledged to follow through on AstraZeneca&#8217;s plan to build a substantial campus in Cambridge, England, and to keep key scientific management at the site. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is ultimately a decision for AstraZeneca shareholders,&#8221; said Universities and Science Minister David Willetts in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.K. government has been in talks with Pfizer about preserving jobs, particularly in research and manufacturing, in the country, Willetts said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think those messages are getting home to Pfizer, but there&#8217;s a lot more hard-headed negotiation to come,&#8221; Willetts said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cameron spoke with Johansson today about the deal, said Jean-Christophe Gray, Cameron&#8217;s spokesman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;AstraZeneca has a fantastic role in the British economy,&#8221; Cameron told reporters today in Newcastle-Under-Lyme, England. &#8220;Action on any merger is a decision for both companies. We&#8217;ve sought and received robust assurances from Pfizer should the deal go ahead.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tax Rate &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buying AstraZeneca would give Pfizer a lower tax rate because the combined company would be a corporate resident of England. The company, which would maintain its head office in New York, also would gain a portfolio of experimental cancer drugs from the purchase. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca in its April 28 statement rejecting the initial offer said Pfizer&#8217;s decision to move its tax domicile to the U.K. may be problematic. The U.K. company highlighted that issue again in today&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s earlier offer, made in January, valued AstraZeneca at 58.8 billion pounds. The acquisition would be the largest ever of a U.K. company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and would create the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The consistent message from leading shareholders reinforces our belief that there is a highly compelling strategic, business and financial rationale for combining our businesses, with significant benefits for all our stakeholders,&#8221; Read said in a letter to Johansson. &#8220;We believe our revised terms will be viewed by the market as a basis for engagement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cash Mix &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stockholders would get 15.98 pounds in cash and 1.845 shares of the combined company for each share in AstraZeneca, Pfizer said. The new bid was 7.3 percent above the previous proposal and 39 percent above the closing price Jan. 3, before AstraZeneca made its initial offer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new proposal consists of about 32 percent cash and 68 percent stock, versus about 30 percent cash and 70 percent stock in the original offer. AstraZeneca said April 28 the initial bid &#8220;very significantly undervalued&#8221; the company, and said it was concerned that too much of the payment was in stock rather than cash. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Limited Commitment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer, in the letter to Cameron, pledged to keep at least 20 percent of the combined company&#8217;s research and development workforce in the U.K., retain &#8220;substantial&#8221; manufacturing facilities at AstraZeneca&#8217;s site in Macclesfield, England, and invite at least two AstraZeneca directors to join Pfizer&#8217;s board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. company is committing to the steps for at least five years, though it could &#8220;adjust these obligations should circumstances significantly change,&#8221; according to the Pfizer statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca employs almost 2,000 people in Macclesfield, and the company is in the process of moving its corporate headquarters from London to Cambridge. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll" date="May 02, 2014  4:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-02/chevron-first-quarter-profit-declines-on-bad-weather.html"><headline>Chevron&#8217;s Goal of Record Output Slips as Production Drops</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Watson&#8217;s goal of breaking a production
record three years from now just got harder to reach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending more than $100 million a day on average
during the first three months of the year on new oil wells and
other projects, Chevron posted its lowest first-quarter crude
and natural gas output since 2006 today. The company pumped the
equivalent of 2.59 million barrels a day during the period, 1
percent below the average estimate of three analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output disappointment comes less than two months after
Watson scaled back his 2017 output target to 3.1 million barrels
a day from 3.3 million amid low gas prices that stalled some
drilling and scant new discoveries. For Chevron, the world&#8217;s
third-largest energy company by market value, production in the
era after its 2001 takeover of Texaco Inc. peaked at 2.78
million a day in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are having to battle quite hard to get bottom-line
production growing,&#8221; Stephen Clark, who helps manage $305
billion, including Chevron shares, at Standard Life Investments
in Boston, said in a telephone interview today. &#8220;The sheer size
of some of the projects is an issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson cited winter weather in Kazakhstan, the source of
one in every eight barrels Chevron pumps worldwide, and a storm
in Thailand for the production decline. &#8220;We continue to advance
our key development projects&#8221; that will begin boosting output
next year, he said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Still Viable &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chevron-operated $10 billion Angola LNG complex in
Africa that chills gas for shipment to overseas markets has been
shut since a pipe failure in mid-April, Chief Financial Officer
Pat Yarrington said during a conference call today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An internal investigation into the incident should be
concluded in a matter of days, she said. Yarrington didn&#8217;t
provide an expected restart date, though she said the outage
will have a negative impact on Chevron&#8217;s overall production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson&#8217;s 2017 goal &#8220;still seems viable because they have a
lot of big projects coming on,&#8221; said Stewart Glickman, an
equity analyst at SP Capital IQ in New York who rates Chevron a
buy and doesn&#8217;t own any shares. New contributions to output will
include fields beneath the Gulf of Mexico and off the Australian
coast, he said in an interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income was $4.51 billion, or $2.36 a
share, compared with $6.18 billion, or $3.18, a year earlier,
San Ramon, California-based Chevron said in the statement. Sales
fell 6.1 percent to $50.98 billion. The company increased
capital spending 5.6 percent to $9.4 billion during the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russia Pipeline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is among international energy explorers caught in
the middle of an intensifying row between the U.S. and its
European allies on one side, and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the other. Putin put foreign oil companies on the spot
on April 29 when he said they may be shut out of his country if
their governments continue to ratchet up sanctions against
Russian nationals and institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron and its partners are in the midst of a $5.4 billion
expansion of a pipeline that carries oil across Russia&#8217;s
Caucasus region from fields in neighboring Kazakhstan that
account for 12 percent of the company&#8217;s global supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spending, Selling &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson is spending almost $40 billion this year to drill
for new discoveries and transport oil, gas and fuels such as
diesel to markets. In tandem with exploration forays that span
the globe from Argentina to China, Watson is overseeing $10
billion in asset sales to narrow the company&#8217;s focus on its
highest-profit projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude futures, the benchmark for more than half the
world&#8217;s oil, declined by 4.2 percent to an average of $107.92 a
barrel during the quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. U.S. gas prices climbed 35 percent to average $4.712
per million British thermal units during that period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron dropped 0.2 percent to $124.72 at the close in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. is the world&#8217;s largest energy company by
market value, followed by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) Plc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., which agreed to buy JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s physical commodity unit for $3.5 billion in March, is offering jobs to about 200 people, or half the unit&#8217;s staff, according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mercuria, whose main trading floor is in Geneva, began making offers to traders and executives in the JPMorgan commodities unit late last week, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the process is private. Those who aren&#8217;t offered jobs will either stay with JPMorgan or be fired, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investment banks including JPMorgan, Barclays Plc (BARC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are withdrawing from or scaling back physical commodity operations as revenue falls and regulators place increased scrutiny on lenders owning and storing raw materials. Trading houses such as Mercuria, which has in less than a decade grown to become the world&#8217;s fourth-largest independent commodity trader with 2013 revenue of $112 billion, are filling the void. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Patrick Burton declined to comment as did Mercuria spokesman Benoit Lioud. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mercuria is most interested in JPMorgan&#8217;s physical gas and power traders in Europe and the U.S. as well as gas and crude trading operations in Canada, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blythe Masters, the head of the bank&#8217;s global commodities operations, will leave once the sale is completed, JPMorgan has said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Henry Bath &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mercuria hasn&#8217;t decided how many of the more than 100 employees at JPMorgan&#8217;s Henry Bath  Sons Ltd. metals warehousing unit will be asked to join the new company, the person said. The 220-year-old Liverpool-based firm handles and stores aluminum, copper and other metals and was a founding member of the London Metal Exchange. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From 2011 to 2013, Mercuria hired 570 people, including executives from banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays. That boosted staff to 1,200 from about 10 in 2004. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan unit will give Mercuria gas and power trading operations on both sides of the Atlantic, physical assets spanning 40 locations in North America, an oil-trading book with a supply and off-take contract at the largest refinery on the U.S. East Coast, and 6 million barrels of storage leases in the Canadian oil sands. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;European Gas &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mercuria&#8217;s head of compliance Victoria Attwood Scott said last month that the trading house is in discussions with Britain&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority to determine whether the purchase of JPMorgan&#8217;s European gas and power business means Mercuria should be subject to regulatory oversight. Unlike banks, the FCA does not have regulatory authority over trading houses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revenue for the 10 largest investment-bank commodity operations slumped to $4.5 billion last year from about $14 billion in 2008, according to the London-based analytics company Coalition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barclays said last week that it&#8217;s exiting most commodities markets apart from precious metals, oil and gas derivatives and index products. Barclays cut jobs in January in fixed income, currencies and commodities and shut power-trading desks in the U.S. and Europe in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, Germany&#8217;s largest bank, said in December it would get out of dedicated energy, agriculture, dry-bulk and industrial-metals trading, cutting about 200 jobs. Bank of America Corp. said in January it would dispose of its European power and gas inventory as increasing regulation curbs trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley agreed to sell its oil-merchant business to OAO Rosneft (ROSN), Russia&#8217;s state-run producer, in December. The sale hasn&#8217;t been submitted for regulatory approval and the companies will probably wait until tensions cool after the U.S. sanctioned Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin, a person with knowledge of the situation said on April 29. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Thomas Penny and Robert Hutton" date="May 02, 2014  9:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-02/u-k-lawmakers-oppose-astrazeneca-deal-as-pfizer-writes-cameron.html"><headline>U.K. Signals It Won&#8217;t Block Pfizer&#8217;s Bid for AstraZeneca</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s
government signaled it won&#8217;t stand in the way of Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s
takeover bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), rebuffing cross-party calls to
intervene to safeguard jobs and the country&#8217;s science base. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron, who received a letter from Pfizer and spoke with
AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson today, &#8220;is clear that the
U.K. government regards the potential takeover bid as a matter
for the respective boards and shareholders of the two
companies,&#8221; the prime minister&#8217;s office said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government &#8220;is determined&#8217; to secure jobs in life
sciences and the letter &#8216;&#8216;is a positive sign with significant
undertakings on research, jobs and investment,&#8217;&#8217; Cameron&#8217;s
office said. The government will now weigh the proposals to see
&#8216;&#8216;whether they offer sufficient protection of our priorities,&#8217;&#8217;
it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments suggest that Pfizer Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read has given the government enough confidence to face down
mounting political opposition to the deal among members of
Cameron&#8217;s Conservative Party and opposition Labour lawmakers.
AstraZeneca rejected New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s increased offer as
inadequate today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Getting Home&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;We&#8217;ve had very tough-minded conversations with Pfizer,&#8221;
Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve emphasized the importance of RD,
the importance of manufacturing, the importance of having high-level management in the U.K. if this deal goes ahead. I think
those messages are getting home to Pfizer, but there&#8217;s a lot
more hard-headed negotiation to come.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its letter to Cameron, Pfizer pledged to set up its
headquarters in the U.K., complete a planned AstraZeneca science
hub in Cambridge, eastern England, and protect jobs in Britain.
Pfizer also sweetened its bid for London-based AstraZeneca to
about 63.1 billion pounds ($106.6 billion), an offer the company
said failed to recognize the value of the promising experimental
medicines under development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuka Umunna, Labour&#8217;s business spokesman, accused the
government of being &#8220;in league&#8221; with Pfizer and said that for
all the reassurances offered there is &#8220;grave concern&#8221; the deal
was driven by tax planning and would risk U.K. jobs and
&#8220;intellectual asset stripping.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;The Beast&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The head of the beast, the central management of the new
merged entity, will be in the U.S. They&#8217;re simply seeking to be
domiciled here for tax purposes,&#8221; he told BBC Radio 4. &#8220;Do we
really want of a jewel in the crown of British industry, our
second biggest pharmaceutical firm, to basically be seen as an
instrument of tax planning.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at the Department for Business are examining how
binding any commitments from Pfizer would actually be, according
to a person familiar with internal discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable, a member of Cameron&#8217;s
Liberal Democratic junior coalition partner, told the BBC the
letter from Pfizer was &#8220;encouraging, positive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics of Pfizer&#8217;s bid for AstraZeneca cite Kraft Foods
Inc.&#8217;s takeover of Britain&#8217;s Cadbury Plc (CADBURY) in 2010. Cadbury agreed
to be sold to Kraft for 11.7 billion pounds, creating the
world&#8217;s largest confectionery company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reputation Damaged &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the deal, Kraft, based in Northfield, Illinois, said
it would keep open a factory in Keynsham, southwest England.
After the takeover was completed, Kraft announced it had decided
to close the plant by 2011. A panel of lawmakers said Kraft
damaged its reputation with its handling of the takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s a real issue,&#8221; Willetts said, when asked how
binding Pfizer commitments are. &#8220;After the way in which Labour
mishandled Kraft&#8217;s takeover of Cadbury, we&#8217;re very much aware of
it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s takeover bid has become a political football as
the parties highlight their differences less than a month before
local elections and elections to the European Parliament. Both
will be held on May 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior lawmakers from both the Conservatives and Labour
weighed in against the deal today. Michael Heseltine, an adviser
to Cameron on efforts to spur economic growth and a minister in
Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s administration, said the government should
have powers to intervene against such a bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are so many issues about the science base, about
the supply chains, about employment prospects that ought to be
explored and I don&#8217;t see any way in which this can be adequately
done unless the government has reserve powers,&#8221; Heseltine told
the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Sainsbury, a Labour Party lawmaker in the House of
Lords who was science minister under Tony Blair, called on
Cameron to block the deal, telling the Financial Times that any
promises from the company were &#8220;frankly meaningless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months after Partners Group
Holding AG bought a majority stake in a Mexican gas pipeline
operator, the $43 billion investment firm is capitalizing on
unprecedented demand for the nation&#8217;s corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fermaca Enterprises, owned by the Zug, Switzerland-based
firm that specializes in private equity, sold $550 million of
bonds overseas yesterday. The sale was the seventh first-time
offering since August, when President Enrique Pena Nieto
proposed changes to the state oil industry that were signed into
law four months later. In the same span, only one debut issuer
came from Brazil, the biggest developing-nation bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partners Group, founded by three former Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. money managers in 1996, is seeking to profit from Mexico&#8217;s
energy industry after the government ended its 76-year-old oil
monopoly and from a boom in shale gas, according to the firm&#8217;s
managing director, Jean Perarnaud. Fermaca, purchased from New
York-based hedge fund Ospraie Management LLC for $750 million in
February, has a 25-year transportation agreement with state-owned utility Comision Federal de Electricidad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The momentum is there for Mexico, fundamentally and
sentiment-wise,&#8221; Perarnaud said by phone. &#8220;The timing is
right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Refinance Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fermaca, based in Mexico City, sold the bonds due 2038 to
yield 6.375 percent. The senior secured amortizing notes, which
will have an average maturity of 15 years, are backed by Fermaca
assets including pipelines. Fitch Ratings and Standard  Poor&#8217;s
rate the bonds BBB-, the lowest investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s peso weakened 0.1 percent to 13.0537 per U.S.
dollar at 7:02 a.m. in New York, paring its advance this week to
0.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partners Group, started by Alfred Gantner, Marcel Erni and
Urs Wietlisbach, will use proceeds of the sale to refinance both
the debt that it took on to buy Fermaca and a loan the company
used to finance construction of a pipeline, according to
Perarnaud. It bought the 86 percent stake in Fermaca from
Ospraie Management in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with CFE will last throughout the life of the
bonds, giving investors comfort that they will get paid, said
Ray Zucaro, who manages $390 million at SW Asset Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That kind of long-term contract with government agencies
beyond the life of the bond where effectively you neutralize
that counterparty risk -- those are the kind of bonds that will
let you sleep at night,&#8221; he said in a telephone interview from
Newport Beach, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CFE Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CFE, as the company is known, plans to take advantage of
legal changes to the energy industry to sell natural gas, Chief
Executive Officer Enrique Ochoa said March 20. After allowing
foreign investors to drill for oil for the first time since
1938, Mexico is looking to increase natural-gas supply, reduce
its dependence on U.S. imports and lower the cost of electricity
generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That push will increase demand for Fermaca&#8217;s gas pipelines,
said Partners Group&#8217;s Perarnaud. The company is also bidding on
multiple pipeline contracts being auctioned by CFE, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We found Fermaca was the perfect asset,&#8221; Perarnaud said.
&#8220;It would be an upside if the oil and gas exploration happen in
Mexico because our pipelines are actually located in one of the
prospective areas for shale gas in Mexico. When you combine
everything together, you end up with a good story.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Fermaca is taking advantage of the investor demand
for Mexican assets after the country passed constitutional
changes in December, the company is not dependent on those
measures to prosper in Mexico, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Secondary Laws &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After pushing through sweeping changes in his first year in
office that earned Mexico its highest-ever credit rating, Pena
Nieto has struggled to overcome opposition to pass the secondary
laws needed to implement the new oil legislation, damping demand
for Mexican assets. He submitted his proposals on April 30, the
last day of the congressional session. Lawmakers plan to vote on
the bills during special sessions in June after Congress missed
a mid-April deadline to pass the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delays helped spark a 0.14 percent loss in Mexican
government debt in April, trailing the emerging-market average
for the first time since January, according to Bank of America
Corp. indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Right Place&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fermaca is also the first debut issuer from Mexico since
Oceanografia SA de CV defaulted on $495 million in February,
when the government seized the oil services provider following
allegations it took out a $400 million loan from Citigroup Inc.
under fraudulent circumstances. Citigroup determined that
Oceanografia, which provides oil services to state-run producer
Petroleos Mexicanos, overstated the collateral from its billings
to the company that were used to back the loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Oceanografia&#8217;s agreement with Pemex, Fermaca&#8217;s
contract with CFE doesn&#8217;t involve a third party and is
transparent, Perarnaud said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fermaca&#8217;s &#8220;in the right place at the right time,&#8221;Rafael Elias, a New York-based analyst at Credit Agricole SA, said in
an April 22 note to clients. &#8220;These bonds should do well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will start giving
users more information about government requests for data,
seeking to provide greater transparency and reassure consumers
about how their activities are being monitored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft is updating its policy to expand routine
notification of users about government requests for data, unless
specifically prohibited by law,&#8221; Kathy Roeder, a spokeswoman
for the Redmond, Washington-based company, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies are changing their policies to offer
more disclosure amid growing government demands for information
about what people do online. Concerns over security increased
after Edward Snowden last year leaked information that Internet
companies are being compelled under court orders to give the
U.S. National Security Agency information about citizens and
other users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. hasn&#8217;t changed its policy and is reviewing
the matter, according to Jodi Seth, a Facebook spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are committed to transparency, and providing notice
about government requests is an important part of being
transparent,&#8221; Seth wrote in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We are
always working to improve our notification process as the law
permits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg earlier
this year blasted President Barack Obama over how the government
handles user data, saying it threatened the future of the
Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said it makes efforts to tell users about on legal
requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;User Notification &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We notify users about legal demands when appropriate,
unless prohibited by law or court order,&#8221; the company said in
an statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, Google, Apple Inc. and other technology
companies won U.S. permission to disclose more about government
orders for customer data. Companies are permitted to say broadly
how many accounts are covered by government requests and whether
the content of users&#8217; communications was sought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post reported May 1 that the companies
&#8220;updating their policies to expand routine notification of
users about government data seizures.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Apple, didn&#8217;t respond to
a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
said Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) raised questions of
&#8220;overriding national interest,&#8221; as the opposition Labour Party
stepped up its rejection of the proposed takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour leader Ed Miliband accused Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday of promoting Pfizer&#8217;s bid for London-based
AstraZeneca. Cable later told reporters that reviewing rules on
intervening in takeovers on public interest grounds was an
option that the government was looking at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliament&#8217;s Business, Innovation and Skills Committee will
meet tomorrow to discuss whether to summon Pfizer executives.
Chairman Adrian Bailey, a member of Miliband&#8217;s Labour Party,
told reporters on April 29 that it was likely they would do so,
as the bid needed to be &#8220;scrutinized very carefully.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political attitudes to the bid are hardening less than
three weeks before local and European elections even after
AstraZeneca&#8217;s board rejected Pfizer&#8217;s 63.1 billion-pound ($106.5
billion) sweetened offer on May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The British competition merger regime is non-political in
the way it is applied, I think that&#8217;s valued in that Britain is
open in that respect,&#8221; said Cable, a member of Cameron&#8217;s
Liberal Democratic junior coalition partner. &#8220;But there is an
important national interest here that we have got to safeguard
the protection of jobs and investment and particularly high
technology research in pharmaceuticals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
